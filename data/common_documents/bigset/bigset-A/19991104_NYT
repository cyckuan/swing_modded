MIGHTY SUBURBAN PARTY MACHINE FALLS IN NASSAU COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It played a crucial role in choosing a president, sent one of
its own to the U.S. Senate, and wielded great power in Albany for
decades. But the hallmark of the Nassau County Republican Party,
perhaps the last great party machine left in the country, has been
its centurylong vise grip on local government.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday night. The election that gave Democrats control of
the County Legislature for the first time ever does not mean the
end of Republican power in a county where Republican voters remain
a sizable majority. But it marks the most serious breakdown in the
history of a party machine that seemed to have perfected the
technique of holding power through a seamless blend of efficient
political operations, lavish government services and ample
patronage.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau machine was always a paradox. It transplanted the
political model of big-city Democrats to the Republican suburbs of
Long Island, with party bosses choosing candidates for office.
Nowhere else was there a suburban party of such power and
discipline. Like the Democratic machines it emulated, it promised
good services, but at high costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau Republicans' political operation was so efficient
that the party owned its own printing plant for candidates'
mailings. They effortlessly turned out thousands of people on short
notice to cheer for presidential candidates at the Nassau Coliseum
or the Hofstra University Field House. They endured chronic
infighting, even a scandal that, in the early 1980s, sent a county
chairman to prison, yet their hold on city, town and county offices
was all but unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there were the great parks, the great schools,
people didn't think any of that other stuff affected them,'' said
Alan F. Eysen, a Nassau political consultant who has worked for
candidates in both parties and a former political editor at
Newsday, Long Island's daily newspaper. ``The Democrats, again and
again, tried to run on a bossism kind of issue, and it didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the tide turned, it was mostly about voters concluding
that they were not getting what they paid for. The scales tipped
this year, as the county's credit rating was downgraded, and the
Republicans, trying to close a large budget deficit, enacted a real
estate transfer tax and then raised property taxes.

 EDITORIAL: WISE ADVICE ON BELL ATLANTIC  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice exercised good judgment and political
courage this week when it formally advised the Federal
Communications Commission to reject Bell Atlantic's bid to enter
long-distance phone service in New York state. The rejection
surprised many participants in this application because it came
only days after the New York Public Service Commission gave Bell
Atlantic's application its blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Justice did not quarrel with the evidence
presented on Bell Atlantic's behalf by the state commission.
Instead it used the state's data to draw an opposite conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Bell Atlantic can apply
to enter long-distance service. But first it must open its local
network to competitors, like AT&AMP;T and MCI, that want to offer local
service to customers now served by Bell Atlantic. The act requires
Bell Atlantic to rent such competitors the wires running into every
home and business, as well as switches and other equipment, on
commercially fair terms.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the state commission and Bell Atlantic have
made tremendous progress. But Justice points out that the company
continues to fall short on three standards. It makes repeated
mistakes switching customer wires from its network to that of
competitors. It also makes repeated errors in processing orders by
competitors to rent its entire network rather than just its wires.
And it often fails to provide competitors the equipment they need
to provide high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The state commission approved Bell Atlantic's application
anyway, based on the company's promises to improve, backed by state
penalties if it did not. But Justice cited rules that say entry
into long distance must be based on actual behavior, not promises.
In recognition of the substantial progress that Bell Atlantic has
made, Justice suggested that the FCC might, after initially
rejecting the application, grant Bell Atlantic expedited future
review focused solely on the three standards it still fails. That
review needs to insist, Justice said, that before the Bell
companies get entry into long distance they ``cross the finish
line, not merely come within sight of it.''

ROBERT VAN KAMPEN, INVESTOR AND BIBLE COLLECTOR, DIES AT 60 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert D. Van Kampen, a millionaire investor who built one of
the world's largest private collections of biblical manuscripts and
early printed Bibles, died on Friday at Loyola University Medical
Center outside of Chicago while awaiting a heart transplant. He was
60.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen, who lived in Grand Haven, Mich., suffered from a
viral condition that resulted in the deterioration of his heart,
said David Allen, a longtime friend and business associate.
</P>
<P>
   After 1984, when he could count his fortune in the tens if not
hundreds of millions, Van Kampen devoted himself to writing books
about Christian eschatology, a branch of theology dealing with the
study of the end of the world, and to his collection of biblical
materials. His first book was ``The Sign'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   His collection of nearly 5,000 items, ranging from clay tablets
to a legendary blood-stained Bible, are housed in the Scriptorium,
a nonsectarian research center, library and museum in Grand Haven
open to the public by appointment. The Scriptorium was founded by
Van Kampen in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the country's outstanding collection of manuscript and
early printed Bibles,'' said Paul Saenger, the curator of rare
books at the Newberry Library in Chicago who has worked at the
Scriptorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Christian fundamentalist Van Kampen believed literally in
the Bible, and saw that if you got all of the different versions
together, it would help scholars to recover the uncorrupted text,''
said Saenger. ``Scholars like myself may not share those beliefs,
but we can benefit from the zeal of collectors like Van Kampen.''
</P>
<P>
   Saenger said that the British Library in London would soon
publish an article of his about the practice of verse numbering in
early Bibles that could not have been written without access to the
materials gathered at the Scriptorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oxford Dictionary of the Bible says that this graphic
device started in the 16th century,'' Saenger said, ``but working
at the Scriptorium a few years ago I found that's wrong. They were
doing it in the Middle Ages. That's important because it helps you
understand how people used the Bible. It made the Bible far more
accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sharpe, curator emeritus of rare books at Duke University,
said of the Scriptorium: ``It is a fine collection which because of
its great resources has the potential of becoming one of the
world's best private research libraries for biblical scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastiaan Van Elderen, executive director of the Scriptorium,
said the collection had many unique pieces, among them a
16th-century Hebrew Bible that he believed was the only one in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen began collecting rare biblical and ancient
manuscripts 17 years ago when he purchased a 1537 English-language
Bible said to be stained by the blood of its martyred owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seemed to fascinate him,'' said Van Elderen. ``The stain
is only the claim, only the story that comes to us with this
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen later acquired papyrus and clay tablets, some of
which date from 2,000 B.C.; a Coptic translation from the fourth
century A.D. of a portion of the Old Testament from Egypt, the Book
of Daniel from the Gutenberg Bible of 1455, Hebrew Torah scrolls
and translations by the 14th-century reformer John Wycliffe.
</P>
<P>
   As a businessman Van Kampen made his reputation as a young bond
salesman. In 1975 he founded an investment banking firm later
called Van Kampen Merritt (now Van Kampen Funds). The firm
pioneered the packaging of municipal bonds into unit trusts sold to
individual investors with insurance against default.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he sold the company to Xerox Corp. for about $200
million. Today, Van Kampen Funds has more than $79 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Van Kampen acquired a controlling interest in Fitch
Investors Service, a diminutive version of Moody's or Standard &AMP;
Poor's, with about $2 million in gross revenues, and sold it in
1997 when it had about $80 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Dec. 16, 1938, at Evergreen Park, Ill., Van Kampen
attended schools in Wheaton, Ill., and graduated from Wheaton
College in 1960. His career in investments and finance began when
he joined the John Nuveen company in Chicago after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen also was a partner in VMS Realty from 1980 to 1992
and established Van Kampen Asset Management Co. with offices in
Grand Haven and Wheaton.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to southwest Michigan in 1993, building a $3.3 million
mansion there, and founded two churches in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kampen is survived by his wife, Judith; three daughters,
Kimberly Van Kampen of Chicago, Kristen Wisen of Grand Haven and
Karla Van Kampen Pierre of Grand Haven, and 11 grandchildren.

CONGRESSIONAL REPORT FAULTS DEFENSE DEPARTMENT SECURITY CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Defense failed to complete
security clearance checks on 92 percent of its employees and
contractors who have access to classified information, according to
a congressional report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said lapses in the screening of
Defense personnel risk national security and make the department
vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton, a Lexington, Mo., Democrat and chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, requested the review last year
after a Pentagon lawyer was convicted of espionage for trying to
sell classified material to foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   The department is supposed to probe nine areas of a person's
background before giving him or her a security clearance, but it
failed to check at least one area in 92 percent of the cases and
overlooked two areas 77 percent of the time, a GAO sampling of 530
civilian and uniformed personnel found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 600,000 employees holding clearances are
overdue for periodic re-investigations of their backgrounds, the
report said. Overall, clearances take an average of 204 days, more
than double the department's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught by surprise,'' Skelton said of the GAO review.
``Several astounding findings are included in the report....''
</P>
<P>
   A defense official said the department is moving promptly to
make sure background checks are more thorough and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the security of the United States of America,''
said Lt. Gen. Charles Cunningham, acting director of the
department's Defense Security Service, which is charged with doing
the checks. ``It's incredibly important.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said the department will spend $30 million to $40
million to upgrade training programs for people who do security
checks. Up to $100 million more will be spent to hire private
contractors to help the department catch up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report makes it clear we were indeed suffering a
bottleneck in our system,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   GAO auditors cited numerous reasons for the lapses, including
poor training, relaxation of some standards, confusion about the
standards and failure to effectively use automated means for doing
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton partly blamed the problem on cutbacks and downsizing at
the Defense Security Service, a branch of the Pentagon. Auditors
said the service has operated for four years with little or no
oversight by the appropriate assistant secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton said nothing is more important than sound security
clearances, especially because 68 Department of Defense employees
have been charged with espionage since 1982. The GAO did not
explore whether those persons had insufficient background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there is no guarantee that individuals fully
investigated will not engage in espionage, these investigations are
a critical first step in ensuring that those granted access to
classified information can be trusted to safeguard it,'' wrote
Carol R. Schuster, associate GAO director for national security
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Espionage convictions in the department are small compared with
the number of employees, but hundreds of other cases have ended in
settlements, suicides or defections, Schuster said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense employees who have access to secret information are
subject to being checked on residency, nationality, education,
prior seven years of employment, character references, credit
background and criminal history. In addition, the subject and his
neighbors are to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found that the areas most likely to overlooked were a
person's residence, birth and citizenship if foreign-born,
employment history and character references. The personal interview
and financial status were overlooked least often.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 2.4 million active duty civilian, military and
contract employees in the Department of Defense who have security
clearances, including 524,000 who have top secret security
clearance _ the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   The 530 persons checked randomly by the auditors early this year
have top secret clearance. Of the total checked, 226 were persons
given initial clearance and 304 were persons due for
re-investigation of their backgrounds. That is to be done every
five to 15 years.

REPUBLICANS PROPOSE CHANGES TO SPEED UP NEW YORK STATE BUDGETS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Taking on one of the most contentious issues in
state government, Gov. George Pataki and his Republicans allies in
the Legislature Wednesday proposed extensive changes in state law
intended to speed up New York's notoriously tardy budget-making
process.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would, among other things, require that the
previous year's budget remain in place for a second year if the
Legislature could not adopt a new one on time, preventing lawmakers
from making any changes in spending for a host of programs dear to
their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drafted by the state Senate's Republican majority with
strong support from the governor, is the latest in a series of
proposals in recent years to remedy Albany's chronic failure to
enact a budget by the April 1 deadline. The Legislature has passed
the budget late for 15 consecutive years, often missing the
deadline by weeks and even months.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader and Pataki's chief ally
in the Legislature, urged Democrats to pass the measure, saying it
would help restore public confidence in state government. ``The
public and their state representatives have grown increasingly
frustrated by a budget process that has failed year after year,''
he said. ``The budget reform plan proposed by the Senate majority
solves the main problems that have caused us to repeatedly miss the
April 1 budget deadline and would enable us to have a budget in
place on time every year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan received a cool reception from Democratic leaders
in the Assembly, who immediately released a similar plan that seeks
to encourage on-time budgets. The Assembly plan had a number of
proposals that Democrats have made in the past, including moving
the budget deadline from April 1 to July 1 to give lawmakers more
time to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, a Democrat who is Pataki's chief nemesis in the budget
negotiations, said the plan released by the Senate was ``worth
looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that the Senate failed to include a provision that
Democrats deemed important: a requirement that the governor give
his approval to a budget before the Legislature adopts it.
Democrats say this is necessary to prevent the governor from
vetoing programs that are important to them once the budget is sent
to him for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan would require an amendment to the state
constitution. To amend it, two consecutive Legislatures must pass a
resolution calling for a statewide referendum on the issue. If the
proposal is approved by the current Legislature and then again by
the Legislature elected next year, the issue will go to voters for
approval in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan calls for several other important changes,
including a provision that requires the governor and legislative
leaders to reach agreement on how much money is available to spend
by March 5. In the past, budget negotiations have been delayed as
state leaders argued over available revenues. But under the Senate
plan, the state comptroller would determine that figure if state
leaders failed to reach a revenue agreement by the March 5
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal also moves the budget deadline to May 1 to
give lawmakers more time to hammer out a spending plan. The plan
calls for both houses to pass their own budgets by March 15 and
then iron out the differences in a conference committee. If a final
budget cannot be enacted on time, a new budget would take effect
that holds spending to the previous year's levels.

SPRINT AND MCI WORLDCOM OFFICIALS TO PITCH MERGER DEAL ON CAPITOL
HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The largest proposed corporate takeover in history
will get its first going-over on Capitol Hill Thursday, when top
officials from Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. make their case
before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which has jurisdiction over antitrust issues,
will also hear from a leading consumer advocacy group, which
opposes the merger, and some financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican and member
of the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday night that after meeting
earlier in the evening with MCI WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J.
Ebbers, he was inclined to support the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will be the opening round of what is expected to be
a lengthy and detailed investigation by the political and
regulatory arms of government into the $129 billion sale of
Westwood-based Sprint, the third-largest long-distance carrier, to
MCI WorldCom, the second-largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any large merger proposal will certainly draw the attention of
the Senate,'' said Charles Boesel, spokesman for Sen. Mike DeWine,
an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee's
antitrust subcommittee. ``They not only have to come to the hill,
they have to go to the regulatory agencies as well. You're talking
about a very large undertaking where you have the second- and
third-largest long-distance carriers wanting to combine.''
</P>
<P>
   The consolidated company would capture about 32 percent of the
estimated $90 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Congress, the proposed merger will be scrutinized by the
Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, whose
chairman, William Kennard, has questioned whether the deal is in
the ``public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will hear from Ebbers and Sprint Chairman William
T. Esrey.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint spokesman James W. Fisher said Esrey and Ebbers would try
to make the case that the telecommunications landscape has changed
considerably in recent years. As more and more companies merge and
thereby expand, the choices available to consumers also expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the playing field has gone to a higher level,
where you have big companies with a lot of power providing the
whole range of products _ wireless, international, local,
high-speed data, long-distance,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups, however, argue that the mammoth
corporation that would emerge from a Sprint-MCI WorldCom marriage
would hurt consumers because it would undermine competition.
Consumers Union, whose co-director, Gene Kimmelman, will also
testify, contends the merger would choke competition and result in
fewer choices for consumers. The benefits will go to the big
customers who require the largest amount of services, the group
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he entered his Wednesday meeting with Ebbers
concerned about the effect of a merger on the Kansas City area job
market and the future of Sprint's new Overland Park campus, but
left feeling the deal was a ``win-win situation'' for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ebbers told him he expected the work force of a combined
Sprint-MCI WorldCom to increase by about 6,000 to 7,000 over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a decline in Kansas City, it would be
short-lived,'' Ashcroft said Ebbers told him.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Ebbers called the Overland Park campus a
``magnificent facility'' that would be fully utilized by the
proposed new company. Ashcroft said he hadn't discussed the merger
with Esrey but expected to do so.

PANEL INVESTIGATING WHETHER PHILIP MORRIS ILLEGALLY PAID FOR PATAKI
TRIPS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York State Ethics Commission has opened an investigation
into whether two trips by Gov. George Pataki to Hungary were
illegally financed by companies with extensive interests before the
governor, including Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is examining donations that Philip Morris, the
tobacco giant, and other companies gave to the nonprofit sponsor of
the trips, the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce U.S.A.,
officials involved in the inquiry said. The investigators are
trying to determine whether the donations were actually gifts for
the governor that were funneled through a third party.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is seeking explanations about the donations from
the chamber and Philip Morris and is asking them to submit other
information related to the trips, the officials said. Philip Morris
joined the chamber a week before the first trip in September 1995,
giving $10,000. It then gave $10,000 a few weeks before the second
trip in October 1996, and another $10,000 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that its donations were not made to pay for
the trips, but has declined to specify its reasons for joining the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel acted in response to articles in The New York
Times in September and October about the financing of the trips,
which were a combination of family vacation and trade mission in
the homeland of Pataki's paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has ridiculed the articles, saying that he and his aides
knew nothing about the chamber's backers and that the ethics rules
were strictly followed. He has declined to disclose the cost of the
trips and the amount the chamber paid.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the governor, Michael McKeon, did not respond
Wednesday to a request for comment about the ethics inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel discussed the inquiry at its regular meeting
last week in New York City. Briefing panel members, the
commission's staff distributed copies of newspaper articles about
the donations and described efforts to get information from the
chamber and Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics officials do not customarily discuss their inquiries,
but one member of the panel, Lynn Millane, said that the trips were
under scrutiny. ``The staff is handling the investigation,'' said
Ms. Millane, who was named to the panel by the governor. ``They
said, `We're looking into this, and we'll let you know when we get
more information.'''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with a separate agency, the Temporary State
Commission on Lobbying, plan to recommend civil penalties in a
separate investigation of Philip Morris' lobbying of the New York
Legislature, where the company has been a formidable force,
repeatedly succeeding in having proposed smoking regulations
killed. Lobby officials say the investigators have concluded the
company failed to disclose all its spending on gifts for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   K. Richmond Temple, a spokesman for Philip Morris, which is
based in Manhattan, declined to comment on either investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Under state ethics rules, the governor and his aides are
prohibited from accepting gifts of $75 or more from companies with
business before the state, directly or through third parties. If it
can be determined that the donations were solicited by
administration officials to pay for the trips, that could be a
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other corporations with business in Albany, Pepsico and
Pfizer, gave $5,000 each to the chamber just before the first trip,
and executives at both said last month that the money was intended
to pay for the trip. A spokesman for Pfizer said the administration
did not play a role in soliciting the money.
</P>
<P>
   The $20,000 from Philip Morris, Pepsico and Pfizer just before
the 1995 trip represented 52 percent of the $38,287 in revenues
that the chamber of commerce reported on its tax returns for its
fiscal year. A fourth corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, has said
it contributed to the chamber and was involved in the 1996 trip,
but has said it is unable to ascertain how much it donated.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb said they had not
been contacted by the ethics commission. A spokesman for Pepsico
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Szarka-Elling, the president of the Hungarian-American
Chamber of Commerce U.S.A., did not respond to two phone messages
at her office and an e-mail seeking comment. She has said in the
past that she did not know why Philip Morris contributed to the
chamber.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   Pataki nominates three of the five members of the ethics
commission, including its chairman, currently Paul Shechtman, who
was formerly Pataki's criminal justice adviser. The state attorney
general nominates one member and the state comptroller nominates
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby commission's inquiry has focused in recent weeks on
whether Philip Morris's chief lobbyist in New York, Sharon T.
Portnoy, kept inaccurate internal records in an effort to avoid
disclosing her spending on meals and other gifts for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, lobbyists have to itemize their spending on
disclosure reports if the cost is $75 or more.

SPRINT TO TAKE ON BELL ATLANTIC WITH $35-A-MONTH LOCAL CALLING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sprint Corp., the nation's third-largest
long-distance telephone company, will seek to loosen Bell
Atlantic's grip on the regional telecommunications market by
offering unlimited local calls for a monthly rate of $35, officials
of the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is the only major telecommunications company to offer
unlimited local calling to just about anyone who wants it in the
New York region. MCI Worldcom, which agreed last month to acquire
Sprint in a stock swap valued at $108 billion, and Bell Atlantic
have comparable plans that are available only to certain customers
or that set a cap on the number of local calls.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sunday, Sprint will offer a $35 calling plan that
includes unlimited local calls, and a rate of 5 cents a minute for
regional, long distance and calling-card calls from 7 p.m. to 7
a.m. Bell Atlantic remains the largest local service provider,
although more than 100 telecommunications companies are certified
by the New York State Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   John Bonomo, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, declined to say
whether the company would try to match Sprint's unlimited calling
option. ``Our plan is not to lose customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some consumers said they would be interested in
Sprint's plan, others said that the $35 monthly fee was more than
their monthly bills. ``I have to say there's something appealing
about a fixed rate,'' said Evelyn Gilbert-Bair, a New York City
resident. ``It's like all-you-can-eat restaurants and
unlimited-ride Metro cards. There's that psychological freedom, but
if you look back at the end of the month, you probably would have
spent less.''

KANSAS MUST CHANGE SPENDING WAYS, BUDGET DIRECTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The days of free-spending legislators may have
come to an end, and even modest spending increases will not be easy
next year, the Kansas budget director reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State economists and budget experts met for 3 hours Wednesday to
craft their revenue projections through the next budget year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters afterward, Duane Goossen, budget director,
warned that the state would have to come up with an extra $108
million just to match the size of the current budget. That is
because the state has been spending surplus funds in recent years
and those surpluses are now depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot maintain the status quo budget,'' Goossen said. ``We
must go down.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will be even greater, he said, if lawmakers and
Gov. Bill Graves want to carry through with promises to increase
school aid by $50 per student at a cost of $30 million and add $21
million to higher-education spending.
</P>
<P>
   Also yet to be considered are pay raises for state workers,
increases in caseloads in public assistance programs and the cost
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those things are to be funded, money must be found
somewhere else,'' the budget director said.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen painted the bleak picture even though estimates are that
next year's revenue collections will be as much as 6.3 percent more
than the money flowing into the state treasury this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those revenue projections for the 2001 budget year, which begins
July 1, include $70.7 million from Kansas' share of the national
tobacco lawsuit settlement.
</P>
<P>
   After next year, those settlement payments will not be earmarked
for the general fund that is used to support basic government
operations. They will be used for children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Without the tobacco money, next year's budget would grow by only
4.6 percent over expectations for the current year. Collections for
the current budget year now are expected to be 4.7 percent more
than the 1999 budget-year collections.
</P>
<P>
   Late in September, Graves directed state agencies to trim 1
percent off their current budgets. That would cut spending by about
$43 million, still far short of minimum demands for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that lawmakers and the governor in recent years
have cut a wide variety of taxes and increased education
assistance, while dipping into existing surpluses to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 budget year, spending exceeded revenue by $217.8
million, and it is expected to outpace revenue this year by $291.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   This budget year, estimates of tax collections have been reduced
by about $110 million, including a $37.3 million reduction
Wednesday. Most of the overestimates have come in the individual
income-tax area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows Kansas has a very healthy economy, but it's
moderating from what it was in the previous years,'' Goossen said.

IN THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK'S HOME TEAMS, MANY FANS WEAR TWO HATS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Psychologists have long puzzled over what is known as
cognitive dissonance, the ability of one person to calmly hold two
seemingly paradoxical ideas, like opposing cruelty to animals but
relishing kielbasa.
</P>
<P>
   Few such psychological conflicts, however, are more curious than
this opinion-poll footnote to the Subway Series That Never Was:
asked whether they are Yankees fans or Mets fans, the largest group
of those polled, 31 percent, say they are, blithely and
simultaneously, fans of both.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? In a New York Times/CBS News statewide survey ending
Oct. 28, the day after the Yankees beat the Atlanta Braves in the
World Series, William T. Kenyon, 53, a stockbroker living in
Bayside, Queens, said he was a Yankees and Mets fan pretty much
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon said he was well aware that the Yankees had a reputation
as arrogant winners and the Mets had one as noble losers. ``But the
Yankees are professionals who go out and do their job, and that's
impressive,'' Kenyon said this week. ``And the Mets are ascending
and they're National League and I've always liked the National
League because the pitchers have to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice F. Johnson, 46, an office manager who lives in the Inwood
section of Manhattan said she rooted for both teams, especially
when they were determined to win. ``I could see not being a Mets
fan if they were scrubs,'' she said, ``but they were working hard
this year. And I like the Yankees because people like me just like
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Schubert, 48, a construction executive who lives in
the Westchester County city of New Rochelle, laughed uproariously
when asked about his home teams. ``How can I be for the Mets AND
the Yankees?'' said Schubert. ``Because I'm a fair-weather fan. I
don't really care. I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up in
northern Connecticut. If I lived in Denver, I'd root for the Denver
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Siena's dual loyalties are more complicated. She has
come to love baseball late in life, ``a few boyfriends and husbands
later, who have explained baseball to me so so many times.'' Her
boyfriend is a Mets fan who hates the Yankees as swaggering louts,
so she is a Mets fan, too. But for Ms. Siena, a Greek immigrant and
the owner of a real estate company who lives on Park Avenue, the
Yankees are America and New York rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   If there had been a Subway Series, she said, ``it would have
been so very hard for me. I would never have cheered for the
Yankees in front of my boyfriend. So let's just say I'm a secret
Yankees fan because the Yankees have history and Babe Ruth and they
are the stars of New York.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ After EgyptAir Flight 990 dove steeply in its
final minutes, approaching or even reaching the speed of sound, the
plane slowed its decline and then climbed again before plunging
once more and apparently breaking up, according to new radar data
released here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board said that
they would wait until they had the flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder in hand before concluding that the plane broke up,
but John Clark, the deputy directory of the board's office of
research and engineering, said that the radar showed multiple blips
at an altitude of 10,000 feet that were no longer ``consistent with
a flying airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane turned right at one point during its descent, but
seemed, as it finally appeared to cease flying, to turn to the
left. The parts drifted with the wind and took some two minutes and
forty seconds to fall below the radar horizon, about 1,800 feet
above the sea.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the plane took 40 seconds to descend
from 33,000 feet, its assigned altitude, to 16,700 feet, where the
device that reports back to shore on its altitude ceased to
function. Investigators said Wednesday night that two Air Force
radars then tracked to 24,000 _ a sudden ascent of about 8,000 feet
_ and then resume its descent.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators would not speculate on whether the pilots were
trying to regain control as the plane stopped its descent and
climbed more than a mile and resumed its plunge. The flight data
recorder, which the Navy is seeking to recover, would indicate
whether the engines were still running and what forces the crew and
passengers where subjected to in the plunge and climb. The climb
came after the plane's transponder stopped working, raising the
question whether the electrical systems were still working to power
the black boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The new information released here by investigators Wednesday
night painted the most detailed picture so far about the final
minutes of Flight 990. But the description of the plane in wild
distress did not indicate what caused the plunge, and investigators
said that they would not speculate on its causes or implications.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane is not designed to fly above 90 percent of the
speed of sound, about 743 miles an hour at sea level, and could
have been weakened by flying too fast, or could have broken up from
stress if the pilots tried to pull it out of its initial dive, or
for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force radars, located at Riverhead, N.Y. in eastern Long
Island, and Truro, Mass., on Cape Cod, cannot see below 8,800 feet,
but a civilian radar on Nantucket can see down to 1,800 feet. Its
data has not been fully analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a storm system brought whipping winds and 20-foot
swells to the patch of ocean roughly 50 miles off the shore of
Nantucket, Mass., where the Boeing 767 plunged into the sea early
Sunday morning, killing all 217 aboard. The storm drove all but one
of the search and salvage ships back to port here.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Naval station here and the Rhode Island Air National
Guard base across Narragansett Bay at Quonset Point where the
recovery operation is being mounted, it was a day of preparation
for the difficult search ahead and one of rest for some of the men
and women who had gone to the crash site Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``By design, I haven't let myself hear what's going on or feel
what's going on,'' said Lt. j.g. Craig Jaramillo, who was the
acting operations officer at the Coast Guard station at Woods Hole,
Mass., when the call came in that an airplane had disappeared from
radar. ``Later on I'll let myself think about the 217 families and
how it is to lose their loved ones, and I'll think about the kids
that we have in the Coast Guard, young men and women 17 and 18
years old, who are pulling teddy bears out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Philip Dequine, 26, recalled how the
Coast Guard cutter Juniper left on a rescue mission only to find
what he called ``popcorn-sized'' debris. Hopes rose briefly when
his shipmates spotted some intact seat cushions. ``When we saw
bigger stuff, we were hoping somehow, some way, someone would make
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives of the 217 people who died in the crash,
meanwhile, complained that they were running out of patience. At a
tense meeting with government officials Wednesday, several asked to
visit the makeshift morgue that has been established on Quonset
Point for the few human remains that have been collected so far,
and others said they would like to be taken out to sea to visit the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Three relatives who were apparently distraught were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   With the weather expected to improve, investigators can continue
their efforts to recover the plane's flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder. Searchers plotted the tentative locations
of the recorders _ the so-called black boxes _ earlier this week
after ships picked up the pinging sounds the boxes emit. Their
recovery from the ocean floor is the mission of the U.S.S. Grapple,
a 255-foot Navy salvage ship that was outfitted here Wednesday with
an underwater robot nicknamed Deep Drone.
</P>
<P>
   The robot, an orange and yellow submersible known in military
circles as a Remotely Operated Vehicle, is equipped with sonar, a
still camera, a video camera and pincers that searchers hope will
be able to grasp the boxes and pull them up.
</P>
<P>
   But should Deep Drone fail in its mission _ if the black boxes
are tangled in wreckage, for example _ the Navy will have to send
divers down to try to retrieve them. Since the wreckage lies in
waters that are estimated to be 240 to 270 feet deep, that will be
a difficult and dangerous endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Divers will be able to spend only about 30 minutes on the
bottom, where the visibility will be extremely limited and the
water will be so cold that they will need to wear special suits
that circulate hot water pumped from the ship above.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But while safety board investigators hope the black boxes
provide a valuable clue, like a telling conversation captured on
the cockpit voice recorder or some glaring anomaly on the flight
data recorder, the information they contain may not be so
cut-and-dried. If that proves to be the case, investigators from
the board may ask the Navy salvagers to begin recovering more
pieces of the plane for a prolonged forensic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   It all begins with making a map of the ocean floor, which will
be done by the Whiting, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ship that pulls a sonar device behind it to collect
data.
</P>
<P>
   With the primary evidence lying in salt water, the recovery
effort will have to be quick. ``The longer the materials are under
the water, the greater the propensity for corrosion and damage,
which can mask the characteristics of bomb damage,'' said William
A. Tobin, a former FBI forensic metallurgist who worked on the
inquiry into the crash of TWA Flight 800 and is now a private
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ravages of salt water, he said, strong tides
that push sand and silt can damage the underwater wreckage and
destroy valuable evidence, especially when they smooth jagged
fractured surfaces, which are among the most valuable bits of
debris for investigators to study in their quest to learn how the
plane came apart.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, at least, the cold water could prove an
advantage. ``A cold environment will retard corrosion
significantly,'' Tobin said.

AGRICULTURE FUTURE OF AMERICA CONFERENCE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ More than 250 students from 15 Midwestern
states will gather at the Kansas City Marriott Downtown Thursday
through Sunday for the third annual Agriculture Future of America
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City-based organization provides college students
with scholarships, workplace skills training, internships and
professional development seminars aimed at easing their entry into
the agribusiness world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFA has provided a bridge between rural America and the
college classroom,'' said Sheri Moeller of Brooking, S.D., one of
the organization's student leaders.
</P>
<P>
   AFA was founded in 1996 by Kansas City banker R. Crosby Kemper
Jr. after the National FFA Organization announced it was moving its
annual convention from Kansas City to Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City this week, a stellar list of government and
industry leaders will meet with the AFA. Among them are Kansas Gov.
Bill Graves, Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes, Kansas City Board of
Trade President Michael Braude, Farmland Industries President Harry
Cleberg, Kansas City Southern Railway Co. President Mike Haverty
and National Cattlemen's Beef Association Chief Executive Charles
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Their organizations and many others in the region provide
financial support that in the next two years is expected to reach
the first $1 million in AFA scholarships awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream of a Kansas City-based youth organization that helps
students prepare to be our next generation of agribusiness leaders
has taken hold,'' said Alexander Kemper, president and chief
executive of UMB Financial Corp. and chairman of the AFA board of
directors.

USC'S KNIGHT SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Darryl Knight has been suspended
indefinitely for a team rules violation that is believed to be
academics related.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not with us this week and we'll see how it unfolds,''
USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight started the Stanford game two weeks ago and split time
with Markus Steele last week against Cal. He will be replaced by
sophomore Henry Wallace, who has practiced at all three linebacker
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect Wallace to play in the game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Steele has not been playing a full game because he is nursing an
ailing shoulder that will require surgery after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Two-quarterback system: Even if John Fox starts as expected
against Arizona State, quarterbacks coach Ken O'Brien said Fox and
junior Mike Van Raaphorst will see action against the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both going to play,'' O'Brien said. ``I anticipate
both will play.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said Fox's practice time has increased dramatically this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten more reps in the last two days than in the last
two years,'' O'Brien said. ``I think John has the ability to play
and can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowl crunch: It might seem ridiculous to ponder that USC will
win its final four games, but even if the Trojans did and became
bowl eligible, they could find some difficulty finding a suitor.
</P>
<P>
   USC can finish no better than 4-4 in the Pacific-10 Conference
race, and there are currently six teams in the conference with two
losses or less. The Pac-10 has agreements with five bowls.
</P>
<P>
   If shut out from the contracted bowls, the Trojans would likely
wind up in the Motor City Bowl in Detroit, which has an at-large
berth. How bout No.13 Marshall vs. USC?
</P>
<P>
   If USC failed to make a bowl, the Trojans would know who to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be our fault,'' offensive lineman Travis Claridge
said. ``Because we had a lot of games we should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paul poll: What is a side effect of a 3-5 start? The Daily
Trojan, USC's student newspaper, has started running a poll this
week asking if Hackett should be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Results are expected to be published next week.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's status: The chances of quarterback Carson Palmer
playing against UCLA appear less likely. Palmer did not undergo an
X-ray Tuesday night because of an academic conflict, and team
doctors wanted to wait another week before examining him.
</P>
<P>
   That means Palmer will not begin upper-body exercises before
next week, and the earliest he could start throwing a football
would be the week of the UCLA game.

LANDSCAPES BY THE CARLOAD: ART OR KITSCH?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>

 Tessa DeCarlo's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
the folk artist Nellie Mae Rowe.  
 By TESSA DeCARLO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Thomas Kinkade's 100,000-square-foot
headquarters here is hardly a typical artist's atelier. But then
Kinkade, arguably the most commercially successful painter of the
1990s, is hardly a typical artist.
</P>
<P>
   In a large room lined with industrial sinks, dozens of workers
in aprons and galoshes dunk reproductions of Kinkade's latest
painting in water, peel off the paper backing and glue the
flower-and-sunbeam-spangled landscape to stretched canvas. Down the
hall, another room is filled with workers sitting before long rows
of the canvas-backed reproductions, amplifying the picture's
luminescent light effects by adding dots and squiggles of paint.
</P>
<P>
   In a smaller studio nearby, three ``master highlighters''
trained personally by Kinkade do the same thing with more finesse
and a wider range of colors. And in the vast warehouse out back,
hundreds more people mat, frame, pack and ship the finished
pictures to the 248 Thomas Kinkade galleries in malls and tourist
Meccas all over the United States, where they'll be sold to eager
collectors for anywhere from $600 to $10,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the future according to Kinkade. Welcome to a crusade
to redeem the soul of American art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent the forefront of an entirely new trend, a populist
movement that takes images people understand and creates an
iconography for our era,'' says Kincade, an ebullient, burly,
mustached fellow in jeans who looks more like a construction worker
than a multimillionaire artist. ``We are creating an avalanche of
imagery that is impacting the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For most high-art aficionados, Kinkade's light-dappled
renderings of frothing oceans, fantastical cottages and feverishly
colorful gardens, bearing titles like ``The Blessings of Spring''
and ``Hometown Evening,'' may be impossible to see as anything but
slickly commercial kitsch. But in view of Kinkade's popularity _
his official Web site calls him America's most collected living
artist _ we might pause before dismissing his paintings out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these days the line between kitsch and serious art is
blurring, thanks to the art world's reflexive disdain for
boundaries and its insatiable appetite for new ways to shock. It's
a trend epitomized by the apotheosis of Norman Rockwell from kitsch
illustrator to member of the high-art canon, as signaled by the big
Rockwell retrospective that opened Saturday at the High Museum in
Atlanta and will arrive at the Guggenheim in New York in 2001. With
sweetness, sincerity and bad taste seemingly in the ascendant, is a
Kinkade show at the Guggenheim next?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. As yet Kinkade has no champions in the high-art world,
not even among those who endorse other popular antimodernists. For
example, Robert Rosenblum, as curator of the Guggenheim's Rockwell
show, shrugs off the outrage of art-world colleagues. ``They're old
fogeys and they think it's substandard art,'' he says. ``I think of
it as a cutting-edge experiment.'' But even Rosenblum draws the
line at Thomas Kinkade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockwells are interesting to look at because they're cultural
documents and because their narrative and visual construction is so
fascinating,'' he says. Kinkade's work, by contrast, strikes him as
vapid and repetitive. ``He doesn't look like an artist who's worth
considering, except in terms of supply and demand. Of course a lot
of people would have probably said the same thing about Rockwell 20
or 30 years ago,'' Rosenblum adds. ``But I think Rockwell is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Kinkade disagrees. ``There have been three
icon-makers in our century,'' he says. Two, Maxfield Parrish and
Norman Rockwell, were embraced by the masses but disdained by
critics until decades later. The third is Kinkade himself.
``Because my art is populist,'' he predicts, ``it is likely to be
shunned until a curator or two steps to the front and says: `We
have to look at this. This is art that is embraced wildly by our
culture.''' In the meantime, he adds, ``The critics may not endorse
me, but I own the hearts of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade, 41, is a devout Christian whose life appears to be as
rich in sentiment as his pictures. He is married to his childhood
sweetheart, Nanette, and has four young daughters, Merritt,
Chandler, Winsor and Everett, all of whom share the middle name
Christian. He grew up in the California mountain town of
Placerville, dropped out of both the University of California at
Berkeley and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, bummed
around the country and painted backgrounds for the animated film
``Fire and Ice'' before becoming a gallery artist. From the
beginning his goals were very different from those of the high-art
world.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he wanted a large popular audience. For another,
he believed art's purpose is to provide inspiration and
reassurance, not _ per modernist orthodoxy _ to question
assumptions or challenge the status quo. ``My paintings provide
hope to people in despair, provide a reminder of the beauty of
God's creation despite the darkness surrounding our lives,''
Kinkade explains.
</P>
<P>
   He calls painting his ministry and says he has received hundreds
of letters from grateful fans telling how his pictures have lifted
their spirits, reunited their families, even saved them from
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   To high-art types Kinkade's sentimental belief in uplift is a
key reason his work is so unappealing. ``It's about reaffirming
images that are comfortable, which isn't very interesting,'' says
Gary Garrels, the chief curator at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. ``There's just very little to discuss there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To Kinkade such attitudes reveal the emotional poverty of the
art elite. ``High culture is paranoid about sentiment,'' he says.
``But human beings are intensely sentimental. And if art does not
speak a language that's accessible to people, it relegates itself
to obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he believes in making art accessible, in every sense.
Many popular artists sell limited-edition reproductions rather than
original paintings, but Kinkade has taken this strategy to
previously unimagined extremes.
</P>
<P>
   His multitiered system includes basic paper prints costing a few
hundred dollars, ``canvas lithographs'' in ``standard numbered''
editions of 4,000 or more that sell in the low four figures,
pricier ``Renaissance editions'' enhanced by ``master
highlighters'' and a half-dozen other variations. At the top are
``semi-originals'' highlighted by Kinkade himself that can cost
$34,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having more dedicated galleries than any other
artist, all furnished with dark-green carpeted walls and rheostat
lights to enhance his pictures' crowd-pleasing light effects,
Kinkade is also the only painter on the New York Stock Exchange.
Media Arts Group Inc., the publicly traded company that distributes
his work, posted $126 million in revenues and $84 million in
profits for fiscal 1999, reflecting not only sales of Kinkade's
pictures but licensing agreements for Kinkade cards, puzzles, mugs,
blankets, books and even La-Z-Boy furniture.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Media Arts spokeswoman, Brenda Balingit, ``We
believe it's the first time a life style brand has been built
around an artist rather than a clothing designer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reassuring pictures remain the heart of the Kinkade empire,
however. ``In this hectic rat race, it's nice to look at something
calm and peaceful,'' said Laurie Weber of Vacaville, Calif.,
explaining why she and her husband, Frank, had just purchased their
second Kinkade, ``Victorian Garden II.'' The Webers were among
several customers lined up at the Thomas Kinkade Gallery in nearby
Calistoga on a recent weekend to have their newly acquired canvases
enhanced by a visiting ``master highlighter,'' who relayed tidbits
of Kinkade's biography as she touched up each picture with dabs of
premixed color.
</P>
<P>
   ``This personalizes it,'' Weber said afterward. ``So even if
your next-door neighbor has the same picture, each one is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gallery down the street, Paul Youngman, an artist, sat near
several of his original landscape oils and shook his head in
disgust. ``I don't think of that place as an art gallery,'' he
said. ``It's a card shop, but the cards are really big and have
frames around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade's brother, Patrick, a sociology professor who also runs
a Kinkade gallery in Forth Worth, Texas, counters: ``Galleries
disparage my brother because they're protecting the market in
originals. There's the critical art culture and the Everyman
culture, and my brother is attacking the foundations of the
critical culture's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Kinkade organization's marketing tactics could be
seen as a hilariously effective critique of the traditional art
world's market-driven deification of the art object. As The San
Francisco Chronicle art critic Kenneth Baker put it during a visit
to the Thomas Kinkade Gallery in that city, ``If there's such a
thing as naive postmodernism, this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Baker was pleasantly surprised by Kinkade's skillful
rendering of skies and mosses, particularly in some of his earlier
works, he found much of the imagery ``clumsy'' and ``cheesy.''
</P>
<P>
   What Baker found most disturbing about the pictures, and the
greatest bar to their ever being taken seriously, was the artist's
relentlessly comforting message. ``Do we want what we call `art' to
serve this social function of quelling our anxiety in an almost
pharmaceutical fashion?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkade nevertheless remains convinced that art mandarins like
Baker will someday recognize his work's value. ``There is room for
an experimental, intellectual bent in the arts, but there is also
room for a populist mainstream vision,'' he says. ``This is a new
type of art, the art of everyone, and I'm on the cutting edge.''

NETS MAKE TOO MANY MISTAKES AND FALL TO CAVS, 97-90
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Starting sluggishly, then rallying to make the game
competitive has merits against Eastern Conference powers like the
Indiana Pacers. But when that is your pattern against the Cleveland
Cavaliers, an inexperienced and injury-plagued team with only
slightly legitimate playoff chances, pats on the back are not in
order.
</P>
<P>
   So there were no qualifying statements, no talk of small
victories, coming forth from the New Jersey Nets after Wednesday
night's listless 97-90 loss to the Cavaliers. For nothing redeeming
comes out of falling behind Cleveland by 11 points in the second
quarter, fighting back to pull within one point in the fourth and
then succumbing in the most crucial moments of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about this at all,'' said Kendall Gill, who
contributed to the Nets' 34 percent shooting by missing 11 of 15
shots. ``That's a team we should have beat. Maybe this is just the
rough part of our year. Hopefully, it is.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gill spoke as if the Nets' world would automatically turn
around, as if their results would change like the seasons, their
0-2 record is not by happenstance. In their losses to the Pacers,
by 119-112 on Tuesday, and the Cavaliers, who were playing without
their injured center, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Nets have been
exposed as a team with problems, and their well-documented
propensity for getting hurt is the least of them.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense _ all Stephon Marbury, all the time _ is among the
most predictable in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   With absolutely no post presence, they rely solely on Marbury to
work magic and to get himself and his teammates open shots. What it
amounts to is jumper after jumper, and so far, miss after miss.
Only 20 Nets points Wednesday night came inside the painted area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive end is really hurting us,'' Nets coach Don Casey
said. ``It's our nemesis.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his brilliance, Marbury has a habit of pulling up for
jump shots at bad times and trying shots outside the offensive
flow. While that deficiency gets overlooked when he scores 39
points against high-quality opponents _ as he did against Indiana _
it becomes glaring against mediocre crews like Cleveland. He missed
seven of his first eight shots, and 15 of his first 20 Wednesday
night, and finished with a line of 7 for 25. He had 27 points, but
only one assist.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers, 92-84 losers to the Knicks on Tuesday, expected
Marbury to take them on by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that Marbury shot the ball 34 times against the
Pacers, so he had to be a little tired tonight,'' said Shawn Kemp,
the robust power forward, who recorded 27 points and 15 rebounds in
leading the Cavs to their sixth straight victory over the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn, the Nets' other should-be star, has yet to get
into an offensive rhythm. Far from displaying the excellence that
has made him one of the most dangerous players in the game, he has
made only 11 of 33 field-goal attempts over the first two games. He
was 6 for 14 Wednesday night with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being perimeter heavy, the Nets' offense is
stagnant, with most plays ending on the side on which they began.
With lots of individual play, there is little ball movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it a lot easier for the defense because you don't
have to rotate,'' Kemp said. ``A lot of times, they were trying to
make one-on-one moves and we were able to sit there and concentrate
on Marbury and Van Horn. They have to find a way to move the ball
and get those other guys involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets also have trouble stopping people. Their perimeter
defense is unsound, and they are a strong post scorer's dream. The
Cavaliers penetrated the lane at will and got many open shots
outside. Their small point guard, Brevin Knight, sped through the
defense for 16 points and six assists, and Kemp had a party near
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-foot-8-inch Jamie Feick guarding him, Kemp had 11
points and eight rebounds in the first quarter. He was big again in
the third, scoring 10 points to help the Cavaliers turn a 46-41
halftime lead into a 15-point advantage, 69-54. Feick, who played
with a plastic cast on his broken nose, fought valiantly but he was
simply overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to attack them inside because we felt that that was
our edge,'' said Knight, who hit a 16-foot jumper with two minutes
left to start a game-clinching 8-2 run after the Nets pulled within
89-88. ``We didn't think they had guys who were big enough to stay
with our guys.''  &QL;

FIGHTING ADDICTION BY DOCUMENTING ITS WRETCHEDNESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Murray Whyte is the deputy arts editor of the National Post, a
Canadian daily national newspaper based in Toronto.  
 By MURRAY WHYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The young woman's image is blurred
and unsteady as it tracks across the screen. She shifts back and
forth in front of a gritty sink, absently tending to a gaping wound
that runs the length of her forearm, which is bloated to twice its
normal size from her addiction to intravenous heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, John, ``wants to get a job,'' she explains. ``He
wants to get off it. He wants to get clean. We both do.''
</P>
<P>
   As the camera captures her distracted attempts to dress the
wound, the woman, Carlee, in the thrall of a recent hit, appears
oblivious to the fact that moments before, John had died in the
other room, the victim of a self-inflicted handgun blast to the
face, after a desperate argument in which she forbade him to try an
armed robbery to feed his drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence, mere moments long, is as amateurish as it is
chilling: the camera wavers badly as Carlee shifts to and fro, her
face alternately hidden by shadow and washed out by excess light.
Given the circumstances _ a violent act, Carlee's wound, the
unsettling nature of a junkie's staccato motion and halting speech
_ some unease on the cameraman's part could be understood.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the camera is in the hands not of a
professional but of Jim Mitchell, a Vancouver police officer who
arrived on the scene with his partner, Mark Steinkampf, only
moments before.
</P>
<P>
   Steinkampf's presence here was no coincidence. For 18 months, he
and his colleagues _ the self-styled Odd Squad, seven beat cops
hardened by years of service on Vancouver's drug and
disease-infested Downtown Eastside _ have been compiling a
documentary film, ``Through a Blue Lens,'' which will have its
premiere in Vancouver Nov. 20 and will be making the rounds of the
film festivals next year.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes Constables Al Arsenault, Toby Hinton,
Dave Kolb, Dale Weidman, Walt McKay and Len Hollingsworth, decided
long ago that the endless stream of drug-related arrests in the
area was doing little to stem the misery caused by the high-volume
drug trade. Instead, the officers had a novel approach: document
the misery and take it to the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point we're trying to make here is that life is a series
of decisions,'' Hinton explains as he and Arsenault patrol an
alleyway strewn with used syringes and needle wrappers. ``Too many
of the wrong ones can land you in a place you never could have
imagined _ right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The area of no more than a dozen square blocks, with roughly
16,000 residents packed into various shelters,
single-room-occupancy hotels and apartments, is the site of 80
percent of Greater Vancouver's drug-related arrests, though it
represents only 3 percent of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16,000, about 6,000 are addicted to intravenous drug use.
And with those numbers comes a darker statistic as well: with an
HIV infection rate as high as 50 percent among the area's
intravenous drug users, according to the police, the Downtown
Eastside had the highest rate in the developed world in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was not lost on the international press. That year,
soon after local health officials revealed their findings,
reporters, camera crews and filmmakers from around the world
descended. ``The Crisis Next Door,'' read one front-page headline
in The Seattle Times that summer; Hinton recalls walking his beat
with a six-person film crew from the BBC, eager for some visual
evidence to back up the statistics. Then, just as quickly as they
had come, the reporters dispersed, leaving the area to its
miserable solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Long before, though, the Odd Squad had embarked on a documentary
project of their own. Years earlier, Arsenault had started
patrolling his beat with a camera in hand. Almost everything he saw
emerged as a photo opportunity: addicts gripped by drug psychosis,
overdoses, mayhem. Arsenault prepared a slide show of his work for
the squad, and soon after, each member began the same practice. The
group now has more than 2,000 photographs, which are used as a
public education tool.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The photos, bleak and chilling, are not simply a random sampling
of the area's ills, Hinton says. ``Over a number of years, you get
to know people,'' he says. ``And over the same number of years, you
start to lose people as well'' _ to AIDS, overdose or violence.
``That's the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   A core group of six of those people have voluntarily become
subjects of both the photographs and film. Their reasons are varied
but similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stop any kid from going through this hell, then I'll
do everything I can to do that,'' Carlee says, sitting in her bleak
one-room apartment. She pulls back her shirt to reveal her upper
arms, which are heavily tracked with scars _ the result of ``dope
worms,'' a tactile hallucination that compels addicts to dig into
their flesh to free the creatures they imagine to be burrowing
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ashamed to show my arms _ battle wounds, I call them,''
Carlee says. ``But I want to say, I want to show them, `Look, this
can happen to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The trust in the Odd Squad has put the officers in an unusual
position as filmmakers, says Veronica Mannix, an independent
filmmaker in Vancouver who directed ``Through a Blue Lens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mannix met the squad while shooting another film in the
area, ``Down Here,'' and quickly realized that the gap between what
a film crew sees and the reality of what a police officer
experiences is vast _ and that on the Downtown Eastside, reality
can too easily be bent to your will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend a week down here _ or an hour, even _ and you'll
get the footage you're looking for,'' she said. ``There's just so
much of it you can build whatever story you want. But it's not the
real story. We were there for eight months, and when we hooked up
with these guys, they took us into places we couldn't have imagined
existed. They know every nook and cranny of this area. What they
showed us was desperation in its most tangible form.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Mannix saw the slides, she encouraged the officers to
start shooting film. The final cut, 52 minutes culled from more
than 67 hours, will include their film interspersed with scenes
shot by Ms. Mannix and her professional crew. The quality varies,
but to dramatic effect, she says. ``It has a kind of rough,
personal quality that you wouldn't get from a professional,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   On the beat, little has changed over the course of the project.
Carlee remains in her one-room flop, drug paraphernalia scattered
about. Michelle, 26, whom Hinton has known from the street since
she was 14, is headed for rehab, but she has been there before,
only to return to dealing and prostitution to support her habit.
</P>
<P>
   For these people, the police know there is little hope, Hinton
says. Where hope lies, he says, is in using their experience as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get some sideways glances when you explain what you're
doing,'' he says. ``But when you see this kind of progression, over
and over again, you realize what a waste it all is. We're
realistic: we know that it's probably too late for most of the
people who are already here. But this is our way of trying to stop
the waste.''

LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS _ IN KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINA, Kan. _ Fifteen years ago, the only animals Charlie
Walker kept on his sprawling ranch were Belgian horses and a small
herd of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of area children visited on school trips, much to
Walker's enjoyment, but young attention spans can be short.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can line up 130 Belgians, but they're all the same color
and size,'' he recalls. ``Kids get bored pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1986, Walker bought a lion, two llamas and a pair of black
bears. Kids loved them. And soon, Walker was hooked. He sold the
Belgians and began collecting exotic animals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Walker opened the Rolling Hills Refuge Wildlife
Conservation Center, a multimillion-dollar zoo set on 55 acres of
Kansas prairie. He plans to add 45 acres in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit project is the result of more than five years of
planning and construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just kind of grew,'' said Walker, 67, who won't reveal how
much money he has spent on the place. ``...We wanted to build it
one time and build it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Walker and park director Bob Brown, that means
heeding every detail.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a valley and surrounded by rolling hills _ hence the name
_ the park has been landscaped extensively. Workers have planted
more than 3,000 trees. There are four ponds and two more on the
undeveloped part.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has a background in landscaping, designed the park.
He said he was going for a ``symphony'' approach, in which steel,
plants, trees and animals are united.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just done a beautiful job with landscaping,'' said
Donna Schneck of Bonner Springs, who visited the park last week
with her husband, Merle. ``And the water, and all the sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Refuge employees have performed practically all the construction
work on the site, leaving only the shells of buildings to outside
contractors, along with electrical, heating and air-conditioning
work.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Hills has its own water system, sewer system and backup
electrical system.
</P>
<P>
   Brown outlined the three restrictions Walker gave him in
building the park: ``Spend my money like it's yours; try to spend
locally; have a good time.''

<P>
   ``One thing that will never be in my funeral procession is a
Brinks truck,'' Walker said, ``because you can't take it with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than animal behaviorist Jane Goodall came
away during a recent visit impressed with the indoor-outdoor
``Great Apes'' display that houses chimpanzees and orangutans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to have the best chimpanzee exhibit in the
country,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though visitors will still have a close view, the large
cages and enclosures were built with the animals' comfort and
safety in mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Hills' animal collection includes more than 65 species,
about 40 of which are on display, including the rhinoceros,
giraffe, black bear, amur leopard and Malayan tapir.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo also has two white tigers on display, one of which was
bid on by Siegfried and Roy, the Las Vegas performers who use them
in their shows. A lion exhibit now under construction is scheduled
to be completed by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Larger animals on Brown's wish list in the next five years
include the striped hyena, lowland gorilla and giant anteater.
Elephants also are a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The animals are inspected regularly by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. Rolling Hills also intends next year to seek
accreditation by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, which
has an extensive review process.
</P>
<P>
   More than 184 zoos nationwide are accredited by the association,
including six in Kansas _ in Emporia, Garden City, Hutchinson,
Manhattan, Topeka and Wichita. All have more species than Rolling
Hills, whose strength lies in having some popular large animals and
primates that some of the others do not.
</P>
<P>
   If accredited, Rolling Hills will be among only a handful of
privately owned and operated zoos nationwide to earn the
designation. Some in this category, including Busch Gardens and
Disney's Animal Kingdom, are owned by large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Rolling Hills... MORE

LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS _ IN KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINA, Kan. _ ....by large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Rolling Hills has been almost entirely paid for by
one man. Charlie Walker made his fortune starting a nationwide
chain of truck stops that bear the Petro and Blue Beacon names. His
company also owns truck washes and convenience stores and has
started building motels.
</P>
<P>
   Walker grew up poor in Salina and has lived there all but a few
years of his life. He quit school and left home at age 15, working
blue-collar jobs in Dodge City, Kan., and Pueblo, Colo. He joined
the Air Force after the Korean War began and returned to Salina
after the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company for Walker's operations, Blue Beacon
International, employs about 3,500 people, including two of his
sons, Trace, who is president, and Mike, who is executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Walker family has made many charitable contributions in
Salina, including to Sacred Heart High School and a homeless
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes on and on,'' said Bill Mowery, a retired Salina
physician and a friend of Walker for 15 years. ``He's a world-class
humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown still loves to tell the story about the first time he met
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and a co-worker were on a service call to repair a pump in
Walker's swimming pool in 1989 when shots rang out overhead. The
two men hit the ground, frightened.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing what happened, Walker called out to the men and
apologized, explaining that he was trying out a new pistol.
</P>
<P>
   During the subsequent conversation, Brown mentioned that he had
noticed two camels on the property. Walker showed him the camels
and the rest of the animal collection, and Brown was fascinated. A
few months later, he became Walker's chief animal keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of Rolling Hills' 41 full-time employees had ever worked
at a zoo before joining the staff. They've all learned on the job
and trained one another.
</P>
<P>
   Walker himself is comfortable working with many animals, but in
1997 as he escorted a kindergarten class through the park, he was
injured while feeding an apple to a rhino. He had to spend two days
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As Walker's plans for a zoo became more ambitious in the early
'90s, he and Brown traveled the country in Walker's airplanes to
look at zoos and animal parks. They figured on a drive-through park
until they saw Wildlife World Zoo, a private walk-through park near
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-acre park, owned by Mickey Ollson, has 325 species and
draws 275,000 visitors a year. Ollson has consulted with Brown on
several occasions and visited Rolling Hills over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they did an excellent job of developing from scratch
a pretty darn nice institution,'' Ollson said. ``...I just hope the
population in Kansas is enough to support another zoo.'' Rolling
Hills isn't sure how many visitors it can expect to attract, but
based on American Zoo and Aquarium Association figures for
similar-sized zoos, it estimates 150,000 to 200,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the Wichita zoo or Kansas City Zoo,'' said
Rolling Hills volunteer Cynthia Hoffman. ``It has its own ambiance,
and it's comfortable. I think that will make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Rolling Hills' primary market area is within 90 miles
of Salina, a city of about 44,000 people. However, the park is near
both Interstates 70 and 135. About 28,000 cars a day pass through
Salina on the two highways, according to the Kansas Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Salina Area Chamber of Commerce is working with officials in
Hutchinson, home of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, and
Hays, home of the Sternberg Museum of Natural History, to market
all three attractions together.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling Hills has placed some billboards on the highways but
decided on a ``soft'' opening in the fall. It will save its
full-fledged publicity blitz for spring, when larger crowds are
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, without Walker, Rolling Hills would never have
advanced past the idea stage, let alone become one of the biggest
things to hit Salina and this part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who knows how to turn dreams into
reality,'' Brown said. ``He loves the community, loves education,
loves kids, loves animals.''

UNCOVERING BEAUTY IN ORDINARY NOISE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Cori Ellison is the dramaturg at the New York City Opera.  
 By CORI ELLISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It is a sultry, sticky afternoon, but in the quiet
corner of the trendy Third Arrondissement where the Finnish
composer Kaija Saariaho makes her home, her thoughts drift toward
snow, the sea and lofty ideas: natural, perhaps, for a daughter of
the Nordic lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven short movements speak of departure, love, tides,
time, memory, death and arrival,'' Ms. Saariaho said of ``Oltra
Mar,'' a 16-minute work for orchestra and chorus commissioned by
the New York Philharmonic as part of its ``Messages for the
Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra will give the work's premiere on Thursday, the
night after the avant-garde Sonic Boom Festival presents the United
States premiere of Ms. Saariaho's ``Neiges,'' a 1998 work for cello
octet, at Cooper Union in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, such gravity is nothing new for Ms. Saariaho. Born
in Helsinki in 1952, she displayed a fiercely odd precocity. ``My
mother told me that I always complained that there was music coming
from my pillow,'' she said. ``I would ask her, `Can't you turn it
off?''' Violin lessons, begun when she was 6, helped slake her
musical thirst. But Ms. Saariaho, with a diffidence to match her
Garbo-esque looks, detested performing, and no sooner had she
turned to the piano than she was drawn toward composition. At 11,
she had what she calls her first crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about Mozart and realized that he'd gotten quite far
when he was my age,'' she said. ``I came to the conclusion that I
was not good enough. So I thought I'd become an organist and lead a
philosophical, ascetic life in some little village in Finland and
play the organ to serve music.''
</P>
<P>
   She also tried to divert her creativity into graphics,
musicology and music theory, but Ms. Saariaho eventually felt fated
to become a composer. She apprenticed herself to Paavo Heininen,
Finland's pre-eminent composition teacher and himself a student of
Bernd Alois Zimmermann and Vincent Persichetti.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s were heady times at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki,
where Heininen taught. Thanks to the Finnish government's
establishment of a national network of music schools in the '60s, a
gifted and diverse crop of young musicians was emerging, rallying
under the loose banner of modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho's schoolmates included the composers Jouni
Kaipainen and Magnus Lindberg, and the conductors Esa-Pekka Salonen
and Jukka-Pekka Saraste. In 1977, they consolidated their
postserialist aesthetics in the society Ears Open and its
performing counterpart, the Avanti Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But soon Ms. Saariaho began to feel stifled. ``Finland is so
small,'' she explained. ``I needed to get out. I started to be
labeled right away `the woman composer,' because there were no
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho attended summer music courses in Darmstadt,
Germany, and was lured to further studies in Freiburg with the
English composer Brian Ferneyhough, a disciple of Pierre Boulez and
Karlheinz Stockhausen, and a guru for young modernist composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all of a sudden on very international ground, and that
was good for me,'' she said. ``Still, I was unhappy in Germany. I
was all alone. And Germany is so strict about rules, it somehow
made my ascetic tendencies stronger. I became a strict vegetarian
just because I couldn't stand the sausages that were all over. So
Germany made me thinner, narrower, in all senses.''
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Ms. Saariaho became acquainted with the work of
Gerard Grisey and Tristan Murail, the standard-bearers of Ircam,
the pioneering center for research and training in musical
acoustics, electronics and computer technology in Paris, founded by
Boulez in 1976. In 1982, she enrolled in Ircam's computer-music
courses, and she has lived in Paris ever since.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Saariaho, one of Paris's most powerful draws was
Jean-Baptiste Barriere, a composer and longtime Ircam staff member,
whom she eventually married. But the city itself also worked its
ineffable charms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it's so good for me, the value Parisians give to their
senses,'' Ms. Saariaho said. ``People can have a lunch that takes
one and a half hours. For a Finn, that's unbelievable. And the
wines, the scents, the multitude of possibilities: it somehow
relaxed me, gave me a freedom. I felt this strongly after living in
Finland again last year.''
</P>
<P>
   She recently completed a one-year visiting professorship at the
Sibelius Academy. ``Of course, I love Finland,'' added Ms.
Saariaho, who speaks Finnish to her children, Alex, 10, and Alisa,
5. ``It's my country. But in Finland, I'm a big public person.
Here, nobody cares about me, so I'm in peace, like in a big
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho's musical life was also transformed in Paris, by
her encounter with computers. Yet she is swift to point out that
for her, computer music is not a style but a means to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a completely instrumental milieu,'' she said. ``I
kind of re-established my musical language with the computer,
analyzing sounds, building synthetic sounds and trying to
understand my own musical mind. I developed some programs with
which I tried to formalize my musical thinking, programs that allow
me to create and modify material. But my ambition was never in
technology. I learned also how boring music might be if you use
only this kind of formalized, rational thinking to create it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho's first computer composition, ``Vers le Blanc''
(1982), set the agenda for many of her future endeavors. It is, in
essence, a 15-minute glide from one chord, formed from three
apparently sung pitches, to another, with the computer slowly
distorting and eventually restoring the human timbre.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The work may be seen as a manifesto of European modernism,
illustrating some of its most striking stylistic features: gradual
processes, static concepts of time and form, and an emphasis on a
microworld of sound. But it also makes a personal statement, laying
bare Ms. Saariaho's drive to probe the limits of perception.
</P>
<P>
   Several works of the '80s established Ms. Saariaho as a major
international composer and drew commissions from such venerable
institutions as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the BBC, Lincoln
Center and the Salzburg Festival. These pieces _ the shimmering
``Lichtbogen,'' for nine musicians and electronics; the elegiac
``Io,'' for chamber ensemble, tape and electronics; the dramatic
``Nymphea,'' for string quartet and electronics, and the spectral
``Stilleben,'' for electronics _ all exhibit Saariaho fingerprints:
whispers, poetic fragments, sensuality and a dreamlike atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1992 with ``Amers,'' for cello, ensemble and
electronics, Ms. Saariaho moved toward a clearer, simpler, more
lyrical style in which orchestral complexity has given way to a
more melodic solo line. This tendency culminated in ``Lonh,'' for
soprano and electronics, and ``Chateau de l'Ame,'' for soprano and
orchestra, both composed in 1996 for Dawn Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been listening to Dawn's recordings since 1989,'' Ms.
Saariaho said. ``But the real event for me was hearing her in
Messiaen's `St. Francois d'Assise.' Her voice in certain registers
became a bit of an obsession for me.'' Along with Ms. Upshaw, a
handful of compelling, imaginative, somewhat quirky performers,
including Salonen, Camille Hoitenga, a flutist, and Anssi
Karttunen, a cellist, have awakened Ms. Saariaho's muse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She usually writes with a particular performer in mind, tries
to get into his mind and personality,'' said Karttunen, a fellow
expatriate Finn living in Paris and a close friend. ``She's a
composer who leaves a lot of room for the performer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho's catalog of works reveals an affinity for flute,
strings and the female voice. ``Cello and flute are perfect for me
and my musical language,'' she said. ``With cello, of all the
stringed instruments, you can have the greatest control of the
color aspect of the sound. Often I divide sounds into different
categories, from noisy ones to bright ones, and then I create a
passage from noisy to bright textures. With cello, with the
different positions and pressure of the bow, with the harmonics, it
feeds these ideas very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Karttunen concurred: ``Kaija gets sounds out of the cello and
other instruments that were never before accepted. She reveals the
beauty in sounds formerly considered noise. She surprises us,
transforms our conceptions of particular sounds. She looks for
beauty in absolutely everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Saariaho's music focuses so strongly on timbre,
harmony and the relationship between them, she has become known as
a colorist. Certainly, the evocative titles of her works point to a
strong visual orientation. Yet these titles, she insists, are not
programmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thinking is very visual,'' she said. ``My sketches for many
pieces are drawings. But even if a visual phenomenon strongly
inspires me, it gives me musical ideas which are finally
abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that Ms. Saariaho feels increasingly
drawn to multimedia projects. In 1998, she, her husband and
Karttunen founded Petals, which produces CDs of new music that
would normally escape the attention of large recording companies
and markets them through the Internet (www.petals.org).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Saariaho has also collaborated on ``Prisma,'' a CD-ROM
dedicated to demystifying contemporary music and its techniques. An
amalgam of music, text, video, film, photos and animation devised
by Ms. Saariaho, Barriere and a group of performers and
technicians, it will be published this month in both French andEnglish versions.
</P>
<P>
   The composer's current preoccupation is her first opera,
``L'Amour de Loin,'' to be performed next summer at the Salzburg
Festival. Again, she has shaped the work around Ms. Upshaw, who
will be joined by the mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, the
conductor Kent Nagano and the director Peter Sellars. The libretto,
by the French-Lebanese author Amin Maalouf, is based on ``La Vida
Breve,'' by Jaufre Rudel, a 12th-century troubadour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it is about love and death, the most important themes
in life,'' said Ms. Saariaho. You can take the composer out of
Finland, but you can't take Finland out of the composer.

   (italics)Thoughts about Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway in its
early years from five people who were present (and active) at the
creation in the 1950s and 60s, and a look at working there today by
four members of the younger theatrical generation.(end italics)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judith Malina A founder of the Living Theater  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were around before the '60s. Our theater opened in 1947. It
was called the Living Theater. What we want is a truthful,
nonviolent, anarchist revolution, and in a certain sense all of our
work over the years has been to encourage people to create a better
world. Everybody wants to live in a world that is free of poverty
and wars. I think the purpose of art is to give people the idea,
the hope, that they can create a world they want to live in.
</P>
<P>
   I was a student of the German director Erwin Piscator and I was
much inspired by Piscator's concept of a theater with real meaning:
to get up and talk to people only when you have something to say.
</P>
<P>
   The Living Theater, as Julian Beck and I began it, wanted to
create new theatrical forms. It is 50 years later and the company
is still doing that. Some of our hopes were realized and many have
not been. But we are working to expand consciousness and the sense
of the possibility of change.
</P>
<P>
   Our latest play, ``Not in My Name,'' is against the death
penalty. It is put on in Duffy Square in Times Square whenever a
prisoner is executed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Living Theater tries to find an active role for the
audience. We don't want a class of people that speaks and a class
that is silent. If you can change people in the theater, maybe you
can change them in life. It's fun to work in revolutionary theater
in revolutionary times. But it's more important to do revolutionary
theater in prerevolutionary times. Hopefully, that is what we are
in now.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Stewart Artistic director of La Mama Experimental Theater
Club  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I had no interest in theater, but I had an interest in people,
which I do to this day. I started making theater in a little tiny
basement on East Ninth Street. It was big enough for 25 people and
I called it my pushcart. My Papa Diamond _ my dybbuk _ said, ``You
get a pushcart and I'm going to help you push it.'' Papa Diamond
was this little Jewish man who came from Romania, and he had a
pushcart on Orchard Street. He was dead by the time he told me this
but I could hear him as clear as could be. He told me I must not
push the cart for myself but for others. And voila, La Mama. In
1962 we did ``One Arm,'' a play by Tennessee Williams. I didn't
know it was about a homosexual in jail.
</P>
<P>
   God and Edward Koch made La Mama grow. Each time I had to move
we got a bigger place and each playwright had to write a bigger
play. I was always watching for the police, so I didn't see much
that I put on. I was a clothing designer and my intention was to
continue working in fashion so I could pay the rent for my
pushcart. Then, in 1965, we took our productions to Europe because,
with the exception of Jerry Tallmer, none of the critics would
come. My mama always told me to find a way, so I crossed the seas.
People in Europe, Asia and the Middle East know us today because
that is our territory.
</P>
<P>
   La Mama is not just one thing. It is a lot of things. I brought
Grotowski to America. And Tadeusz Kantor. It's very fashionable
now. All the things that people in the '90s think are new we have
been doing for 30 years.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schechner Artistic director, from 1967 to 1980, of the
Performance Group (Performing Garage)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was preposterous and arrogant maybe, but we were trying to
make a theater that would be a model for a new society. We didn't
want a theater that was a reflection of life. It was very much
related to the politics of the time: the black freedom movement
first and then the antiwar movement. We wanted to make theater that
you would not find on Broadway or in the newly formed regional
theater. It would not be naturalistic but would carry on the
European experimentation of Artaud and others. It would be a
participatory democracy, less hierarchical, more collective. And
noncommercial.
</P>
<P>
   The theater thought of itself as active _ it went into the
streets and into strange new venues. La Mama E.T.C. was a club. The
Performing Garage was a metal stamping factory. These were
nontheatrical spaces that we were claiming for ourselves. SoHo?
There wasn't a fashion store in the whole damn place.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no real artistic neighborhood in New York. Then,
neighborhoods were affordable. You could live much more cheaply.
The city didn't know what to do with some of the new spaces. These
places weren't theaters. They didn't have seats or a stage
sometimes. City inspectors were bollixed. You could work in your
space and have the public come in.
</P>
<P>
   The public was very curious. They came. The same people would go
to 18 different places. The audience was also a community. There
was a core of different groups. The old Dance Theater Workshop.
Grand Union. Trisha Brown. The Kitchen. Mabou Mines. Judson Church
was a fabulous venue _ it was the farthest north that we went.
</P>
<P>
   We were aware of the injustices of the system _ war, segregation
and poverty _ but we had the hope that we could do something to
change it. The assassination of John Kennedy was a terrible blow.
When Richard Nixon came to power he did end the war in Vietnam, but
his administration was the death of hope. It wasn't a physical
defeat but an emotional defeat for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is still good work being done, but it is done to
keep a career going. Thirty years ago people wanted to get careers
going, too, but we also wanted to change society and there was a
tone to what we did. Today, if you say you're an idealist, people
look at you: ``Give me a break.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Mann A co-founder of Circle in the Square  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We started at Circle in the Square in 1951 and in 1972 we moved
to Broadway. We had no intention of making a movement. We were
young people who had gone through World War II and now it was 1950
and there was a period of openness and expression going on. The
beatnik period was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted plays that we liked. We had a passion for theater. We
rarely went to Broadway, because most of the plays were not
memorable or important. We were just fledglings. We didn't have a
philosophical commitment. We'd find a failed play, say Tennessee
Williams, and we would try to do a quality production.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then in 1952 we did ``Summer and Smoke.'' It had had a short
run on Broadway. We hadn't seen that, we just liked the play. We
couldn't get critics to come to our productions. They didn't want
to go away from Broadway. Then, Brooks Atkinson of The New York
Times decided to come. His acknowledgment of the play and the work
by Jose Quintero, Geraldine Page, Lee Richardson and the other
actors made the rest of the critics decide to come. Then the first
big wave of audience arrived.
</P>
<P>
   We felt we were fulfilling a need, that there was an audience
for what we were doing: literate, substantive and realistic plays,
a lot of them about family relationships. We weren't interested in
competing with Broadway. We felt there was an educated audience
that would want to go to the plays that we were doing. We never
fooled ourselves that this was the mass audience. It turned out
that people from all over the country came. There has always been a
hunger in a segment of our society for better quality, and the
hunger is still there on the part of theater artists and the
audience. &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   I came back from the war and so did the three main people
involved in starting The Village Voice: Daniel Wolf, the editor;
Edwin C. Fancher, the publisher, and Norman Mailer, the silent
investor who was silent for about two minutes. The paper began to
get together in the summer of 1955, which was exactly the time that
the Off Broadway theater was beginning to flower. Before this I had
seen a young woman, Julie Bovasso, whose name should not be
forgotten. She had walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and built with
her own fingernails the Tempo Playhouse at 4 St. Mark's Place. She
put on work by Genet, Ionesco. She wrote letters _ a kid _ ``Dear
Genet,'' and did a production of ``The Maids'' that I have never
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Atkinson had already made his expedition down to see
``Summer and Smoke,'' so that gave a boost to Circle in the Square.
Off Broadway was everywhere: churches, cellars, storefronts, all
the places it is today, only it had to be dug out then. This was in
Greenwich Village. The East Village wasn't even called the East
Village then. The Living Theater was on 14th Street and Sixth
Avenue. I called it my cathedral because they put colored gels,
that you use over stage lights, in the windows. They did a play by
an unknown American named Jack Gelber called ``The Connection.'' It
was a famous play about a roomful of junkies waiting for their fix
from a man called Cowboy. It was dismissed by the uptown critics
and I wrote a very warm endorsement in The Village Voice. There was
the Edward Albee phenomenon _ ``The Zoo Story'' _ and what came out
of it. Joe Papp arrived and did Shakespeare. He had Colleen
Dewhurst, Roscoe Lee Browne and J.D. Cannon. Lorraine Hansberry did
``Raisin in the Sun,'' which changed everything for black theater.
It opened all the doors and should never be forgotten for that,
even though it was on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are more companies, productions and theaters now
than there were then. You can't walk on West 27th, 28th, 29th or
30th Streets without passing what look like falling-down buildings
and they all have theaters in them. &QL;

   Mark Russell Executive director of Performance Space 122  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to matter so much to audiences whether it's Off
Off or Off Broadway. They are now used to watching something move
from one side to the other. Along with the Information Age, Off
Broadway is moving very fast. Something can happen at P.S. 122 and
within a year be Off Broadway or, as with John Leguizamo and
``Freak,'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Theater is an antidote to technology. People are going to need
it more and more in the future. Theater is still attracting a lot
of voices that cannot be heard through television or movies. The
struggle of people of color, of gays _ different views of life and
the culture are still being developed first by the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Right now we are seeing a wave of really creative work downtown:
Elevator Repair Service, Dean Street Field of Operations, Richard
Maxwell. Many of them were trained or influenced by the Wooster
Group and Richard Foreman. A lot of European producers are coming
here to shop because they are aware of how strong the American work
is now.
</P>
<P>
   What we have developed are not playwrights but theater makers.
You can't look at American theater for traditional plays and
playwrights. The question now is, how are the regional theaters
going to join this party? Are they going to open up to new
playwrights and not read them to death? Are they going to open up
to these new theater creators? The regionals are facing problems I
can't imagine. One of the things regional theaters have been doing
is embracing a lot of people we call performance artists, like
Danny Hoch, Dael Orlandersmith, Spalding Gray. I think this is a
good sign and is going to grow. It will lead to nontraditional
plays. It will lead to sea changes in how we look at live events.
I'm pretty excited about theater in the next 10 to 20 years.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Derek Anson Jones Director of ``Wit'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My hope for Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway is that they will
be places for experimentation and new ideas in production, setting
and designs, and for plays that take place less often in living
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   With nonprofit companies there is a certain level of hope now
that they can get a production with commercial viability _ that's
the golden ring these days _ but that limits the choice of
material.
</P>
<P>
   I want Off Broadway to be a more fertile ground for more
innovative types of writing. There is so much hype about marquee
productions that take place that they sort of eat up all the
oxygen. Even being aware of what goes on Off Broadway and Off Off
Broadway is difficult, and you have to be an incredibly dedicated
theatergoer to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   I think there is a lot of new work that is being judged by
traditional standards and not being taken on its own terms. There
should be more attention given to grappling with what is new and
unfamiliar. One can experiment and yet bring an audience along.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Theater works at its best when it exploits theatricality rather
than kitchen-sink realism, which film does much better. But in
terms of magical realism, theater always does it better. Why not
support the writers out there who can work in this way? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mia Katigbak Artistic/producing director of the National
Asian-American Theater Company  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough I'm very optimistic about the future of the theater
_ particularly Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway. The National
Asian American Theater Company is 10 years old this season.
Artistically, I feel maybe it takes the world a long time to catch
up in terms of what can be done. For us, the financial risks are
lower _ we don't have any money _ so we figure we might as well
take artistic risks. As a result, people look to us for really
different things. We are not as worried as the commercial theater
about making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true, you want people in the seats. After we did
``Falsettoland'' last year _ a bunch of Asians being New York Jews
_ and its success, we were very encouraged. We have to persevere
because it takes a long time to change people's minds about race
and ethnicity. We are doing ``Othello'' next _ all Asian _ and it
will make people think. Another reason we do these productions is
for people to get beyond the skin. It is very presumptuous perhaps,
but we are trying to change people's minds. We are asking people to
allow themselves to see the world differently. We want to change
people, especially on the subject of racism.
</P>
<P>
   There is a part of me that is scared that the theater is going
to lose future audiences. I try to get colleges to send their
students since the price is low _ $12. I just got a grant to buy a
new hotshot computer and am hoping to get a Web page. Regular
theatergoers who use the Web probably know about us. But it is a
challenge to reach a wider audience. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diane Paulus Co-creator and co-director of ``The Donkey Show: A
Midsummer Night's Disco''  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To my generation of artists _ I'm 33 _ the labels Off Broadway
and Off Off Broadway are less important. What is important is the
work that you create and its meaning in relation to our lives now.
Whether it happens on Broadway or in a little alley downtown is not
that relevant. When I look to the theater as an artist, I don't
look to those definitions as much as I look to where can I go as a
creator and have an exciting new vigorous connection with an
audience? In the case of ``The Donkey Show,'' it is happening in a
nightclub on 21st Street on the far West Side. We get listed in a
variety of categories. I think in the future, theater is going to
pop up in unexpected places, be it nightclubs, the street or a
stadium. Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway were a reaction to
Broadway in their inception 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I want to go outside theater. I am obsessed with the meaning of
ritual that theater has to the culture. Pop music has meaning to
our culture. The '70s disco hits are hymnals, in a way, of their
time. I find theater alive in many different arenas today, not
necessarily in a theater space.
</P>
<P>
   Theater has its roots in ritual. In Greek civilization or Indian
culture it was a significant part of one's life as a citizen. It
had the power of transformation for the individual. You went to the
temple or the amphitheater because you were seeking meaning to your
life. Everybody participated. I am interested in returning theater
to its role as a popular art form. We think if we want theater to
be popular we have to pander to the lowest common denominator. But
look at music _ people are passionate about it.
</P>
<P>
   When we look to the power of theater at the millennium, where
there is television, film and the Internet, we have to give theater
meaning in relation to all these other options for the audience.
I'm very excited about the future. I think of myself as an
entrepreneur as well as an artist. I have trouble with the word
commercial. Here we have ``The Donkey Show.'' It's a commercial
run. To make a show that is a viable business proposition is not
evil. I'm from a generation that doesn't think about government
funding.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote my senior thesis on the Living Theater and always wished
I could have been older in the '60s and '70s. But I've moved
through that nostalgia now and I'm much more interested in the
future and how theater can resume its place in the wider culture.

RENAISSANCE FOR A `LIGHTWEIGHT'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who was the most popular American artist of the century? Norman
Rockwell, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday Evening Post already had a circulation of two
million readers a week when Rockwell first walked through its doors
in 1916. You might say that the magazine was akin to what
television became in terms of general appeal, and Rockwell quickly
rose to be its premier draftsman, doing 322 covers during the next
47 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he illustrated advertisements for Jell-O, Crest and
a slew of other popular products. The New Yorker in 1945 estimated
that Rockwell's Boy Scout calendars were glanced at 1.6 billion
(billion!) times each day. A couple of years before he died in
1978, at 84, 10,000 people turned out for a Rockwell parade in tiny
Stockbridge, Mass., where he lived with his third wife, Molly
Punderson, a retired schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   The parade was an unheard-of tribute to an American artist, but
it was nothing, in sheer numbers, compared with the 200,000 people
a year who pass through the Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally this kind of popularity guarantees contempt from the
art world, which, for more than half a century, despised Rockwell
as a cornball sentimentalist.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you know? Saturday at the High Museum in Atlanta
began a national tour of works by Rockwell that ends up in 2001 at
the Guggenheim in Manhattan. Let's put aside the cynical
observation _ this is Norman Rockwell, after all, no cynicism
allowed _ that a Rockwell show is cunning box office, even better
box office, perhaps, than a show of motorcycles or pictures with
elephant dung attached to the Virgin Mary. Could it be that art
professionals, or a few of them anyway, are coming around to
thinking he's a good artist?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. He is a good artist, on his own terms, every good
artist being good on some terms or other. Besides microscopic
verisimilitude, Rockwell's terms involved squeaky-clean pleasure,
which, more than anything else, made sophisticated art critics and
art historians cringe, because that sort of pleasure, combined with
the simple sentimentality of the work, defied the fundamental credo
of modernism that good art should be difficult if not (better yet)
discomforting.
</P>
<P>
   To the cognoscenti, the almost complete lack of any sorrow or
suffering in Rockwell's pictures was a clear sign that he was a
lightweight. One essay in the show's catalog even argues that
Rockwell's sanitized small-town vision ``simplified unmercifully
and reassured inappropriately'' because it belied the ``noisy,
disorderly, crowded, smelly and dynamic'' realities of urban
America. This is the no pain, no gain philosophy of art history.
</P>
<P>
   American art has got itself into a curious pickle at the end of
the millennium. An artist like Rockwell, who gave millions of
people pleasure, is discounted because he gave millions of people
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasure is OK only if it's clearly subordinated to instruction.
Puritanism being embedded in the national psyche, it has led to the
idea that art ought to be not just good but good for us _ a
ridiculous presumption, if you think about it, because culture is
no more inherently moral than cooking or football, except when it
chooses to be.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's art was actually weakest when, in his later years, he
tried to make himself into a more ``serious'' artist by turning out
``important'' works like ``The Problem We All Live With,'' of Ruby
Bridges, a young black girl, on her way to her newly integrated
school in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is vivid and right-minded but also didactic, and it
signaled, as the critic Dave Hickey has put it, ``the end of
Rockwell's instinctive identification with the citizens he painted
and the beginning of his tenure as a member of the nation's new,
therapeutic, power elite.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning Rockwell's art had a moral undercurrent, of
course, but it was an undercurrent, the work being primarily a
comic form of escapism in a sugary old-fogey mode, no more real
than Poussin's Arcadia or the Andy Griffith show _ ``life as I
would like it to be,'' Rockwell once explained.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to recall that he had a crisis of identity in the
1930s. He went to Paris to look into becoming an abstract artist
until he realized that it wasn't for him and returned after seven
months to New Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint ordinary people in everyday situations, and that's
about all I do,'' he concluded. He continued to have what his son,
Peter, called a ``tortured relationship'' with his art, and he
suffered occasional bouts of depression. But he settled on what
came naturally to him, in spite of the disdain of an art world he
admired, a decision that was admirable on Rockwell's part, not to
mention a wise business move.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, he realized, to be serious about painting and
to take pleasure in illustrations for popular magazines, something
generally regarded as a contradictory position in a culture that,
out of insecurity or mistaken priorities or simple snobbism,
continues to divide a taste for high art from a taste for low art
as if they were mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   But who says people can't like Willem de Kooning
(italics)and(end italics) Norman Rockwell? As a matter of fact,
they liked each other.
</P>
<P>
   Why like Rockwell? One place to look for an answer is on the
cover of the Feb. 13, 1960, issue of the Saturday Evening Post,
containing the first installment of Rockwell's autobiography, for
which he painted a work called ``Triple Self-Portrait.'' He showed
himself peering around his easel into a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A painter painting himself painting himself was nothing new in
art. The distinction of Rockwell's version had to do with the
clever and modest way he conveyed a sense of his own elusive,
faceted personality. The picture, despite the title, presents at
least eight slightly different self-portraits: besides the versions
of him seated, in the mirror, on the canvas and five times in a
drawing pinned to the canvas, there are what you might call
self-portraits in metaphorical form.
</P>
<P>
   The shiny gold American eagle on the mirror's frame is an ideal
symbol for an all-American painter like Rockwell. The smoke from
the trash can may be an allusion to the famous fire (Rockwell
started it by accident) that burned down his studio in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   And the postcards, also tacked to the canvas, are self-portraits
by Durer, Rembrandt, Picasso and van Gogh. Rockwell over the years
nodded to famous painters, the allusions generally being tributes
to people he admired and at the same time subtle declarations of
his own ability to paint as they did.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Connoisseur,'' of a dandy standing in front of a Jackson
Pollock, is a masterpiece of this sort of sly imitation that,
significantly, doesn't make fun of Pollock, as almost all other
popular illustrations of the day did, but leaves us to think for
ourselves about him.
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick, Rockwell also seems to be saying in his ``Triple
Self-Portrait.'' He is each of the people you see in his picture
but none in particular. He is in the end like everyone else, pretty
much, ordinary and complicated at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   He trusted the viewer to decide who he really was, which in a
nutshell was the essence of his work at its best: it was an art of
narrative transparency based on democratic principles, viewing its
audience eyeball-to-eyeball, like a next-door neighbor, not to be
lectured at or condescended to. Rockwell's message was that as long
as an artist doesn't go out of his way to make things difficult and
muck up a situation, people have enough wit to figure out a picture
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   No irony or provocation, no probing at the limits of social
propriety. Just the occasional good-natured poking of fun among
friends. Rockwell even seemed to open up the front of his picture
planes so that viewers were made to feel that they were also
sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner or sidling up to the lunch
counter where the soda jerk was admiring the smiling prom girl's
corsage.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's identification with his audience was the source of
his popularity even more than folksy humor or fool-the-eye realism,
and it remains the basis of his continuing appeal. Could we also
make an argument for him in high art terms? Sure. We could point
out how we admire dead foreign illustrators like Daumier and Jose
Guadalupe Posada and Heinrich Hoffmann-Donner (the children's
illustrator from whom Balthus, among others, copied), but how we
unfairly dismiss Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow Homer's illustrations for Harper's Weekly are taken
seriously because they're by Homer. Why not Rockwell's
illustrations? Museums are full of pictures by old masters like
Hals and Greuze and Boilly that, like Rockwell's pictures, show
everyday scenes. On top of which there is Rockwell's subterranean
complexity: the buried allusions he made to Michelangelo's Isaiah
in the figure of ``Rosie the Riveter'' or to Mondrian's grids in
the window frame of ``Shuffleton's Barbershop.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is actually a silly argument because it misses the real
point about Rockwell and the American imagination. Rockwell gave us
a people's history of America during the first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a history of celebrities and presidents but of Aunt
Ella taking her niece for a ride in a horse-drawn carriage, and of
dad and mom driving grandma and the kids to their summer vacation
in a crowded Packard with the family's green rowboat strapped to
the car, and of a new television antenna being installed on the
gabled roof of an old Victorian house with a church steeple in the
distance _ old religion giving way to new.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell gave to the prosaic facts of a rapidly changing America
an old-fashioned glamour and comforting, self-effacing dignity that
helped, at least a little, to ease the country's passage into the
future. He reminded people that the little things sometimes matter
more than we think, and we could say the same about his pictures.

AN ACTOR AND DIRECTOR WHOSE BOND WAS, WELL, MAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Gilberto Perez teaches film studies at Sarah Lawrence College and
is the author of ``The Material Ghost: Films and Their Medium.''  
 By GILBERTO PEREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The film opens with a man in the spotlight clutching
a microphone. He points at the audience and shouts with ferocity,
``First, cast the beam out of thine own eye, and then the mote from
mine!''
</P>
<P>
   This man is not merely quoting Scripture; he is also speaking as
Jesus Christ himself: ``I am not the Jesus of the official Church,
whom the police, bankers, judges, hangmen, officers, church bosses,
politicians and other powerful people tolerate. I am not your
Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he out of his mind? Is he part of some crazy cult? With the
same ferocity he pushes aside an audience member who climbs onstage
and tries to speak. When another spectator grabs the microphone and
talks about Jesus' tolerance, the man who speaks as Jesus invokes
His anger and furiously walks off.
</P>
<P>
   Then the title of the film comes onto the screen: ``My Best
Fiend _ Klaus Kinski.'' Of course. Kinski is this fierce Jesus.
It's his peculiar brand of intensity bordering on insanity. He
comes back into the spotlight. Again he walks off the stage in
angry response to a spectator, this time hurling not only insults
but the microphone and its stand as he exits.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of performance is this? The anger, the derangement
must have been part of the act, but still it looks awfully real, a
performance gone out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Best Fiend,'' at the Film Forum in Manhattan through Nov.
16, is the German director Werner Herzog's documentary about his
tumultuous, love-hate relationship with Klaus Kinski, the actor who
starred in five of Herzog's feature films. When Kinski published
his autobiography, ``Kinski: I Need Love'' (``Kinski Uncut'' in the
English translation) just before his death in 1991, he wrote
disparagingly of Herzog: ``I've never in my life met anybody so
dull, humorless, up-tight, inhibited, mindless, depressing, boring
and swaggering.'' Now, with ``My Best Fiend,'' Herzog has a chance
to set the record straight, or at least to tell his side of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, though much younger than Kinski, presents himself in the
documentary as a kind of father figure to Kinski's bad boy.
Standing in the German countryside near where the actor used to
live, Herzog holds Kinski's autobiography in his hands and says
Kinski explained that no one would read the book unless he wrote
bad things about the director. According to Herzog, he gave his
consent to his own vilification. He even helped Kinski find
expletives in the dictionary to use against him.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Kinski takes credit for his most famous
screen role as the demented conquistador in Herzog's 1972 film
``Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' _ ``I tell Herzog that Aguirre has to
be crippled because his power must not be contingent on his
appearance'' _ and not just for his performance, but for everything
that is good about the movie. ``Every scene, every angle, every
shot is determined by me,'' Kinski writes, ``and I refuse to do
anything unless I consider it right. So I can at least partly save
the movie from being wrecked by Herzog's lack of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinski is an unreliable narrator; it's part of his persona as a
bad boy. But is Herzog any more reliable? Taking us back to the
Peruvian locations of ``Aguirre'' and sitting by the mountain that
appeared in that film's opening shot, he tells us that Kinski
wanted a picture postcard view of the ruins of Machu Picchu. Then
he shows us that wonderful opening shot. Without any signs of
civilization, we seem to be present at the dawn of creation, and
the invading Spaniards coming down the mountain resemble a parade
of insects foolishly intruding on primeval nature.
</P>
<P>
   The shot is so good, and so characteristic of Herzog at his
best, that just showing it again in ``My Best Fiend'' is a rebuttal
to Kinski's boast.
</P>
<P>
   From a close-up of Kinski as Aguirre, his fiery eyes transfixing
us with a deranged gaze, the film cuts to Herzog in close-up
telling us that Kinski had accused (italics)him(end italics) of
insanity. ``This isn't true, of course,'' he insists. ``I'm quite
sane, clinically sane. I was never, certainly never out of my
senses'' _ not even that time, he says, when ``I seriously planned
to firebomb him in his house'' and ``was prevented only by the
vigilance of his Alsatian shepherd.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier he describes how ``the Indians offered to kill Kinski
for me'' during the shooting of ``Fitzcarraldo'' (1982), another
film they made together in the Peruvian wilderness. ``They would
have killed him undoubtedly if I had wanted it. I at once regretted
that I had held the Indians back from their purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these Indians told him that it wasn't ``that screaming
madman'' Kinski they were scared of. ``They were actually afraid of
me because I was so quiet,'' Herzog says. He goes on about Kinski's
egocentricity, how it was nothing short of egomania, without
appearing to recognize his own. He maintains that Kinski's
expressed love of nature, his sense of the jungle as an erotic
place, was only a pose. Then we see his own mustachioed younger
self expressing his sense of the jungle as obscene, ``overwhelming
and collective murder.'' Was this any less of a pose?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In three of the films Herzog made with Kinski, ``Aguirre,''
``Fitzcarraldo,'' and the lesser-known ``Cobra Verde'' (1988), the
actor embodies the insanity of the colonial enterprise: as Aguirre
the madman in quest of El Dorado, as Fitzcarraldo the opera zealot
driven to build an opera house deep in the Amazon jungle, as Cobra
Verde the slave trader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Herzog doesn't adequately recognize that these Kinski
characters are doubles of himself. In each case, the character's
mad venture into alien territory, his domination of others, are
projects parallel to the director's own.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fitzcarraldo,'' the character crazily has a steamboat
carried across a mountain for the sake of his opera house, just as
the director had actually done for his film _ and everybody, Kinski
included, thought he was crazy to go through with it. If Herzog
would admit to a certain insanity in himself, it would be the
insanity of genius, of the creator, not of the conqueror, not of
the exploiter.
</P>
<P>
   One way ``My Best Fiend'' succeeds as a documentary is by
showing us Kinski's madness off camera _ making us better aware of
the artistry and control that went into his madness on camera. To
see Jason Robards and Mick Jagger in Herzog's first attempt at
``Fitzcarraldo''(before Robards became ill) and then to see Kinski
in the part is to appreciate what an actor he was.
</P>
<P>
   And the documentary shows actor and director as two sides of a
coin: not simply the controlling director and the actor out of
control, but two versions of the same madness, barely under
control. Like the actor, the director makes his madness part of his
act, Herzog the bad boy behind the camera and Kinski the bad boy in
front.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``My Best Fiend,'' Herzog steps in front of the camera.
While in the feature films Herzog the director sets the terms of
credibility, in the documentary he appears for us to judge him.
</P>
<P>
   The settling of scores with the fiend gradually turns into an
elegy for the friend. Eva Mattes, who played opposite Kinski in the
director's 1979 film ``Woyzeck,'' ``is one of the very few women,''
Herzog says, ``who had anything good to say about Kinski.'' But not
the only one: later Claudia Cardinale, who appeared in
``Fitzcarraldo,'' speaks about Kinski with fondness. ``He was very
shy _ very polite, very sweet,'' she says. ``He used to write me
little notes, nice, that I found in my room, just sweet things.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's death is represented with the dying scene of the
vampire he played in Herzog's remake of ``Nosferatu'' (1979).
``Sometimes I want to put my arm around him again,'' Herzog says,
``but I guess I only dream about this because I've seen this in old
footage of the two of us.'' And we see the old film of the director
putting his arm around the actor, the two laughing together. Then
the film cuts back to Kinski as the screaming Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet we belong together,'' Herzog resumes, as the film cuts
once more to scenes of good times. ``I see us back in the jungle
together in a boat. The whole world belongs to us. And then I see
him with a butterfly, softly, delicately. The little creature
doesn't want to leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog claims that Kinski's love of nature was a pose, and yet
he leaves us with this image of the actor posing with a butterfly _
this metaphor of Kinski as a butterfly, this memory of the fiend,
the friend, with a pretty, fluttering creature perched now on his
hand, now on his chin, now on his shoulder, now on his ear. The
film that opened with ferocity closes with affection.

`FITZCARRALDO': DRAGGING IN THE MUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7)  
 (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I want my opera house!'' screams Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald,
known as Fitzcarraldo, from the top of the bell tower in the
Peruvian Amazon town of Iquitos. Toasted as a ``conquistador of the
useless,'' Fitzcarraldo, the rabidly enthusiatic and mostly failed
entrepreneur portrayed with mad nonstop ardor by the wild-eyed,
spike-haired Klaus Kinski, has heard Enrico Caruso perform in
Brazil and is determined to erect a building grand enough to lure
the singer for a gala evening deep in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the money required, Fitzcarraldo proposes harvesting
rubber from a prolific but remote piece of land about the size of
Belgium. In order to transport the product, he procures a
steamboat, but the 32-ton vessel is blocked by rapids and the
Ucayali Falls, so he determines to haul it up a steep hillside and
slide it into another river with freer access.
</P>
<P>
   For labor he enlists Indians who could as easily kill the
interlopers as work with them but who decide to cooperate for
reasons of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In a film of stunning spectacle and furious struggle, boat and
task become centerpieces for two tales of obsession. Every bit as
driven as Fitzcarraldo's efforts to move the craft upward, Herzog's
determination to perform the feat in actuality inspired Les Blank's
documentary ``Burden of Dreams,'' also released in 1982, about the
making of the film. It told of events behind the cameras that were
often more dramatic than the story unfolding in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   In Anchor Bay's new editions of ``Fitzcarraldo,'' Herzog adds
his own commentary and recollections. For example, one day a
woodcutter was bitten by a snake called the chuchupe. Cardiac
arrest would come within minutes. Struck on the foot, the man fired
up a chain saw and cut it off. That in turn upset the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Kinski would start raving because he was now just a
marginal figure,'' Herzog recalls. The actor insisted on being the
center of attention no matter what the diversion. Toward the end,
the Indians offered to kill him. ``And I said, `No, for God's sake,
I still need him for shooting,''' says Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   For months, life and art merged in the mud. In the fictional
film everybody wastes their breath trying to dissuade Fitzcarraldo,
and so it was with Herzog on the set. With the boat mired on the
river bank, Kinski instigated a protest. ``And by this attempt to
talk me out of the film, it was clear that Kinski, the strongest
force that had been with me here, had now also abandoned me,'' the
director comments.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Robards originally had the role but fell ill in the jungle
and couldn't continue. If Kinski, who remained a close associate of
the director (Kinski's version of the making of ``Fitzcarraldo'' is
told in his 1991 autobiography, ``Kinski Uncut''), hadn't taken the
part, Herzog would have played Fitzcarraldo himself.
</P>
<P>
   Though the actor never actually defected, his reticence poisoned
the atmosphere on the set until the day the ropes and winches held
fast and the steamboat began to inch up the hill. Suddenly he and
everybody became a believer in an exploit that, for all the passion
of Kinski's performance, stands as the film's true measure. &QL;

COMING TO GRIPS: GRIFFEY LEAVING MORE THAN HIS TEAM

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phones rang at the Mariners offices, but it was hardly a deluge.
Downtown leaders met to consider possible fallout and emerged with
a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after it was announced that Ken Griffey Jr.
was divorcing himself from the Mariners, the most pressing question
circulating through our city was this:
</P>
<P>
   Will there ever be another pillow fight?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's adult fans seemed to have gotten over the potential
loss of their sporting icon Wednesday, mulling quietly over lunch
or out loud on sports talk radio the possible player bounty a trade
might bring.
</P>
<P>
   However, Griffey's youngest fans, particularly those at Rainier
Vista Boys and Girls Club, remained downright perplexed over the
impending departure of their longtime hero. Griffey has asked to
relocate to an eastern or southern city, close to his Orlando,
Fla., home. After all, their lives and his career have been
practically intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were coming up with different questions,'' Rainier
Vista director Denise Overton said. ``They asked why he would want
to leave Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainier Vista youngsters stand to lose the most in a Griffey
move.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Griffey has hosted a Christmas party at the club
located in the middle of a well-worn housing development in south
Seattle. For three years, he has joined 25 Rainier Vista children
at either Disneyland or Disney World for three days of February
fun, paying for it all. He bought a van for the center in 1993 and
donated baseball award money to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love him a lot,'' Overton said. ``He plays with them.
They even had a pillow fight in the hotel one time. A lot of these
kids won't be able to go see him again.''
</P>
<P>
   All along, Griffey has promised that his relationship with the
Rainier Vista children wouldn't change, even with a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger set is quickly learning what their parents
already have discovered _ in professional sports, nothing is
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is sad,'' said Dr. Ron Smith, a University of
Washington psychology professor who has worked as a performance
consultant with the Houston Astros and Oakland A's. ``Fans better
get used to having their hearts broken. That's the state of the
business now.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Griffey's reason for leaving, to play in a city
closer to his wife and two children in Orlando, helped soften the
blow for adults. Family values always sell.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's emphasis on family also struck home with Seattle
youth. At the Miller Community Center, Precious Harris, 11,
sympathized with Griffey's strong family ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family is more important than baseball,'' she said. ``He wants
to be near his family, and we'll still cheer for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all kids were convinced, however. Dominic Roberts, also 11,
was disappointed that Griffey didn't move his family to Seattle and
remain with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   An outcry over a Griffy departure also was muffled by the fact
the Mariners have posted sub-.500 records the past two years, even
with their beloved slugger in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to face the realities of professional sports right
now, and the athletes have to realize it, too,'' Smith said. ``If
they make these astronomical salaries they're now demanding in the
marketplace, it's going to be difficult to have a successful team.
The monster being created is destroying sports as we've known
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this message is reaching Mariners fans. There was no
outpouring of grief to the team switchboard Wednesday. Emotions
were kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting,'' said Tim Hevly, Mariners media relations
director. ``At the front desk, we figured they would be getting
buried. They got phone calls but no onslaught, just people calling
with questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cummings, owner of the three Sports Den outlets, which
specialize in different souvenir items at each shop, said fans have
been prepared for player exits after hearing the season-long
rhetoric surrounding Griffey and shortstop Alex Rodriguez and their
contractual uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings only has to look at his own books to come to this
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our merchandise has been going down the last year on Ken and
Alex because people thought they were going to leave,'' he said.
``The sale of Griffey stuff hasn't been strong all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Eason, president of Seattle's NAACP chapter, finds it
disturbing that few black pro athletes want to call this place
their home. He says Seattle, with its ever-changing makeup, might
have lost its luster as a liberal enclave for minorities. He even
has spotted a reverse migration of young black professionals in
differing fields returning to southern cities.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Spurs center David Robinson has set roots and
invested $2.5 million in an inner-city project. Seattle has been
the recipient of the occasional Rainier Vista-like gesture, but
nothing on the grand scale of Robinson's generous payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen any athlete dump that kind of money into the
C.D.'' Eason said, referring to the Central District. ``That tells
me the black athlete doesn't feel at home here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Griffey's situation, Eason acknowledges the superstar's
decision could have come without financial or social connotations,
that a gated community in the Florida sun might be highly
preferable to rainy Seattle. Actually, the community leader said he
thinks baseball matters got in the way with Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A factor everyone has overlooked is he may have considered
that by playing for the city of Seattle, the possibility of getting
to the World Series was zero,'' Eason said. ``If that's the case,
it's overwhelming in Atlanta's favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Eason says the days of an athlete sticking with one team are
long gone. Seattle's adult fans seem to realize this, as evidenced
by the tepid Griffey reaction.
</P>
<P>
   He said if they don't know already, the city's youngsters will
catch on quickly as they build future allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got A-Rod and Edgar,'' 12-year-old Jeffrey Harris
said. ``They'll know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though pillow fights might become a thing of the past.

TOUGH LOVE FOR A TOUGH GIRL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Karen Durbin is the film critic for Mirabella magazine.  
 By KAREN DURBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rosetta,'' the artful, gritty Belgian film that won top prize
at Cannes this year, opens with a harrowing scene of a young woman
being chased like a rabbit. The hounds are security guards at the
factory where she has just been told, without explanation, that
she's not getting a job she has been trying out for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going quietly, she abruptly takes off _ deep into the
factory. The guards finally run her to ground in a changing room,
where she has locked herself in, hunched down and gasping,
clutching herself as if to keep anyone from taking the white smock
and shower cap that are her work uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a good worker,'' she cries through the door. ``Everybody
says so.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrage and raw desperation are palpable in her voice. And yet a
terrible comedy bubbles through the scene. Whoever heard of someone
reacting that way to not getting a job? And who hasn't secretly
wanted to?
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, brothers who dazzled critics
everywhere with ``La Promesse'' three years ago, have come back
with an even better film and a tougher one. ``Rosetta,'' which
opened on Friday, had its American premiere last month at the New
York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the movie with the audience afterward, Luc Dardenne
used battle language to describe its heroine, played by Emilie
Dequenne, a newcomer. ``She's at war with the world that won't let
her in,'' he said. ``To her, it's a fortress she's trying to storm.
But she becomes a fortress in the process, and it nearly kills
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they liked Rosetta, the Dardennes looked amazed. ``We
love her,'' Jean-Pierre said. ``We couldn't make a film about her
if we didn't. We can only hope the audience loves her, too, because
if you don't, she cannot live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dardennes don't make it easy. Although the film has been
hailed by some critics for its brilliance and originality, it has
repelled others with its blunt lack of charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian director David Cronenberg, who headed the jury at
the Cannes International Film Festival, called the Dardennes' movie
``a fantastic portrayal of a primal life force _ so unsentimental,
so uncompromising and yet in the end so moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film has such a physical, tactile understanding of this
girl's life. It's beyond desperation, her determination to live and
to survive. Making the character sympathetic is a rule of thumb of
all popular filmmaking. And they didn't do that. She does shocking
things in the movie. Yet by the end you love her; you're so with
her by then.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were in New York, the Dardennes discussed their work
over coffee in their suite at the Rihga Royal Hotel, with their
co-producer, Michele Halberstadt Petin, serving as translator. Luc
Dardenne said that they wanted to make a movie with a female
protagonist, but that the story took off when they hit on the
concept of a lonely, ostracized girl whose lifeline is the belief
that work will provide what she crucially lacks, a rightful place
in the civilized order of things.
</P>
<P>
   Rosetta is an unwilling outsider. She lives in a rundown trailer
camp with her mother (Anne Yernaux), a quiet, solipsistic oblivion
drinker who trades sex for booze and vigorously repels her
daughter's efforts to save her. (There's black humor in this, too.
When Rosetta presses her to go into a drying-out clinic, saying,
``It's the only way out of it,'' her mother, suddenly looking like
a large, obstinate baby, says, ``I don't want out of it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Rosetta seems almost savage in her utter disregard for the most
minimal niceties of human discourse. No s'il vous plaits or mercis
lubricate her speech, and she fights to hang on to any job that
comes her way _ literally fights, and literally hangs on.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Rosetta'' and ``La Promesse'' explore the lives of people
who are twice marginalized, by poverty and lawlessness on one hand
and by their own youth on the other, and who fight that
marginalization.
</P>
<P>
   Igor, the 15-year-old protagonist of ``La Promesse'' _ played by
another neophyte, Jeremie Renier _ is industrious, too, working as
a mechanic's apprentice and putting in long hours helping his
adored and adoring father, a sometimes ruthless trafficker in
illegal immigrant labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie introduces Igor as he filches the wallet of a
woman who has just cashed her pension check, then coolly lies when
she discovers it missing. As he speaks, we see that his teeth are
rotting, a sight that is at once pathetic, informative and
repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   The Dardennes are scrupulous in refusing to court our sympathy
in their films. ``La Promesse'' and ``Rosetta'' feel unblinkingly
tough, even antiromantic. There is no soundtrack music to cue up
our feelings, just the noises of everyday life, including, in
Rosetta's case, the small grunts and gasps that accompany her
ceaseless industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Dequenne's intensely focused performance (which won the
best-actress award at Cannes), Rosetta bristles with anxiety and
determination, barreling her way through the world at a clumsy,
headlong tilt. The Dardennes practically climb on top of her with a
mostly hand-held camera. ``We wanted the audience to have the same
obsessions she does,'' Luc said.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Promesse'' and ``Rosetta'' are convincing when their
protagonists choose, reluctantly and by agonizing degrees, to do
the right thing. The Dardennes' brand of dirty realism is anchored
in a deeply felt, and deeply moral, belief not just in the
potential decency of people, but in the desire of most people to be
decent. Their unsparing, economical films have an optimism that
feels earned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dequenne said at the New York Film Festival that, as
co-directors, the brothers were like ``the same person with four
eyes.'' Indeed, interviewing them was a little like talking to the
same smart, friendly man with two mouths.
</P>
<P>
   The Dardennes answered questions generously, weaving in and out
of each other's responses with the sort of scene-setting and lively
detail that they bring to one of their scripts. International
recognition has come in the middle of their lives _ Luc is 45,
Jean-Pierre 48 _ and well along in a 60-film career as documentary
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   They made two previous fiction films that were released only in
Belgium. It wasn't until ``La Promesse,'' Luc said, ``that we
decided, `Now we're going to do exactly what we want to do, the way
we want to do it.'''

TAX BREAK FOR FILMS STALLED OVER PORN ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A tax credit designed to keep film production
from migrating to Canada might die because of concerns some of the
money could go to the pornography industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat in the Woodland Hills section of
Los Angeles, said the tax credit attached to the House minimum wage
bill is causing discomfort among representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my colleagues would face very, very strong opposition
if a single dollar of this went to the pornography industry,''
Sherman said. ``It would kill the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to such a tax credit hits the San Fernando Valley
suburbs of Los Angeles twice as hard. Not only is the Valley a hub
for independent film production, but the Valley doubles as the
nation's porn production headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, removed a provision Wednesday from his version of
the minimum wage bill that would have given a tax break to
small-film producers, citing the possibility that the credits could
be given to pornography producers.
</P>
<P>
   Film industry representatives said Archer was simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a misstatement to say it would help the adult
film industry; that's just not true,'' said Chuck Warn, spokesman
for the Directors Guild of America. ``What we're trying to do is
stop the runaway production of mainstream film and television.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision would have given producers and employees of
independent films with budgets under $10 million a credit for 20
percent of the first $20,000 in salary.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Douglas, executive director of the Free Speech
Coalition, an adult film industry group, said the industry wasn't
interested in the tax credit anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practical reality is the adult side of the industry would
not have qualified, nor would they have sought the tax credit,''
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, however, said pornography cannot be excluded from
qualifying under the guidelines proposed in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The provision is the latest skirmish in the battle between
Canada and the United States over what Hollywood terms runaway
production _ the exodus of hundreds of millions of dollars in film
and television production to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials contend Canada is trying to steal the film
industry using unfair tax credits while Canada maintains it is
simply engaging in economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman suggested that since the portion of the film industry
most affected by runaway production to Canada is the
made-for-television sector, the tax credit should be limited to
that type of production. Sherman said that would decrease the
likelihood that any tax breaks would go to adult film producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to forego the opportunity to save the
movie-of-the-week business just because I can't save everything.
Let's see what we can do to save some of the jobs,'' Sherman said.
``What we want to combat is unfair Canadian tax credits. Our
long-term objective here is to convince the Canadians that we're
serious and they should stop trying to steal this industry with
(their) tax credits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rafe Greenleaf, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild,
said the Constitution precludes the government from drawing the
line based on the content of the films. Adult entertainment is,
after all, a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment,
Greenleaf said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult line to draw,'' he said. ``As a union that
supports artists and represents artists, we don't want to do
anything that undermines the freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is that members of Congress are concerned
about getting re-elected, Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a political catastrophe possibly for somebody from
a state that wouldn't understand,'' Sherman said. ``The hit
commercial that could be made against a Nebraska member of
Congress; would you want to be running in a Republican primary in
Nebraska with that on your record?''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas of the Free Speech Coalition chided Congress for putting
re-election concerns above tax breaks for the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates that a minority of the population that is
phobic about adult entertainment has such influence that it would
damage a vital portion of the American economy,'' he said.

 UNDATED: do it.'''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The result is an approach to feature filmmaking inflected and
enriched by their documentary experience. Although ``La Promesse''
and ``Rosetta'' are stylistically distinct _ the earlier film is
quieter and more conventionally shot _ they both have a factual
quality, as if the Dardennes were recording rather than creating
their unfolding narratives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned from documentaries is that reality resists
you,'' Jean-Pierre said, ``and so we try to recreate that
resistance. We consider our characters not as creatures born from
our head, but as people we meet. What comes to light are the things
you're interested in from them, but the rest remains in shadow. So
there are a lot of things you don't know about Igor's life, about
his mother, for example, or about Rosetta or her father.''

   This refusal to explain everything we see gives the Dardennes'
movies some of the confounding and suggestive untidiness of life.
Igor's father Roger is tough and amoral; he's willing to let an
injured worker die rather than risk drawing the attention of the
immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not a wholly bad man. He works hard, is quick to repair
the housing he overcharges his illegal tenants for, and loves his
son with an intensity that is touching. At the same time, he
unwittingly teaches Igor the one lesson that may liberate the boy _
that to be amoral is to court chaos and savagery.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary impulse that informs these films adds as well as
subtracts, creating character and incident from a steady
accumulation of eloquent, often mordantly witty details. These
yield the Dardennes' signature _ moments at once so strange and so
right that they resemble nothing else under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In ``La Promesse,'' Igor's growing sexual self-consciousness is
marked by an unforgettable gesture, when he suddenly reaches for
the bottle of white correction fluid he's using to do his father's
paperwork and tries to paint over the cavities in his front teeth.
And in ``Rosetta,'' perhaps the most brilliant bit of gallows humor
in a movie studded with it occurs when Rosetta staggers across the
trailer park lawn, trying to roll a heavy gas cylinder back to
their caravan so she can commit suicide and kill her mother in the
bargain. Nothing comes easily for this girl, not even the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Dardennes set their movies among the invisible of society,
not so much the down and out like Rosetta's mother as those
scrambling for purchase on the lowest rungs of the economy. Igor
and his father live in the same building that houses their illegal
tenants; the object of all their hustling is to fulfill a dream of
owning a decent house of their own.
</P>
<P>
   And watching these films, one is constantly aware of the
ineluctable dictates under which these characters play out their
personal dramas. Rosetta conducts her indefatigable job search
against an ominous backdrop of empty storefronts and soaped-over
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Those storefronts are real. So is the rundown trailer camp the
Dardennes wryly call Grand Canyon (the owner proudly adopted the
name after the movie came out). ``Rosetta'' and ``La Promesse'' are
set in Seraing, the town near Liege where the brothers grew up.
Once a stronghold of coal and steel production, the area is
economically depressed, coping with 20 percent unemployment and a
great influx of immigrants from Russia, Turkey, Greece and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dardennes' understanding of the importance of work, the way
it anchors a life and a sense of worth, is rooted in personal
observation as well. They talked about the pride their uneducated
father took in his rise from a low-level factory job to the head of
the factory's industrial design department.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw what a blow it was 20 years ago, when he was
abruptly fired at the age of 52 in a company restructuring. With an
industriousness worthy of Rosetta and Igor, he quickly rebounded,
forming a government-financed association that runs a shelter for
battered women and a food bank for the hungry. Still, the brothers
said, when he goes off to work in the morning he still asks his
wife, ``Make my factory sandwiches, please.''
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of the three Dardenne documentaries that I've seen
are frankly political _ the general strike of 1960, an underground
newspaper published by factory workers and a series of brief
portraits of Polish immigrants in Belgium. Yet when I asked the
brothers if they considered themselves political filmmakers, they
seemed surprised by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't belong to any party,'' Luc explained. ``We support
causes we find meaningful, like the fight against racism or for the
rights of people who don't have papers. It's what any citizen
should do in a civil society. For example, I went to England to
support the movement to try Pinochet.''
</P>
<P>
   One could wait a long time for a world of such citizens. In the
meantime, the Dardennes make movies about people whose choices are
shaped by an uncivil society. It's the oldest of stories. But
political or not, the Dardennes are artists, and so they make it
new.

A PURIST PLIES HIS TRADE IN THE HEART OF BOHEMIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shepard Sobel has some truly radical notions about
the theater, and if they start getting around, there's going to be
trouble. ``I think the most interesting take on Chekhov is
Chekhov's take,'' he says. ``I'm not going to improve on that. My
basic thing is, trust the playwright and the text.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on there. Who does this guy think he is? . Sobel not only
preaches this wild heresy, he also practices it in his own little
hotbed of classicism, the Pearl Theater Company. And in what
unlikely outpost does this audacious experiment occur but the heart
of the East Village, spiritual home of the avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   The Pearl, with its faithful mountings of Ibsen, Marivaux,
Sophocles and Shakespeare, is as expected a resident of St. Mark's
Place as a spinoff of Le Cirque would be on Coney Island. Other
neighborhood establishments sell nipple rings and T-shirts bedecked
in expletives; the Pearl at Theater 80 (for 80 St. Mark's Place)
hangs out a shingle for Moliere's ``Miser.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, a major New York company might be staging ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' with Stanley and Stella naked in the
bathtub, or a ``King Lear'' set in Bosnia. Ellen Stewart's
legendary La Mama is a five-minute walk; five minutes farther on is
Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theater.
</P>
<P>
   These bastions of bohemianism might as well be on Pluto for all
they have in common with the Pearl. In Sobel's shop, they stick to
the period. Period. There is no space in the Pearl's dressing rooms
for a Shylock in a Nehru jacket or a Hedda Gabler in designer jeans
and a serape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an explorer, not an inventor,'' Sobel insists, sitting in
the bar of his theater with the black-and-white photos of Pearl
productions of Shaw and Strindberg on the walls. For 15 years,
Sobel, as the Pearl's artistic director, has been exploring the
universes conjured by the world's great dramatists. In an innocent
way, he's a rebel in the New York theater world, struggling against
a prevailing tide that says it is the director who gets the last
word with a classic, that the mandate that comes with an old play
is to gut-renovate it, equip it with shiny appliances and sell it
as something new.
</P>
<P>
   Some playgoers might see Sobel's approach as outmoded or even
reactionary; indeed, some of the Pearl's prodigious output _ five
major classics per season _ can seem a bit on the dry side, as was
the case with a twee version of Carlo Goldoni's 18th-century comedy
``Mistress of the Inn,'' retitled ``Mirandolina,'' that ended last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is nothing stuffy or superfluous about the niche the
Pearl fills as an intimate outlet for the presentation of important
works, both famous and obscure, in conditions that allow the
playwright's words to speak louder than the director's conceits.
</P>
<P>
   A few other Off Broadway companies ring in the old; the Jean
Cocteau Repertory Theater, a few streets away on the Bowery, stages
modern classics by the likes of Genet and Pirandello, and the
Classic Stage Company, on East 13th Street, aspires to more stylish
adaptations and revivals, with better-known actors and directors.
(The Roundabout has a similar mission, on Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   But none poke quite so deeply into the nooks and crannies of the
canon as the Pearl. Where else but the Pearl can a theaterphile
regularly sit down to plays by Congreve and Farquhar, Goldsmith and
Scribe?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a rare experience in New York, where there really
isn't a true rep company like it,'' said Arnie Burton, an actor who
spent six seasons at the Pearl. ``I did `Ghosts' and `The Venetian
Twins.' I played Iago, Leontes, Edgar in `King Lear.' The stuff you
get to do is just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, first-rank directors like Declan Donnellan and David
Leveaux regularly return to the classics, albeit with the sort of
stylized productions Sobel would never dream of presenting at the
Pearl. And audiences there are accustomed to seeing 100-, 200- and
500-year-old dramas by the country's foremost theaters, the
National and the Royal Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the United States, where we can be suspicious of
anything that has aged, classical plays _ as distinct from old
musicals _ are generally pushed to the margins. So, yes, the Pearl
is marginal, and yet it may be as crucial to the future of New York
theater as any of the larger companies uptown: it is a caretaker of
the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   You don't go to the Pearl for bravura performances. The acting
is on the whole efficient rather than mesmerizing, and despite
Sobel's devotion to his authors, some of the minor plays are mere
curiosities. But must every play at a subscription theater be a
blockbuster?
</P>
<P>
   The Pearl is about the long haul, the development of an ear for
the language of the theater and the astonishing breadth of the
writers it has produced. You go to the Pearl for an education in
how it all began.
</P>
<P>
   In its modest way, the Pearl has become, like Katz's
Delicatessen, the Strand bookstore or the Chelsea Hotel, another
certifiably quirky New York institution, sticking stubbornly to its
guns, paying little heed to what the rest of the world deems
fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel, in a sense, sets his own fashions, sometimes to the
detriment of his own coffers. Dana Keefer, president of the Pearl's
board of trustees, says that lively discussions erupt at meetings
with Sobel over ``whether to make a more commercial choice in a
play over a less commercial choice.'' One guess as to who is the
advocate for the less.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel's company rarely if ever has actors with names you could
advertise on a marquee, although David Hyde Pierce was with the
troupe in its first season. ``He was David Pierce then,'' Sobel
recalled. The best-known ensemble member at the moment is Joanne
Camp, a Tony nominee for ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and a veteran of
32 Pearl productions, who happens to be married to Sobel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a dearth of high-visibility players does not seem to put a
dent in the Pearl's loyal following. The 160-seat theater has a
record 2,500 subscribers now, and a budget that has risen to $1.1
million this season from $45,000 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that Sobel, 52, has had an extended tenure, for
the discreet charms of the Pearl must grow on you. It wasn't until
I had seen several productions there _ a frisky version of Scribe
and Legouve's 1851 comedy ``When Ladies Battle'' and a tender
staging of ``The Seagull'' stand out in my mind _ that I began to
appreciate what the Pearl tries to do. I became more familiar with
the faces of the dozen actors who typically make up the resident
company, some of whom have been with the Pearl for years, and I
found the sincerity of Sobel's approach surprisingly refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pearl productions have the ineffable quality of real theater on
a shoestring. They often involve clever uses of limited space,
handsome homages to thrift. The place has a homey feel; it's the
kind of playhouse you might happen on during a stroll through a
midsize town in the Cotswolds. You actually may happen on Sobel;
some nights, he is the genial fellow standing by the door who takes
your ticket stub and shows you to your seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the privilege of ownership,'' he explained. ``The only
way I really know how we're doing is if I see how we're affecting
the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   From Day 1 the Pearl has been like a favored relation of
Sobel's; though he can tick off a half-dozen lovely meanings for
the company's moniker, the reality is that he named it after his
mother. Sobel, who was born in Queens, graduated from Hobart
College and got a master's degree in theater from the University of
Florida, after which he was awarded an internship at a theater in
Washington, where he met Ms. Camp. When they came to New York, she
pursued acting jobs while he contemplated producing and directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put two ads in Dramatists' Guild Quarterly,'' he recalled.
``One said, `New producer looking for new plays to produce.' The
other said, `Typist looking for plays to type.''' One ad got
results. ``The first submission came through the typing.''
</P>
<P>
   Classics entered the picture when Sobel was offered a job
running a theater festival in West Virginia, where he staged an
``As You Like It.'' He liked it, and starting thinking about
forming a troupe in Manhattan that would ``feature a classical
repertory and a resident company built on craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouting sites, he got a month-to-month deal in 1984 on a
72-seat playhouse on West 22nd Street, across from where the Irish
Repertory Theater now makes its home. Sobel moved to the grander
digs on St. Mark's a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, audiences materialized. A hunger exists, it
seems, for European plays that remain tucked away in yellowing
anthologies, and the Pearl dared to satisfy it, staging Edwardian
comedies like ``The Mollusc'' or Racine's ``Andromache'' or
Marivaux's ``Fine Art of Finesse.'' (The company also does its
share of ``Macbeths'' and ``Uncle Vanyas.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Intrepid'' is a word that tends to crop up in reviews of the
Pearl when the company is indulging its appetite for minor Ibsen
and hard-to-stage Restoration comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel is attentive to technique; actors are encouraged to take
part in the seminars on voice and text he arranges. One result is
that members of his ensemble can become among the more experienced
classical actors in the city. ``We're not standing up there,
thinking, `I don't know what I'm talking about,''' said Ms. Camp,
who is in the cast of her 33rd production at the Pearl, Ibsen's
``John Gabriel Borkman,'' which begins performances on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Camp was a first-rate Arkadina, admirably imperious and
self-absorbed, in the ``Seagull'' Sobel directed last season. He
normally stages two of the season's offerings and gives the others
to a rotating stable of directors, the recruiting of whom is his
toughest challenge. ``When I call agents,'' he said, ``they'll send
the resumes of directors who don't have a single classical credit
in a list of 30 productions.''
</P>
<P>
   This is worrying to the purist in Sobel. He claims not to be
hostile to theaters that grind the classics down to their own
idiosyncratic specifications, but he clearly also believes that to
fool around with a play's temporal and geographical foundations is
sometimes more than a distortion, it's a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frustrating thing is when we or someone else will do
a classic play and fail the playwright, and people walk out and
say, `That writer is not for me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is intriguing that Sobel feels so deep a responsibility to
the writer, since those whose work he produces are all dead. Even
some of the actors who admire him think this devotion is carried a
bit too far. ``An argument we have a lot is that sometimes his view
of wanting to do what the author intended is too narrow,'' Burton
said. ``I do think people have got to come in with an idea or a
point of view, because the fact is we don't know completely what
Shakespeare had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sobel has in mind certainly makes him sound like a
schoolteacher who goes strictly by the book. You know that if he
did have a classroom, he would assign an awful lot of homework. But
there is real passion and affection behind his rigorous commitment
to the text. He and his classical seasons make a persuasive case
for taking stock of theatrical trends and heading off in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, all this going his own way could boomerang. What if,
dare we utter it, going to plays at the Pearl becomes trendy?

DON'T BUY HYPE BEING SOLD BY GRIFFEY, MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Looking back on it, Mariners ownership should have
used the $100 million-plus that was spent on the new stadium's roof
and put it over the Issaquah home of Ken Griffey Jr., and a nearby
golf course, the start of a Florida-style biosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Because now they have what?
</P>
<P>
   The House That Griffey ...
</P>
<P>
   Used For 2{ Months?
</P>
<P>
   Rented?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Like?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the incandescent career of Griffey was a large
emotional driver that created the new ballpark. But in fancifully
labeling it The House That Griffey Built, after the Yankee Stadium
nickname when Babe Ruth inspired its creation, there was always the
expectation that Griffey would be around for more than one or two
grass stains.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the world's most expensive ballpark wasn't grand
enough to hold him.
</P>
<P>
   A big selling point behind the stadium campaign was the creation
of revenues and atmosphere sufficient to allow the Mariners to
compete with the best clubs for top talent. But it seems now that
the best yard wasn't good enough to keep even one of their home
growns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the $517 million investment, the plotters forgot the
most elementary rule of real estate development: Location,
location, location.
</P>
<P>
   They forgot to build it in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That's the inescapable conclusion _ at least if one accepts the
premise being offered by all sides that Griffey's primary
motivation for telling the Mariners to drop dead was so he could be
closer to his family in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   But what if that premise isn't accepted? Then the door is open
to other theories.
</P>
<P>
   Here's mine:
</P>
<P>
   Griffey left because he was sick and tired of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a revelation, true; but the bet here is it's a lot
closer to the truth than this family-values business.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Griffey should be believed when he says he's
putting family first. He is among the relatively few pro athletes
of his stature who, as far as I know, has no women or babies
outside his marriage and has no interest in the bar or drug scene.
If he goes to the Mets, he will not be hanging this off-season with
Darryl Strawberry in Tampa's red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey comes by his family-first virtue the hard way, a way
most of us can understand: He doesn't want to make the same
mistakes raising his kids that his parents did raising theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Brought up primarily by his mother and grandmother, Griffey was
desperate for a serious relationship with his dad, an itinerant
ballplayer. Without getting into a long riff on child psychology,
Griffey's attempted suicide in 1986 with an overdose of pills is
all any reasonable adult needs to know about a lonely child
desperate for attention.
</P>
<P>
   As best he can, Griffey wants to make sure his kids won't share
his childhood nightmares about an absent dad.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Griffey as a dedicated father makes for a
palatable, even admirable, cover story so that he doesn't have to
discuss the times he felt let down, betrayed and even a fool for
hanging with a traditionally deadbeat outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is hardly without fault in this divorce. His
egocentrism, petulance, pettiness and moodiness have been sources
of aggravation for countless teammates and front-office staffers.
</P>
<P>
   So what is being played out now is a separation, carefully
choreographed on both sides, that will ease the pain of the
children _ Mariners fans _ so they won't blame one side too much.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is eager for all to see, particularly his new fan base,
that his abandonment of Seattle wasn't about money, just geography.
The Mariners are eager for all to see that everything that could be
done, was done, including the removal of Woody Woodward, John Ellis
and a modest payroll, all targets of public contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side wants a repeat of the bitterness and villainy of
the Randy Johnson episode. So the no-fault script calls for polite
thank yous all the way around and wistful shrugs about a romance
gone stale. The public anger, both sides hope, will be directed
toward some faceless evil such as baseball's economics.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln even took politeness to a new
frontier of absurdity when he called Griffey's decision
``courageous.'' My image of courage is more along the lines of
firefighters removing old people from a burning nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Empty courtesy gestures aside, Griffey's 3-year-old move to
Florida was a well-planned step, endorsed by his wife, Melissa, who
even though she is a native, was eager to leave. Griffey made no
secret about wanting his family life made more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that might have complicated his plan was a World
Series appearance. Ownership eliminated that threat by being so
preoccupied with the stadium that back-to-back losing seasons
destroyed whatever credibility the organization might have had
going into this fall's negotiations about creating a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership knew Griffey well enough to know that the chance of
keeping him was small. That helps explain why the stadium was built
at such a ridiculously expensive pace.
</P>
<P>
   It needed to be up and running before Griffey and Alex Rodriguez
(see tomorrow's paper for his departure news) up and left.
Apparently the strategy was that the delights of the park will help
mitigate the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the gullibility of the sports public, they just
might be right.
</P>
<P>
   None of this matters for Griffey, because things couldn't have
worked out better. He can leave gracefully, and with a legacy: 13
years with one organization, 11 in the majors, helping the Mariners
to two division titles, a new stadium, an annual fan base of 3
million-plus, while leaving a passel of individual thrills and
memories unparalleled in contemporary baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He never complained about his contract and even did the club a
favor when he shut up about his dislike of the new park.
</P>
<P>
   So the deed of his departure will be done, shrewdly, with
surprisingly minimal aggravation. Griffey will get out cleanly,
except for a .255 post-All-Star batting average that betrayed his
fading concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, whose publicly funded park was a rousing success,
made all the right PR moves with management shakeups, giant
contract proposals and dramatic cross-country meetings. They even
hired the sharpest guy available, Pat Gillick, to repair the
anticipated damage. By next spring, attention will be on the new
faces and a full year in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while this elaborate ritual of butt-covering unfolds,
there's an unmistakable feeling that Seattle baseball fans have
been had, big time.
</P>
<P>
   The people who bought the arguments, bought the tickets and paid
for the park will look out into center field next spring and, for
the first time in 11 years, see no Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because of his family's location? Because he was too
costly? Because the stadium was too expensive?
</P>
<P>
   No. Those situations were choices made by the parties involved,
not involuntary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The parties chose these circumstances. The only ones without a
choice are the ones who paid for the opportunity for the parties to
have choices.
</P>
<P>
   What they get is disappointment, betrayal and butt-covering.
What they get is had.

 Steven Drukman is writing a history of American avant-garde
theater.  
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How does a nonprofit Off Broadway company measure its
success? In the case of the Atlantic Theater Company, the answer
may go back to the Stoics. ``We measure what we do against our
larger guiding principles,'' says the group's artistic director,
Neil Pepe. ``We talk about the Stoics believing in `Do your job.
Treat the endeavor with respect.' These principles are what we
return to, even after all our recent perceived major successes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Hinckle, the Atlantic's managing director, nods
fervently: ``It's about serving this larger purpose. That's the
Atlantic idea.''
</P>
<P>
   While most theater troupes have the vaguest of mission
statements, the Atlantic Theater Company has what its members refer
to, without irony, as a philosophy. This credo _ mixing the Greeks
and the myth-based writings of Joseph Campbell with Konstantin
Stanislavsky's principles on acting _ was handed down in 1985 by
one of the company's founders, David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   ``David wrote a letter to the company after its first
production,'' said Pepe, who joined the group in 1987. ``He said
that a good actor sticks to his objective, no matter what. Emotion
comes, sure, but it's a byproduct of the larger action. It's all
about serving the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking over bowls of frothy latte in a Chelsea restaurant,
Pepe, 36, and Ms. Hinckle, 32, displayed a knack for finishing each
other's sentences _ a relic, perhaps, of ensemble training. Pepe
went on: ``We've extended this acting technique to how we comport
ourselves in business, choose a season, everything. It's a
variation on `Ask not what your country can do for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy seems to be working for an ensemble that began
when, according to the actor William H. Macy, an Atlantic
co-founder: ``Mamet said to these former NYU students in 1985, `I
have not-for-profit status and I have a name _ the Atlantic. Now go
form a company!'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the ensemble, which now numbers 34 members, has
acquired what other Off Broadway companies can only dream about.
They have a home: a 130-year-old Gothic Revival-style historic
landmark building in Chelsea, housing a 182-seat theater. (The
landlord is St. Peter's Episcopal Church, to which the company pays
rent.) They have star power: a number of today's name actors are
company members, including Camryn Manheim, Giancarlo Esposito,
Kristen Johnston and Macy.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they now have a Broadway transfer behind them.
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' a production that earned four Tony
Awards, moved from their Chelsea space to the Walter Kerr Theater
in April 1998 on the strength of box office receipts and rave
reviews. ``Beauty Queen'' was, in every significant way, a transfer
of the director Garry Hynes's original staging of the Druid Theater
production in Ireland and England, using no Atlantic actors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pepe is aware of the pressure that comes from having
theatergoers associate the name Atlantic with the Broadway hit.
``Suddenly, there was this perception that we went to a new
level,'' Pepe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic has dedicated this season, its 15th, to the plays
of Mamet. ``It seemed an appropriate way to celebrate our
organization,'' Ms. Hinckle said. ``Many company members began by
doing his one-acts.'' Currently in production, through Nov. 20, are
a pair of lesser-known works: ``The Water Engine,'' a gritty tale
of corruption set in the 1930s, and a curtain raiser, ``Mr.
Happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Atlantic will present two one-acts by Mamet,
``Sexual Perversity in Chicago'' and ``The Duck Variations.''
``American Buffalo'' opens in March, directed by Pepe and starring
Macy, after a run at the Donmar Warehouse theater in London.
</P>
<P>
   Macy, an actor best known for the 1996 film ``Fargo,'' described
the Atlantic's philosophy: ``It is an extension of the acting
technique Mamet received in the 1970s. It doesn't matter what you
say, or how you feel; it's what you (italics)do.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   But while the philosophy began as an acting technique, Macy is
aware of its implication in the world of ethics. ``You can't act
words, and you can't act emotions, you can only act actions. And
you'll see that idea in Mamet's plays, too. In the end, that's how
we are judged.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the Atlantic has experienced a growth spurt in
the last five years. Box office revenue increased to a whopping
$645,000 in the 1997-98 season from $106,000 in 1994-95. Yet the
company has chosen not to build a traditional subscription base,
``in order to keep taking risks,'' Pepe said. Instead, it charges
$30 for annual memberships, which allow members to buy $15 tickets
to the season's shows _ nonmember ticket prices generally run
between $35 and $45 _ and gives them the chance to renew early for
the following season at $20.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Beauty Queen'' in 1997-98, that season included
another critical success, Jez Butterworth's ``Mojo,'' and the
revival of Kaufman and Hart's ``Once in a Lifetime.'' During that
same period, the Atlantic embarked on a 10-year lease of the former
administrative offices of the Manhattan Theater Club on nearby 16th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   This 13,000-square-foot building now houses the company's acting
school, affiliated with New York University, as well as a 70-seat
black-box theater for a new reading series and rehearsals. The
annual operating budget is $2.8 million, split evenly between the
theater and school.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic has also formed two partnerships with film
production companies: a ``first-look'' contract with Robert De
Niro's Tribeca Films, and a deal with Mosaic Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe is aware of the perils of unchecked growth. ``We model
ourselves on the Moscow Art Theater, or, for a more recent example,
on Steppenwolf,'' he said, referring to the Chicago ensemble
company that has also produced its share of stars, including John
Malkovich, Laurie Metcalf and Gary Sinise. ``The trick is to grow
and not become too sacred about what we (italics)were.(end italics)
But as we get more attention and more critical success, remember to
look back to our guiding principles.'' (In true ensemble spirit,
the position of artistic director _ which Pepe has held since 1992
_ is voted on every year.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a constant recycling of energy, Ms. Hinckle noted.
``Not only does our school prepare current students to perhaps be
future Atlantic members, but the so-called stars keep coming back
to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Macy directed Quincy Long's play ``The Joy of Going
Somewhere Definite'' in 1997 and Tom Donaghy's play ``Down the
Shore'' in 1993, as well as Mamet's adaptation of ``The Three
Sisters'' in 1991. Mamet returned to direct J.B. Priestley's
``Dangerous Corner'' for the Atlantic's 1995-96 season. ( Mamet,
who is busy directing the film of his screenplay ``State and Main''
outside Boston, about the making of a big Hollywood movie in a
small Vermont town, declined to be interviewed for this article.)
</P>
<P>
   Macy, who plays a character in the film, spoke by telephone
during a shooting break about the company's founding. ``Mamet
taught a class at NYU and invited some students to accompany him to
Vermont in the summer of 1983. I taught them the next summer, and
then they followed me to Chicago to intern on a production I was
doing at the Goodman Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, several of the students collaborated on a
book, attempting to codify the acting method they were learning.
The result was published in 1986 as ``A Practical Handbook for the
Actor,'' the primer of performance technique that is still assigned
to classes at the Atlantic Theater Company Acting School.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Atlantic moved from Chicago to New York. In
1991, the troupe took up residence at 336 West 20th Street, and it
has gone on to establish itself, according to Macy, as a testing
ground for some favored playwrights. (In addition to Donaghy and
Long, the Atlantic has produced several plays by Howard Korder and
Peter Hedges.)
</P>
<P>
   Over 15 years, the company has had its expected share of hits
and misses. Pepe mentions two productions _ the 1988 ``Boys' Life''
and the 1993 Obie Award-winning play ``The Lights,'' both by Korder
_ as high-profile audience builders because they were both
presented at Lincoln Center. (``Boys' Life'' moved from a summer
production in Vermont to Lincoln Center before the company had a
permanent theater and, Pepe said, the large cast and expensive
design of ``The Lights'' would not have fit as well at the
Atlantic's own home.)
</P>
<P>
   But it is the acting school, another anomaly among Off Broadway
companies, that Pepe and Ms. Hinckle believe will ensure the
company's legacy. Of their 250 students, about half are NYU
undergraduates who train for three years in Practical Aesthetics
(the name given by Mamet and Macy to their technique) while
receiving degrees. Others take classes part time or study full
time, unaffiliated with NYU, for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the current company are graduates of the
program, and several have been instructors from the school's
beginning. The Atlantic has also opened schools in Los Angeles and
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a perceived lack of preparedness on the part of acting
students that prompted Mamet's 1997 book, ``True and False: Heresy
and Common Sense for the Actor.'' In it, he writes: ``Most teachers
of acting are frauds, and their schools offer nothing other than
the right to consider oneself a part of the theater. Students, of
course, do need a place to develop. That place is on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``True and False'' strikes the average reader as very different
from the pared- down how-to approach of the 1986 ``Practical
Handbook.'' This difference raises the question: Does Mamet still
approve of the acting technique passed on by this new generation of
Atlantic instructors, now that it has, in both Pepe's and Ms.
Hinckle's word, ``evolved''?
</P>
<P>
   Mary McCann, who from 1985 to 1986 was the company's first
artistic director and has been the executive director of its school
since 1990, said: ``Mamet says in the book, `Leave your acting
schools, don't go back,' and then he teaches here! He said that to
us when we were at NYU. And that was how we started the Atlantic.
We said, `We have nowhere else to go,' and he said, `Well, I have
nothing left to teach you.'''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the charge that Practical Aesthetics promotes a
certain performance style, maybe best suited for the plays of
Mamet? ``Perhaps there is an `Atlantic style,''' Macy said. ``But
in the best of all worlds there isn't one. The philosophy or
technique is aimed at bringing the truth of the play to the stage,
and that should include any era or any playwright. There is an
economy in the style of acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. In his review in The New York Times of the
Atlantic's current production of ``The Water Engine,'' Ben Brantley
wrote: ``There is a feeling that the talented actors (many of them
Mamet veterans) are reciting their lines as though they were
reading sheet music.'' He added: ``This may conform to Mamet's own
published theories about acting, which are basically of the
`just-say-the-words' sort.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Lyons, a theater critic for The New York Post, said
in an interview: ``The results of the acting technique can be
tremendous. I like the boldness, the stoicism and the simplicity
that you often see in Mametian acting. It seems to be about power,
desire and focus.'' Still, he noted that ``at times it seems like
they choose plays to serve that technique, and I think the results
are often uneven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the work seems banal, while the acting technique
gives it a false air of neurotic energy. But that's true of any
system, like the Method of the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater,
said he admired the company. ``It is hard to zero in on who or what
they are, though,'' he added. ``If anything, they are most like
Circle Rep used to be, because that was also structured around the
aesthetic of a playwright, in that case Lanford Wilson. But a
Circle Rep play was always identifiable and often thought of as
`lyrical realism.' That doesn't seem to be true about the Atlantic
_ which may say more about the climate of the theater, now that
having such an identifiable aesthetic is no longer necessary or
even desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepe, who, like many Atlantic actors, has appeared in several of
Mamet's films, graduated from Kenyon College in Ohio in 1985. While
parking cars at a Manhattan restaurant, he met a member of the
Atlantic company, Clark Gregg, who invited him to attend a workshop
in Vermont in the summer of 1987. His introduction to the Atlantic
spirit was swift. ``Immediately, I was made technical director on
eight shows _ a crash course in the meaning of the word ensemble,''
he said. ``What I learned is that the Atlantic is one big family.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many ensembles, the Atlantic is an extended family in more
obvious ways. Pepe and Ms. McCann were married in June 1998; Macy
is married to the actress Felicity Huffman, a member of the company
(and currently a regular on the ABC television series ``Sports
Night''); Mamet is married to the actress and company member
Rebecca Pidgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamet has said, `There's no such thing as talent; you just
have to work hard enough,''' . Pepe said. ``I would argue with that
_ but it is what a parent is supposed to say to his family, right?
`I love you all the same.'''

BROADWAY DOESN'T LIVE THERE ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 7) 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For one brief, shining moment, and it really wasn't
much more than that, there flourished on the island of Manhattan a
bold and glittering realm of theaters, or so legend has it. It was
called Broadway, in reference to the arterial avenue that ran
through it. And those who are old enough to remember swear that
there was a time when this neighborhood comprising 40 square blocks
held up the most scintillating of all cultural mirrors to the
urgency, energy and impudence that was New York.
</P>
<P>
   That moment was a matter of two mere decades, give or take a few
years _ that period between world wars when the mind of a new
country was finally catching up with its overgrown body. Drama was
daring, it is said, and still had the power to shock; from New York
stages issued words and ideas that movies weren't yet allowed to
speak; satire was sexy, and it lasted past Saturday night; comedies
of manners were as dry as Prohibition martinis, and Eugene O'Neill,
dragging the American play into the 20th century, was king. Never
mind that the mediocrities far outnumbered the gems; there was
verve and sweep in the abundance of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway,'' teased
the Depression-era hit by Al Dubin and Harry Warren, a song full of
gritty promise and sensuous danger. That sensibility, needless to
say, has nothing to do with the area today, where the hip-hooray
and ballyhoo may continue, but in the synthetic and homogenized
forms made familiar by television and corporate merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-second Street, hymned by Dubin and Warren as the spot
where ``the underworld can meet the elite,'' is now a place where
tourists who spent their last vacation at Disney World can feel
they never left it. As for the theater itself _ struggling to
capture a television audience and mired in ever-escalating
production costs _ well, you know the story. It's mostly animated
cartoons featuring live actors who somehow seem less vivid than
their two-dimensional counterparts. The lullaby of Broadway has
become as narcotic as elevator music, and the name Broadway itself
is like that of a fashion house trading on the currency of its
long-dead eponymous designer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what the Broadway theater once represented, an essential
part of the crude, sophisticated and sassy dialogue that made you
feel more alive in Manhattan than anywhere else, still exists, if
you're willing to hunt for it. Symbolic geography, from Imperial
Rome to the Left Bank of Paris, always outlives itself, and what
once was Broadway can now be found in shimmering bits and pieces
throughout the rest of Manhattan. So come along and listen to the
lullaby of SoHo and Union Square and the East Village and Chelsea,
places where live theater lives and plays actually speak to their
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Just when off-Broadway turned into Broadway is a matter of
debate, though there is consensus that the shift began well before
the old Broadway became the Williamsburg of neon it is now. In his
history of 20th-century theater in New York, ``Broadway,'' Brooks
Atkinson, the longtime chief theater critic of The New York Times,
saw the decline of the straight play on Broadway as beginning with
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatist Robert Sherwood lamented in the late 1940s the
``melancholy fact'' that so few new playwrights had ``made any
valid claim on public recognition.'' The organic musical descended
from ``Oklahoma!'' would flourish for another decade before
encountering its own health problems, but by the mid-1950s the
burden of the American drama rested mostly on the shoulders of two
men, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, and by the 1960s even
they were looking spent.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest theatrical energy was by then concentrated in
Greenwich Village, which had been nourishing new voices since at
least a half-century earlier, when the Provincetown Players
introduced Eugene O'Neill to Manhattan. In the 1950s, the Circle in
the Square emerged as a showcase for the blossoming talents of
Geraldine Page and Jose Quintero. They, however, represented the
Midtown theatrical establishment's ability to assimilate young
blood from the outside in periodic, necessary transfusions. In
contrast, what groups like La Mama and the Living Theater, steeped
in the European iconoclasm of Artaud and, later, Grotowski,
represented couldn't be sold on the Great White Way.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Edward Albee is a fable for a theatrical world in
transition. He first gained serious attention, at 32, with the
off-Broadway production of ``The Zoo Story'' in 1960. Two years
later, he was Broadway's fair-haired boy, the designated heir to
Williams, when ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' became a succes
de scandale, a succes d'estime and a big fat hit all at once.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1970s, Albee had been banished from Broadway,
which had lost patience with his mystical indirection and
intellectual conundrums. And when the mainstream Midtown theater
turned its back on Albee, a door slammed shut, firmly and loudly.
</P>
<P>
   A few playwrights of stature _ David Rabe, David Mamet, August
Wilson and Tony Kushner among them _ would force that door open
again, but only briefly and rarely with financially satisfying
results. Mostly, if you wanted to see theater that counted, that
wasn't a special-event import or revival, you went elsewhere. In
1970 and 1971, the Pulitzer Prize for drama went to two
off-Broadway productions: Charles Gordone's ``No Place to Be
Somebody'' and Paul Zindel's ``Effect of Gamma Rays on
Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,'' respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamma Rays,'' a Williamsish memory portrait of a child-warping
mother, wasn't exactly an envelope pusher in the early '70s. No one
in the play got naked or wandered with touchy-feely wantonness
through the audience. Off-Broadway was becoming as much a haven for
the middle classes as for the avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the works most talked about at Park Avenue
cocktail parties were likely to have been seen at the Manhattan
Theater Club, Playwrights Horizons, the Circle Repertory and the
New York Shakespeare Festival, especially when the dynamic Joseph
Papp held the reins. Many of the names associated with those
institutions _ and their styles run from well-made tailoring to
jagged impressionism _ are names to reckon with in American
literature: John Guare, Terrence McNally, Christopher Durang,
Lanford Wilson, Tina Howe, Craig Lucas, A.R. Gurney, Suzan-Lori
Parks and Sam Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of each of these institutional incubators
fluctuates, of course. But the most exciting new American work of
the last decade, with the notable exception of Kushner's ``Angels
in America'' and Mamet's ``Old Neighborhood,'' confirms the idea of
off-Broadway as the first home of serious commercial theater in New
York, with a roster of companies that now embraces the Vineyard
Theater, the New Group, the Manhattan Class Company and New York
Theater Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Vogel's ``How I Learned to Drive,'' Margaret Edson's
``Wit,'' Kenneth Lonergan's ``This Is Our Youth,'' Christopher
Durang's ``Betty's Summer Vacation'' and, significantly, Albee's
``Three Tall Women'': these are all recent off-Broadway productions
of the first rank that have also, in small but specific ways,
broken new ground. Even the freshest new musicals of the same
period have come from off-Broadway: ``Rent,'' of course (which
somehow turned into a bohemian theme park when it moved to
Broadway), ``Bring In da Noise/ Bring In da Funk,'' ``Hedwig and
the Angry Inch'' and this season's joyous ode to the power of
dance, ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stalwarts of the avant-garde like the Wooster Group and Richard
Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theater, whose influence on younger
artists cannot be overestimated, continue to set the gold standard
of wit, polish and imagination in experimental theater. New
companies keep forming, too, in the margins of off-off-Broadway,
built on a rejuvenating passion for the theater, _ from the Drama
Dept., which is filled with performers, directors and writers who
have also known success in commercial realms, to the less
well-known Adobe and Target Margin troupes, which are trying to
create dramatic vocabularies that might engage a younger audience
for whom theater is traditionally the antithesis of cool.
</P>
<P>
   There is a telling contrast between two new shows in New York
that have sought to resurrect the disco-driven hedonism of the late
1970s. On Broadway, there is ``Saturday Night Fever: The Musical,''
a big, expensive production, which comes by way of the Hippodrome
in London and reinvents the 1977 movie of the same title. At the
Club El Flamingo, in the westernmost reaches of Chelsea, there is
``The Donkey Show,'' which comes by way of the Pyramid Club in the
East Village and reimagines ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' in a
Studio 54-like environment.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two productions can be summed up in a
single word: vitality. There's lots of it in ``The Donkey Show,''
which really does conjure the sweaty headiness of the sexual circus
of pre-AIDS Manhattan; there's not a whiff of real life in the
leaden ``Fever,'' which manages to drain even the rhythmic
infectiousness out of the old Bee Gees songs that make up much of
its score.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Camelots, from those chronicled by Mallory and Tennyson
to the idealized portraits of the Kennedy administration, the
Broadway that was is more than slightly mythic. And it's worth
remarking that the theater that thrived there at the turn of the
20th century is largely recalled as garish and empty, emphasizing
technological spectacle, buffoonish humor and wooden stereotypes of
characters. Fans of symmetry will no doubt appreciate the full
circle that Broadway has reached as this century nears its end.

TV AND MOVIE SOUNDSTAGE PROJECT IS DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An ambitious plan to build a television and movie
soundstage complex on top of a Manhattan office building has been
abandoned, becoming the latest in a series of heavily promoted
``Hollywood-on-the Hudson'' proposals to fall apart, city officials
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Announced by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a news conference in July
1998, the complex, called Hudson River Studios, was to have
included five soundstages, among the largest in Manhattan, capable
of transmitting the latest generation of high-definition
technology. The $160 million project was given a greater chance of
success than most other soundstage proposals because its anchor
tenants were to be two long-running soap operas, ``As the World
Turns'' and ``Guiding Light.'' That meant the stages would not have
had to depend entirely on short-term commitments.
</P>
<P>
   But the longtime sponsor of the two programs, Procter &AMP; Gamble
Co. of Cincinnati, has dropped out of its deal with Hudson River
Studios, according to Philip Dixson, the managing director of
Televest daytime programs, the production agency for the soap
manufacturer. ``We're not pursuing that project for the two Procter
&AMP; Gamble shows,'' Dixson said earlier this week. ``We're no longer
involved and have no immediate plans to become re-engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's commitment to Hudson River Studios was the
key reason that United Labor Life Insurance Co., a pension fund
company that makes investments aimed at stimulating job growth, had
agreed to award the complex a $70 million construction loan,
according to a financial source involved with the project who did
not want his name published. Otherwise, Ullico, as the company is
known, shies away from such risky deals, the source said. Ullico
officials and most other people involved in the matter refused to
comment for the record.
</P>
<P>
   The soundstages were intended as a rooftop addition to St.
John's Center, a four-story, 60-year-old building at Houston and
West streets. Originally designed to handle rail freight, the
building is now used for data processing by Merrill Lynch and other
large companies.
</P>
<P>
   The developers of the project had cited the rooftop setting as a
key advantage because it would afford privacy to
entertainment-industry tenants. But the location also may have been
the project's undoing. One key reason the deal fell through is that
Merrill Lynch, which had veto rights, was afraid that highly
sensitive data could be destroyed during construction of the
soundstages, a City Hall official said. Merrill Lynch officials
refused to discuss their operations at the center, but other
sources said the company had not expressed concern until long after
the project was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Hudson River Studios did not return several
telephone calls this week. City officials said there was a chance
that the project could be revived at another city-owned site, on
11th Avenue between 44th and 45th streets, but Dixon said he knew
nothing about such a plan. ``We're not a party to a deal for that
site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Hudson River Studios plan comes only weeks
after the collapse of a deal for actor Robert De Niro and Miramax
Films to build a complex of soundstages at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
In a move that stunned De Niro and his associates, the city signed
a lease for the soundstage project at the Navy Yard with a group
headed by Douglas C. Steiner, a New Jersey developer. The group
includes two entrepreneurs who had signed a contract with the city
in 1998 to develop the site.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, De Niro and Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of
Miramax, toured a 35-acre site in Harrison, N.J., which was once
the home of a pipe factory, at the request of Mayor Raymond J.
McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   The two filmmakers _ who were not accompanied by executives of
Vornado Realty Trust, their development partner for the Brooklyn
Navy Yard proposal _ found the site ``very interesting,'' but were
nowhere near a deal to develop it, said an associate who insisted
on anonymity. The Harrison tour was first reported by The New York
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Another film-industry executive who looked at the site around
two years ago, however, said that although it is across from a PATH
station, it is far from an ideal location for a soundstage complex
because cars would have to travel busy local roads to get to Route
280.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly heavily traveled roadway,'' Peter B. Higgins,
the chairman of the Harrison Redevelopment Authority, acknowledged,
``but the studio traffic would pretty much be off-peak.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This month is an anniversary of sorts: the beginning
of the seventh year I have been covering theater as a regular beat.
Not the least of the discoveries for a man who had been made numb
after decades of total immersion in films: that Off Broadway
(including Off Off Broadway) is not just an alternative New York
theater, but virtually the entire New York theater.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues, of course, have been announcing this for years. Yet
that realization came to me with the kind of shock you're supposed
to experience only while watching a fiery, 12-car pile-up in a $70
million Mel Gibson movie.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway continues to exist, but mostly as a glitzy, very dear
sideshow for attractions of greater scope and grander aspirations
in other neighborhoods. The extent to which Broadway has shriveled,
both as an actual place and as an idealized concept, was made
ruefully apparent to me one evening this spring.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the intermission at a preview performance of ``The
Civil War,'' the pop composer Frank Wildhorn's sincere, quite
commonplace folk oratorio aspiring to become a gold record.
</P>
<P>
   Two men of youngish old age, wearing short-sleeved sport shirts
and khaki trousers, stood on the sidewalk in front of the St. James
Theater, where ``The Civil War'' was occupying the stage on which
``Oklahoma!'' had its Broadway premiere in 1943. It seemed as if
the men might have arrived in one of the yellow school buses that
had been depositing patrons en masse before the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Their expressions were cheerful, nonjudgmental and vacant. ``Oh,
look,'' said one of the fellows, nodding toward the marquees of the
Broadhurst and Shubert across the way, ``there are other theaters
on this street!'' We were on West 44th Street, in the heart of what
is referred to as Broadway, but it might have been Branson, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   If Broadway now depends on strangers who don't know where they
are, it is equally true that Off Broadway is sustained by patrons
who not only know where they are, but also demand something more
than what they can easily expect.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Joseph Papp Public Theater, under the direction of
George C. Wolfe. Even though its recent productions have not been
of consistent quality, the Public's complex of performance spaces,
in what was once the handsome old Astor Library, is still the most
invigorating theatrical crossroads in New York. The Public is a
living organism.
</P>
<P>
   Get there early on any night, have a coffee in the lobby and be
turned on by the enthusiasm and the variety of arriving ticket
holders: white, black, Hispanic and Asian, young, middle-aged and
old, backpacking students and tailored corporate types. It makes
the preperformance crowd in the Vivian Beaumont at Lincoln Center
look as genteel as the guests at a Buckingham Palace garden party.
It also reminds you of what going to the theater was like 50 to 60
years ago: no big deal and possibly a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The notable moments on Broadway in the last six years have been
mostly musical and, of the straight plays that have been
successful, most have been of London origin, exemplified by last
season's ``Iceman Cometh'' and ``Not About Nightingales.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mayer's Roundabout production of ``A View From the
Bridge'' is a memorable exception. Yet when I think of Off
Broadway, notability is only part of the equation, possibly because
the auspices are less formal than on Broadway, and the risk-taking
involves art and mind more than money.
</P>
<P>
   Off Broadway's failures can be whoppers on the scale of the
Public's production of ``Macbeth,'' directed by Wolfe, with Alec
Baldwin and Angela Bassett as a low-rent thane and his wife. Yet no
careers were damaged by the production. Instead, the zest with
which this ``Macbeth'' went down inspired a kind of crazy respect.
</P>
<P>
   One recognizes and responds to the intense, continuing
commitment of a variety of Off Broadway companies that never had
any exact Broadway equivalents: New York Theater Workshop, which
produced Tony Kushner's ``Slavs!'' and hit the jackpot when
``Rent'' transferred to Broadway; the Atlantic Theater Company,
David Mamet's group, which is now beginning an all-Mamet season
with an immaculately staged double bill of ``The Water Engine'' and
``Mr. Happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic has also given us fine productions by other
playwrights, among them Martin McDonagh's ``Beauty Queen of
Leenane'' and Harold Pinter's very funny if bleak comedy ``The
Hothouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the long-running Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater, which
presents the classics as straight as it knows how (they are
currently doing the seminal Jean Genet comedy, ``The Balcony'');
the Classic Stage Company, which persists in deconstructing classic
texts (I particularly remember its dramatization of ``The Scarlet
Letter''), though their productions can provoke furies of
involvement as much as of outrage; and the Wooster Group, for which
postmodernism is the rule, often meaning that banks of video
screens are the props of choice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, Playwrights Horizons, whose current offering, ``James
Joyce's `The Dead,''' a musical play based on the story from ``The
Dubliners,'' prompts a one-word query: ``Why?'' Though the
production appreciates its source material, it is a faded souvenir
of the multilayered Joyce story, which also inspired one of John
Huston's last and greatest films.
</P>
<P>
   Be gentle with Playwrights, however. You have to remember that
last season it was the producer of Christopher Durang's uproarious
and surreal ``Betty's Summer Vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherish, too, the excellent record of Scott Elliott's New Group,
now presenting (at St. Clement's Church) a beautifully acted
production of Dmitry Lipkin's ``Cranes,'' a sardonic comedy about
the problems of assimilation faced by two families of Russian Jews
living near New Orleans. Also pay attention to the consistently
high level of work by the Drama Dept., whose productions have
included superb revivals of ``As Thousands Cheer'' and ``June
Moon'' and a robust deconstruction of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Off Broadway that gave us the recent opportunity to see Uta
Hagen in two successive seasons, first in ``Mrs. Klein,'' then in
``Collected Stories.'' Also to see ``Death Defying Acts,'' the
triple bill by Woody Allen, Elaine May and David Mamet, and Mary
Louise Wilson in ``Full Gallop,'' which originated at the Manhattan
Theater Club, the long-running subscription theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Theater Club has its own particular Off Broadway
identity as the place for patrons who, 50 years ago, would have
belonged to the Theater Guild, a pioneer in subscription-theater
planning. Typical MTC productions may not be especially innovative,
and they are frequently English. But at the same time they are the
kind of substantial plays that Broadway doesn't comfortably
embrace, and the productions are of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Currently on its Stage I: Shelagh Stephenson's ``Experiment With
an Air Pump,'' an English import, a Tom Stoppard-like consideration
of scientific, moral and marital issues in seriously comic terms,
staged by Doug Hughes and performed by its cast with an elegance
once associated with the Theater Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Off and Off Off Broadway? Think Sam Shepard, Everett Quinton,
Terrence McNally, Jon Robin Baitz, the Signature Theater, Tracy
Letts's ``Killer Joe,'' Nicky Silver, Craig Lucas, David Ives's
``All in the Timing,'' and, from some years back, Murray Schisgal's
priceless, noisome farce, ``The Flatulist,'' for which Broadway
will never be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Today's committed playwrights, those who don't see the theater
as just a way of getting into movies or television, who long to
have their works performed on Broadway as were Arthur Miller's and
Tennessee Williams's, are caught in a sentimental time warp. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Broadway is an alien landscape of overmiked theaters, naive,
undermannered audiences and inflated costs. It isn't geared to
welcome the kind of original new work that can flourish Off
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   No one should feel sorry that Margaret Edson's brainy,
transcendentally moving ``Wit'' never made it to Broadway. The MCC
Theater's tiny second floor space, off Broadway, was the ideal
setting in which to introduce New Yorkers to the play and to its
mesmerizing central performance by Kathleen Chalfant. Now playing
at the much larger Union Square Theater, with Judith Light in the
Chalfant role, ``Wit'' is as close to Broadway as is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Off and Off Off Broadway, to survive, must guard that distance
and celebrate it. &UR;  &LR;

FOR GARTH FAGAN, HOME IS WHERE THE FOCUS CLEARS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7)

 Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the choreographer Ronald K. Brown.  
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ On a recent bright, crisp morning, the 12
members of Garth Fagan Dance arrived at company headquarters in
downtown Rochester excited that they would be learning a new Fagan
work later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, ``Woza,'' which can mean ``Come'' in Zulu, set to a
commissioned score by the South African composer Lebo M, will have
its world premiere during the company's two-week engagement at the
Joyce Theater, beginning on Tuesday. The program also includes last
season's hit ``Two Pieces of One: Green,'' set to 16th-century
chants and a jazz composition by Tony Williams, as well as revivals
of ``Postscript Posthumous: Ellington'' (1983) and ``Oatka Trail''
(1979), danced to Dvorak's Cello Concerto in B minor and inspired
by a wilderness refuge near Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Fagan choreographed ``The Lion King'' in 1997, for
which he won a Tony Award, his company has had to share him with
the Disney Corp., the producer of the hugely successful musical.
He's responsible for periodically overseeing every new production.
Currently, two are running in Japan and another opened in London
last month. But now, in preparation for the Joyce season, Fagan was
with the dancers for a while and, crucially for him, he was
spending a few days at home in his handsome old house. Here, in a
quiet residential section of the city, close to his son,
grandchildren and brother, surrounded by art collected on tour
throughout the world and cheered by his parrot and finches, he
dreams up the dances that have thrust him to the forefront of
modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was important to Fagan as an oasis when he settled
here in 1970, after dancing with the Jamaican National Dance
Company and studying in New York with Martha Graham, Pearl Primus,
Alvin Ailey and Jose Limon, and it has become even more so with
time.
</P>
<P>
   Until the success of ``The Lion King,'' he largely supported the
company with income he earned teaching dance at the State
University of New York, at nearby Brockport, where he holds the
title distinguished professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need the solitude,'' the 59-year-old choreographer explains.``I need the greenery. I need the sky. I grew up in Jamaica. I
didn't want the hurly-burly of Manhattan, much as I love that city.
I don't mind fighting for my career, my family, my friends and my
dancers, but I just don't like the inhumanity of not being able to
get a cab in New York because I'm black. It distracts me too much.
It takes away from my focus.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost its entire 30 years of existence, the company has
leased office and rehearsal space in an old-fashioned office
building that once belonged to the Knights of Columbus. Today,
light streams through the stained-glass windows in the spacious,
high-ceilinged rehearsal studio, making the chandeliers sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   In this former ballroom, the dancers gather daily for morning
and evening classes, usually led by the longtime company members
Norwood J. Pennewell or Natalie Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   This morning Pennewell chooses two highly rhythmic CDs, the
Cuban ``Buena Vista Social Club'' and the West African ``L'Annee de
Zouk,'' for the limbering and strengthening exercises that make up
the idiosyncratic Fagan technique. The foundation of his richly
textured choreography, it emphasizes the flexibility of the torso
and isolation of various parts of the body, an inheritance from
Caribbean and African dance.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two hours, the dancers move as one, with no mirrors
in which to check their positions or barres for support. ``This is
how we get the stamina and rhythmic fluency to do Garth's work,''
explains Pennewell.
</P>
<P>
   As they finish, Fagan arrives dressed with customary flair:
baggy black corduroy pants, black shirt, tan leather vest and, for
color, an emerald earring and his grandmother's amber amulet with a
carved Buddha worn on a string around his neck. His baseball cap,
emblazoned Garth Fagan Dance, doesn't interfere with his ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wonderful day we had together yesterday,'' he says,
thanking his dancers. ``We've gotten the broad strokes done.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan takes a chair in the center of the room to get perspective
on his work. ``I asked Lebo M and other South Africans what the
word `come,' meant to them,'' he says. ``They answered so many ways
_ come to me, come along, come over, come celebrate _ it started me
thinking of images for the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-part work begins with a solo for Sharon Skepple, who
won a Bessie Award last year for her performances with the company.
Taking long elegant strides to the center of the room, she
stretches out her arms and lifts her leg high in arabesque, with
every movement imparting longing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the penche arabesque that's been around 300 years,''
says Fagan. ``It's a pure diagonal line and it's contemporary.
Women aren't swans anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Pennewell and Ms. Rogers dance a romantic duet, curling
around each other's bodies in an intricate set of sequences,
defined by eloquent and sensual gestures of opening and closing.
``The solo depicts a lone woman's search for companionship,'' Fagan
explains. ``The duet is about how relationships work best when
partners alternate being in charge and being vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third section, six couples lie on the floor, locked
together head to foot. As if tossed by the sea, they futilely roll
back and forth until finally, with effort, they extricate
themselves. ``It echoes forced journeys,'' he says, ``and how we
can grow no matter how difficult our experiences.'' He closes
``Woza'' with a celebration of these various aspects of the human
condition.
</P>
<P>
   When rehearsal ends, Fagan sets out for home. At the wheel of
his black sports utility vehicle, he points proudly to the
lampposts near his headquarters, where banners proclaim Garth Fagan
Dance part of Rochester's cultural district.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I know,'' he says confidently, ``when I come back
from London next week, the work will lead me.'' Then, momentarily
disconcerted, he adds: ``But I'm terrified that while I'm away I'll
miss the changing of the fall foliage. It's so glorious.''

SENIORS FIND DRUG PRICES HARD TO SWALLOW
</HEADLINE>
 For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Elizabeth Daw has outlived her husband, survived cancer and
toughed it out through 52 radiation treatments. Now the 78-year-old
is terrified because her insurance company no longer pays for her
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need about $150 per month in drugs _ and I don't know what
I'm going to do,'' said the Woodland Hills resident, who lives on a
fixed income. ``I wish President Clinton could have done something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daw's predicament is reflected in a study released Wednesday
that shows prices of prescription drugs seniors use most rose at a
rate four times higher than inflation last year.
</P>
<P>
   And more than a third of seniors on Medicare aren't covered for
outpatient medicine, according to the report, ``Hard to Swallow:
Rising Drug Prices for America's Seniors'' by the nonprofit health
advocacy group Families USA, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that health reform is not a legislative priority, drug
companies are boosting drug prices with no pressure from the
government,'' said Families USA Executive Director Ron Pollack.
``The sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, the report said, prices of the top 50 drugs used by
seniors increased by 6.6 percent in 1998, compared with the 1.6
percent general inflation increase. About 30 percent of seniors
over 65 have heart conditions and half suffer from arthritis,
requiring prescription drugs, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the median net profit for manufacturers of the 50 most
prescribed drugs for seniors was 20 percent in 1998, which is 4.5
times greater than the median net profit of 4.4 percent for all
Fortune 500 companies, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington-based Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America challenged the significance of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although expenditures on prescription medications are
increasing, this growth is primarily due to increased use, not
increased price,'' according to a statement by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the pharmaceutical industry is not pocketing all profit
but will spend about $24 billion _ or 21 percent of its estimated
revenue for 1999 _ on research and development to provide more
effective drugs.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug industry and consumer advocates agree on anything,
it is that the elderly have difficulty paying for drugs and the
government should help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Pollack said. ``Seniors are being priced
out of health care. Some drugs cost two to three times more here
than in other countries, even though they're the same drugs made by
the same companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan by Clinton, seniors could choose to pay $24 a
month, starting in 2002, for a benefit intended to cover half their
prescription-drug costs. Initially, Medicare would pay up to $1,000
a year for medications _ half a $2,000 annual bill. Gradually,
Medicare payments would increase to a maximum of $2,500 in 2008,
when the monthly premium would rise to $44.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is lacking widespread support from Congress,
would be subsidized with roughly 15 percent of the projected
federal budget surplus over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Daw sees that plan as her only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to pay to get the medicine I need,'' she said,
``even if it means going without other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna Kornet, 80, has Medicare and a private plan that costs her
$200 per month, putting a $450 yearly cap on prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' she said. ``I need about $300 a month in
drugs. I just went to my doctor this morning and he prescribed
Propulsid, which will cost about $114 a month alone.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the annual cost of Propulsid,
manufactured by Janssen for gastrointestinal illnesses, went from
$876 in 1994 to $1,171 in 1999. In the same period, the annual
price of K-Dur 20, a potassium replacement, went from $252 to $365
and Imdur, used to clear blood vessels, went from $237 to $525.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take advantage,'' Kornet said. ``If it weren't for the
free samples and other medicines my doctor gives me, I wouldn't be
able to afford the medicine I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Torrez is the senior vice president for long-term care and
government relations at AltaMed Health Services, a nonprofit group
that provides supplemental health services to low-income seniors in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a longstanding problem for many seniors in our
country,'' she said. Seniors on a fixed income can only handle so
much price increases, and if they can't get the preventative
medicine they need, they're only going to get more ill and require
more serious and expensive treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the report, Families USA used data from the
Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly
program, the largest outpatient prescription drug program for
seniors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The report compared changes in suggested wholesale prices for
drugs listed in a widely used industry database with changes in the
Consumer Price Index, the government's inflation yardstick.

ATTORNEYS LINK ACCUSED MURDERER WITH MAN WHO STOPPED TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Is Romel Abufakher, the Overland Park
businessman charged with killing his wife, also the mystery man who
stopped potentially bloody terrorist attacks during the Gulf War
with Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government isn't saying, but Abufakher and his
attorneys are.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get Abufakher's $1 million bond lowered,
attorney Tom Bath has filed information in Johnson County District
Court describing Abufakher's claim of 1991 life-risking exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Included is one government agent's statement to Abufakher's
attorneys that they say confirms he is the individual described on
several U.S. State Department Web sites who was ``essential in
thwarting the planned terror attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the planned attacks succeeded, scores of Americans and
citizens of our coalition partners would have been murdered,'' Brad
Smith, the director of a State Department anti-terrorism program,
is quoted as saying on one government Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Abufakher, a real estate agent, broker and developer, has been
jailed since Sept. 21, charged with first-degree murder in the
shooting death of his wife, Carol Ann Abufakher.
</P>
<P>
   Bath will argue for a lower bond at a hearing scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and other U.S. government agencies would
not confirm Abufakher's claims.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier hearing, District Attorney Paul Morrison opposed
any reduction in bond, in part because of Abufakher's history of
relocating. Earlier, Morrison said his office had not been able to
verify Abufakher's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Abufakher has lived elsewhere in the United States, including
Tampa, Fla. According to court records, Abufakher was a victim in a
domestic battery case filed against his wife two years ago.
Abufakher had been charged in another Florida battery case
involving a teen-age son, court records show. Court records show
both Abufakher and his wife entered probationary programs.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Abufakher was being investigated by the state
attorney general after Linn County, Kan., property owners
complained that he was trying to take their land for $200.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Gulf War details, Bath also has filed information
that he says supports Abufakher's claim that his wife was
accidentally shot and that he had summoned police help several
times previously because she was acting violently and irrationally.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a tape recorder he was carrying in his pocket
captured the sounds of the shooting, including Abufakher's
statement to his wife, ``I'm going to kill you.'' Prosecutors say
that is strong evidence of premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Abufakher, 47, was born in Jordan,
where he attended high school and college. He followed other family
members into the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Bangkok, Thailand, in the late 1980s and was there
in 1990 and 1991 when the Gulf War began. Among the properties he
owned were two houses rented by Iraqi diplomats, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Abufakher said he learned of potential terrorist activity and
notified U.S. officials, who asked him to steal documents and plans
from the houses.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department acknowledges that an individual living in
an ``east Asian'' country provided valuable information at the
start of the Gulf War about pending Iraqi-sponsored attacks.
</P>
<P>
   That east Asian case is referred to on several State Department
Web sites as an example of a success in the department's ``Heroes''
program.
</P>
<P>
   In operation since 1984, Heroes is operated by the department's
diplomatic security service. It provides rewards and relocation to
the United States to tipsters who thwart international terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department, ...MORE
</P>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ ...international terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the State Department, the east Asian informant came
forward with ``alarming information'' about a series of attacks
planned by the Iraqi intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   One attack was 48 hours shy of being carried out and involved
the planned bombing and machine gun assault of airline ticket
counters at a ``major airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site does not address what happened to the alleged
terrorists, other than to say ``they were stopped in their tracks
by U.S. and host nation authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Orrick, another attorney representing Abufakher, said in a
sworn affidavit that she contacted the State Department agent that
Abufakher said he worked with, Mike Posillico. He was a colleague
of Smith, the anti-terrorism program director, who died in January.
</P>
<P>
   Posillico, who could not be reached by The Kansas City Star,
``confirmed that he knew Mr. Abufakher, but could not provide any
direct information due to the nature of his work,'' according to
Orrick's affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Posillico told her that the State Department Web sites contained
information about Abufakher, Orrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agent Posillico told me that I might be interested in looking
under the heading `Operation Desert Storm,' &UR; '' according to the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the east Asian informant is the only one under that
heading.
</P>
<P>
   It is the State Department's ``longstanding policy'' to not
discuss individuals involved in the Heroes program, said Andy
Laine, a spokesman for the diplomatic security service.
</P>
<P>
   In the case referred to on the Web sites, the individual who
thwarted the Iraqi attacks was paid a reward of about $500,000 and
relocated to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Abufakher said in an earlier court hearing that he was in the
United States under a special State Department program.
</P>
<P>
   After being relocated to the United States, his attorneys said,
Abufakher moved to Seattle in 1991 and lived in Tampa before moving
to the Kansas City area by early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
regulations, a handful of special visas are issued each year for
individuals who have provided assistance against terrorists and
must be relocated for their own safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Star has filed a written request with the immigration
service to provide information about Abufakher's immigration status
and when he entered the United States. Officials with the agency
said they were processing the request.
</P>
<P>
   Abufakher's lawyers say that he has business and personal ties
to the Kansas City area and has no intention of leaving the area if
released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   The information also includes letters from friends and business
acquaintances attesting to Abufakher's honesty and nonviolent
character.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is one by Medal of Honor winner Don Ballard, a
business partner who said at an earlier court hearing that he would
go so far as to move in with Abufakher to ensure that he stays in
the area if released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   By coming forward publicly, a person who helped thwart a
terrorist attack could be setting himself up for possible
retribution, said Joseph Goldberg, a terrorism expert at the
National Defense University in Washington, D.C.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Claude Lemieux, the most valuable player
in the Devils' Stanley Cup championship in 1995, is back in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In a trade with the Colorado Avalanche, the Devils reacquired
the 34-year-old right wing and longtime agitator on Wednesday
before rallying for a 3-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens at
Continental Arena on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Brian Rolston, who is 26, was sent to Colorado while
New Jersey acquired the Avalanche's second pick in next year's
draft. If the Devils re-sign Lemieux, who becomes an unrestricted
free agent next summer, they will send the Avalanche a third-round
draft pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The uncharacteristic move by the Devils to reacquire a player
who left after a bitter contract dispute was announced by Lou
Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager, whose
disagreement with Lemieux led to the player's trade after the 1995
cup-winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always put things in perspective,'' Lamoriello said of that
dispute. ``That situation is behind us for a few years now. I spoke
with him and he's delighted to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming back from a two-goal deficit on Wednesday night, the
Devils got goals from Denis Pederson, Petr Sykora and Scott Stevens
to improve their record to 7-4-1. They are in first place in the
Atlantic Division and looking like a solid playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   And Lemieux thrives in the playoffs, where he has 76 career
goals in 198 games. Only Wayne Gretzky has more game-winning goals
in the playoffs than Lemieux, who has helped capture the Stanley
Cup with Montreal (1986), New Jersey (1995) and Colorado (1996),
one of four players to be on three cup-winning teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello refused to admit that his decision to bring back
Lemieux was because of the Devils' failures in the playoffs the
last two years, when they were eliminated in the first round after
finishing as the top team in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, who scored 125 goals in his five seasons in New Jersey,
had 13 goals and 3 assists in the '95 Stanley Cup run. He wanted to
renegotiate his contract in the following weeks, but Lamoriello
traded him to the Islanders, who immediately sent him to Colorado
for Wendell Clark. Lemieux created an impact instantly in Colorado,
leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a conference call on Wednesday night, Lemieux, when
asked whether the Devils were wrong to trade him in 1995, said:
``This trade is not about judging who was right and who was wrong.
Lou and I had a good relationship, but, like in a marriage, there
are disagreements. As you grow older, you realize that you never
say never to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said he decided to bring back Lemieux because he
provided an element lacking in his team. He fell short of saying
the Devils lacked someone to light a spark under the rest of the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the type of player we felt we needed to make our team
better right now, not in the playoffs,'' Lamoriello said. ``We feel
he's the type of player who can come in and create an impact. When
you're able to get a different type player who can complement
others, you do it.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Tennessee Titans have undergone an amazing
metamorphosis.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they were the Oilers, they were notorious for blowing close
games in the regular season and choking on large leads in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday night's game at Miami, Tennessee is 6-1 for the
first time since 1991 and tied with the Dolphins, St. Louis and
Jacksonville for the best record in the NFL. The Titans have beaten
the Rams and Jaguars, so a win over Miami would enable them to
stake a claim as the best team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In their third season in Tennessee and their first as the
Titans, it seems as if the Oilers had plastic surgery and received
heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in new uniforms in the new, palatial Adelphia Coliseum,
which is sold out for every game, the Titans are developing a
reputation as a team that plays with passion, welcomes pressure and
never panics, no matter how hopeless the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Marcus Robertson, a nine-year veteran, has coined
what should be the team's slogan when he says the Titans ``refuse
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of their seven games have been decided by three points or
fewer. The Titans have a 5-1 record in those six games, none of
which was decided until the last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They have pulled out four come-from-behind victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding ways to win instead of finding ways to lose,''
says running back Eddie George, the team's leading rusher, who also
has four touchdown catches. ``We're showing the characteristics of
a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans, who have won 10 consecutive AFC Central games, are
6-1 for the first time since 1991 and one victory from tying the
best eight-game record in franchise history. What makes their
record more impressive is that of the four 6-1 teams, they are the
only one not rated among the top five in rushing or passing on
offense or defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is 14th in offense (326 yards a game), including 25th
in rushing (86) and eighth in passing (240). The Titans are 22nd in
defense (334 yards a game), including 20th against the run (108)
and 24th against the pass (226).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that the bottom line's winning,''
says guard Bruce Matthews, a 17-year veteran. ``We keep finding
ways to win. It's something different every week. If we keep
improving and doing that, I really like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances of what? Making the playoffs for the first time since
1993? The Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, let's just say that we're one of the top
teams,'' Matthews says. ``Historically, I've seen some of our teams
start fast and fade. We can't stop now. We can't afford to take
anything for granted. We really need to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will tell you this: This season's been very gratifying
because it's a collective effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the team's first season in its new stadium and practice
facility. The Titans finally have a home after playing consecutive
seasons at the Astrodome, the Liberty Bowl in Memphis and
Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Titans are winning, fans are supporting them
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 24-21 victory over previously unbeaten St. Louis is
leading to some much-deserved national attention. If they defeat
the Dolphins, the Titans can expect to be barraged by the national
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys think that most people across the league are still
making fun of our uniforms right now,'' says coach Jeff Fisher, who
joined the organization as defensive coordinator in 1994 and
replaced Jack Pardee as head coach 10 games into that season. ``Not
many people expected us to (defeat the Rams), and I'm sure that's
going to be the case again in Miami. The players believe as they
continue to win, there'll be more and more respect for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied with the St. Louis win, because I don't
think we've played our best game yet. One thing I really like about
this team is that somehow, some way, we're going to find a way to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, the Titans made two outstanding moves in
particular. General manager Floyd Reese signed veteran quarterback
Neil O'Donnell to back up Steve McNair. After McNair had back
surgery following the first game, they went 4-1 with O'Donnell as
the starter.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of the draft, Reese selected Florida
defensive end Jevon Kearse. Kearse, known as ``The Freak'' to his
teammates, is pushing Washington cornerback Champ Bailey for the
Defensive Rookie of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse has a team-high four sacks, leads the linemen in tackles
and has such speed and quickness that he forces offensive linemen
into an astonishing number of false-start and holding penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to do things on defense with a player
that doesn't come along very often,'' Fisher says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds veteran receiver Yancey Thigpen: ``I don't think Jevon has
a clue how good he's playing or how good he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse and defensive tackle John Thornton _ the first pair of
rookies to start on the defensive line since 1983 _ have made
defensive coordinator Gregg Williams' job easier. At times against
the Rams, Williams used a formation of three linemen and eight
backs and relentlessly blitzed quarterback Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, McNair and George are still the catalysts. But
Thigpen and 1998 No. 1 pick Kevin Dyson have given the Titans one
of the best pairs of receivers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Before he suffered the back injury, McNair threw three touchdown
passes and ran for another in an opening victory over Cincinnati.
He returned against St. Louis, throwing for two touchdowns and
running for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being out for five weeks was a challenge for me,'' McNair
says. ``I knew I wasn't going to be as sharp as I wanted to be, but
I came in and we ran the plays I felt comfortable with to get me in
a groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, as a team, we're finally getting together. We finally
feel comfortable of where we are. We have what it takes, but we
have to keep it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Matthews: ``I think it's a case of us doing whatever it
takes to keep us moving forward. The first step is to win. Then,
recognition comes. You don't get the extra stuff if you don't
win.''

BERG PULLED FROM LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Aki Berg, whose recent defensive lapses were about the
only negative during the Kings' five-game winning streak, was held
out of Wednesday's game against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   But Kings coach Andy Murray said Berg, who was responsible for
four opposing goals in the past 10 days, would not be sent to
minor-league Long Beach to work out his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with him for a long time today and I want him to know
that we are behind him,'' Murray said. ``At the same time, we need
him to be more consistent and stop making the mistakes that have
been causing the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in October, Murray said Berg had a good training camp and
shouldn't have trouble returning to the NHL after spending a year
playing in his native Finland. After one full season and parts of
two others with the Kings, Berg left the club because he was a
restricted free agent and couldn't reach an agreement on a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the adjustment might have been more difficult than
first expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss a year, that's going to hurt, I don't care who you
are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille agreed. Before the season, Murray asked
Robitaille and captain Rob Blake to help get the new coach's
philosophy across. Murray is big on positive reinforcement and
Robitaille said that is the most important thing for Berg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem with his effort or his skill,'' Robitaille
said of Berg. ``But he is making a big adjustment coming back to
the NHL. It is the best hockey in the world; there is no
substitute. The rinks are bigger over there so there is more
skating, but this is the best. Aki also is playing opposite the
best players on each team every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't doing a lot wrong right now. I think that is why so
much attention is being given to some of the problems Aki is having
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back: Defenseman Jaroslav Modry, who was scratched from the
team's first 14 games, took Berg's place in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Modry appeared to have earned more playing time when he had a
strong training camp. But defenseman Mattias Norstrom was sitting
out in a contract dispute. When Norstrom returned, Modry was out.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, he was teamed with Berg's defensive partner Sean
O'Donnell and played almost 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Murray returns: Second line right winger Glen Murray
returned Wednesday after missing Tuesday's game in Pittsburgh with
a sore left ankle. Murray was struck on the ankle in practice and
underwent X-rays when the pain persisted.
</P>
<P>
   In Murray's place, Vladimir Tsyplakov was impressive and
sometimes dazzling against Pittsburgh. Tsyplakov played early on
Wednesday but was limited to six minutes overall. Murray played 20
minutes and said his ankle was much improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THEY sold it, the majority of us believed it, and now it's time to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Those politicians who opposed Tuesday's arena referendum talked
about wanting a better deal for Houston. They questioned the
proposed location and talked about traffic flow and revenue
streams. They said taxpayer interests were their biggest
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Cry me a revenue stream of tears, guys.
</P>
<P>
   The arena vote wasn't about money. Or us. It was about Leslie
Alexander and Chuck Watson, their bitter feud and all those who for
whatever reason aligned themselves on one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   This vote was about selling the public on heroes and villains.
It was about building an image for one side and tearing down the
image of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the anti-arena faction is happy, but the rest of us
should not be. Even if we couldn't care less about basketball,
hockey, concerts, commencement ceremonies, trade shows or any other
events that could have found a home in the ill-fated arena, this
was about being juked, duped, suckered and hoodwinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt as bad as I did last night,'' said Carroll
Dawson, Rockets executive vice president of basketball, reflecting
the gloomy mood that surrounded the Rockets' practice facility
Wednesday. ``The most depressing thing is the way the public
rejected us. I don't know a lot about politics, but what I saw in
this I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   None of us should.
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means to question voters one way or the other. You
cast your ballot Tuesday. The majority did not approve the deal,
and that's what makes this country great. The people spoke.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the vote, the foreboding reality of it all is
that while so much effort and political clout were dedicated to
supposedly protecting the chump change in one pocket of the
taxpayers, serious dollars were being lifted out of the other.
</P>
<P>
   If the arena vote truly was only about money, then why did this
happen? Voters approved some $387 million in port bonds. They also
approved $119 million in bonds for a new downtown Civil Justice
Center.
</P>
<P>
   While we won't question the importance of those projects, they
will be financed with Harris County property taxes. Our money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the $80 million in hotel and rental-car taxes that would
have funded the arena _ a revenue mechanism that already was in
place and whose funds come mostly from visitors to our city _ was
given a decisive heave-ho.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't anti-arena forces rage so vehemently about our
property-tax increases for the port and court? How did more than
$500 million of our taxes seemingly slip through the cracks, while
$80 million in hotel and rental-car revenues became a heated issue?
</P>
<P>
   Arena opponents did a superb job of casting Alexander and those
affiliated with him as villains _ particularly Mayor Lee Brown and
former Mayor Bob Lanier. They preyed on an us-vs.-them strategy,
partisanship and underlying bitter feelings. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Notice the voting percentages in the suburbs, where a decisive
anti-arena vote was cast. Nowhere in the county was the anti-arena
sentiment stronger than in Kingwood, where nearly 73 percent of the
voters slammed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to remember Kingwood's raging opposition to
Lanier's regime during annexation a few years ago and not know it
was a factor here. Since Lanier sided with Alexander for the arena,
he was the villain again at the polling place Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has not said much about the vote, and the silence that
will come from his office over the next few years will be
deafening. The Rockets are gone, even if no one will come right out
and say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a message to all of us,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said,
preferring not to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Rockets do leave, surely Alexander will be cast
with other notable villains in this city's sports history, most
notably Bud Adams. But who are the real villains? Whose legacies
should be defined by Tuesday's vote? Who made you look one way _
talking about protecting your tax-dollar interests _ while serious
tax dollars were being spent elsewhere on the same ballot with nary
a peep?
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are so many opportunities for the Rockets to
relocate that Alexander would be crazy not to take one of them.
There are New Orleans, St. Louis, Baltimore, Anaheim, San Diego,
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was cast as the lonesome stranger, the villainous
Yankee trying to grab it all, and the strategy worked. But having
heard the message from voters, he won't just sit and take it. The
Rockets are Alexander's business, and he can do with them whatever
he wants. After Tuesday's vote, who could blame him for leaving?
</P>
<P>
   Soon, we won't have the Rockets. But at least we'll be able to
hop on a cruise ship to New Orleans or San Diego and catch a few
games.

CELTICS BEAT WIZARDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two games. Two convincing wins. OK, it's still the Iowa caucuses
of the 1999-2000 NBA season, but how can you not be somewhat
intrigued?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics haven't merely beaten the Raptors and Wizards.
They've stomped them. Wednesday night, in their home opener before
16,082 fans _ well short of a FleetCenter sellout _ the Celtics
bludgeoned Washington, 112-101. They are now, officially, off to
their best start since 1990-91, when they opened 3-0. Time to break
'em up.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, the Celtics had balanced scoring,
this time paced by Vitaly Potapenko, who had 20 after going for 2
the night before. Also increasing his output by 18 was Eric
Williams, who finished with 18 after watching the full 48 in
Toronto. Kenny Anderson (19 points, 10 assists) and Antoine Walker
(19 points) also came up big, as did nerveless rookie Adrian
Griffin (9 points, 8 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the two games,'' coach Rick Pitino said.
``But we're not going to embrace it.'' But he could embrace 51
percent shooting (two straight nights better than 50), 29 assists,
a second straight blowout, and 20 points off turnovers, mostly due
to the vaunted Pitino pressure.
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinly disguised secret to Wednesday night's
success. The Celtics ran, pressed, ran, pressed, ran, and pressed.
And when they didn't do that, they pressed and ran. The Wizards'
starting five is slow, several players are out of shape, and,
Wednesday night, their whole team was out of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a winnable game for us,'' sighed the still-not-there
Mitch Richmond, who led Washington with 20. ``But we had that one
bad stretch and we couldn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. It was bad. It was so bad that if Redskins
owner Daniel Snyder also owned the Wizards, coach Gar Heard might
be looking for work Thursday. As it is, the Celtics can make an
impressive case for their own proprietary rights over Washington;
they've won the last four games by an average margin of 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The critical stretch came in the third quarter. The Celtics had
a 13-point lead clipped to 6 at the break and vowed to come out
strong after intermission. On the court during halftime, Red
Auerbach watched as a banner with his silhouette was raised to the
rafters (it sort of looks like the old ``Alfred Hitchcock Hour''
profile) and asked the fans to get behind Pitino and the team.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Celtics came out and streamrolled Washington, blowing
it open with a 14-0 run in just 2 minutes 20 seconds. The Wizards
were gracious guests at this point, turning it over four times and
missing five shots. The Celtics shot 61 percent in the third
quarter, with Walker collecting 12 points (7 in that 2:20 stretch).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (9 of 15 from the field) got the rout going with a
layup off a Richmond turnover. Ike Austin then tried to throw the
ball into a crowd of about 15 people and Walker snared it before
going coast-to-coast. (He was stupidly fouled from behind on the
play, but missed the freebie.) Walker then followed with a
3-pointer, Griffin followed that with a conventional 3-point play
off an offensive rebound (a simple, hustle play), and Potapenko
(two free throws) and Walker again (another layup) completed the
run.
</P>
<P>
   That was basically the game. There was no way the wizened
Wizards were going to make up that much ground in so little time.
Rod Strickland might as well have missed the plane as he had 9
points and 5 assists. Juwan Howard had 12 points. Austin was a step
behind all night.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' scouting report noted that the Washington starters
are both slow and not in shape, and it was on the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep the pace and keep running,'' Anderson said.
``It's tough to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston led by 22 after three quarters then weathered a mild
Washington uprising in the fourth, as the Wizards got to within 14
with 7:36 to play. Pitino called time and Anderson executed a
textbook pick-and-roll with Pervis Ellison for an easy jumper.
(Both Wizard defenders stayed with Ellison, who was 18 feet from
the basket. You figure it out.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards eventually cut the final margin to what looks like a
reasonable number _ if you weren't at the game.
</P>

RED RAISES ANOTHER BANNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it feel 50 years, Red?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   The warm-and-fuzzy answer would have been no, the years have
just zoomed by. But Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach doesn't do
warm-and-fuzzy. Never has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn right!'' he exploded. ``It's 50 years!''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the time in Boston. Throw in the first four years in
Washington and Tri-Cities and Red has been with the NBA in all 54
years of its existence. What hasn't he seen and heard? What doesn't
he know?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now here's something I'm not sure I ever told you,'' cooed
Bill Russell. ``I didn't want to come to Boston. I wanted to play
for the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   What? The Lakers? The Tinseltown/La-La-Land Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   Uh, no, not them. The Iceberg Lakers. The Land of 10,000 Lakes
Lakers. The mighty five-time NBA champion Minneapolis Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met George Mikan in high school,'' Russell revealed. ``He
couldn't have been nicer. He said I would become a professional
basketball player, but that I had to play for the Lakers. And
that's what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that never happened. Bill Russell came to Boston _ that
is to say, Red made sure Russell would come to Boston _ and the
greatest star player/coach partnership in American sports history
was forged.
</P>
<P>
   It's officially Red's Year in these here parts, and that
naturally means it's also Russell's Year.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest coach/player duo? Says who? Says anyone who can
read the NBA Guide, that's who. Coach Red and Player Russ only lost
once in 10 tries, and that's when Russ was hurt and you can look it
up.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, brought up the days most provocative
question:``Would either one of you have been as successful without
the other?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have been as successful,'' decided
Russell, ``and I know he wouldn't.'' (Pause for cackle.)
</P>
<P>
   The punch line delivered, Russell got serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand something fundamental,'' he said. ``A
team has two elements. There's a coach and there are the players,
and one's got to be as good as the other. A coach's job is to
create an atmosphere where players can function to their upmost
ability, and nobody was better at that than Red. I could not
imagine a better working relationship than the one we had.''
</P>
<P>
   No coach in NBA history has been better at anything than Red, be
it evaluating talent, motivating talent, scolding talent, soothing
talent, or getting talent to subjugate its inherent selfish
instinct in favor of the greater good. And when he had given all he
had to the coaching game (giving the entire NBA one last shot at
him by announcing his retirement in advance of the 1965-66 season),
he demonstrated to the world that no one was better at putting
together a T-E-A-M from inside an office.
</P>
<P>
   It was, and is, a unique combination of coaching and
administrative skills in the sport of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   No one recognized this faster than the younger Bill Russell, who
didn't need much time to realize he was much better off in Boston
than he ever would have been in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here,'' Russell explained, ``I knew how good I was,
and Red was the only guy who understood. I knew we'd win. It only
took me about three conversations with Red to see that he and I had
the same agenda. I realized right away that Red was a great coach
and administrator.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 43 years ago. This means the two have been friends and
mutual admirers for more than four decades, and the friendship is
taking on a new meaning in Year 44 now that Russell has renewed his
allegiance to his old team in a meaningful way. He signed on to be
an adviser during training camp and he now seems to be a regular
presence. He and his old coach were a duo Wednesday afternoon in
front of a media gathering and they were a duo Wednesday evening
before a FleetCenter Opening Night crowd as Russell first addressed
the fans prior to tap-off (``I've had numerous conversations with
Rick Pitino and he knows what Celtic Pride means'') and then
assisted Red's daughter Nancy in hoisting a banner saluting her
father's 50 years with the team (a spiffy silhouette of Red and
Cigar, with the words ``50 Years'') to the Fleet's Rafter Heaven,
where it will reside for the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Red took the occasion to thank owners, old and new (``The late
Walter Brown for bringing me here and Paul Gaston for keeping me
here''), the fans (``an integral part''), and, mostly, the players
who won the games for him, both as a coach and as an administrator.
He also made it clear his life remains wrapped up in one thing _
the Boston Celtics. He has every intention of seeing a 17th banner
raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' he insisted. ``This is no swan
song.''
</P>
<P>
   He has always made it clear he does not care to live in the
past. Just because he's 82 doesn't mean he isn't looking forward to
seeing the next great player, the next great team, and even the
next great basketball moment. He is the embodiment of the Boston
Celtics. Prick him, and green blood will flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new era,'' he proclaimed. ``We've got Rick Pitino
and the boys. They're young, they're aggressive, and let's get
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Red. Forever young. Forever feisty. Forever competitive.
Forever the Ultimate Celtic.

TIE FEELS GOOD TO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Kings didn't fly home after Wednesday night's 1-1
tie with the mighty Detroit Red Wings. They strutted.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady days for a team many thought would be lucky to
get back to the playoffs for just the second time in seven years.
Instead they are undefeated in six games and off to their best
start in 19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you want to win,'' said goalie Stephane Fiset. ``But I
think on a night like this against a team like this, you want to
see if your team comes out to play. We could have said, `Hey, we're
doing fine, we can ease up a little.' I never saw any of that
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second of back-to-back games, the Kings might have been
more impressive than they were in Tuesday's 5-4 victory at
Pittsburgh. The Red Wings are pretty much the same team that won
its second straight Stanley Cup just two years ago. They had had
four days off and were angry after coming off two disappointing
games against lesser opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9-3-3 Kings are no longer a patsy on anyone's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've added a couple of players, but it looks like they're
playing better, more disciplined hockey out there,'' Red Wings
defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom said. ``They look very real to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Real enough to enter the game with five consecutive victories,
the most points in the NHL (20) and a league-leading 49 goals. It's
enough to make Kings first-year coach Andy Murray catch himself
from underplaying the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good trip but not a great trip,'' Andy Murray said.
``What am I saying? We got a point in this building against this
team? It is still early, but the hard work these guys put in is
paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   It also should pay off when they get home. Attendance at the new
Staples Center dipped after the opening-night sellout, but a
capacity crowd is expected Saturday night when the Kings host the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Kings fans will see Ziggy Palffy, the dazzling goal scorer who
until recently hadn't scored many goals since coming over last
summer from the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Palffy got his sixth of the year and third in two
games, with just six seconds remaining in the second period to tie
the score. To that point, the Red Wings, who led on a first-period
power play goal by captain Steve Yzerman, had controlled the game.
But Palffy stole Detroit's momentum just as the teams were headed
to the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   After a turnover by Detroit's Sergei Federov, Palffy took a
breakaway pass from Jozef Stumpel at center ice and skated in on
Detroit goalie Chris Osgood. Palffy, remembering how Osgood had
stopped a breakaway by Kings defenseman Sean O'Donnell in the first
period, faked a slap shot, then fired a wrist shot from an
impossible angle that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in way too far,'' Palffy said. ``I'm not quite sure how
it went in, but watching the other breakaway, I knew he would stop
the slap shot. I mixed it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no scoring after Palffy's goal, there was
plenty of action. The final minutes of regulation were riveting
with each team having a chance to win. The Kings' best opportunity
came with 28 seconds left, even though Detroit was on the power
play with Bryan Smolinski off for hooking.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Murray, who missed Tuesday's game in Pittsburgh with a
bruised left ankle, picked up a loose puck at center ice and had a
clear look at the goal. As he closed in on Osgood, Murray slid the
puck to Brad Chartrand, whose shot hit the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Chartrand, who plays on checking lines when he plays at all,
scored a fancy goal Saturday in Chicago, lifting the puck over the
shoulder of Blackhawks goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. This time he
almost did it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is looking like a goal scorer,'' Murray said with a
well-deserved grin. ``Wouldn't that have been the capper for this
trip.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Home Products and Warner-Lambert said early Thursday
that they had agreed to merge in a deal that would form the world's
largest drug company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, valued at about $70 billion, would combine some of the
world's best-known brands, including Warner-Lambert's Listerine
mouthwash and American Home's Advil painkiller, and two New
Jersey-based companies situated less than 10 miles from each other.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be named AmericanWarner, would be based in
Madison, N.J., the headquarters of American Home Products, and have
a market capitalization of about $140 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of each company met on Wedensday night and approved
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   AmericanWarner would have $23.7 billion in total sales and would
have an enormous presence in consumer brands and agricultural
products as well as prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   With $13.8 billion in worldwide prescription sales,
AmericanWarner would be the biggest company in its industry. Its
nearest competitors _ Novartis, Astra/Zeneca and Merck _ each have
about $11 billion in worldwide sales in a sector so fragmented that
its leaders have single-digit percentile shares of the market,
according to IMS Health, an industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, AmericanWarner would have 5.5 percent of the
world prescription drug market, compared with Astra/Zeneca's 4.2
percent, IMS said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts insist that AmericanWarner's size would be an
advantage. The combined company's research and development expenses
last year totaled $2.5 billion, compared with just $877 million at
Warner-Lambert. By comparison, Merck spent $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely that there will be any significant antitrust
issues with the merger,'' said Viren Mehta of Mehta Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little obvious overlap in the products the two
companies make,'' Mehta added. ``The only noticeable problem is the
sizable gap that would exist between the world's top drug maker and
its nearest competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, the company would be a combination of
equals. Investors in both companies would trade in their stock for
shares in AmericanWarner, which is to be divided evenly between
American Home and Warner-Lambert. The companies would each get 10
members on AmericanWarner's 20-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American Home Products announced two huge mergers _
first with the British drug maker SmithKline Beecham and later with
Monsanto _ that subsequently fell apart, primarily over who would
run the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at American Home and Warner-Lambert have been talking
about a combination for several months, said one person close to
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that American Home officials had approached
Warner-Lambert as early as last year, but Warner-Lambert was not
eager to merge until Lodewijk J.R. de Vink, Warner-Lambert's
chairman, assumed control of the company in May.
</P>
<P>
   Executive egos are unlikely to derail this deal, however. The
companies said that John R. Stafford, the 62-year-old chairman and
chief executive of American Home Products, would become chairman of
AmericanWarner, but only for 18 months. He would then be succeeded
by de Vink, who is to serve as the chief executive of
AmericanWarner. De Vink is 54.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has strong opinions as to how the executive office
should be structured. One person close to the negotiations said
that Stafford had insisted that AmericanWarner have no mandatory
retirement age for its chairman or chief executive, a policy that
is in place now at American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for American Home Products declined to comment on
the management structure.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said on Wednesday that they still expect American Home
to continue its plan to sell its troubled agricultural division,
allowing the newly merged company to concentrate on its core
prescription drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said on Wednesday that they were surprised at how
quickly American Home Products has moved to correct its bad
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from American Home's two ill-fated mergers, the company
had several product calamities, including a $54 million settlement
over its Norplant contraception device and a $3.75 billion payout
to settle claims over the fen-phen diet pill combination.
</P>
<P>
   The product disasters had caused shares of American Home
Products to tumble 45 percent from its 52-week high of $70.25 on
April 13 to $38.50 on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said on Wednesday that American Home executives feared
the company could become prey to hostile competitors, notably
Novartis, which has a sizable agricultural and consumer division,
or Glaxo Wellcome, a company analysts believe is looking for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted giddily to the possibility of an all-American
merger. Shares of American Home Products jumped 11 percent, or
$5.625 on Wednesday, to $56. Warner-Lambert's stock also rose
$5.625, to $83.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe the merger, the discussions of which were
reported on Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal, was necessary. In
the last few years, the pharmaceutical industry has become so
competitive that companies can hardly afford to not have
blockbuster drugs on pharmacy shelves or others in their production
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Though Warner-Lambert has been one of the drug industry's
hottest performers _ routinely reporting quarterly earnings gains
of more than 30 percent _ analysts were concerned that its pipeline
lacked the depth of those of some competitors.
</P>
<P>
   AmericanWarner would have a strong presence in several drug
categories. Sales of Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's cholesterol
reduction drug, should near $5 billion next year, according to
analysts, while American Home Products' Effexor antidepressant line
and Premarin hormone replacement are projected to each top $1
billion in sales in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we like the deal between American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert,'' said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP;
Co., said before the companies announced the merger. ``It's not a
done deal by any means. But it has some positives. Warner-Lambert
is not so dependent on Lipitor and American Home has a good drug
pipeline.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both companies have potential top selling drugs under
development. American Home Products is developing two vaccines _
one for flu and one for pediatric pneumonia _ that analysts project
to notch sales of more than $250 million. Warner-Lambert is
developing a treatment for neuropathic pain that could sell more
than $600 million. All three drugs are expected to be released
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a bounty of new products, the merger is expected to
create $1 billion in synergies, according to people close to the
negotiations. One target may be the two companies' home operations,
which employ some 6,700 people in New Jersey alone.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts could not project how many jobs could be eliminated,
although some duplication could result in virtually all of the new
company's prime businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some analysts were cautious that the deal could
still fall through, others believed it would succeed and pointed to
how well the two companies' chief executives appeared to be getting
along.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has a reputation for being one of the industry's most
aggressive bosses, to the point of throwing the occasional elbow on
the company basketball court, according to a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   But de Vink, while confident, does not need to be in the
limelight, analysts said, making him the perfect executive-office
companion to Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for an outside company to break this
deal up,'' Mehta said. ``Few management teams fit as neatly
together as this one.''

CLIPPERS FALL AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ With strong evidence suggesting Lamar Odom
possesses requisite ingredients for ``The Bomb'' status, Scottie
Pippen decided to see if the kid's already ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it two eras posturing to explode in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Odom is the Clipper rookie who creates more matchup disasters
than anyone this side of Chuck Woolery. Pippen, Michael Jordan's
erstwhile attack mongrel, at age 34 remains the defining model of
small-forward versatility.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Pippen's Portland Trail Blazers (2-0) opened
their home schedule and soothsayer-endorsed run for NBA glory by
wiping out the 0-2 Clips, 121-98, Wednesday in front of a sellout
crowd of 20,584 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For facial-application junkies, Pippen went for 16 points in the
third quarter, finished with 22 and looked fully capable of
enabling the Blazers to make good on a threat to terrorize the
Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who often seems as out of place in Clipper battle dress as
Sinatra in a karaoke bar, had 23 points and 7 rebounds. In
Tuesday's opener vs. Seattle, the youngster had 30 (on 10-of-18
shooting) and 12. Against Pippen and crew, he missed 12 of 17
field-goal attempts. He did fix the 8-of-15 free-throw calamity of
Game 1 by dropping 12 of 14 freebies against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom he collected from facing Pippen could be
immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, you can't help being in awe,'' said Odom of butting
heads with Pippen, who scored six NBA championship rings with the
Chicago Bulls. ``It took me a couple of quarters to figure out it's
just another basketball game''
</P>
<P>
   And what did he figure out about Pippen that can be used for
future skirmishes?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dribbling, keep the ball close to you,'' Odom
said. ``He's so good at reading what you do. He's like a boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Blazers look like legitimate playoff
heavyweights. Of course, they had a similar look for most of last
season, but their cast of characters seemed one disagreement away
from turning into the Donner Party.
</P>
<P>
   Trades seemed to have provided the remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Steve Smith - acquired from Atlanta in a purge that
sent J.R. Rider and Jim Jackson to the Hawks -- matched Pippen's 22
points. That number was 1 fewer than what was provided by hometown
hummingbird point guard Damon Stoudamire, who added nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor had 22 points and 6 rebounds for the Clippers,
with teammate Derek Anderson pitching in with 16.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the ugly numbers:
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper offense, still guilty of lots of shakin' and little
bakin', provided just 15 assists; the equal-opportunity Blazers had
32. Portland also conquered the Clips on the backboards, finishing
with a 41-29 rebounding edge. Clipper Michael Olowokandi followed
Tuesday's 16-rebound effort by checking in with 1 at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper defense - which somehow limited Seattle to
39-percent shooting from the field Tuesday - was used at a
60-percent rate by Portland.
</P>
<P>
   So Coach Chris Ford's post-game, post-mortem must have been a
bloodletting, right?
</P>
<P>
   Take it, Chris:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did some good things out there,'' Ford said. ``We
played a lot better tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Read that as more of an endorsement for the Trail Blazers than
as a rip at the SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put any pressure on Mike, because he's a
friend of mind,'' Ford said of Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, ``but
they're going to be in a position to challenge. The do the little
things that are necessary. They have those hungry veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have a starving rookie who's looking to taste
victory for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about the NBA,'' Odom said, ``is that there are
80 more games.''
</P>
<P>
   An even better thing about the NBA is that only three of those
are against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers were without reserve shooting guard Eric
Piatkowski (sore ribs), who made the trip, but wasn't in uniform.

LAKERS WIN STAPLES OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Change was unmistakable at every glance Wednesday
night as the new-look Lakers and their new coach got cozy in their
plush new downtown arena. Even the championship banners and retired
jerseys hanging high above the Staples Center floor were
fresh-off-the-sewing-machine new.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it was reassuring to the long-faithful Lakers fan that
certain traditions would remain. Little things, like Jack Nicholson
at courtside, Shaquille O'Neal dominating the paint and the Lakers
rolling over the NBA's well-heeled warmup act, the Vancouver
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than usual, but the Lakers did indeed roll,
103-88 before a pleased, if often docile, announced sellout crowd
of 18,997.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Staples Center duly broken in.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal tested the rims with a series of thunderous jams on his
way to a 28-point, 10-rebound night. Glen Rice also warmed to the
shiny surroundings with a 17-point, five-assist, six-rebound
performance to help the Lakers improve to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Phil Jackson's triangle glistened a little more under
Staples' bright lights, and the offense designed to involve
everyone did just that. Rick Fox, 15 points in relief. A.C. Green
and Brian Shaw, 10 points each. Derek Fisher, eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it all came as easy as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were just showing a Hollywood flair for the dramatic,
but the Lakers managed to build more suspense than credibility in
the first half, taking just a one-point lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It took a 13-point third quarter from O'Neal to turn the game
into the rout it should have been. Led by O'Neal, the Lakers opened
the second half with an inspired 15-4 run and entered the fourth
with a 79-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not everything went the way the Lakers envisioned for
their Staples debut. Letting the Grizzlies hang with them in the
first half, for one. And then there was that awkward moment at
halftime, when a still shot of the Great Western Forum on the
center-court video screen got the loudest ovation of the night.
</P>
<P>
   During the many, quieter moments of the first half _ the ones
during which a sneeze at the south end of the arena carried to the
upper reaches of the north end _ the Lakers struggled to hold down
Vancouver's offense, led by Bryant Reeves' 10 points and eight
apiece from Othella Harrington and Michael Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers did almost everything right on offense, shooting
47.1 percent and recording 17 assists as they took an iffy 49-48
lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, showing all sides of his game, scored 14 points in the
half, added nine rebounds and dished out four assists, three to
newest Laker Brian Shaw. After wondering where their bench scoring
would come from, the Lakers found some answers when Shaw scored six
points in 10 minutes and Fox tallied eight in seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And Glen Rice, who emerged from a month-long slump to lead the
Lakers the night before, continued his hot streak. He scored nine
points on 4-of-7 shooting in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I said to my assistant coach, Tex Winter, you know a
hangnail sometimes will keep a shooter from having a good game,''
coach Phil Jackson said. ``And once they get on a roll, sometimes
it's infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got it going and it stayed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice seemed to find his shot on his own Wednesday, whereas the
night before Jackson designed a few plays to get him untracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his shot against Utah (last week, in an
exhibition game),'' he said. ``He knew that he's a better player
than that, and we gave him some indication where we were going to
get him some shots early in the game because we had to have some
scoring from him.''

DUCKS SETTLE FOR TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ When the Mighty Ducks look back on Wednesday's 3-3 tie
with the Philadelphia Flyers before 13,898 at Pond, they will no
doubt bemoan squandering a two-goal lead and the two points that
would come with a win.
</P>
<P>
   But when reality sets in, the Ducks might realize they were
fortunate to get one point on a night when the bigger, more
physical Flyers gradually ground them down as the game progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim managed only seven shots in the second and third
periods, but it scored on three of its five shots in the second and
as a result had enough cushion to hang for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first period, the two teams combined for six
goals in a wild, freewheeling second that concluded with John
LeClair's second tip-in goal of the night with 4.1 seconds
remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks fell behind 1-0 at 1:13 on LeClair's first goal, but
they countered with three goals of their own, including a rare
power-play tally.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne had talked about the Ducks need for a ``garbage
goal'' on the power play and that's just what they got thanks to
Valeri Zelepukin of the Flyers, who tipped Kariya's centering pass
past a stunned John Vanbiesbrouck at 2:15.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers goalie had little chance on the Ducks' second goal at
13:41. Antti Aalto left a drop pass for Fredrik Olausson and the
defenseman used a screen provided by Jim McKenzie and Luke
Richardson to his full advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 3-1 lead at 14:45 when Selanne scored his
seventh of the season from a prone position _ batting the puck
under Richardson after Steve Rucchin's bouncing centering pass
ended up in the crease near Richardson's feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks' lead didn't last long. Anaheim's No.1 line got
caught on a long shift deep in their own zone and after missing
several chances to clear, the Ducks got burned when Eric
Desjardins' 45-footer appeared to bounce off Ruslan Salei and
through Dominic Roussel's pads at 17:14.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Anaheim would take a lead into the second
intermission when Rucchin won a defensive zone faceoff, but Daymond
Langkow and LeClair overpowered two Ducks defenders and LeClair
chipped in his seventh goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's lackluster effort against Phoenix, the Ducks came
out sporting a new attitude and a new look. Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg started Rucchin between Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne for
the first time this year and that trio got the Ducks energized
early on.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim managed just three shots in the first period on Sunday,
but Wednesday they needed only 2{ minutes to reach that mark. The
Ducks would have taken a lead at the four-minute mark if not for a
spectacular save by Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne took a backhand pass from Olausson at the left post and
appeared to have a open net to work with, but somehow Vanbiesbrouck
moved quickly to his right and smothered the original shot and the
rebound. Selanne had another good scoring chance later in the
period when he cut in front of the net only to have his backhander
turned aside.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Anaheim power play, ranked 24th in the league
coming into the game, had a chance to give the Ducks a lead late in
the first period, but they failed to generate a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' power-play unit came into the game ranked third and
it scored shortly after after Jason Marshall was called for
interference early in the second period. LeClair got behind Pavel
Trnka to tip in Mark Recchi's shot from the right
circle. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

LACK OF POWER FORWARD FRUSTRATES LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pamela Anderson Lee was linked to Dennis Rodman
once, just like the Lakers. The actress was considerably closer to
the NBA Wednesday than the flamboyant forward; she had a courtside
seat for the Lakers' 103-88 win over the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman might get even closer to the action than that if Phil
Jackson has any say in who joins him on the Lakers bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been throwing out idle threats of bringing Dennis Rodman
back,'' said Jackson, who coached Rodman in Chicago. ``I'll `fess
up: They are more than idle, but they are threats. If we have to
bring a player back to bolster our team, we're going to have to do
it one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is high on Bison Dele but Dele e-mailed his agent
earlier this week from an island off the coast of Africa to
reiterate that he has no desire to play this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Dele is, it's doubtful he's any less accessible than
the club-hopping, mischief-making, mores-flaunting Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   With a solution like Rodman, who needs problems?
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers are as frail as Robert Horry's confidence at power
forward, it's not Jackson's fault. It's not the Jerrys' fault
either. It says here Kevin McHale is as much to blame for this fine
mess as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   If McHale didn't hate the Lakers so, Jackson wouldn't be
campaigning for a power forward with all the vigor he brought to
the task of delivering his good friend Bill Bradley to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's quite conceivable he'd be out on the campaign
trail with Bradley right now instead of on the tails of Rodman and
Dele and who knows who else.
</P>
<P>
   In January McHale, the former Boston forward now ensconced as
the general manager in Minnesota, quashed a trade that would been a
boon to both teams: Power forward Tom Gugliotta and shooting guard
Anthony Peeler to L.A. for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   McHale's Celtics pride wouldn't allow him to consummate the
deal. So the Lakers went out and lured Rodman out of the casinos
and nightclubs (however temporarily) and shipped Campbell and Jones
to Charlotte for Glen Rice and made a complete mockery of the
truncated season.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Lakers were boxed in by Charles Oakley and
Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor. Oakley shunned the Lakers'
overtures and Baylor rejected a generous offer from West for
Lorenzen Wright because it's wrong to aid and abet the cross-town
rival.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers aren't the only team reluctant to return West's
phone calls. The Lakers, by virtue of their success in the 1980s
and their sustained starpower, are a magnet for resentment. They
are the NBA's answer to Bill Gates or Calista Flockhart. Nobody is
particularly eager to see Gates get richer, Flockhart get thinner
or the Lakers get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' said Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Trading for a power forward who can provide rebounding and clog
the lane and get eight or 10 points and 12 rebounds a game could
take all of Jerry West's guile.
</P>
<P>
   And it's probably going to take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it comes in December or January is of course an issue
for me,'' Jackson said. ``I'd like to see it happen tomorrow. The
reality is the guys that are here are doing the best jobs they can.
We're going to ask the most out of them that they can give.''
</P>
<P>
   Green can't give any more of himself than he has the first two
games. He has sculpted his body to take its licks but it doesn't
change the fact he's 36. After playing a wonderful game Tuesday at
Utah, the 15th-year veteran looked winded against the Grizzlies. It
was as though the specter of Karl Malone stayed with him on this
night, even as he was fighting Othella Harrington and Bryant Reeves
for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Green shot an airball toward the end of the first quarter and
was a step slow all night. Fresh as a daisy, he decidedly was not.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he looked like he could have used watering.
</P>
<P>
   Green is a proud man, but he professed not to be bothered by the
not-so-subtle suggestions of Jackson that his is not the face that
will complete the Lakers' championship portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take to heart (things that are said), positive or
negative,'' Green said. ``You learn as you go around the block a
few times that it's a business and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this: Until the Lakers can solve their power forward
problem, there's no sense dwelling on it. From now on, the less
said about it, the better.

OPENING NIGHT DIARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lakers' Staples Center opening night diary:
</P>
<P>
   5:45: Veteran Laker assistant Bill Bertka is at courtside
marveling at Los Angeles' newest architectural shrine when he
thinks back to his first coaching job at Midland School in Los
Olivos, Calif., in 1952. ``My team played in a converted barn that
had no seats,'' he says with a laugh. ``This is slightly better.''
</P>
<P>
   6:00: ``This is definitely 21st century L.A.,'' says Magic
Johnson, as he gazes out at the court. ``This is the kind of arena
we should have in this city.'' Ah, if only Magic Johnson could have
played in it.
</P>
<P>
   6:14: I walk into the Lakers' locker room, and, omigod, is it
plush! It's twice as big as the one they had at the Forum, and it
has all the amenities you would find in a suite at a high-end Las
Vegas hotel.
</P>
<P>
   6:15: ``Hey, I hear you're no longer a virgin,'' I say,
kiddingly, to A.C. Green, the Lakers' 36-year-old power forward and
God-fearing member of Morningside Christian Church in Torrance. He
fixes me with a scowl and says seriously, ``I can't believe you
said that! You have really changed as a person since I last talked
to you. Nothing has changed in my life. I'm the same person and
still live a Christian life. How dare you say that. Don't judge me
by the morals that exist in your industry.'' Wow. I certainly would
never do that, and I humbly apologized to Green.
</P>
<P>
   6:25: I ask Phil Jackson his early impressions of Southern
California. ``I've found out that the freeways are a hallowed and
sacred spot for people,'' he says. ``I enter them with fear and
loathing.'' Just as I'm sure Phil Jackson's author pal, Hunter
Thompson, who has such a fear and loathing of Las Vegas, would.
</P>
<P>
   6:30: I ask Shaquille O'Neal what he thinks when he hears people
say that Tim Duncan has become the most dominant player in the NBA.
``It doesn't bother me,'' he claims. He pauses and then adds, ``No
one in this league can stay with me one on one.'' Then he says,
alluding perhaps to the superior personnel that surrounds Duncan:
``He and I have about the same car only his is shinier.''
</P>
<P>
   6:35: ``I'm going crazy,'' says Kobe Bryant, pointing to the
cast on his broken right hand. ``But I'm learning to shoot a lot
better with my left hand. I'm pretty good at it right now. I've
been shooting better than 90 percent from the free throw line.''
</P>
<P>
   7:15: I walk past actress Dyan Cannon, who's asking an usher the
location of section 101. ``I'm not familiar with this place yet,
she says defensively. It turns out that section 101 is at mid
court, but I notice it's three rows up from the floor and not at
courtside, where she sat at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   7:18: I see Jack Nicholson sitting in his familiar perch next to
the scorer's table, and I find out he and his pal Lou Adler split
the expenses on their four floor seats. Each ticket costs a mere
$1050 a game, meaning Nicholson will invest almost $100,000 to
watch the Lakers perform this season. No wonder Dyan Cannon, not
exactly on a cinematic roll, is sitting way up there in the peanut
gallery with the garden variety millionaires who are willing to pay
only a couple hundred bucks for their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   7:25: The crowd stands in silence for the late Wilt Chamberlain,
as a filmed tribute of him is shown on the massive video
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   7:29: For the 19th straight season, Jeffrey Osborne sings the
National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   7:30: I'm seated in the same row as my all-time idol, Chick
Hearn, at mid-court, and I ask Chickie Baby how he compares his new
broadcasting setting to the old one at the Forum. ``This is a lot
better because I'm 40 feet closer to the floor,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   7:42: Play ball. Shaquille O'Neal easily wins the opening tip
from his personal foil, Bryant (Country) Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   7:42: Illegal defense is charged against Vancouver after fewer
than 10 seconds have elapsed, the quickest it's ever been called at
Staples Center, if not the quickest in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   7:44: Glen Rice scores the first Lakers' point at Staples Center
on a layup, and follows it with a free throw for the Lakers' first
Staples Center three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   7:45: Shaquille O'Neal scores his first points at the sold out
arena it's a semi-hook from the side and the Lakers are off and
running to what figures to be an inevitable win against a modest
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   7:58: Shaquille consummates his first of what figures to be
thousands of Staples Center dunks during the next 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   8:05: First quarter ends. The Lakers are up by only a point at
23-22 because of the sterling play of O'Neal, who looks even more
imposing than ever.
</P>
<P>
   8:10: Poor Shaquille. He's playing with the scrubs early in the
second quarter: Brian Shaw, Tyron Lue, Devean George and Rick Fox.
Somehow, the Lakers still are holding their own against the dreaded
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   8:25: What's going on here? Shareef Abdur-Rahim gives the
Grizzlies a 39-37 edge and then ol' Country Reeves makes it 41-37
as he overpowers John Salley, filling in not so admirably for
O'Neal. Wasn't Salley an NBA television analyst only last season?
</P>
<P>
   8:30: Where's the noise? Even when the Lakers do something well,
which hasn't been often except for O'Neal's heroics, there is only
muffled noise in the cavernous building.
</P>
<P>
   8:35: ``Defense! Defense! Defense!'' the crowd chants, the first
Laker chant heard at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   8:37: Haltime. The Lakers are clinging to a 49-48 edge in a game
that makes up in boredom what it lacks in excitement.
</P>
<P>
   8:45: Chick Hearn and Magic Johnson preside over the unveiling
of the jerseys of the Lakers players who have had their numbers
retired and also the unveiling of the Lakers championship banners.
</P>
<P>
   8:57: Oh, what drama and tension in the air, as the second half
commences.
</P>
<P>
   9:03: A mighty O'Neal dunk makes it 59-50, and the Lakers seem
finally ready to take total command.
</P>
<P>
   9:05: Glen Rice, who's suddenly rediscovered his jumper that
betrayed him during the preseason, hits one to make it 64-52, and
the scantily-clad Laker Girls draw the evening's loudest cheers
strutting their stuff during a Grizzlies' timeout.
</P>
<P>
   9:10: O'Neal is scandalously schooling poor Country Reeves.
Dunks over him again to make it 68-55.
</P>
<P>
   9:14: O'Neal, amazingly, makes his first Staples Center free
throw attempt. An omen of things to come? Not really. He quickly
misses his second attempt.
</P>
<P>
   9:21: Oh no. Shaquille, back in peak form, misses two straight
free throws after being fouled by the Grizzlies backup center,
Cherokee Parks, sporting quite a tattoo behind his neck.
</P>
<P>
   9:31: There is 10:23 remaining, but this game is over, unless,
of course, if you have a bet on it, as Glen Rice's two-pointer
makes it 85-69. Natch, a lot of fans hurry for the exits, upholding
a cherished L.A. athletic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   9:42: Staples Center is now about half filled with still seven
minutes remaining, as Phil Jackson is going with his reserves.
O'Neal is resting comfortably on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   9:46: Jackson is not taking any chances. With 6:03 remaining and
his team up by a 90-76 margin, he re-inserts O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   9:50: Poor Country Reeves fouls out, giving O'Neal the
opportunity to miss his fourth straight free throw. But Shaq breaks
the ugly streak by finally making his second free throw of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   9:54: O'Neal is finally pulled with three minutes to go, and his
first Staples Center performance is solid with 28 points, 10
rebounds and 2 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   10:10: Fouls and timeouts keep the game from finishing until
this ungodly hour. It's not a surprise the Lakers win by 15
(103-88), but it is a surprise that the final seven minutes take 28
minutes to play.

</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ With strong evidence suggesting Lamar Odom
possesses requisite ingredients for ``The Bomb'' status, Scottie
Pippen decided to see if the kid's already ticking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it two eras posturing to explode in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Odom is the Clipper rookie who creates more matchup disasters
than anyone this side of Chuck Woolery. Pippen, Michael Jordan's
erstwhile attack mongrel, at age 34 remains the defining model of
small-forward versatility.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Pippen's Portland Trail Blazers (2-0) opened
their home schedule and soothsayer-endorsed run for NBA glory by
wiping out the 0-2 Clips, 121-98, Wednesday in front of a sellout
crowd of 20,584 at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For facial-application junkies, Pippen went for 16 points in the
third quarter, finished with 22 and looked fully capable of
enabling the Blazers to make good on a threat to terrorize the
Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who often seems as out of place in Clipper battle dress as
Sinatra in a karaoke bar, had 23 points and 7 rebounds. In
Tuesday's opener vs. Seattle, the youngster had 30 (on 10-of-18
shooting) and 12. Against Pippen and crew, he missed 12 of 17
field-goal attempts. He did fix the 8-of-15 free-throw calamity of
Game 1 by dropping 12 of 14 freebies against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen on Odom: ``He's a left-handed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom on Pippen: ``At first, you can't help being in awe,'' the
rookie said of butting heads with Pippen, who scored six NBA
championship rings with the Chicago Bulls. ``It took me a couple of
quarters to figure out it's just another basketball game''
</P>
<P>
   And what did he figure out about Pippen that can be used for
future skirmishes?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dribbling, keep the ball close to you,'' Odom
said. ``He's so good at reading what you do. He's like a boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Blazers look like legitimate playoff
heavyweights. Of course, they had a similar look for most of last
season, but their cast of characters seemed one disagreement away
from turning into the Donner Party.
</P>
<P>
   Trades seemed to have provided the remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Steve Smith - acquired from Atlanta in a purge that
sent J.R. Rider and Jim Jackson to the Hawks -- matched Pippen's 22
points. That number was 1 fewer than what was provided by hometown
hummingbird point guard Damon Stoudamire, who added nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor had 22 points and 6 rebounds for the Clippers,
with teammate Derek Anderson pitching in with 16.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the ugly numbers:
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper offense, still guilty of lots of shakin' and little
bakin', provided just 15 assists; the equal-opportunity Blazers had
32. Portland also conquered the Clips on the backboards, finishing
with a 41-29 rebounding edge. Clipper Michael Olowokandi followed
Tuesday's 16-rebound effort by checking in with 1 at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper defense - which somehow limited Seattle to
39-percent shooting from the field Tuesday - was used at a
60-percent rate by Portland.
</P>
<P>
   So Coach Chris Ford's post-game, post-mortem must have been a
bloodletting, right?
</P>
<P>
   Take it, Chris:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did some good things out there,'' Ford said. ``We
played a lot better tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Read that as more of an endorsement for the Trail Blazers than
as a rip at the SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put any pressure on Mike, because he's a
friend of mind,'' Ford said of Portland coach Mike Dunleavy, ``but
they're going to be in a position to challenge. The do the little
things that are necessary. They have those hungry veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have a starving rookie who's looking to taste
victory for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about the NBA,'' Odom said, ``is that there are
80 more games.''
</P>
<P>
   An even better thing about the NBA is that only three of those
are against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers were without reserve shooting guard Eric
Piatkowski (sore ribs), who made the trip, but wasn't in uniform.

   CZECH-HAVEL (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Vaclav Havel, the ironic
dissident who articulated the power of the powerless and helped
bring down the Berlin Wall, still serves, like a prisoner, as
president of the Czech Republic. Celebrated in the West as a symbol
of communism's magical implosion and the force of the written word,
Havel, 10 years later, is now regarded by many Czechs as something
of a scold, or worse, a bit of a joke. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>

   CHINA-SECT (Beijing) _ Has it come to this, that the Communist
Party of China is terrified of a bunch of fervent retirees in

where senior senators defend their bill and senior representatives
defend their bill, with both sides striking compromises to resolve
the differences. But in the real world of power politics,
conventional procedures are sometimes flouted. That is what
happened in the House on Wednesday on managed-care legislation. By

   BUDGET-CAPS _ The budget caps, imposed by Congress with great
fanfare in the mid '90s, are dead. They crumbled with no

engaging in round-the-clock head banging, and plenty of bare skin
in prime time, it is not surprising that many parents find a lot of
what is on television unfit for their children. But when offered
something that would block violent or racy shows from their
television set's, would parents actually use it? It seems not, if
the arrival of the V-chip is any indication. The V-chip, circuitry
that can be used to block programs according to a ratings system,
quickly gained the support of Congress and parents' groups in the
mid 1990s. By January, all sets over 13 inches sold in the United
States will be required to have one. But whether it is because of a
lack of consumer awareness, or because it is difficult to use or
because parents do not feel they need it, the V-chip has few users,
judging by interviews with retailers, industry experts and
consumers. Even groups that support the V-chip acknowledge that it
has yet to catch on with the public. By Catherine Greenman.

Papadopoulos regime. Then there was the cedar-paneled house
overlooking a sound in Bermuda, the tile-roofed hacienda in Phoenix
and the suburban rendition of a Provencal manor in Dobbs Ferry,
N.Y. Finally, just a loud honk from the Holland Tunnel, they're
putting down roots. But for the first time, the couple say, they're
in terra incognita, in a territory mapped by architects. Where once
they traveled freely with little more than what they could stow

in the kitchen, and happy to be: teenagers, children, men, the
elderly and, yes, women. So, what's wrong with that? The kitchen,
says Jane Langmuir, an architect. It hasn't caught up. ``We get
coded at a very early age by memories of the place we grew up in,
and think, `Why change it?''' Ms. Langmuir said. ``But that kitchen
was designed for a single person, 5-foot-6. And when you start
putting everyone else in, it's not going to work very well.'' By

LAKERS WIN IN STAPLES DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Change was unmistakable at every glance Wednesday
night as the new-look Lakers and their new coach got cozy in their
plush new downtown arena. Even the championship banners and retired
jerseys hanging high above the Staples Center floor were
fresh-off-the-sewing-machine new.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it was reassuring to the long-faithful Lakers fan that
certain traditions would remain _ Jack Nicholson at courtside,
Shaquille O'Neal dominating the paint, and the Lakers rolling over
the NBA's well-heeled warmup act, the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   It took longer than usual, but the Lakers did indeed roll,
103-88 before a pleased, if often docile, announced sellout crowd
of 18,997.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Staples Center duly broken in.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cozy part, that might not ever happen in this
cavernous arena. Crowd roars sounded like distance whispers at
times, and it fit a game in which the Lakers muddled through the
first half without much electricity themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very difficult place to play,'' coach Phil Jackson summed
up. ``You saw that the energy was really weird in the first half.
Shots didn't go in, although we shot a relatively decent
percentage....
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half, we just got a little energy and fired up and
played some defense. (Derek) Fisher got the ball back for us a few
times, we did some things to turn the game around. It's going to be
a strange place to play for a while. We knew that. Even though we
shot 50 percent, which looks great, there's still a certain feel
about that building that's a little different yet. The open space,
the idea that there's some airballs that just ended up out there
looking like long flies in the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for home sweet home.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the sweet 2-0 record will have to suffice for
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The energy level rose markedly in the third quarter, with O'Neal
testing the new rims and scoring 13 of his game-high 28 points. A
15-4 run to open the second half paved the way for a 79-67 lead
heading into the fourth quarter and allowed the Lakers to relax for
the first time all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking among ourselves and we said hey, look, we've
got to pick it up,'' said Glen Rice, who followed his breakout
performance at Utah with a 17-point, five-assist, six-rebound
performance. ``You give a team a chance to hang around to the end,
then you're going to wind up being sad at the end of the ballgame.
We didn't want that to happen tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It took contributions from all corners of Jackson's triangle
offense, which glistened a little more under Staples' bright
lights. The offense designed to involve everyone did just that:
Rick Fox, 15 points in relief. A.C. Green and Brian Shaw, 10 points
each. Fisher, eight assists and four steals. John Salley, five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second unit was really critical for us,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it all came as easily as anticipated. The Grizzlies'
Michael Dickerson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim, with 19 points each,
kept the game close, though Vancouver never took a lead in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not everything went the way the Lakers envisioned for
their Staples debut. The soft defense and the uncomfortable 49-48
lead at halftime, for one. And then there was that awkward moment
when a still shot of the Great Western Forum on the center-court
video screen got the loudest ovation of the night.
</P>
<P>
   During the many, quieter moments of the first half _ the ones
when a sneeze at the south end of the arena carried to the upper
reaches of the north end _ the Lakers struggled to hold down
Vancouver's offense, led by Bryant Reeves' 10 points and eight
apiece from Othella Harrington and Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, showing all sides of his game, scored 14 points in the
half, added nine rebounds and dished out four assists, three to
newest Laker Shaw. And Rice continued his hot streak with nine
points on 4-of-7 shooting in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I said to my assistant coach, Tex Winter, you know a
hangnail sometimes will keep a shooter from having a good game,''
Jackson said. ``And once they get on a roll, sometimes it's
infectious.... He got it going and it stayed there.''

SILENT NIGHT AT STAPLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Home called, even if it was as comfortable and
familiar as a new pair of leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Except, at least, leather shoes squeak.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers _ with new coach, new uniforms, new offense and new
arena _ made their Staples Center debut Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And got a quick new lesson in just how incredibly lifeless
18,997 people can be when placed in one very large building.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd acted as if it had stumbled into a library.
Any more silent and they wouldn't have needed a radio to hear Chick
Hearn do the play-by-play. Morgues show more life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very quiet,'' said Lakers guard Ron Harper. ``For a first
game, unusually quiet. You go to any high school gym and you get
some loud noise. Everybody came to see the building, they didn't
come to cheer tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere was strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Lakers would work out a 103-88 victory, players and
coaches eagerly awaited taking the floor for their first game at
the $375 million arena. They understood there would be an
adjustment to their new surroundings, but no one could have
anticipated what awaited. Or what didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's just an arena, until we get the fans here,''
Lakers forward A.C. Green said before the game. ``Just give us a
crowd, that's the only missing ingredient right now. I'm really
looking forward to the seats being filled.''
</P>
<P>
   He may still think he's waiting. As tipoff approached, there
wasn't enough electricity to fire a 25-watt bulb. The Lakers
mistakenly decided to wait until the half to unfurl their
championship banners, so there was no focal point to liven up the
crowd. Ex-Laker James Worthy took the microphone prior to the game
to welcome them to Staples. He all but got down on his knees to ask
the crowd to fire up, but his plea fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that the Lakers were playing the faceless
Vancouver Grizzlies, and not well. But that hardly explained the
total lack of energy at the season home opener. That homecourt
advantage may be some time in coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are still working out the acoustics,'' said Lakers
forward Rick Fox. ``We didn't give them much to cheer about. They
were definitely taking in the view. For the prices they paid,
they're entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   New Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who coached the Bulls when they
opened the United Center in Chicago, had felt confident earlier
that Staples Center would quickly feel like home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chemical thing,'' Jackson said. ``It's the energy the
fans bring and the players bring to the court that builds that.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Staples Center has a chemistry problem. Maybe it's
those three rows of suites that all but knifes the crowd in half.
Or maybe it's the opera-house feeling as the arena builds straight
up.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, something was plainly missing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like it a little more rowdy,'' said Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal. ``They were kind of laid-back for me. But we
didn't give them much to get rowdy about, too.'' The Lakers did dim
the lights at the half as Magic Johnson and Hearn made the
presentation of the championship banners and the crowd gave a brief
sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Magic could inspire the crowd for long. Not the
Laker Girls. Not Jack Nicholson sitting courtside with new squeeze
Laura Flynn Boyle, not agent Leonard Amato sitting with Pamela Lee
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a Hollywood crowd. They needed cue cards to know when
to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers opened the second half with a 15-4 run, you
could finally tell a crowd was in the arena. But sustaining any
real enthusiasm was not in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   During the Showtime era, the Forum could truly rock with
intensity. It offered genuine homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the best, as far as true noise and support,''
Green said. ``There's a little bias there, but they were the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time to catch up with the Forum.''

TOP U.S. PLAYERS SKIPPING SPAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The big problem with this new World Championship
Golf series is readily evident at the American Express
Championship, which started today at the Valderrama links in
Sotogrande, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   There are 65 golfers, supposedly the best from their respective
tours, competing for a $5 million purse, including $1 million to
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the lucrative payout, seven of the world's top 50
players, six of them Americans, took a pass.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that holding one of these ``World'' events anywhere in
the world but the United States is one big inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's No. 2 player, decided his fly fishing
form needed more attention than his bank account. And what was he
gonna prove, anyway? That he's almost as good as Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara didn't want to take his game out in public because
his swing has gone on hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III, who battled Woods for the Tour Championship last
weekend, waffled about going to Spain on almost every hole.
</P>
<P>
   He went, but only because it's his last chance to win this year
and thus get an invite to the lucrative winners-only event that
kicks off the PGA Tour season next year in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman also passed, but he's got his own tournament in
Thousand Oaks to get ready for and there is always guy stuff to do.
</P>
<P>
   This series, otherwise known as the World Corporate
Championships, consists of the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship at La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad and the NEC
Invitational at the Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It is sanctioned by the International Federation of PGA Tours,
which includes the PGA Tour, European Tour, Southern Africa PGA
Tour, PGA Tour of Australasia and the Japan Golf Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Winnings count as official money on players' home tours and has
a bearing on the world golf ranking.
</P>
<P>
   So that makes it at least seem worthy of jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a big-deal tournament with a couple of subplots
worthy of prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is trying for his fourth consecutive win and eighth
official victory of the year. He also won a tournament in Germany
that isn't considered official even though the money is probably
commingled with his other earnings.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be taking on Colin Montgomerie, who rates his own chances
as great, and will be renewing the rivalry with Spain's Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there is still that Ryder Cup bad blood that might
surface.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some big American names decided to stay home
miffed some of the European players, who made the effort to compete
over here.
</P>
<P>
   And money is an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The series features huge payouts. But American golfers compete
for heaps of cash every weekend. For example, Montgomerie set a
European money record this year, but seven Americans won almost as
much or more on the U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring the pot: Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, the world's
18th-ranked player and Ryder Cup star, caused a stir when he
decided to stay home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That decision cost him his European Tour card because he only
played in 10 events on the continent instead of the required 11.
Some European Tour officials considered Parnevik's action rude, and
their reaction was swift.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik's decision was also prudent.
</P>
<P>
   His American manager, Clarke Jones, said Wednesday that Parnevik
stayed home because of an irregular heart beat.
</P>
<P>
   The condition is not supposed to be serious, but Parnevik won't
go to South Africa for a tournament next month, either.

 REPORT TELLS OF GLOBAL WARMING'S THREAT TO STATE  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new report from a group of California
scientists concludes that global warming will pose grave problems
for the state in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible scenarios, the scientists warn, are more
warm, wet winters that could bring both flooding and water
shortages in the same year, more and bigger landslides and an
increase in the outbreak of exotic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the places we know and love in California are
vulnerable to a changing climate,'' said the report's lead author,
Chris Field, a plant biologist at the Carnegie Institution at
Stanford University. ``A variety of changes are coming, and many
will have profound ecological and economic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists and the
Ecological Society of America, the two-year study is a
collaborative effort by scientists from Stanford, Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, the University of California at Santa Barbara
and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. It was based on new
climate computer models.
</P>
<P>
   But some climatologists have questioned the study, warning that
even the best climate computer models are unreliable when it comes
to predicting the regional impacts of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that California winter temperatures are
expected to rise 5 to 6 degrees and that summer temperatures will
climb 1 to 2 degrees by 2030 to 2050. The warmer temperatures bode
ill for California, the scientists say. Among the possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   -- California could experience simultaneous floods and water
shortages. There will be more wet El Nino years, but most of the
precipitation will fall as rain, not snow.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy storms would require that floodgates remain open to
prevent dam failure. But with scant snowpack, reservoirs would not
be able to fill back up.
</P>
<P>
   -- Urban water shortages could become commonplace due to reduced
supplies from reservoirs. And water deliveries to agriculture could
be severely curtailed because of short supplies, seriously
affecting the Central Valley's economy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Heavy El Nino rains could increase the frequency of rodent
population booms, contributing to outbreaks of hantavirus, a
microbe associated with mice that has been responsible for human
fatalities in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   -- Catastrophic wildfires could increase, particularly in the
southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The report also predicts that California's natural heritage will
suffer if temperatures rise significantly. Forests will tend to
migrate northward, replaced in their southern ranges by brush or
grass. This could result in the degradation of many of the state's
remaining old-growth forests. Woodland wildlife populations could
experience increasing stress because of habitat destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced summer runoff would harm coastal and Sacramento River
salmon runs and increase salinity in San Francisco Bay, adversely
affecting estuarine fish. Expected warming of offshore waters would
reduce plankton, weakening the bottom rung of the marine food
chain. This could devastate game fish, sea birds and marine
mammals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting our inheritance from nature in jeopardy,'' said
report co-author Gretchen Daily, a Stanford biologist. ``The
long-term health of California's most spectacular natural
treasures, from redwoods to giant kelp, is at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But while scientists are reasonably confident about
sophisticated computer modeling projections at the hemispheric and
continental scale, they are much less confident at the regional
level. Peter Stone, a professor of climate dynamics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says while the report's
temperature ranges are correct, the accuracy of the overall results
is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying their predictions won't happen, but they're
speculative,'' said Stone. ``Different models give different
results. Even the best are very poor at predicting storm tracks, so
you have to take (all projections involving water shortages) with a
grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   The best authority on global warming predictions, said Stone, is
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established in 1988
by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization.
They issue assessments every five years; the last one was in 1996.
It concluded that there is greater confidence in climate
projections on the hemispheric and continental scale than in
regional projections, where the panel concluded ``confidence is
low.'' The panel also said it had more confidence in temperature
projections than in projections about water supply changes.
</P>
<P>
   Computer modeling has not advanced sufficiently since 1996 to
warrant altering that evaluation, Stone said. ``It still applies.''

COMMENTARY: THE ALPHA-BETA MACARENA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I will say this in Naomi Wolf's favor: You've got
to respect a woman who gets a vice president to pay her a salary
higher than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine revealed that Al Gore hired Ms. Wolf, who has
written extensively on women and sexual power, as a $15,000-a-month
consultant to help him with everything from his shift to earth
tones to his efforts to break with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolf has argued internally that Gore is a `beta male' who
needs to take on the `alpha male' in the Oval Office before the
public will see him as the top dog,'' write Time's Michael Duffy
and Karen Tumulty.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a man has to pony up a fortune to a woman to
teach him how to be a man, that definitely takes the edge off his
top-dogginess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf is the moral equivalent of an Armani T-shirt, because
Gore has obscenely overpaid for something basic. It is advice given
to all vice presidents: Be your own guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baby biology, for heaven's sake,'' says Lionel Tiger, the
anthropologist and author of ``The Decline of Males.'' ``In two
months the vice president has paid Naomi Wolf the annual salary of
an assistant professor of zoology at a decent university to tell
him something so elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore actually was a dominant male, he wouldn't need to be
told how to have gusto.''
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate Gore had seven years to get his team together,
and yet his pack of gurus becomes ever wackier, like the portal to
John Malkovich's head.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the scene when the earthy campaign manager, Donna
Brazile, learned that the airy Naomi was receiving consulting fees
that could have totaled $180,000 for a year, compared with the vice
president's annual salary of $175,400. Ms. Brazile cut Ms. Wolf's
fee down to $5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Ms. Wolf, who was a Rhodes scholar, wrote ``The
Beauty Myth,'' a 1991 book about how the obsession with looks was a
conspiracy perpetrated by the beauty industry. ``She came onto the
stage all glossy-eyed and glossy-mouthed, telling all the ugly
girls that it didn't matter if Prince Charming wasn't attracted to
them,'' Tiger says. ``But beauty is a real force, not a myth. And
it's cruel to say otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   She alarmed critics by drawing parallels between the Holocaust
and anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   In her next book, ``Fire With Fire,'' she drew a parallel
between apartheid and the gender wars and urged women to release
their inner sluts.
</P>
<P>
   Her thesis was that feminism needed to be more fun: ``Rape, of
course, must never be thought of as fun. But should it be heresy to
suggest that changing attitudes about rape should sometimes be fun?
This must not be taken out of context, but there is no other way to
say it: The rape crisis center starved for lack of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Wolf has to make the unfun Gore fun. She has come up
with her most un-feminist notion yet: Urge a gentle, new-age beta
male to act like a Fight Club macho alpha male, the sort who bares
his teeth and drags women off to his cave.
</P>
<P>
   She has a point. Women are impressed by swagger and paternalism
in presidential candidates, just as men are.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Ms. Wolf helped Dick Morris woo straying female voters
back to the Clinton fold. Morris, the master of alternating smart
and flaky ideas, said that Ms. Wolf had alternating smart and flaky
ideas. ``Once she showed up at my office with a whole wall full of
angel cutouts from Time magazine and other places, saying angels
were in the United States,'' he said on Fox News. ``And I said,
`What are we supposed to do, y'know, appoint one to the Cabinet?'''
</P>
<P>
   She devised the Good Father model for Bill Clinton. It was an
obvious idea. But we live in a time when politicians don't trust
the contents of their own minds, when externalities are more
important than internalities.
</P>
<P>
   And the style consultants can't even agree about the
externalities. In the '96 race, Harry Thomasson told Clinton to
wear lighter suits. Then Morris told Clinton not to. Now Ms. Wolf
approves of Gore's switch from navy to tan.
</P>
<P>
   It's deliciously Byzantine. Gore, whose shot at the presidency
is in jeopardy because Clinton had a preoccupation with sex, has
turned to an author with a preoccupation with sex to save him.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after turning Clinton, the predator, into the Good
Father, Ms. Wolf will try to turn Gore, a good father, into more of
a predator.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Democracy in the land of the freebie
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Californians have re-established themselves on the cutting edge
of hyper-democracy with the thumping success of the referendum in
San Francisco outlawing some ATM fees. Electorates everywhere must
be wondering, ``Why didn't I think of this myself?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some did, sort of. Connecticut, Iowa and Santa Monica,
Calif., also have forbidden the charges, though by statute and
ordinance rather than by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, with their usual instinct for the deft public-relations
touch, came up with ATM fees as a way to charge their depositors
for access to their own money.
</P>
<P>
   The fees average $1.27 per transaction and _ the target of the
referendum _ often double that if you're using another bank's ATM
to decant your money. The percentage can be trivial if you're
ordering up cash for a Mercedes or a month on the Costa del Sol, as
most of us do, but extravagant if you're begging milk money from a
threadbare account.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, pleading poverty, say they need this levy to maintain
their system of ATMs, so that customers will have a chance to be
mugged for their life savings in broad daylight at every strip mall
in this great country.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult not to sympathize with the bankers, poor babies,
who find themselves in the dispiriting business of every so often
having to let us use our own money.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains a bit of a puzzle just why, if fees are necessary
to support the ATMs, bank tellers don't demand $1.50 when you walk
up to their window to make a withdrawal. What with vacations _ they
do get them, don't they? _ and sick kids and general whining, you'd
think tellers would cost more to maintain than machines that don't
even get the graveyard shift off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the idea of tellers demanding front money to serve
customers strikes even bankers as coming uncomfortably close to a
plain stick-up. When a machine does the same thing, it is somehow
more like fate than felony.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking as the San Francisco vote is, it is small
potatoes measured against the potential for this new economic
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ATM fees rankle disproportionately precisely because of their
seeming pettiness, in the way you can learn to live with the din of
factory noise but it makes you crazy when the guy next to you sucks
his teeth. It seems a shame to waste a referendum on what, for
most, is only pocket change. For all the populist kvetching, let's
face it, few have ever been driven to their knees by ATM charges.
</P>
<P>
   The biggies for this innovation of pricing by ballot box are
shelter, food, clothing and, crucially, lifestyle. Electorates
aroused by San Francisco's example soon may be storming their
polling places to enact dollar weekends at Blockbusters, yuppie
discounts for BMWs and bread and roses for the hungry and the
emotionally unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetes of governance have been fretting for some years
over declining voter participation in elections. This breakthrough
to freebies by referendum ought to perk the political system right
up.

 &HT;    Symposium sparks mostly tasteful debate on Southern food
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ As the Jack Daniel's flowed and the ghosts of
William Faulkner and Willie Morris danced under the magnolias, a
spirited debate erupted on the heart of the Ole Miss campus over
the weekend. New York culinary historian Jessica Harris had a bone
to pick with Savannah cookbook writer Damon Lee Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument at the Southern Foodways Symposium was not
about race or sex or politics. It was about the origins of that
holiest of Southern icons, fried chicken. ``I thought somebody was
going to pull out a pistol,'' said Linda Carman, a baking expert
from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought Southern food was just food, you haven't been to
this symposium, an event that, more than anything, proves how
passionate _ how downright peculiar _ some people can be about
catfish and collards. In a place where tempers once flared over
matters of war and peace, the dialogue has shifted to the kitchen.
But despite the occasional squawks and ruffled feathers, this
gathering was an occasion of broad affection and graceful good
humor, and the defining moment in a long effort to accord the
region's culinary heritage the same treatment as its literary and
musical idioms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foodways are just as important as Faulkner in understanding
the South,'' said Charles Reagan Wilson, director of the University
of Mississippi's Center for the Study of Southern Culture, which
produces the symposium and the world-renowned Faulkner &AMP;
Yoknapatawpha Conference. ``Faulkner speaks to some Southerners,
but foodways speak to all Southerners.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, all weekend long, some 90 food aficionados from around
the country _ museum curators, chefs, cookbook writers and
journalists from The Food Network and Food &AMP; Wine and Gourmet
magazines _ ventured here to learn about Arkansas tamales, Georgia
boiled peanuts, Kentucky shuckbeans and Creole file-making.
</P>
<P>
   They came to hear New Orleans Times-Picayune columnist Lolis
Eric Elie joke that he had changed the title of his talk on Creole
cooking to ``Escoffier's Resounding Silence on the Matter of
Gumbo.'' Or to hear Mississippi home cook Kathy Starr tell how she
found salvation and love in the bosom of her grandmother's kitchen
after her parents abandoned her. They came to sit over a plate of
barbecue with Atlanta's Nathalie Dupree, who, in her Chanel
sunglasses and pearl choker, seemed the epitome of the strange new
species known as the food celebrity. And they came to hear National
Public Radio host Vertamae Grosvenor spout morsels of folk wisdom
like this: ``When the preacher comes, the chickens cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to use food as a way of talking about what Mr.
Faulkner called the great verities, like race and class and gender
and all that stuff,'' says symposium director John T. Edge, a
boyish-looking 36-year-old with a laugh like a hiccup. After
getting his master's in Southern studies at Ole Miss, Edge
persuaded the Center to put the symposium, and its newly formed
Southern Foodways Alliance, under its umbrella. On Thursday, he'll
be in Atlanta to sign his new book, ``A Gracious Plenty: Recipes
and Recollections From the American South'' (Putnam, $30); a
portion of its sales benefits the symposium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton, Ga., native says the event would not be
happening had it not been for the work of people like Edna Lewis,
John Egerton and others. Since at least 1992, Lewis, the venerable
chef and writer who now lives in Atlanta, has wanted to organize a
society to preserve the vanishing traditions of the Southern farm
and kitchen. For various reasons, the effort didn't get off the
ground until last year's first Oxford symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems there is no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   This year's installment sold out two months in advance. Also,
the American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, which plans to
open a $70 million museum in Napa, Calif., in 2001, sent a film
crew to tape oral histories of everyone from Mississippi catfish
farmer Ed Scott to Baton Rouge, La., file maker Lionel Key.
</P>
<P>
   Edge, who works full-time at the center, says: ``People who were
not here might question whether it's a stretch. `You spent the
whole weekend talking about food? Does it really matter?' And yet
if you'd been in attendance, you'd realize we are telling the story
of a culture through its food, which is the shared creation of all
these ethnic groups and nationalities. It's very much life and
death stuff. It is sweat and blood and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Lewis could not journey to the conference to pick up a
lifetime achievement award, her presence was palpable. ``It was
this vision of hers that really brought us to where we are,'' says
Egerton, unveiling a portrait of Lewis that Edge will bring to
Atlanta on Thursday. Lewis, the granddaughter of freed Virgina
slaves and the grande dame of Southern culinaria, is scheduled to
appear at Edge's book signing. Scott Peacock, her soul mate and
chef at the Decatur restaurant Watershed, will cook.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Edge's book is a collection of recipes taken from
the region's copious supply of community cookbooks, and annotated
with the meal memories of the famous (bluesman B.B. King) and the
not-so famous (Lawrence Craig, who runs a barbecue joint in
Devall's Bluff, Ark.).
</P>
<P>
   Says the author: ``This book pays homage to those
gravy-splattered spiral-bound cookbooks, but it does it in a way
that hopefully gives some cultural context. I look upon those books
as the voice of an unsung people. Nobody is paying attention to
those churchwomen who came together, those firemen who cooked
Brunswick stew every Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   One admirer of Edge's work is Daphne L. Derven, curator of the
Napa center, who came to Oxford oversee the videotaping of oral
histories. ``What I see John doing is attempting to both document
and explore the language that connects us to people who lived and
farmed and ate and laughed and listened to music and shared meals
in different parts of the South and in different parts of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was much laughing, singing and sharing of meals at
the symposium. But there were moments of crackling debate _
questions of who we are and where our cooking came from.
</P>
<P>
   After Fowler, the Savannah writer and gadfly, made an academic
argument that the bone of Southern cooking is English, Harris, an
expert on the foods of the African diaspora, stood to say his
evidence would never pass the muster of ``the Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   And you could have almost heard a pin drop when Egerton _ who
Edge calls ``the pope of Southern cooking'' _ rose to say that
Fowler was ``digging an unnecessary hole for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But symposium leaders say such debate is vital. ``We are not
providing a sentimental, nostalgic look at the old ways,'' says
Wilson, ``but trying to look with very clear eyes just as we would
at Southern history and the origins of Jim Crow. Jim Crow had
meanings in terms of food, so that's a part of the story that we
want to unravel.''
</P>
<P>
   If some symposium attendees were marching to the beat of a
different drumstick, no one _ especially Fowler _ questions that
Southern food is a glorious blend of African, European and
indigenous influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can argue about that forever,'' says Edge. ``But when the
chicken hits the plate, I'm happy!''

getting his master's in Southern studies at Ole Miss, Edge
persuaded the Center to put the symposium, and its newly formed
Southern Foodways Alliance, under its umbrella. On Thursday, he'll
be in Atlanta to sign his new book, ``A Gracious Plenty: Recipes
and Recollections From the American South'' (Putnam, $30); a
portion of its sales benefits the symposium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton, Ga., native says the event would not be
happening had it not been for the work of people like Edna Lewis,
John Egerton and others. Since at least 1992, Lewis, the venerable
chef and writer who now lives in Atlanta, has wanted to organize a
society to preserve the vanishing traditions of the Southern farm
and kitchen. For various reasons, the effort didn't get off the
ground until last year's first Oxford symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems there is no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   This year's installment sold out two months in advance. Also,
the American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, which plans to
open a $70 million museum in Napa, Calif., in 2001, sent a film
crew to tape oral histories of everyone from Mississippi catfish
farmer Ed Scott to Baton Rouge, La., file maker Lionel Key.
</P>
<P>
   Edge, who works full-time at the center, says: ``People who were
not here might question whether it's a stretch. `You spent the
whole weekend talking about food? Does it really matter?' And yet
if you'd been in attendance, you'd realize we are telling the story
of a culture through its food, which is the shared creation of all
these ethnic groups and nationalities. It's very much life and
death stuff. It is sweat and blood and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Lewis could not journey to the conference to pick up a
lifetime achievement award, her presence was palpable. ``It was
this vision of hers that really brought us to where we are,'' says
Egerton, unveiling a portrait of Lewis that Edge will bring to
Atlanta on Thursday. Lewis, the granddaughter of freed Virgina
slaves and the grande dame of Southern culinaria, is scheduled to
appear at Edge's book signing. Scott Peacock, her soul mate and
chef at the Decatur restaurant Watershed, will cook.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Edge's book is a collection of recipes taken from
the region's copious supply of community cookbooks, and annotated
with the meal memories of the famous (bluesman B.B. King) and the
not-so famous (Lawrence Craig, who runs a barbecue joint in
Devall's Bluff, Ark.).
</P>
<P>
   Says the author: ``This book pays homage to those
gravy-splattered spiral-bound cookbooks, but it does it in a way
that hopefully gives some cultural context. I look upon those books
as the voice of an unsung people. Nobody is paying attention to
those churchwomen who came together, those firemen who cooked
Brunswick stew every Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   One admirer of Edge's work is Daphne L. Derven, curator of the
Napa center, who came to Oxford oversee the videotaping of oral
histories. ``What I see John doing is attempting to both document
and explore the language that connects us to people who lived and
farmed and ate and laughed and listened to music and shared meals
in different parts of the South and in different parts of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was much laughing, singing and sharing of meals at
the symposium. But there were moments of crackling debate _
questions of who we are and where our cooking came from.
</P>
<P>
   After Fowler, the Savannah writer and gadfly, made an academic
argument that the bone of Southern cooking is English, Harris, an
expert on the foods of the African diaspora, stood to say his
evidence would never pass the muster of ``the Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   And you could have almost heard a pin drop when Egerton _ who
Edge calls ``the pope of Southern cooking'' _ rose to say that
Fowler was ``digging an unnecessary hole for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But symposium leaders say such debate is vital. ``We are not
providing a sentimental, nostalgic look at the old ways,'' says
Wilson, ``but trying to look with very clear eyes just as we would
at Southern history and the origins of Jim Crow. Jim Crow had
meanings in terms of food, so that's a part of the story that we
want to unravel.''
</P>
<P>
   If some symposium attendees were marching to the beat of a
different drumstick, no one _ especially Fowler _ questions that
Southern food is a glorious blend of African, European and
indigenous influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can argue about that forever,'' says Edge. ``But when the
chicken hits the plate, I'm happy!''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: OUR UNREAL BUDGET BATTLE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once more, it's high season for the brouhaha
between Congress and the White House over how to spend the
taxpayers' money. But to see what's really going on, we need to
cast aside the inflamed rhetoric and focus on four basic truths.
</P>
<P>
   Reality No. 1: Like alpha chimps in the zoo, political leaders
vow never to budge from their purportedly principled positions. But
with an effective four-vote working majority in the House, the
Republicans know they cannot enact their spending schemes without
at least partially accommodating President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The same math also faces Senate Republicans, who the other day
managed by one vote to avoid opening the year's final spending bill
to an anything-goes round of amendments. Because that bill also
calls for a nearly 1 percent cut for all federal agencies, Clinton
promises a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Reality No. 2: The verbiage bears scant relation to the stakes.
(Perhaps that's one reason why many folks tune out of these
disputes, even though, as the saying goes, it's your money.)
</P>
<P>
   So you see Gen. Henry Shelton, who chairs the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, telling Congress that the proposed cut would strike a
``devastating'' blow at military readiness, yielding a
``disastrous'' result.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable enough to hold that an 0.97 percent cut applied
equally across all 13 of the annual federal spending bills would be
ill-advised. But while the military cuts would exempt some
mandatory accounts like payrolls, magnifying their effect on
readiness, it's still nonsense to argue the that it would lead to a
national disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Reality No. 3: Even though Congress can usually find a way of
screwing things up, enacting spending bills nowadays doesn't
require lots of heavy lifting. That's because the budget surplus
for fiscal 1999, which just ended, stands at $123 billion. And
projected surpluses for the current fiscal year will be at least as
large, if not even larger.
</P>
<P>
   Like sailors on permanent shore leave, politicians find ways of
pushing public spending up and up. Although tight spending ``caps''
are supposedly in place, they are being breached through fake
``emergency'' appropriations and other accounting gimmicks, which
aren't subject to mandatory ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   About the sole curb on outlays is a desire, fed by political
posturing, to fence off the Social Security ``trust fund.'' But
that's a phony too, because the seemingly sacrosanct ``fund'' flows
directly into the Treasury's general coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Reality No. 4: For all the puffery, the budget fight embodies
marginal differences over micro-issues. Neither the president nor
the Congress shows any genuine interest in tackling truly major
problems, such as reforming health care policy or coping with the
coming crunch of aging Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the long run, it won't matter too much whether they spend
an additional $1.3 billion to put more cops on the beat, as Clinton
wants, or spend $325 million for this purpose, as Congress would
have it. In the end, they'll probably split the difference, with
each side claiming credit for whatever emerges.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there'll again come a time when politicians must face
some tough choices. And when that time comes, today's limited
quarrel over borderline issues in a booming economy will depart
from the Washington scene.

COMMENTARY: `DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Oslo the other day, the ex-KGB man who is
Russia's prime minister of the month delivered a letter from
President Yeltsin to President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Bill,'' I am told it began, ``I would like to share with
you, in confidence and with the utmost candor'' _ and then a
Kremlin spokesman put out, in less confidence, the guts of the
letter: that if the U.S. proceeded to mount any defense of its
territory against nuclear missiles, ``it would have extremely
dangerous consequences for the entire arms control process.''
</P>
<P>
   That threat _ signed ``Respectfully, B. Yeltsin'' _ puts Clinton
in a bind. He is acutely aware of the dilemma that is likely to
face his successor:
</P>
<P>
   A rogue state invades its neighbor, threatening some vital U.S.
interest. The U.S. president mobilizes a strike force to stop the
aggression. The dictator responds with a threat to fire a nuclear
missile at New York.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. president turns to the director of central
intelligence, who says: ``We suspect that state may have an
untested nuclear device. We know that it has a stolen
intercontinental missile. The odds are 50-50 that he is bluffing.
Of course, because we adhere to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty, we have no defense against such an incoming missile.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you decide, Mr. President? Do you call the possible
bluff, resolutely defending our interests abroad at the risk of
losing an American city? Or do you prudently back down, blaming
Bill Clinton for his legacy of leaving this country naked to its
new enemies?
</P>
<P>
   This is not a novel or a movie plot. As states like Iraq, Iran,
Sudan and North Korea develop the technology of terror, and as
well-financed terrorist organizations buy the components of nuclear
missiles, that agonizing choice is more likely than not to face our
president _ unless we start now to deploy a defense that can shoot
down a score or two of incoming missiles. That would counter the
threat before it materializes.
</P>
<P>
   Why do Yeltsin's manipulators pretend to see this as a strategic
threat to their thousands of missiles? Why are they enlisting China
and the United Nations in a campaign to deny the United States this
rudimentary protection from rogue states? Why do they
ostentatiously test their SS-19s and antimissile missiles,
threatening an end to strategic arms control if we build a tactical
umbrella for a nuclear-rainy day?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Yeltsin position seems irrational. The
Russians know a defense against individual missiles would not
challenge their nuclear superpower status. They know that the
development of missiles that kill missiles _ which they could steal
from or wheedle out of us _ would protect them from a growing
threat from Iran's Islamic fundamentalists on their border and in
Chechnya. Then why their fuss?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It's their main leverage on us. Using our outdated
treaty with a USSR that no longer exists, Russia will extort the
highest price it can in economic and military aid for graciously
granting America permission to defend itself against rogue-state
missiles. By posing ABM as a matter of principle, B. Yeltsin will
respectfully hold us up for all he can.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach is to buy the Russians off with economic aid
and improvements on their radar. He sees John McCain making our
nuclear nakedness a campaign issue, and George W. Bush will deal
with it in his Nov. 19 foreign policy address at the Reagan
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Clinton will weigh the state of our antimissile
technology, the budget-busting cost of a limited system, the
growing threat from rogue states and the attitude of allies like
Japan toward theater defenses. Then I'll bet he will offend the
Democratic left with a decision in early summer to deploy a limited
system _ just in time to strike a tough pose for the political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners here are having none of this time-consuming,
unnecessary and expensive negotiation. President Nixon made sure
the ABM treaty had a withdrawal clause. If we now tried to buy
minor alterations to the old treaty, we would undercut our ability
to soon build an effective land- and sea-based, space-monitored
defense.
</P>
<P>
   This is no time for dancing with bears. Too many American lives
are at stake. We need National Missile Defense now.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another barrier for the Gaza Strip
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 7, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been 30 years since I've been to the Gaza Strip. In that
span, the narrow shred of mostly arid land bordering the
Mediterranean has seen little progress from the days when it was a
refugee haven for Palestinians fleeing Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A report in last Sunday's New York Times about the new ``safe
passage'' highway between Gaza and the West Bank depicted an
internecine schism _ the West Bankers resenting Gazans now coming
to their towns and villages in search of jobs, of offering to work
for less. There is a comparable fear in the West Bank of a repeat
of the economic problems caused when affluent West Germany merged
with financially and infrastructure-deficient East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It never has surprised me that the people of the Gaza Strip
resorted to upheaval and violence under all those years of Israeli
occupation. Ever since the Egyptians abandoned them after the
creation of modern-day Israel, the Gazans have been shoved into a
corner _ more likely,

THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT RICKY AND RICKY MANIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Accent marks needed over first e in Miserables and third a
in Amaras) 
 
By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ So you think you know every last ``loca'' detail about
Ricky Martin?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to impress friends and family, keep reading.
Some of these tidbits may surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   And if you fancy yourself the ultimate Ricky maniac, this will
serve as a prelude to his ``Livin' la Vida Loca'' tour, which is a
third of the way through its 25-city run.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which is a well-oiled blend of Las Vegas glitz,
accessible Latin rhythms and at least two pairs of leather pants,
clocks in at about 105 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a carefully orchestrated, relentlessly upbeat celebration
of his persona and his music, right down to his barefoot encore of
``La Copa de la Vida'' (The Cup of Life). But you've got to hand it
to Martin: Nobody else looks better amid a sea of streamers and
confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the Ricky factor has run pretty high in the last few
months. Along with that ubiquitous ``Loca'' hit, Martin has made
fans _ both female and male _ swoon with the moody ballad ``She's
All I Ever Had,'' and he's shaking those million-dollar hips again
in the clip for his latest single, ``Shake Your Bon-Bon.''
</P>
<P>
   He's an award- and talk-show regular, and he's recently popped
up in TV spots for Pepsi's Goza el Sabor (Joy of Cola) campaign,
with commercials airing on Univision, Telemundo and Galavision.
</P>
<P>
   Overexposure? Maybe. But until the next music wave hits, the
view is pretty good from where we're standing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MUSICAL BACKGROUND &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin's Menudo days began when he was 12. He left the bilingual
boy-band in 1989 when he reached 17, the group's age limit. Between
roles on soap operas (as ``General Hospital's'' brooding bartender
Miguel Morez) and on Broadway (as Marius in ``Les Miserables''),
Martin built a rabid Latin fan base.
</P>
<P>
   His self-titled, Spanish-language debut album was released in
1992, and it was followed by ``Me ''Amaras`` (1993), ''A Medio
Vivir`` (1995) and ''Vuelve`` (1998). Sales of those releases
soared past the 15-million mark before Martin even thought about
recording an English-language album.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 hit ``Maria'' introduced Martin to a wider audience and
became a club hit in the United States. Since then, the
hip-swiveling hero has scored No. 1 hits in 30 countries. The
United States, then, was just catching up when Martin's performance
of ``La Copa de la Vida'' (The Cup of Life) at the Grammy Awards
set hearts racing. His English-language album has sold more than 5
million copies in the States alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HIS FAVORITE MUSIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Martin was growing up, his radio blasted '80s pop-rock.
</P>
<P>
   Music by Boston, Cheap Trick, Journey, David Bowie and Annie
Lennox topped his list of favorites. (Just listen to the swooping
instrumentation on ``I Am Made of You'' and ``Private Emotion,''
two songs on his English-language debut album, and you'll hear the
influences.) Martin also admires Latin stars Julio Iglesias and
Celia Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own music, Martin holds an affinity for ``Vuelve,''
the heartbreaking title track of his 1997 album, penned by
singer/songwriter Franco de Vita.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a lucky charm for me,'' Martin said, just before
launching into the hit onstage in Miami. ``It's a song that talks
about the ups and downs of life, especially love. Most of us have
been through that ... when somebody just leaves. It makes us
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHAKING HIS BON-BON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did Ricky Martin learn to shake his bon-bon?
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, much of Martin's dance skill is in the jeans, uh,
genes.
</P>
<P>
   To help him polish his steps for the ``Livin' la Vida Loca''
tour, Martin enlisted the help of dancer and choreographer
extraordinaire Tina Landon.
</P>
<P>
   You may have caught a glimpse of Landon in the MTV Video Music
Awards show, when she shared the stage with Martin to accept the
awards for Best Dance Video and Best Choreography in a Video.
</P>
<P>
   Landon also created the zippy moves for the Livin' la Vida Loca
and Shake Your Bon-Bon videos, as well as an upcoming Martin TV
special.
</P>
<P>
   Landon's other clients include best pal Janet Jackson, Jennifer
Lopez and Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT IS CASA SALSA? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a spicy dance studio where Martin learns his moves.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it's a trendy Puerto Rican restaurant that opened last
December on Miami's South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is one of the owners, and he's said to stop by the eatery
every couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   It offers ethnic selections, along with more standard items
spiced with some Puerto Rican flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't plan a trip any time soon, expecting to run into
Martin while you're being seated. He will be on tour until early
December.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHO DOESN'T LOVE HIM? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the title of Most Unlikely Fans goes to
octogenarian sisters June Taylor and Marilyn Taylor Gleason, who
attended Martin's opening-night show in Miami. Salsa singer Luis
Enrique was also spotted trying to slip away from clamoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   June was the choreographer for the June Taylor Dancers, regulars
on ``The Jackie Gleason Show,'' and Marilyn is the widow of the
legendary actor and comedian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is absolutely marvelous,'' said Gleason, chatting outside
the Miami Arena as a car waited to whisk her away. ``I wish my
husband could be alive to see him, because he would certainly
appreciate him, too. (My sister and I) adored him _ his
personality, his show-biz sense. He has a marvelous voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor agreed wholeheartedly, commending Martin's ``movement _
his natural movement is fantastic. He was born with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who has seen Martin move onstage will argue with that.

OVER THE EDGE WITH ADAM SANDLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `BIG DADDY'
</P>
<P>
   1999, PG-13, Columbia TriStar, CC, VHS $21.96, DVD $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor and producer, Adam Sandler has ``edge,'' the quality
that eluded Albert Brooks' middle-age screenwriter in ``The Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' character wrote literate, artistic scripts _ which
wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandler can tell a tired tale and get away with it _ because
he has edge.
</P>
<P>
   That edge enables Sandler to have it both ways in ``Big Daddy,''
a movie that wallows in manipulative sentiment while Sandler
performs the same kind of abrasive, crude and belligerent humor
that's made him a very rich man.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment comes from an irresistibly cute 5-year-old (played
alternately by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse) who's dropped into the
lap of Sonny (Sandler), poster boy for slackers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He's the slacker ideal because he has it all.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Sonny is shiftless, loutish, self-absorbed and given to
fits of temper. But that doesn't stop him from having a gorgeous
girlfriend, a slew of helpful buddies and a mammoth New York
apartment. (Hey, it's a movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sonny doesn't have a kid, and as movies have taught us,
anyone without a kid lives a hollow, desperate life with no
possibility of true happiness or fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny figures this out and quickly warms to the idea of
fatherhood, even though it goes against every aspect of his
character.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it all up to love. He adores the little guy, and the boy
loves him.
</P>
<P>
   Love _ in a Sandler film? Well, it worked in ``The Wedding
Singer.'' But it doesn't work here _ not when the bulk of the movie
has Sandler's '90s brand of ``edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969's ``Easy Rider,'' Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper had edge
because they were anti-establishment bikers living as they pleased
_ wildly _ but hurting no one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999's ``Big Daddy,'' Sandler has edge thanks to boorish,
vulgar and violent behavior. He's not ``Father Knows Best.'' He's
``The Jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the sins of the father figure are passed to the
surrogate son.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny thinks it's cool to teach free-spirited antics to the kid,
even when that means cursing, violently assailing in-line skaters,
invading people's homes and threatening them, or throwing
customers' food on the floor at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Still more edge comes from repeated scenes of urination,
vomiting, urination, spitting and _ oh, yes _ urination.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Sonny is more like an indulgent big brother than a
worthwhile dad doesn't seem to matter. He's the alleged hero, and
we're prodded to pull for him to get custody of the kid, even
during an absurdly phony courtroom scene.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Buscemi, Jon Stewart and Rob Schneider have moments in
small roles, but Joey Lauren Adams _ so wonderful in ``Chasing
Amy'' _ is wasted as Sonny's oddly patient and easy-to-please new
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this movie, as a product, worked. ``Big Daddy'' earned $163
million in theaters. Speaking of products, it often plays more like
a commercial than a movie, thanks to so many plugs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that part of the edgy hard-sell. These days, when even
car ads blare with extreme-sports chaos, why shouldn't a film about
adoption play like a raucous night at Hooters (another plug ``Big
Daddy'' makes _ ceaselessly)?
</P>
<P>
   It's all about edge, baby, and if you don't have it, then _ like
Brooks' Oscar-nominated but studio-shunned screenwriter _ you just
don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 1 1/2 stars.

`JACK FROST' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1998, PG, Warner, CC, VHS $19.96, DVD $24.98
</P>
<P>
   For its first 40 minutes, this is a playful, joyful and engaging
domestic comedy about a musician dad (Michael Keaton), a sweet mom
(Kelly Preston) and a cute kid (Joseph Cross) in snowy Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dad dies in a car crash, the kid plays his magic harmonica,
and faster than you can say ``Give me a break!'' Dad's spirit
inhabits a large snowman on the front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   What ensues is a ludicrous ``boy and his snowman'' adventure
straight out of E.T. country and couched in sentiments that don't
add up.
</P>
<P>
   Special effects come from ILM and the Jim Henson Creature Shop.
The snowman is a life-sized animatronic puppet that works well
enough for a snowman.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole idea of a walking, talking snowman is so
preposterous and stupid that it doesn't matter. Besides, with his
beady eyes and branch arms, he's a bit creepy _ even with Keaton's
jovial voice.
</P>
<P>
   The kid comes from a tired movie mold. He shows no gratitude for
having loving parents but instead resents it mightily when Dad's
big gig keeps him from watching a pee-wee hockey game. (The kid's
team always loses, so you'd think he'd prefer Dad didn't show up.)
</P>
<P>
   Keaton is fun, with a boisterous charm in his human scenes.
Preston is also far more appealing here than in her needy role in
``For Love of the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   But 40 minutes don't make a movie, and this one gets buried in
an avalanche of wrong-headed humor and a heart that turns to mush _
make that slush.

 &HT;    Award's principles put quality in schools
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOVALL, N.C. _ Out here amid the trailer homes and rusty-roof
barns, where education was headed down a rutted road to mediocrity,
lessons from corporate America are rejuvenating Stovall-Shaw
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   School districts across the country are putting to work in
classrooms successful methods from the corporate world. Some of the
most dramatic changes are happening here in North Carolina in such
unlikely places as Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   The elementary school looks ordinary. It's been around for 50
years, a red-brick fixture in rural, blue-collar Granville County,
just south of the Virginia line. Yellow buses park out front. A
crackly voice from the public address system echoes through the
main hallway, which, like most of the building, has the personality
of apple butter on toast. Walls are beige, the floor brown.
</P>
<P>
   But in Anne Fitz's sixth-grade classroom, the students are fixed
on Tamsin Norris. The 11-year-old is wandering around with her eyes
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find me where my voice is,'' said Fitz, 36, a
teacher for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tamsin's classmates giggle as she bumps into desks. When she
nears the teacher, the game ends. Then the lesson begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the one thing that she lacked?'' Fitz asked, walking
among the two dozen students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vision,'' they said. ``Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is vision?'' asked Fitz, making a point that symbolizes
the importance of setting goals and other business principles in
the state's education reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can achieve your goals if you can envision what they look
like and see how to get there,'' said Fitz.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the business world, administrators and teachers
at Stovall-Shaw Elementary set goals to solve problems ranging from
bathroom cleanliness to student attendance. They use flow charts to
prepare lesson plans and to organize how students go from their
classrooms to the gymnasium for physical education.
</P>
<P>
   Fitz's students started the school year by debating and writing
a vision statement. Each student signed it, and Fitz posted it on
the dark green chalkboard at the front of the cramped classroom.
Students can revise it at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it reads: ``We will show respect, cooperation, and
acceptance of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is part of Fitz's belief in empowering students to
think and act on their own. It's also the mantra of total quality
management, a corporate concept finding a place in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   `CUSTOMER SERVICE'
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, principals and teachers who use business
techniques to organize their schools and classrooms report higher
standardized test scores, better attendance and less disruption and
violence among students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fundamentally changing the way we do business by
focusing on customer service,'' said Mike Ward, sounding more like
a salesman than the North Carolina superintendent of education.
</P>
<P>
   In public education, Ward said, the customers include students,
parents and the local governing boards and state legislatures that
dole out tax dollars to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, customers weren't getting much for their
money in North Carolina, historically laggard in national student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, national educators took notice of the Tar Heel state.
The National Education Goals Panel reported that students in North
Carolina and Texas had scored the greatest average gains in state
testing of reading, writing and math basic since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state test results show improvements as well, with 69
percent of North Carolina's 1.2 million students scoring at or
above grade level on tests in reading and math. Six years ago, 53
percent were capable of grade-level work.
</P>
<P>
   The goals panel commissioned a study to explain North Carolina's
progress. Published in August, it concluded that cooperation among
educators, the business community and state government in a
six-year initiative called ``Total Quality in Education'' has
played a big role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it as a way to engage business expertise in
partnerships that will really help transform education,'' said
Peggy Siegel, the North Carolina report's author.
</P>
<P>
   As director of business and education leadership initiatives at
the National Alliance of Business, a nonprofit organization in
Washington, Siegel is at the forefront of the movement to instill
business principles in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1991, Pinellas County, Fla., was among the first
places in the nation to embrace business methods across its entire
district. In seeking a way to assess the performance of its
program, the Tampa Bay district adopted the criteria of the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous other school systems _ including North Carolina's _
have modeled their programs on Pinellas County's. They, too, have
adopted the Baldrige criteria to judge their results.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established the prestigious award in 1987, the year
Malcolm Baldrige died. As President Ronald Reagan's commerce
secretary, Baldrige had realized many American businesses needed to
restructure themselves dramatically to compete globally.
</P>
<P>
   Baldrige envisioned a rigorous competition among U.S.
corporations that would measure improvements in planning,
productivity, profitability, treatment of employees and customer
service. Managed by the Commerce Department and the private sector,
the award has emerged as a widely accepted model of business
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, the Baldrige competition is open
to educational organizations. That category attracted 16
nominations (the organizations haven't been disclosed). President
Clinton and Commerce Secretary William Daley are expected to
announce the winners soon.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Baldrige criteria, school districts share a common
rulebook for measuring their performance. It breeds cooperation and
competition among schools, answering some critics of public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missing element in public education is not a missing set
of Baldrige principles,'' said John Hood, president of the John
Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. ``It is the competition
that makes those principles important.'' TEACHERS' VIEWS MIXED
</P>
<P>
   The increasing savvy of North Carolina's education reforms drew
a national award last month. The National Alliance for Business
selected the North Carolina Partnership for Excellence as a
recipient of a distinguished performance award.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit partnership is an offshoot of North Carolina's
six-year effort to incorporate business practices in the classroom.
Shortly after he was elected governor in 1992, Jim Hunt met with
state business leaders, who complained that partnerships between
companies and schools had done little to improve student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders started anew in 1993, creating pilot projects in six
school districts, including Granville County. Using the Baldrige
criteria to judge results, school officials teamed up with nearby
corporations and colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In Granville County, an official with IBM helped the
superintendent figure out how to make the district's budget process
work more smoothly. It involved the principles of individual
schools taking greater responsibility for deciding how much money
they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's cool is that schools are empowered to do this,'' Davis
said. ``They are now fixing problems that I do not even know we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by improving student achievement, the state
Legislature began allocating funds in 1995 to expand the pilot
project. It has now spread to 45 school districts, which have
volunteered to incorporate business practices. The goal is to reach
all 116 districts by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Carolina has taken such marvelous flight,'' said Chris
Harwell, a trainer for the Pinellas County school district who has
worked with North Carolina educators.
</P>
<P>
   Not all teachers embrace the new methods, not even in districts
like Granville County, where efforts have been under way the
longest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This too shall pass _ that's the attitude among some
teachers,'' said Fitz. But for her, a return to tradition, with
teachers being the undisputed boss, would be unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to be a boss; I want to be a leader,'' Fitz
said. ``Listen to the difference. Which one sounds more appealing
to you?''

 &HT;    Noted mediator prepares new era
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Usery has been at the center of a lot of fights
most of his working life.
</P>
<P>
   In his nearly 40 years in labor management mediation, Usery has
traveled extensively to keep the peace and resolve conflicts. His
work has taken him inside Russian coal mines and behind the scenes
of one of the nastiest sporting brawls in recent memory: the 1994
Major League Baseball strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most difficult dispute I've ever been in,'' Usery,
75, said. He was appointed as a special mediator in the dispute by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Usery, who heads a Washington-based labor management
consulting firm, is still making his pitch as a peacemaker. The
former secretary of labor was in town this week to participate in a
conference at Georgia State University's W.J. Usery Jr. Center for
the Workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference on alternative dispute resolution began
Tuesday and ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the center will unveil its computer lab, an innovative
way to help companies and individuals solve workplace problems.
</P>
<P>
   Usery, a Milledgeville, Ga., native, talked about the center and
the future of the workplace in an interview at the red brick
facility in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why was the Usery center established?
</P>
<P>
   A: To resolve workplace problems. We have a whole lot of laws in
this country. We're trying to figure out how we can minimize
workplace disputes. It doesn't necessarily have to be unions at
all. (We're also looking at how) do we get more effective
production at work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the center do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: We facilitate. We do mediation. We do training, education
and, through the computer lab, we do general consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The center is building a reputation for its work in
alternative dispute resolution. Are more companies turning to ADR?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think so, and more will be turning to it. It takes so long,
and it's so costly to go through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been working 50 years, and most of that time has been
spent in labor and management relations. How has the workplace
changed?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I was first working in a machine shop, you operated the
lathe yourself. Now it's computer-operated. Workers are more
specialized and more high-tech than before. We live in a very
tense, fast-moving world. Demand is greater. Expectations are very
high for people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the three biggest workplace issues in the new
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, we've got to do something about our primary
public school systems. We've got to prepare people for the next
generation of high technology that will be thrust upon us. Then,
how do we work together in the workplace? How do we work
competitively to compete with other countries?
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent Rutgers University study gave Georgia employers low
marks overall in their treatment of women and minorities. Since
that study came out, several large Georgia firms have been hit with
discrimination lawsuits. What's your assessment of Georgia's record
in its treatment of workers?
</P>
<P>
   A: I haven't seen the Rutgers study. I wouldn't argue with the
figures. But, generally, employers are becoming more sophisticated
(in the way management and workers) work together and in being
fair.
</P>
<P>
   We're trying to provide training programs for supervisors and
managers, not only so that they know the laws but understand the
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In our conference, we're going to use a case study on Home Depot
(class-action employment discrimination suit) to see what was done
right, what was done wrong and how we can avoid this in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very important case to see how such lawsuits can be
avoided in the future.

   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four

against the University of Texas law school. The case is being

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T ads place call to the future
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AT&AMP;T's current ad campaign is either brilliant or
woefully premature.
</P>
<P>
   So say a mix of analysts about a series of slick spots on
television and full-page spreads in papers running in Atlanta and
elsewhere. The ads tout AT&AMP;T as a premier telecommunications
provider in realms such as local phone service, high-speed Internet
access and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T is still months away from federal approval of a
proposed merger with MediaOne, which would be
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's conduit for all of those services in a number of markets,
including Atlanta, where it has more than 600,000 customers. The
ads not only do not mention MediaOne, they give no hint of
hesitation as AT&AMP;T reaches out to consumers who have been getting
cable and phone service from someone else for at least 15 years _
customers who don't currently have access to AT&AMP;T services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is now,'' trumpet the television ads, while
newspaper ads proclaim, ``It's all within your reach.''
</P>
<P>
   True, AT&AMP;T is investing $140 billion, including the big-ticket
purchases of Tele-Communications Inc. and MediaOne, which will give
it cable access to about 30 percent of the nation's homes. But it's
not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T abandoned local phone service in the 1984 breakup that
created BellSouth and the other regional phone companies. AT&AMP;T
hasn't yet returned to local residential service in Atlanta and
doesn't have cable service for high-speed Internet or even
television, although it hopes to be able to offer all of those
services in bundles to customers soon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, MediaOne in Atlanta still has a large image problem,
with many customers still angry about what they feel has been lousy
service. That resentment has been sharpened by years of ads in
which MediaOne touted high-speed service that was still unavailable
to many customers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Bryant Steele said consumers are not calling to
order services the company can't provide. Consumers are smart
enough to understand that the ads convey
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's postmerger intention, not its current offerings, he said.
``It talks about what benefits will be _ better, cheaper, faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is meant to make a connection _ in the minds of
consumers, Steele said. ``We want them to think of us. We want them
to think of quality and customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Bund, a consultant and lecturer in marketing at the
Sloan School of MIT, said AT&AMP;T is taking a huge risk with its
greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T is seen as promising more than it can provide, it will
annoy the most assertive customers, the ones who are quickest to
switch companies, she said. ``In software they call this vaporware.
It could come across as not being honest, and it's not something a
leading brand should do.''
</P>
<P>
   She scoffed at the notion that ads run now may also affect
future consumer choices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, AT&AMP;T is betting on bundling _ an assumption about
consumer behavior that has not been proven, she said. ``And if
you've got a strong brand name, you've got to be more careful, not
more callous.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is widely viewed as one of the best-known, most-respected
brand names on the planet. While AT&AMP;T has swiftly moved to guide
MediaOne's image-improvement efforts, officials have vowed not to
slap the AT&AMP;T brand name on the service until they are satisfied
with its quality.
</P>
<P>
   So what is AT&AMP;T up to with these ads? Is the huge company
repeating MediaOne's mistakes? Is AT&AMP;T promising too much too soon
and misleading consumers by jumping the gun?
</P>
<P>
   Blaik Kirby, vice president at Renaissance Worldwide, a
Boston-based consulting group, said AT&AMP;T must make sure MediaOne
service is up to snuff, but eventually its tarnished reputation
won't matter, he said. ``Whether MediaOne is a good brand in
Atlanta is not relevant, because they are going to leverage the
AT&AMP;T brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Under AT&AMP;T's name, the service will succeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is that demand will far exceed their
expectations,'' Kirby said. ``A lot of people will be ready to drop
their local phone company. There will be a segment of the market
that is loyal, but anytime you have more than a 15 percent
differential in price, you'll have people switching.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``bundling'' of cable television, Internet, local,
long-distance and even wireless phone service will permit some
hefty discounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has starting offering its own version of high-speed
data and video services via a technology known as Digital
Subscriber Lines. DSL can be delivered over existing copper phone
wires, although to catch up with cable will still require a
substantial investment from BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to packages of services, BellSouth remains at a
disadvantage, still months away from even asking the Federal
Communications Commission for permission to offer long-distance.
BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher said the AT&AMP;T ads bolster
BellSouth's claim that its markets are as open as required for
permission to enter long-distance. ``They are touting these
services so they must believe our markets are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory marketing Professor Devon Johnson suggested, ``They are
signaling that they are serious, that they will be here for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   To some competitors the message is: back off. To others that are
committed to this market, like BellSouth, the signal may instill
some urgency. For consumers, the ads are not expected to produce an
immediate reaction, Johnson said. ``These are decisions that people
make over a two- or three-month period. AT&AMP;T is saying, come and
talk to us before you make a purchase.''

 &HT;    Watch out for flying wood pieces
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ For the first time in about three weeks,
I'm walking around without a bandage on some part of my body. All
my wounds have healed, leaving me with some fresh scars on a body
already well-tattooed with the reminders of past accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Woodworking may be easy on the mind, a stress reliever that even
beats golf for lowering blood pressure, but it's rough on the body.
I wear eye protection, ear protection, follow directions carefully
and still manage to injure myself at an alarming rate. My friends
have taken to asking me to hold up my hands to make sure all digits
are still attached when they see me. The latest mishap came when my
jointer-planer rejected a piece of hard-rock maple and kicked it
back, impaling it in the palm of my hand quicker than you can say
Tim Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   I had taken the weekday off, using up some vacation, the plan
being to spend the entire day piddling with wood. First I hauled
two black-walnut railroad ties up the road to a portable sawmill to
be made into one-bys, which gave me the opportunity to hook up the
trailer and do that East Texas hauling thing, check out some cool
machinery and admire furniture made at the sawmill. Finally, I
putzed around in the shop, making turning blanks for the lathe from
the maple for a minor project _ a wooden mallet.
</P>
<P>
   A jointer-planer is a wicked looking piece of machinery, about 4
feet long and 2 feet deep, and weighs as much as one of my
ex-sisters-in law, which is substantial. Its primary purpose is to
true the edges of boards so that when you attach them, as in a
table, there's no gap. You can also plane the wide side of a board,
but a thickness planer works better for that. The jointer-planer
has a cylinder with three sharp blades that rotate rapidly and
shave off the wood in small increments, usually about a sixteenth
of an inch. When I bought it a while back, the salesman told me
about how when he first used one, he didn't have the blades set
right, and it kicked the board back through the garage wall and
into his bedroom, where it landed on the bed. I chuckled and made a
mental note to make sure the blades were set correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, after a number of successful uses of this
infernal machine, I was running a piece of hard-rock maple through
it. It's called hard-rock maple for a good reason, and I found out
when one of the blades caught in the wood and it kicked back, the
corner ripping open the palm of my hand in a split second, bouncing
back and taking a chunk off a knuckle on my other hand.
</P>
<P>
   There were some bad words spoken on that fine fall day, blood
spurting across the concrete and me hopping around in big-time
pain, reminding me of a quotation I cherish: ``At no time is free
speech more precious than immediately after one has hit his thumb
with a hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   I washed the wound, put on a bandage, and headed to the golf
course for an appointed round. I know: This really is a great
country. However, I only lasted a few holes before wimping out on
my buddies and quitting. By the next morning, I realized the wound
wasn't going to heal with just a Band-Aid, and headed to the
doctor. He chastised me for waiting so long, muttered darkly about
infection, soaked my hand in some maroon goop for about an hour,
put three stitches in my palm and had the nurse wrap my hand in
about 73 feet of white gauze. It reminded me of the Invisible Man's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a while since I've had stitches, about 25 years or so,
the last time coming when I was dumb enough to play tackle football
on the SFA intramural fields without equipment and someone tap
danced across my head, splitting my eyebrow open and leaving me
with one brow that has about half the hair as the other. Stitches
aren't pleasant, but there are worse medical procedures _ though
when the doctor stuck that needle in my hand I wondered if perhaps
I should find another hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, things were looking up. I even took the
stitches out myself, reasoning that there was no reason to cool my
heels in the doctor's office to cut a few pieces of thread. Call me
Dr. Borders. I bought a pair of thick leather gloves to wear while
using the evil jointer-planer, and since rigging a cable-TV hookup
out in the shop to watch the World Series, I have spent most
nonwork hours out there building Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   The scar on my palm will be there for good, making it more
difficult for me to assume a new identity if that becomes
necessary. (Look for the short, balding man with a chunk taken out
of his right palm, and the wispy left eyebrow, the APB will say.) I
finished building the wooden mallet with minimal difficulty. It
looks like something you'd make in eighth-grade shop class, but
since I never took shop I'm proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   A friend tried to comfort me by telling a story about an
employee of his who took early retirement to go into woodworking
full time and promptly sliced off a couple of fingers. It's great
to have support like that. Think I'll scratch him off the
woodworking Christmas list.

 &HT;    35-city tour turns out to be a Block-buster
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The always-entertaining Lawrence Block
had enough of the usual eight-to-10-city book tour, so, with the
recent publication of ``The Burglar in the Rye,'' he designed his
own. Renting an Olds Cutlass, Block took off on the road to 35
cities, smaller ones, places like Dayton, Ohio, Tucson, Ariz., and
Wichita, Kan., that usually don't see a lot of authors.
</P>
<P>
   Block booked his own tour, taking special care to include
mystery bookstores wherever he could. The result was that Block
attracted crowds comparable to the ones in Boston and Chicago
bookstores _ and made some serious friends in the bookstore
community, which can translate into good displays, which can
translate into sales.
</P>
<P>
   Every little bit helps.
</P>
<P>
   SEMPER FI ...
</P>
<P>
   The market might be a small one, but ``Stars in the Corps''
(Naval Institute Press, $29.95) held my interest. It's a
run-through of the various Hollywood stars and character actors who
have done time in the Marines. They range from Tyrone Power, who
had a very interesting World War II career as a Flying Leatherneck
ferrying soldiers, to Lee Marvin, who was a sniper wounded on
Saipan.
</P>
<P>
   Other people covered by the book include Robert Ryan, Gene
Hackman, George C. Scott, Brian Dennehy, Brian Keith (a gunner for
the Flying Tigers) and Steve McQueen, who seems to have spent as
much of his time in the brig as he did on active duty; he was
busted from private first class to private several times,
apparently for going AWOL over a woman. In spite of such goofing
off, McQueen was somehow assigned to security detail aboard Harry
Truman's presidential yacht, the Sequoia.
</P>
<P>
   FAIR WARNING ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Drafts'' (Prometheus, $18.95) is a examination of
writers' suicides. You may have noticed that a great many
ink-stained wretches hurry themselves out of this vale of tears,
and Mark Seinfelt's book takes on the famous (Hemingway, Plath,
Mishima) as well as some of the more obscure (Anne Sexton, Primo
Levi) and also includes a redundant section on writers who have
contemplated suicide _ more or less anybody who's ever gotten a bad
review_ but who decided to live nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE ..
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right not to change anything, but don't be a
fool. Change things if somebody else is right. But if you do change
something because somebody else is right, you must instantly take
credit for it yourself. That's very important.''

 &HT;    Excerpts of John Ford biography
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's Note: Scott Eyman, a film historian and Books Editor of
The Palm Beach Post, has written a new biography on one of
America's greatest film- makers, Print the Legend: The Life and
Times of John Ford (Simon and Schuster; $40). In this exclusive
excerpt, Eyman writes about Ford's cantankerous, sometimes cruel
personality, which hid the sensitive soul in his American movie
sagas, from Stagecoach to The Grapes of Wrath to The Searchers.
</P>
<P>
   The old man was in rare form, and he had picked a fine place for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lido is a tree-covered island about eight miles long and a
few hundred yards wide that forms the eastern boundary of the
Venice lagoon. The broad, sandy beaches face the Adriatic, while
the lagoon side looks back to the heart of Venice, fifteen minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of September 1971, John Ford came to the Lido,
to the jauntily arabesque Excelsior Hotel. He was a frail,
77-year-old man in bad health who invariably contrived to give the
impression that he was not to be trifled with.
</P>
<P>
   And now there was a critic at the door, come for his scheduled
interview. Barbara Ford, her father's traveling companion and
handler, politely told the critic that the interview might not be
possible; Daddy was being inconvenienced by some sudden stomach
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come in, come in,'' yelled John Ford from the lavatory. ``I
can deal with two (things) at once.''
</P>
<P>
   The critic soon disposed of, a couple of people from the British
Film Institute arrived to talk to him about their upcoming season
devoted to his films. He hadn't wanted to do any more talking, but
Barbara said that she'd ``go ask Daddy.'' She came back quickly.
``Daddy said he would give you three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was now in bed, looking rough and ready. Ken Wlaschin, the
director of the B.F.I., told him that they were looking for 35mm
prints of some of his rarer films. It was a subject of no interest
to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you come from?'' he asked Wlaschin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I can understand what you say. And where do you come
from?'' Ford said, turning to John Gillett.
</P>
<P>
   ``London.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand a goddamn thing you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Being put on the defensive was the customary surcharge for the
pleasure of his company, and your reaction to the tough, unhelpful
persona he had perfected would determine whether or not you were
worthy to endure more of it. Gillett made a quick mental
calculation that capitulation would be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' he said, ``I'll move a little closer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Gillett explained that a number of artists were going to be
given awards and declared Maestros of Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Marcel Carne ... ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Bergman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ingrid?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ingmar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh. He called me one of his favorites ... ``
</P>
<P>
   An hour past their allotted three minutes, it was time for
Wlaschin and Gillett to leave. John Ford had to get ready for the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two closing night films of that year's Venice Film
Festival was Directed by John Ford, a documentary by Peter
Bogdanovich that traced Ford's career from his first directorial
efforts in 1917. It was narrated by Orson Welles, contained
excerpts from 26 of Ford's more than 140 films, interviews with
John Wayne, Henry Fonda, James Stewart and some hilariously
cursory, unhelpful comments from Ford himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rich tapestry that effectively communicated the bounty
of Ford's career, as well as his deceptive range. Here was The Iron
Horse, the first western epic, there the passionate sympathy for
the dispossessed of The Grapes of Wrath; here the moody fatalism of
sailors fighting a losing campaign in They Were Expendable, there
the romantic idyll of The Quiet Man; here the unleashed
misanthropic savagery of Ethan Edwards in The Searchers, there the
gloomy resignation of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance; here the
glowing humanity of How Green Was My Valley, there the lean,
laconic gravity of My Darling Clementine _ a tapestry of film
cumulatively creating a vision of humanity that defined a nation
and influenced the world.
</P>
<P>
   The film also gave a good sense of Ford's perverse personality.
Six Academy Awards, more than any other director has ever won, had
been presented to a man who resolutely refused to talk seriously
about movies _ his own or anybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that happened when you got an assignment with
Ford is that everybody told you legendary stories about him,''
remembered the screenwriter Winston Miller. It would often be the
famous one about a producer telling him he was five pages behind
schedule, whereupon Ford ripped five pages out of the script,
handed them to the crestfallen producer, and snapped, ``Now we're
back on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be lesser-known but similar tales, such as the one
concerning the producer who discovered that Ford had missed an
angle in a scene. Against everybody's advice, the producer went
down to the set and told Ford there was a shot missing and, maybe,
perhaps, Ford might be able to pick it up?
</P>
<P>
   ``You really think we need it?'' Ford asked. The producer said
yes. Rising from his chair, Ford said, ``You shoot it,'' walked off
the set, off the lot, and onto his boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in town knew these stories,'' said Winston Miller,
``and (everybody thought) they were true.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the stories about John Ford weren't absolutely true, they
could have been, because a lot of them were spread by him. He loved
to tell stories; whether they were true or false didn't really
matter. He would tell people the most outrageous falsehoods with a
perfectly straight face. He would assert that his father had come
to America to fight in the Civil War, when his father hadn't
arrived in America until seven years after Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man who told stories for the sake of telling stories _
to amuse his audience, of course, but mostly to amuse himself. He
would mention in passing that he knew Wyatt Earp _ quite true _
that Earp told him all about the gunfight at the OK Corral, and
that the way Ford reproduced it in My Darling Clementine was
``exactly the way it had been'' _ utterly false.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he laid down these thickets of stories so that he could
give the impression of a physically rambunctious, horny-handed son
of the soil. It was all part of the vast, comprehensive smokescreen
that was part and parcel of John Ford.
</P>
<P>
   That some of the stories turn out to be true in no way detracts
from their deceptive purposes. He was a product of the age of Teddy
Roosevelt _ self-reliance and a sense of adventure were vital
qualities for a man who made movies about and associated with men
of action. Ford tried hard to live up to the legend he created for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As a man, he delighted in pretending to be a roughneck, but his
films show that he was deeply tender and sensitive. He tested
people relentlessly, tested their abilities, their temperament,
their fears and above all their loyalty, mostly by abusing them. If
they remained loyal despite his taunts, Ford would reciprocate
forever. If they failed, or were even perceived to have failed, he
``closed the iron door on them.''
</P>
<P>
   As nearly as can be determined, he never gave himself completely
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   What John Ford brought to his movies was an innate sense of
composition, and, more importantly, a sense of the turning of the
earth, the easy rhythm of life as lived by people who have a bond
with the land.
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, he would always remain nostalgic, romantic, and,
socially speaking, innately conservative, which makes his nearly
lifelong adherence to liberal principles even more startling.
Deeply shy, he loved the physical act of making movies because it
was the only thing that enabled him to come out of himself.
Terrified of being found out to be a sensitive man and artist, he
constructed a rock-like carapace, a character that he could play.
He would be curmudgeonly old-before-his-time Jack Ford, the man who
made westerns _ half contrary, bloody-minded Irishman, half flinty
New Englander, 100 percent anarchic individualist.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of his extraordinary talent remained elusive. His
childhood had only nominal creative input, his adolescence only
slightly more so. His sole aspirations were vague longings for a
career in the Navy, which wasn't pursued until middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was John Ford, more than any director since Griffith, who
instinctively understood the potential of film, who knew how to
utilize all the devices intrinsic to the medium. He understood
pacing, framing, angles, lighting, composition. He understood
characters and reality, understood the value of myth, understood
people and understood time.
</P>
<P>
   In his work, Ford's Irish melancholy manifested itself in an
elegaic sense of loss _ for a vanished innocence, for a lost love,
for a community, for a home. Many of Ford's films are large-scale,
even epic, yet they contain the same warmth, domestic detail, and
intimacy of his small movies. His sense of rapport with the men and
women of his movies was remarkable; it is a world of genial
humanity, not of cardinal sins, but of venial, hedonistic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's deepest moments concern memory and loss _ Ma Joad burning
her letters and keepsakes before leaving for California; Frank
Skeffington walking home alone while the winner's parade moves in
the opposite direction; Abe Lincoln at the grave of Anne Rutledge;
Nathan Brittles at the grave of his wife; Hallie Stoddard remaining
in love all her life with the man who really shot Liberty Valance;
Ethan Edwards exiling himself from his family and society.
</P>
<P>
   A good case can be made that America's sense of itself, as far
as the movies are concerned, derives from two people: Frank Capra
and John Ford. Of these two men, it was John Ford who told the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Capra's supposed respect for the common man, the
films that made his reputation are largely repetitions of one
single plot trope _ ruthless businessmen finds it childishly easy
to manipulate the people to turn against the simple, lanky man of
the people, the incarnation of the mob for which Capra pretended to
have such respect.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's social vision was every bit as intense, but far more
nuanced and mature. America's humane idealism gave him his themes,
and his best films are energized by his recognition of his
country's internal conflicts; as Geoffrey O'Brien once noted,
``Behind every assertion of God and Motherhood, and Country, a
covert blasphemy peeps fitfully out; the suspicion that it might
all be a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's films can be seen as one cumulative epic of America's
national mythology as told by its foot soldiers, an elegaic,
driving history that Ford saw as part nostalgic fantasy, part
hardshell objective reality.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the westerns. Ford's westerns have the feeling of
life.You can hear the timber creak as he grafts the theme of the
odyssey with his abiding sense of unkempt humanity, the weathering
of human wood. Ford's westerns fulfill the essential requirement of
anything lasting about America _ they are about promise and,
sometimes, its betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   John Ford brought the art form to what still seems an ultimate
synthesis of character and landscape _ pictures superseding words,
meanings too deep to be explained, yearnings that must remain
unspoken. Most movies are all plot _ what happens next? _ but
Ford's movies are less about what the main character will do than
they are about the mysterious question of what he actually is.
</P>
<P>
   I have attempted to resist the oppressive moral vanity of our
age, in which biographers adopt a prosecutorial role and profess
outrage over human failings that occur nearly as frequently among
biographers as they do among artists.
</P>
<P>
   To be a serious artist is to have a single-minded mania for
control, the precise quality that makes it extremely difficult to
be a loving husband and father. To spend hundreds of pages primly
documenting every instance of ill temper or alcoholic outburst
strikes me as every bit as pointless as writing about fish and
reporting with outrage that they are cold and wet.
</P>
<P>
   The great epigram of Ford's career is, of course, ``When the
legend becomes fact, print the legend,'' from The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance. With all due respect for the amber tint of myth,
this book concerns itself with how the facts of John Martin Feeney
led to the legend of John Ford.

 &HT;    Political shorthand on both sides of the border
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The driver was talkative as he navigated the
streets of the working-class neighborhood. He likes Mexico City,
even with the hazards in the air and on the ground. Likes it even
with its crazy traffic and its even crazier politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``people who live here have a bad
reputation. If you tell someone that you're a chilango, they will
look at you strangely. They will sometimes not even talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chilango'' is slang for residents of Mexico City, and it's not
necessarily a term of endearment. Mexicans have a rather jaded view
of those who inhabit the capital city. So common is the slang word
``chilango'' that it finally has made it into a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported recently that in its entry for Mexico
City, the Orthography of the Spanish Language _ compiled by the
Royal Spanish Academy _ includes a reference to its inhabitants as
``chilangos'' for males and ``chilangas'' for females.
</P>
<P>
   What ``chilango'' means to most Mexicans is a person who is
gruff, arrogant, whiny, all wrapped in a world-revolves-around-me
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Charming, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are people, too,'' the driver protested. ``But we have the
misfortune to suffer this bad reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Globe report, the reaction to including the
nickname in the reference book is a source of both consternation
and pride. There are various theories about the origins of the
word. Some say it is a combination of a Spanish profanity that has
a variety of sexual definitions or that it refers to the Mexican
affinity for chile peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it is a nickname and a reputation that the 24 million
residents of Mexico City are stuck with.
</P>
<P>
   I told the driver I empathized. You see, I explained, I live in
the capital city of Texas and our reputation in the rest of the
state is not the best.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that Globe description of chilangos as arrogant and
whiny and convinced that the world truly does revolve around them
sounded hauntingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, I told the driver, people who live in
capital cities are often targets of derision by those who don't.
Maybe its jealousy and maybe its a natural resentment of power
others hold. How many times do we slander those who make their
livings inside that famous Washington Beltway?
</P>
<P>
   Austin is a popular target for legislators from the other parts
of Texas. This has been going on so long that ``Austin bashing'' is
now a mainstay of the Texas political vocabulary. It is shorthand
for bills that would hamper, impede, limit or otherwise have a
negative effect on the city's ability to govern itself.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some Austin politicos love to bait the legislators, and
the results are rather predictable. But they just can't wait to do
it again.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy oh boy, how we love to brag about how much better, how
much smarter and how much more tolerant we are those nimrods in the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   I figure the only difference between Austinites and chilangos is
that no one has come up with a colorful nickname for Austinites
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Have a nice day.

 &HT;    Rockcity goes modern with Web adventure
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Something's definitely going on between
Jamie and Justin.
</P>
<P>
   Kim suspected they'd hook up. Sari wasn't so sure. Mike and his
tattooed torso couldn't have cared less, and Chip was too busy
getting his tongue pierced so he could be as cool as Mike.
</P>
<P>
   But the brooding, perpetually sunglassed musician and his
flamingo-legged cutie have been disappearing for big chunks of
time. They're in the back of the bus now with the curtains drawn,
and they're wayyyy too quiet. They avoid public displays of
affection, but they cuddle up hip-to-hip and whisper to each other
on the leopard-print couch. Busted!
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes things a tad uncomfortable for the group,
stuck together on a recreational vehicle for the next 5,000 miles
and being filmed 24-7 for an Internet version of ``The Partridge
Family'' meets ``Peyton Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockcity Limits'' is the episodic road-trip documentary of six
twentysomething aspiring actors and musicians who have been packed
in a bus with stylish furnishings and asked to take the long way
across the country. Their ultimate destination: Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   For that '90s twist, they let a camera crew record every move
and broadcast it on the World Wide Web at a site called
Rockcity.com. The group tooled across Palm Beach County last week,
driving their RV through Lion Country Safari, surfing off Jupiter,
playing half-time cheerleaders during a Miami Dolphins game and
hanging out with pop group Sugar Ray in South Beach. The South
Florida segments are due to be posted on the site by the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   If you've watched cable television in the past decade, you know
that this kind of voyeuristic entertainment isn't new. Sometimes,
it's not all that interesting.
</P>
<P>
   MTV tried it seven years ago, with a show called ``The Real
World,'' throwing together a disparate band of twentysomethings for
one year and filming their lives and interactions in their big,
colossally hip pad. They partied, they fought, they had disastrous
intimate relations.
</P>
<P>
   The show was so successful, MTV put it on wheels a few years
later and called it ``Road Rules.'' Similar premise, with a Gen-X
sports angle _ bungee-jumping, rock-climbing _ and a cramped RV.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's ``Rockcity's'' turn. A joint venture between Pepsi and
World Wide Web titans Yahoo and MP3, Rockcity.com is an attempt to
re-create the types of programs offered on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The site is still under construction but plans to offer several
``channels'' of such programming as ``Hollywood Interns'' (about,
you guessed it, interns for Hollywood big shots) and ``My
Rockcity,'' where visitors can submit their own videos and
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that you, the entertainment consumer, can choose
when and where to watch TV. It's all there for the downloading. And
it's free.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the site's most prominent attraction is the soap-opera
episodes of ``Rockcity Limits,'' which debuted about three weeks
ago. During the first part of their 44-city tour, they've tried out
improv comedy with the Second City troupe in Chicago, met with
politicians in Washington D.C., and hung out at Biketoberfest in
Daytona Beach. The group is never told what their next destination
will be, so their reactions will, it is hoped, be authentic. The
cast is due to arrive in Los Angeles sometime around Thanksgiving.

 &HT;    Read this backwards
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Now that the Rev. Jerry Falwell has said that
Christians should act more charitably toward gays and lesbians, I
presume we must cancel his pay-per-view caged death match with
Tinky Winky.
</P>
<P>
   And we did so want to see the reverend in tights.
</P>
<P>
   Tinky Winky, for the generationally impaired, is one of the
Teletubbies, the tube sensations with TVs on their tum-tums. Months
ago Falwell was asserting that Tinky, with his purple suit and tote
bag (purse?) was gay and a diabolical device to lead pre-schoolers
astray.
</P>
<P>
   Diabolical if true, yes. Then again ...
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed that when someone gets on a rant about
something like this, the ranter never fully explains exactly how
the harm is delivered?
</P>
<P>
   Has some psychologist somewhere certified that a half hour
staring at magenta leotards without commercial breaks will turn
one's AC to DC?
</P>
<P>
   Really, what was the threat here?
</P>
<P>
   No one ever seems to ask questions like this. Instead of asking:
``What's with Tinky?'' Shouldn't we be asking, ``What's with the TV
preacher trying to undress him?''
</P>
<P>
   So, what's with these people, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column denouncing Al Gore's environmentalism, Cal
Thomas belched righteous flames about ``bogus science'' used to
scare the public. He rattled off the health scares _ Red Dye No. 2,
cell phones, cyclamates, electric blankets, video display terminals
and more.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard the list of so-called junk science before come from
spokesmen of the right. I'm waiting to hear one of them denounce as
nothing but the same some of the hysterias cooked up by TV
preachers and their flocks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the threat to the nation's youth via so-called
subliminal brainwashing. How many times have you heard people
assert that hidden messages are contained in Walt Disney movies?
How about the messages contained in rock records played backwards?
</P>
<P>
   We haven't heard much of the latter since compact discs came
out.
</P>
<P>
   It's junk science, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   It has been thoroughly debunked that subliminal messages can
accomplish anything. The much-ballyhooed 1950s study ``proving''
that subliminal messages could cause theater-goers to crave popcorn
was denounced by its own author, James Vicary.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas wants to decry hysteria, he might focus on those who
for so long passed along rumors about thousands of blue-eyed, blond
children being kidnapped and sacrificed by a satanic cult, most
active on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 an exhaustive FBI investigation concluded that it was
bunk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue of the day is public school's use of the
wonderfully compelling Harry Potter books, targeted by some groups
alleging that it leads children to witchcraft. (Actually, what
Harry does is lead children to read voraciously. We sure wouldn't
want that.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll notice that the practitioners of these pointless pursuits
do so in religion's name, a practice lending itself to a term I'd
like to see introduced alongside ``junk science'': try ``junk
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a WWJD bracelet, please raise your hand: Do you
think Jesus would spend his time listening to rock records
backwards, freeze-framing Walt Disney's ``Fantasia''? Dressing down
Tinky Winky? Chasing Harry Potter from the schoolyard?
</P>
<P>
   With starving people abroad and in our communities, with real
hatred, violence, general mistrust, social insulation, greed,
corporate cannibalism and more, do you really think a savior would
dwell on any of this?
</P>
<P>
   I think the answer is no. I think that a lot of so-called
Christians are spending too much time staring at their tum-tums.

 &HT;    Disjointed biography of Pius XII fails to make case of SS
collusion
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only about 20 pages of Hitler's Pope deal with the topic the
title suggests. The cover is off-message, too. The photo shows
Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pius XII, sweeping past a German Army
guard. It was made on a visit to President Paul von Hindenberg in
1927, before Adolf Hitler was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   If the title were based on what seems to grab the author, an
Oxford University fellow and a Catholic, it might have been
Concordat Politics: How the Popes Lost a Kingdom and Created a
Spiritual Realm with Oxymoronic Italian Statecraft. But that
wouldn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   The book is frustratingly hard to summarize because it keeps
glancing off course. Maybe this will give readers some idea of the
contents, however:
</P>
<P>
   John Cornwall set out to write a biography of Pacelli. Pacelli
kept no diary, talked to few, confided in no one. Not an easy
subject, but then he was a child of the church that developed after
the papal states were lost to a new Italy in 1871, and the physical
realm shrank to 108 acres of Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   OK, said the modern popes starting with Pius IX (1846-l878). We
can't match land with the crowned heads of Europe, but we are
autocrats of a bigger, spiritual realm: the Catholic Church. ``So,
there'' is strongly implied.
</P>
<P>
   Pacelli, from a family that worked for the Vatican, was ordained
a priest and worked his way up in the Vatican's diplomatic corps
while the popes were solidifying their authority.
</P>
<P>
   That included bringing other Catholic political power centers
under control. Pius XI used a treaty with Mussolini to eliminate
the Italian Catholic party. Pacelli, now secretary of state, used a
treaty with Hitler, a ``concordat,'' to get rid of the German
Catholic Center Party. When Hitler suppressed the Socialists, the
Center was the only organized opposition left, and it committed
suicide at Pacelli's behest.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a long (but fairly interesting) prologue to the
standard topic of the ``silence'' of Pius XII during World War II.
He couldn't bring himself to say the word ``Jew'' while Hitler was
murdering 6 million of them.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall had access to documents for the prospective
canonization of Pius, and he brings other new material to the
dispute. But since Pius didn't discuss his motives, what it all
means depends on interpretation, and Cornwall's is disputable.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after calling Pius ``Hitler's Pope,'' Cornwall
reports that the Fuhrer wanted to kidnap him and assigned the job
to Karl Wolff, the SS officer who later arranged the surrender of
German troops in Italy. Wolff talked Hitler out of it. Cornwall
uses the incident to show that the pope had sufficient influence
that his voice could have had an impact. But the same incident
shows that Hitler never thought he owned Pius.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, as usual, overreacted to this book. It always makes
two cases: That Pius did speak out, and that if he had spoken
bluntly it would have made things worse. It needs to choose one.
</P>
<P>
   The more damning material in this book _ known by specialists
but not previously by the general public _ concerns how Pius
encouraged the Croatian fascists, all Catholics and allied with
Hitler, in the ethnic cleansing of Serbs under cover of war. Here
the case is much clearer than what he did or didn't do about the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify, Pius XII was no farther behind events than the
Allied leaders. All of them knew of the Holocaust, but none of them
believed what he knew until it was too late. By his own and his
predecessors' claims to a higher realm of conscience, Pius failed.
By more worldly standards, he didn't miss the Holocaust any more
than the leaders of the democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Pius was never pro-Hitler. If he didn't make a big noise about
Jews, neither was he a roaring lion on behalf of Catholics, Jewish
converts and others who fell afoul of Hitler. Cornwall has new
material on Pius' role in trying to bring Germans plotting the
overthrow of Hitler into contact with England in 1939. He stuck his
neck way out on that one. It was uncharacteristic.
</P>
<P>
   After all this, Cornwall argues that in the Second Vatican
Council (1962-65) the bishops saw that doing all the thinking for
Catholics is too much for one man and results in controversy, so
they voted themselves collegiality with the pope. Now John Paul II
is taking it back from them.
</P>
<P>
   That's one more theme in a book crammed with too many.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ For the first time in

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ ``Chilango'' is slang for residents of Mexico
City, and it's not necessarily a term of endearment. Mexicans have
a rather jaded view of those who inhabit the capital city. It is a
nickname and a reputation that the 24 million residents of Mexico
City are stuck with. I can empathize with the city's residents. I
live in the capital city of Texas and our reputation in the rest of
the state is not the best. (Arnold Garcia is editorial page editor

   HOME-DESIGN _ CHICAGO _ Nowhere is the ``new contemporary'' look
more evident than in the city considered America's birthplace of
modern design, Chicago, where the world's finest exposition of
contemporary furnishings opened Thursday. In just three years, the
Chicago Design Show has outgrown its space, reflecting the
burgeoning interest in the furnishings. Atlanta interior design
Herbert Brito attributes much of that growth to the onset of the
new millennium, a time when consumers are nostalgic about bygone
eras, such as the modern designs of Art Deco and Art Moderne. Mayer
Rus sees it more as a matter of letting the good times roll. During
an economic boom, consumers are more willing to take
risks.(Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   RX-PRICES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The cost for drugs used
routinely by the elderly has accelerated twice as fast as inflation
since 1994 and four times as fast in just the last year, a study
released Wednesday shows. ``More and more seniors are finding the
cost of these drugs unaffordable,'' said Ron Pollack, executive
director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored
the study of the 50 most commonly prescribed medicines for the
elderly. (Palm Beach Post).18.

   FOOD-SOUTH _ OXFORD, Miss. _ And you thought it was just fried

elevated to Faulkneresque proportions. A report from three-day
weekend conference at the Center for the Study of Southern Culture
in Oxford, Miss. (which also produces the Faulkner event), where
some of the leading names in Southern culinaria (John Egerton,
Damon Lee Fowler, Jessica Harris, John Martin Taylor and Vertamae

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Of all literary forms, the one that makes me

one who must write for a living is ever completely comfortable with
his own inadequate stabs at saying what is on his mind, if indeed
anything is. But in the leisure of hearing what is on another's
mind, I freely waive the obligation of making sense and let myself
be engaged by the writer who's already gone to the trouble. (Skube,

 &HT;    St. Augustine full of historic haunts, hangouts
 &HT;    By Mary Thurwachter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. _ First there was the praying nun and the
Spanish soldier who marched an old grandma to the ``other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the appearance of the long-dead Henry Flagler who
scared the bejesus out of a college student studying for final
exams. The likeness of Flagler's face mysteriously etched on the
floor in the room the railroad titan's body was shown in after his
funeral at Flagler College (originally the Hotel Ponce de Leon).
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't enjoy the story about the bishop's corpse
exploding from an overabundance of body gas and stifling heat _ and
the horrifying stench returning to haunt churchgoers many years
later?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not me. I was loving every minute of the ghost walk, a
nightly event in this 433-year-old city.
</P>
<P>
   By the time our gang of 24 hearty souls reached the entrance of
the Tolomato Cemetery, all ears were on the guide, Paula Gates,
dressed in colonial costume and carrying a kerosene lantern. She
was talking about the ghost of a bride who sent a handful of boys
running off screaming a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   As she pointed to the tombstones where the ethereal bride had
been seen, I felt a tapping on my shoulder accompanied by someone
eerily humming The Wedding March. I jumped, but wished I hadn't.
Seems my prankster husband, who came along begrudgingly, discovered
a bothersome use for his closed umbrella and found great delight in
poking fun of the whole idea of ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe how these people are eating this up,'' my
skeptical half said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just stories,'' I insisted, trying to quiet the
disbeliever. ``Consider this entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a fool,'' he mumbled, declining my invitation for
him to return to the inn where we had booked a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want to leave you out here alone with all these nuts,''
he whispered, a little too loudly for my comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shhhh!'' I begged, ``She's talking about that Chief Tolomato
guy whose tombstone we saw in the drugstore today.'' (The chief was
provoked when the apothecary shop was built over his burial
grounds. He kept messing up the place at night until the owner
reassembled the Indian's grave marker inside the store. Tolomato's
hauntings ended as soon as the monument was erected).
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of speculation happening in this spirit-filled
city. What I found most intriguing about the tour, though, was that
practically every place we had been earlier that day had a ghost
story associated with it. The restaurant where we had eaten dinner,
Hooked on Harry's; Flagler College; our bed-and-breakfast (The
Casablanca) and even the lot where we parked our car. In fact, I
think the lady in white, the ghost of the parking lot, thumped my
husband on the head when he got in to move his car. He felt
something (although it may well have been the car door since he was
in such a hurry to get back!)
</P>
<P>
   ``That parking lot ghost is mad at you for making fun of her,''
I told him. ``She's letting you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   We both laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be returning to the Casablanca Inn, my husband had
formulated stories of his own to share with anyone who would
listen.
</P>
<P>
   The bed-and-breakfast, overlooking the bay just north of the
Bridge of the Lions, is a 1914 Mediterranean revival home
surrounded by porches. There are enough rocking chairs and hammocks
to keep its guests comfy after a historic tour of the city or a
morning at the beach a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in the Vilano suite, a queen bedroom with a double
Jacuzzi tub in the sitting room. The sundeck overlooks the Old City
and the bay. There is an antique armoire in the bedroom and a
separate shower in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the rooms are different, each has a cuddly teddy
bear on the bed, prepared to keep guests company. Many guests share
their experiences at the inn by writing in journals provided in
each room. We discovered that our suite was the site of many
marriage proposals and even more honeymoon and anniversary
celebrations over the years. (Alas! No one reported a ghost
sighting!)
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast, served on the front porches or in the dining room,
included orange juice, coffee, lemon muffins with whipped cream, an
egg casserole or caramel French toast with apples and raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Guests are always welcome to grab a can of soda or a glass of
wine from the refrigerator and each day a fresh batch of chocolate
chip cookies is available in the sitting room.
</P>
<P>
   Even if scaring up a few ghosts in old haunts isn't your cup of
tea, St. Augustine is a great place to visit. There's so much to
see, so much history to absorb. And the Casablanca is a great place
to start.

   HOME-DESIGN _ CHICAGO _ Nowhere is the ``new contemporary'' look
more evident than in the city considered America's birthplace of
modern design, Chicago, where the world's finest exposition of
contemporary furnishings opened Thursday. In just three years, the
Chicago Design Show has outgrown its space, reflecting the
burgeoning interest in the furnishings. Atlanta interior design
Herbert Brito attributes much of that growth to the onset of the
new millennium, a time when consumers are nostalgic about bygone
eras, such as the modern designs of Art Deco and Art Moderne. Mayer
Rus sees it more as a matter of letting the good times roll. During
an economic boom, consumers are more willing to take
risks.(Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   RX-PRICES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The cost for drugs used
routinely by the elderly has accelerated twice as fast as inflation
since 1994 and four times as fast in just the last year, a study
released Wednesday shows. ``More and more seniors are finding the
cost of these drugs unaffordable,'' said Ron Pollack, executive
director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored
the study of the 50 most commonly prescribed medicines for the
elderly. (Palm Beach Post).18.

   FOOD-SOUTH _ OXFORD, Miss. _ And you thought it was just fried

elevated to Faulkneresque proportions. A report from three-day
weekend conference at the Center for the Study of Southern Culture
in Oxford, Miss. (which also produces the Faulkner event), where
some of the leading names in Southern culinaria (John Egerton,
Damon Lee Fowler, Jessica Harris, John Martin Taylor and Vertamae
Grosvenor) will be dissertating on everything from peanuts to
pilaus. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. MOVED.

one who must write for a living is ever completely comfortable with

anything is. But in the leisure of hearing what is on another's
mind, I freely waive the obligation of making sense and let myself
be engaged by the writer who's already gone to the trouble. (Skube,

   LONDON _ So you suspect your spouse may be having an affair.
These days, you can employ a world of high-tech devices to help you
catch an errant husband or wife: zoom cameras, auto-tracking
apparatus, even spray-on sperm detectors.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the ones doing the misbehaving. Where can this
often-discounted segment of the population seek their much-needed
support? At the Alibi Agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, the popular British agency will provide
credible cover stories for almost every adulterous moment. The fee:
a mere US$25-US$75, depending on the tailor-made fib.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to meet a lover for the weekend, but don't want
your mate to know. You could hire the Alibi Agency to mail you a
phony invitation to a seminar or sporting event, providing you with
a ``legitimate'' excuse for going away.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptions don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will make purchases on your behalf so that the items
can't be traced back to you via one of those pesky receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It will even loan you a noiseless pager so that you can be
discreetly contacted without the little woman _ or man _ knowing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone agrees with this blatant assault on
marital fidelity. Encouraging one to cheat on one's spouse _ no
matter how sophisticated the deception, or noble the goal _ is not
going to get you past society's moral gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling remorse about making money out of helping
spouses cover their deceits, however, the brains behind this
business say they are proud to be ``helping keep couples
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually trying to preserve the family, to protect loved
ones from the stress that comes from suspecting your spouse is
cheating,'' said Ronnie Brock, who founded the company nearly 10
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the agency's advertisement on the Internet reads: ``Our aim
is total peace of mind for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock also points out that about US$1.50 from each US$30 annual
membership goes to charities helping children from broken homes.
</P>
<P>
   Annual membership allows what Brock calls ``secure telephone
access to our operators.'' Beyond that, it costs US$25 a time for
the agency to call a spouse with a bogus business appointment and
US$40 for it to make up a phony invitation letter or card and mail
it to a client.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptions can cost more, of course, depending on how elaborate
you want them to be. Say you want to have a fling in Wales. While
you're away, one of the agency's receptionists will answer calls
from your spouse _ in a Welsh accent. They will answer in a
pre-arranged manner, i.e. trade fair, golf tournament, etc. They
will even allow your spouse to hear them as they pretend to try and
ring your room or page you.
</P>
<P>
   perates the Alibi Agency from Blackpool _ a picturesque
resort town in Northern England's Lake District, about a four
hours' drive from London _ along with Joe and Dawn Taylor. Although
Brock's not married, the Taylors have been married 15 years. They
say neither is interested in having an affair. The idea for the
agency grew out of the trio's experiences on the road managing
British rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people would want to fool around a bit and we
would have to make excuses for them, so eventually we figured it
would be a great idea for a business,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been.
</P>
<P>
   In just over nine months of operation, the agency has received
more than 10,000 customer inquiries, a third of them from women.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brock plans to open franchises in Argentina and the United
States by the end of the year, and franchises in other countries _
including Australia, Denmark and Mexico _ by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the unique business has spawned at least one copycat in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   John Watson, of Inverness, Scotland, started the Ace Alibi
Agency about four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has more than 1,200 members, 40 percent of whom are
women. Most members are from Europe, although 26 members live in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's mailed many of the American members invitations to
nonexistent conferences in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't believe a family should be destroyed over two
or three nights of madness,'' said Watson, who is married. ``If
someone uses this service, then that person obviously wants to
preserve their family.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is thrilled that businesses built on deceptions
are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders, for example, have spoken out against this type
of business, which they say condones lying for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Says an outraged Rev. Michael Manley of St. John's Church in
Blackpool: ``I can't believe this type of business is allowed to
exist. I didn't think it could be legal because obviously this
service is open to anybody so how do you know people are just
cheating on their wives, which is bad enough? They could be
cheating on their companies, anything in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brock and Watson reason that hanky-panky will happen in
today's society no matter what, and that their agencies are there
to help preserve the sanity of the poor, unknowing spouses waiting
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people these days who have a short-term
fling, or dalliance, and there's no sense in breaking up a
long-term relationship over it,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics vary on the number of people who have affairs, but a
survey conducted last year showed that British men and women are
the most adulterous in Europe _ although Americans topped the
overall list.
</P>
<P>
   The study of more than 10,000 sexually active adults in 14
countries found that 42 percent of Britons, compared to 22 percent
of Spaniards, 36 percent of French and 38 percent of Italians,
admitted to having more than one relationship at a time. But the
Global Sex Survey, conducted for Durex, the condom manufacturer,
said that half of the Americans questions said they had been
unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you get too depressed over the prevalence of
cheating, those who have been cheated on do have a new weapon of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a gel called Infidelity Detection Cream is selling
faster than sushi. Japanese women surreptitiously rub the gel into
their husbands' backs before they leave home in the morning. If the
men shower during the day _ a sure sign of a fling _ the chemical
reacts with water to form big blisters.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for revenge?

   LONDON _ So you suspect your spouse may be having an affair.
These days, you can employ a world of high-tech devices to help you
catch an errant husband or wife: zoom cameras, auto-tracking
apparatus, even spray-on sperm detectors.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the ones doing the misbehaving. Where can this
often-discounted segment of the population seek their much-needed
support? At the Alibi Agency.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, the popular British agency will provide
credible cover stories for almost every adulterous moment. The fee:
a mere US$25-US$75, depending on the tailor-made fib.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want to meet a lover for the weekend, but don't want
your mate to know. You could hire the Alibi Agency to mail you a
phony invitation to a seminar or sporting event, providing you with
a ``legitimate'' excuse for going away.
</P>
<P>
   The deceptions don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will make purchases on your behalf so that the items
can't be traced back to you via one of those pesky receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It will even loan you a noiseless pager so that you can be
discreetly contacted without the little woman _ or man _ knowing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone agrees with this blatant assault on
marital fidelity. Encouraging one to cheat on one's spouse _ no
matter how sophisticated the deception, or noble the goal _ is not
going to get you past society's moral gatekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling remorse about making money out of helping
spouses cover their deceits, however, the brains behind this
business say they are proud to be ``helping keep couples
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually trying to preserve the family, to protect loved
ones from the stress that comes from suspecting your spouse is
cheating,'' said Ronnie Brock, who founded the company nearly 10
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even the agency's advertisement on the Internet reads: ``Our aim
is total peace of mind for you and your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock also points out that about US$1.50 from each US$30 annual
membership goes to charities helping children from broken homes.
</P>
<P>
   Annual membership allows what Brock calls ``secure telephone
access to our operators.'' Beyond that, it costs US$25 a time for
the agency to call a spouse with a bogus business appointment and
US$40 for it to make up a phony invitation letter or card and mail
it to a client.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptions can cost more, of course, depending on how elaborate
you want them to be. Say you want to have a fling in Wales. While
you're away, one of the agency's receptionists will answer calls
from your spouse _ in a Welsh accent. They will answer in a
pre-arranged manner, i.e. trade fair, golf tournament, etc. They
will even allow your spouse to hear them as they pretend to try and
ring your room or page you.
</P>
<P>
   Brock operates the Alibi Agency from Blackpool _ a picturesque
resort town in Northern England's Lake District, about a four
hours' drive from London _ along with Joe and Dawn Taylor. Although
Brock's not married, the Taylors have been married 15 years. They
say neither is interested in having an affair. The idea for the
agency grew out of the trio's experiences on the road managing
British rock musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people would want to fool around a bit and we
would have to make excuses for them, so eventually we figured it
would be a great idea for a business,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been.
</P>
<P>
   In just over nine months of operation, the agency has received
more than 10,000 customer inquiries, a third of them from women.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brock plans to open franchises in Argentina and the United
States by the end of the year, and franchises in other countries _
including Australia, Denmark and Mexico _ by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the unique business has spawned at least one copycat in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   John Watson, of Inverness, Scotland, started the Ace Alibi
Agency about four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has more than 1,200 members, 40 percent of whom are
women. Most members are from Europe, although 26 members live in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's mailed many of the American members invitations to
nonexistent conferences in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't believe a family should be destroyed over two
or three nights of madness,'' said Watson, who is married. ``If
someone uses this service, then that person obviously wants to
preserve their family.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is thrilled that businesses built on deceptions
are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders, for example, have spoken out against this type
of business, which they say condones lying for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Says an outraged Rev. Michael Manley of St. John's Church in
Blackpool: ``I can't believe this type of business is allowed to
exist. I didn't think it could be legal because obviously this
service is open to anybody so how do you know people are just
cheating on their wives, which is bad enough? They could be
cheating on their companies, anything in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brock and Watson reason that hanky-panky will happen in
today's society no matter what, and that their agencies are there
to help preserve the sanity of the poor, unknowing spouses waiting
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people these days who have a short-term
fling, or dalliance, and there's no sense in breaking up a
long-term relationship over it,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics vary on the number of people who have affairs, but a
survey conducted last year showed that British men and women are
the most adulterous in Europe _ although Americans topped the
overall list.
</P>
<P>
   The study of more than 10,000 sexually active adults in 14
countries found that 42 percent of Britons, compared to 22 percent
of Spaniards, 36 percent of French and 38 percent of Italians,
admitted to having more than one relationship at a time. But the
Global Sex Survey, conducted for Durex, the condom manufacturer,
said that half of the Americans questions said they had been
unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
   Now before you get too depressed over the prevalence of
cheating, those who have been cheated on do have a new weapon of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a gel called Infidelity Detection Cream is selling
faster than sushi. Japanese women surreptitiously rub the gel into
their husbands' backs before they leave home in the morning. If the
men shower during the day _ a sure sign of a fling _ the chemical
reacts with water to form big blisters.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for revenge?

<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Diminutive Mayan women with faces that
could grace the cover of National Geographic mill around the
tree-shaded central park, balancing huge baskets filled with
hand-woven fabrics on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A block away in a cyber cafe, German students hop on the
Internet and flash electronic messages across five time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Along a cobblestone street before the facade of a 400-year-old
church, vendors peddle ``comida tipica'' _ Guatemalan fare of
beans, tortillas and fried platanos _ while nearby a craftsman
spreads his wooden wares on the sidewalk and blows a tune on a
hand-carved flute.
</P>
<P>
   His notes drift toward a nearby bistro, where jazz hums from
hidden speakers as tourists banter in a half-dozen languages, some
smoking fat Cuban cigars and sipping espressos.
</P>
<P>
   Part charming colonial showcase, part slow-paced Guatemalan
mountain town, part hot spot for the international backpacker
crowd, Antigua offers a comfortable, intriguing introduction to the
Central American back country.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour from the teeming capital of Guatemala City, Antigua
_ the formal name is ``La Antigua Guatemala'' or ``The Old
Guatemala'' _ is worlds away in terms of its architectural beauty,
the quaint feel of its narrow, cobblestone streets and its
easy-going pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   But far from a frontier outpost, you can still sleep in a
five-star hotel _ if you choose _ and find a nightlife of some
sophistication, with fine restaurants, a jazz club or two and
infinitely interesting conversation from the wide array of
travelers attracted to the place.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can go the backpacker's route: sign up for classes at one
of the 50 or more Spanish language schools and live with a
Guatemalan family, paying only $60 a week for room and meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I expected,'' said British barrister Richard
Gee, 30, who, taking a year off from his wig and gown, landed in
Antigua recently after six months of traipsing through Asia and
other far-flung parts. ``I expected a backwater, but it's really
quite convenient. I have friends in England who would never dream
of roughing it, and they'd be quite comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the local accommodations were good enough for the
White House: President Clinton spent a night in Antigua last spring
during a tour of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The town dates back to the 1540s, and is nestled amidst three
forested volcanic peaks at a cool 5,000 feet above sea level.
Spanish rulers once issued decrees from the stately Palacio de los
Capitanes (Palace of the Captains), which for more than 200 years
served as the provincial capital of a region encompassing
modern-day Nicaragua, Honduras Guatemala and the southern Mexican
state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   But Antigua's bane through history has been the occasional
violent earthquakes that have rumbled through the mountains and
destroyed parts of the city. After a particularly vicious quake in
1773, Spanish governors moved the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua lived on, thanks to its scenic beauty and the love of
its residents. In 1944, the national government declared the entire
city a national monument, leading to the preservation of its
architecture and strict limits on new building.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the United Nations declared Antigua a World Heritage
site.
</P>
<P>
   Some guidebooks list the city as one of the most beautiful in
all of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is now the main industry, and travelers from around the
globe can be spotted almost daily bartering with the Mayan vendors
in the central park or snapping photos of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But along with sightseers, the town has become something of a
magnet for students of the Spanish language. The first schools were
set up more than 20 years ago, and have become extremely popular _
probably due to the gorgeous surroundings and the rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A week of one-to-one instruction, seven hours per day, costs
from $100 to $150, far cheaper than comparable schools in other
Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best reputation in all of Central America,''
said Jeanne Guthrie, an American who now lives in Costa Rica but
who came to Antigua to learn Spanish. ``I went to a school in Costa
Rica and the instruction here is 100 times better. All we did there
was play.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools tailor their instruction to the individual students'
level. Many people come for weeks or even months at a time,
spending their days laboring through classes, their nights
bar-hopping through the bistros and internet cafes and their
weekends traveling through the rest of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife is far from wild, but agreeable. Fine restaurants
_ many run by foreigners _ offer everything from Italian to Thai
and French food, while several American-style pubs offer beer,
burgers and American sports on satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   A popular spot is the Cafe Condesa, just off the central park,
which is housed in a 400-year-old home. Legend has it that the
Spanish count who once lived there returned from a journey, found
his wife in an amorous repose with the butler, and promptly killed
the servant. The body was buried in one of the home's
two-foot-thick walls, the story goes _ and the bones were
supposedly uncovered by a 1976 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less historic bars offer entertainment in the form of
videos shown nightly in small rooms packed with overstuffed couches
and chairs. The movies are mostly in English with Spanish
subtitles, which helps students hone their Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, there is a colonial art museum, several
impressive churches and a convent that has been transformed into a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous, there is horseback riding, bicycling,
hiking in the surrounding mountains, golf and whitewater rafting.
Hiking is a bit risky, however, as bandits have been known to hold
up tourists venturing up the nearby volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will find plenty of Mayan handicrafts, jade, silver,
native artwork and other handicrafts. Barter with vendors on the
street, or step into gift shops that range from the kitschy to the
refined.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a Latin American veteran or a first-time
traveler, Antigua is simply too beautiful to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a film set, really,'' said Gee, the Brit on extended
holiday. ``It's an interior designer's dream. Around every corner
you've got these great colors, and you're surrounded by these
volcanoes in every direction. It's really quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   La Antigua, Guatemala or ``The Old Guatemala'' is aptly named,
as guidebooks say the quaint streets, well-preserved colonial
architecture and spectacular views of three surrounding volcanoes
make it one of the most beautiful cities in all of Latin America.
Known also for its Spanish-language schools, Antigua is the perfect
starting point for a Latin American vacation, or a pleasant,
inexpensive place to spend a few weeks or even months learning how
to speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Guatemala City, the nation's capital, is served
by American, Continental and Delta, along with TACA and several
other Latin American air carriers, with non-stops from several
major American cities including Miami, Atlanta and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DOCUMENTS: American residents need only a passport. No visa is
required for tourist stays of less than 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND:
</P>
<P>
   Rental cars _ If you plan to tour the entire country, a rental
car is probably the best way to go, although they are expensive,
from US$60 to US$90 per day. You must also be careful as cars are
targets for thieves _ best to stay only at hotels with secured
parking, and be sure to purchase collision/damage waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles _ If you plan to limit your visit to Antigua, you can
take a shuttle from the Guatemala City airport to Antigua, a trip
of about one hour that should cost from US$15 to US$30. For
information, call the Guatemalan Tourist Commission at
502-331-1333. Once in Antigua, you don't really need a car, as the
historical part of the city is pleasant and small enough for
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Buses _ Taking a public bus on an excursion in Antigua can be an
adventure all on its own. The buses are incredibly cheap _ as
little as US$2 for a several-hour trip _ and are filled with
residents packing children, market produce, luggage and practically
anything else you can imagine. Ask locals where to find the buses _
most leave from a large open lot west of the market. Be prepared to
stand if the bus is crowded and don't take lots of luggage or
valuables _ tourists can be targets for pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE: Antigua is located at about 5,000 feet above sea
level. Rainy months are late summer to early fall. A sweater is
probably a good idea, but a must in winter as nighttime
temperatures can drop into the 40s. Days are generally pleasant
year-round, with highs rarely going above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ACCOMMODATIONS: You can stay cheap or expensive. Budget hotels
range from as little as US$5 a night for a shared bathroom to US$15
for rooms with private bathrooms. In the mid-price range, expect to
pay US$30 to US$50 a night, while luxury hotels go for US$75 to
US$125 per night. If you enroll in a language school, they can
arrange a stay with a family, with meals and room going for about
US$60 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RESTAURANTS: The selection varies widely, from very
inexpensive local spots serving Guatemalan fare of beans, chicken
and rice for US$3 to US$4 to fine dining establishments with
American and European cuisine. Favorites with tourists include the
Rainbow Reading Room and Cafe, a bookstore offering vegetarian
dishes; Cafe Condesa with its opulent courtyard and 400-year-old
building; Cafe Flor for Thai food; Fridas Mexican Restaurant and
Bar and El Sereno, a fine-dining establishment offering
international dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SIGHTSEEING: Highlights include the Catedral de Santiago off
the central park, built in 1542 and only partially rebuilt after
devastating earthquakes in 1780 and 1820. Also facing the park is
the Palacio de los Capitanes, which housed the Spanish capital for
200 years when Antigua was the administrative center for a
territory that stretched from Southern Mexico to Nicaragua. On the
north side of the park is the Palacio del Ayuntamiento, the town
hall, which includes a museum of colonial artifacts. The city's
most striking church is La Merced, located three blocks from the
park, which was built in 1548 and rebuilt after numerous
earthquakes. It features a huge fountain said to be one of the
largest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPANISH SCHOOLS: Antigua boasts more than 50, which offer a
week of one-on-one instruction, up to seven hours per day, for $100
to $150. For a list of schools, call the Guatemalan Tourist
Commission 502-331-1333 or check a website at:
www.conexion.com/schools.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EXCURSIONS: One-day tours to places like Lake Atitlan can be
arranged through travel agencies. Tours to Mayan ruins at Copan or
Tikal are also available, as are mountain-biking, whitewater
rafting trips and horseback riding. Among the tour companies are
Adventure Travel Center at 502-832-0162 in Antigua and Maya
Expeditions in Guatemala City at 502-363-4955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRECAUTIONS: It's safest to drink only bottled water and not
to eat food prepared by street vendors. Avoid peeled, uncooked
fruit or vegetables. Be careful with rented cars, parking only in
secured areas, and walk at night only in groups. Bandits have been
known to rob tourists hiking on the volcanoes surrounding Antigua,
so it's probably best to enjoy the view from town.

<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal
following, Major Jan Zeman is back on duty 10 years after the end
of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

 &HT;    10 YEARS LATER: EAST GERMANS ACCEPTING THAT WALL HAS COME DOWN,
NOT COMING BACK

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On a recent afternoon, Lothar Weinberg celebrated with
a sip of champagne the conclusion of his philosophical journey from
Karl Marx to Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, 52, has a salesman's eye contact, smile and handshake
_ the markings of a man destined to win friends and influence
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with a few friends over hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a
sparsely furnished suburban office, Weinberg toasted the beginning
of a new and perhaps more perilous adventure _ running a business
in a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going at it full-bore, throwing himself into
capitalism's wildest and woolliest milieu: private consulting. He
and his partner hope their new business, Know How Inc., will make
them rich, an objective as distant as Mars just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall was famously breached 10 years ago Tuesday,
Weinberg was fastened securely in East Germany's Communist
structure. He was an electrical engineer facing a future with
little risk or reward.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the millennium, life for Weinberg _ as well as
his former East German countrymen _ is now full of both.
</P>
<P>
   For Weinberg, who felt the fires of ambition as a young man, the
changes that came in that momentous autumn of 1989 couldn't have
come soon enough. He regrets the years stifled in the old system.
``For me, the wall came down too late,'' he said during a break
from entertaining well-wishers. ``But my children. They will know
well what it means to have freedom and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Burkhard Rauschart sat on a wooden bench in an
open plaza sharing beer and cynicism with friends. Rauschart's eyes
were bloodshot and full of suspicion. He clinched an unlit
cigarette between his fingers as he listened to a stranger's
questions about life after The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' he said ``I wish they would build it back _ and 10
meters higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The park bench chorus confirmed this sentiment with grumbling
obscenities. It's been a hard 10 years. Within a few months of the
dawn of freedom, he got a divorce and lost his job as a train
security inspector.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Rauschart, the benefits of freedom seem
abstract, while the tribulations of capitalism are real.
``Freedom?'' he said with a caustic laugh. ``Freedom. Who can
afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people often say that tearing down the
brick-and-mortar Berlin Wall was easy compared to removing the
barriers that remain in the minds of Ossies and Wessies _
Easterners and Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ostalgia'' _ a sense of longing for the good old days _
expressed by Rauschart is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey indicated that some 13 percent of the population
would like to see the East and West divided again. The numbers were
nearly the same for both easterners and westerners surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent believed that Germans are now ``one
people,'' the poll said. Most _ 57 percent _ said another decade
would be needed to unite Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is deeper among Ossies _ people from the former East
Germany. Easterners say that they are paid less than their Wessi
counterparts and are treated as second-class citizens. ``They think
we're lazy and stupid,'' said Manfred Schneider, a 70-year-old
former East German army officer who now earns about $4 an hour as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ossies express a gnawing anxiety over losing the
cradle-to-grave security that they enjoyed in the past even if they
lacked privacy and personal freedom. In a September survey, only 38
percent of east Germans said they were satisfied with democracy
compared to 60 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent in the east favored continuing the free-market
economy. Most surprisingly, 51 percent of the Ossies said they were
happier in the communist German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschart, for one, said his life is far more difficult now. He
lives on $600 a month in government welfare. After paying the rent
on a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the poor Hohenschoenhausen
district, Rauschart is left with about $250 for groceries and other
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough,'' he says bitterly. ``Lamb cutlets cost four
times more than they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have found political resonance. The Communists _
reborn as the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS _ are now
Germany's No. 2 political party behind Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats. And in a potentially more worrisome
trend, the far-right German's Peoples Union won seats in two
eastern state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS positions itself as a hip alternative to the capitalists
of the West that stresses social justice issues and a respect for
the old ways of the East. The party is by far the biggest in
eastern Germany with nearly 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moderate East Germans express feelings of uneasiness
about unification, particularly the way their former identities
seem to have been lost in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they feel like a conquered colony. ``I wouldn't
describe it as a unification as much as I would call it a
swallowing,'' said Christoph Links, a former East German journalist
who is running a successful publishing house in East Berlin. ``We
had all the systems and structures of West Germany imposed on us
with all the problems that were already there. It's as if our whole
biographies are not accepted _ we spent our lives in a wrong system
so our lives before unification don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This nostalgia is puzzling to many, including former East German
politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the former communist official
who announced the end of travel restrictions on Nov. 8, 1989. In
his view, this decision brought an end to the wall's practical
relevance. ``At that moment, the wall became only a metaphor,''
Schabowski said during a discussion over plates of fancy Italian
food not far from the former location of Checkpoint Charlie, the
gate from East Berlin to the city's American Sector.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski, now 70, is awaiting sentencing for his role in the
shooting deaths of people trying to flee the East over the wall. He
denies that he had a direct part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He has little patience for all this ``Ostalgia.'' ``They are
concerned about the loss of the socialist institutions and the high
rates of unemployment, and I don't reproach them for that,'' he
said. ``But it was an illusion. You see, the failure of the GDR was
this: These positive traits weren't positive because we had no way
to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are selective about what they remember, he said.
``They say things were cheaper then, but they seem to forget that
they couldn't find anything to buy,'' he said. ``What has happened
in 10 years is enormous. If you don't see that, then you have
something else in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ossies aren't alone in their concerns. In the West, there
are fears that the once economic powerhouse has squandered its
wealth trying to prop up the East, which was an economic ruin in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent more than $600 billion in the
former East Germany, which to the annoyance of many in the West is
benefiting tremendously from the new infrastructure. It is
generally accepted that the phone system in the East is now much
more advanced than the older one in the West.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans often grumble about paying the 7.5 percent levy
known as a ``Solidarity Tax'' on their incomes to help the East.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Ossies feel the Wessies haven't been given any
credit for what they contribute. ``I wouldn't say. 'We pay the
solidarity tax, too,''' said Tom Sello, a former opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sello expressed a common sentiment . . . ``I'm personally better
off now, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining, Berlin is for most people today a
better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Brauer, a Wessie who owns a yachting school with an Ossie
partner, said only a fool would want to return Berlin to being
isolated island in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no going back, and there shouldn't be, `` Brauer
said. ``The two parts of the city have to grow together and in time
become just one city.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trace the wall on the landscape these days. The
city center, which was left to atrophy during the Cold War, is now
booming, in part because of the return earlier this year of the
national government for the first time since Hitler was in power.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to push the city into the future sometimes has paid
little attention to its past. Construction workers last month
uncovered part of the bunker where Hitler spent his last hours
before committing suicide. City officials wasted no time in
deciding to continue with plans to build a new road over the
bunker, paving it back to its inglorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1989, Michael Roesler's city map showed West Berlin as an
undefined white blot. Today he and his wife Kristina live in an
apartment in the white blot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the wall came down, they were forced to leave their
apartment in the east after the owner reclaimed the building and
began to remodel it. Their new apartment is spacious by European
standards and has a view of a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, the Roeslers looked through the pages of
the scrapbook they've made to recount their new lives. Their
greatest satisfaction seems to come from having been able to see
much of the world for themselves _ a nearly unheard of joy in the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they traveled with a keen sense of urgency _ as if the
wall would suddenly close again. They learned _ to their quiet
satisfaction _ that the West isn't quite up to their old fantasies.
``We've seen Vienna and it was fine, but it is no better than
Budapest,'' said Kristina. ``We see that not everything is perfect
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   As their retirement years approach, they worry about their
financial security _ an unheard of burden in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they have managed well in this strange new system. ``We're
really benefiting from these capitalistic means of making money,''
joked Michael Roesler, who has switched jobs twice sense
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't say that the old days were better, but they also
wouldn't argue that they had nothing to commend them either.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roeslers are optimistic about the future. They plan to
visit Toronto to see old friends _ once a bold dream that is now
just a pleasant expectation.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hurry because the wall is gone forever.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S PRIMARY ELECTION, BY THE NUMBERS
 &HT;    With MEXICO-PRIMARY-$ADV07.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Nov. 7 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO'S PRIMARY ELECTION AT-A-GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHEN: Sun., Nov. 7, polls open between 8 a.m. CDT and 6 p.m.
CDT (9 a.m. and 7 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHY IT'S IMPORTANT: This is the first time Mexico's
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has held a primary election
to select the party's presidential candidate. The party has
controlled Mexico's presidency for 70 years. Mexico's president has
always selected who would be the party's nominee in previous
elections. The primary winner will run against at least two strong
opposition candidates on July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO IS RUNNING: The top two contenders in a tight race are
Francisco Labastida, former interior minister and agriculture
minister in President Ernesto Zedillo's administration, and Roberto
Madrazo, former governor of Tabasco state. The other two contenders
are Manuel Bartlett, former governor of Puebla state; and Humberto
Roque Villanueva, former PRI congressional leader.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO IS SUPERVISING: Because Mexico's electoral law doesn't
cover primaries yet, the PRI is supervising its own election. All
candidates are allowed to have representatives at precincts to
monitor the balloting and the counting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO CAN VOTE: Any Mexican with a voter credential is invited
to participate, not just PRI members. About 6.5 million voters
expected to turn out. There are 58.1 million Mexicans eligible to
vote. Out of that number 54.5 million Mexicans have active voter
credentials, which are frequently used in Mexico as an
identification card.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WHO WINS: Mexico has 300 electoral districts of varying sizes
nationwide. The winner of a majority of those districts not the
winner of the total number of direct votes will become the nominee.
Nov. 10 is when all returns should be counted. Nov. 18 is the final
deadline for announcing the winner. And on Nov. 20 the winner will
be sworn in as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NUMBERS AT A GLANCE:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ballots mailed out to 300 districts: About 16 million
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Voting stations: 64,500
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottles of indelible ink to mark voters' thumbs to ensure they
only vote once: 140,000
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Observers: 193,500 trained observers from the PRI's ranks will
supervise, along with up to 258,000 observers representing the
candidates. Each candidate is allowed one representative per voting
station.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ballots available at each voting station: An average of 220,
but bigger districts are supposed to have more.

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, general cKB7:&AMP;u!2

<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Diminutive Mayan women with faces that
could grace the cover of National Geographic mill around the
tree-shaded central park, balancing huge baskets filled with
hand-woven fabrics on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A block away in a cyber cafe, German students hop on the
Internet and flash electronic messages across five time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Along a cobblestone street before the facade of a 400-year-old
church, vendors peddle ``comida tipica'' _ Guatemalan fare of
beans, tortillas and fried platanos _ while nearby a craftsman
spreads his wooden wares on the sidewalk and blows a tune on a
hand-carved flute.
</P>
<P>
   His notes drift toward a nearby bistro, where jazz hums from
hidden speakers as tourists banter in a half-dozen languages, some
smoking fat Cuban cigars and sipping espressos.
</P>
<P>
   Part charming colonial showcase, part slow-paced Guatemalan
mountain town, part hot spot for the international backpacker
crowd, Antigua offers a comfortable, intriguing introduction to the
Central American back country.
</P>
<P>
   Only an hour from the teeming capital of Guatemala City, Antigua
_ the formal name is ``La Antigua Guatemala'' or ``The Old
Guatemala'' _ is worlds away in terms of its architectural beauty,
the quaint feel of its narrow, cobblestone streets and its
easy-going pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   But far from a frontier outpost, you can still sleep in a
five-star hotel _ if you choose _ and find a nightlife of some
sophistication, with fine restaurants, a jazz club or two and
infinitely interesting conversation from the wide array of
travelers attracted to the place.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can go the backpacker's route: sign up for classes at one
of the 50 or more Spanish language schools and live with a
Guatemalan family, paying only $60 a week for room and meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I expected,'' said British barrister Richard
Gee, 30, who, taking a year off from his wig and gown, landed in
Antigua recently after six months of traipsing through Asia and
other far-flung parts. ``I expected a backwater, but it's really
quite convenient. I have friends in England who would never dream
of roughing it, and they'd be quite comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the local accommodations were good enough for the
White House: President Clinton spent a night in Antigua last spring
during a tour of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The town dates back to the 1540s, and is nestled amidst three
forested volcanic peaks at a cool 5,000 feet above sea level.
Spanish rulers once issued decrees from the stately Palacio de los
Capitanes (Palace of the Captains), which for more than 200 years
served as the provincial capital of a region encompassing
modern-day Nicaragua, Honduras Guatemala and the southern Mexican
state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   But Antigua's bane through history has been the occasional
violent earthquakes that have rumbled through the mountains and
destroyed parts of the city. After a particularly vicious quake in
1773, Spanish governors moved the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua lived on, thanks to its scenic beauty and the love of
its residents. In 1944, the national government declared the entire
city a national monument, leading to the preservation of its
architecture and strict limits on new building.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the United Nations declared Antigua a World Heritage
site.
</P>
<P>
   Some guidebooks list the city as one of the most beautiful in
all of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is now the main industry, and travelers from around the
globe can be spotted almost daily bartering with the Mayan vendors
in the central park or snapping photos of historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But along with sightseers, the town has become something of a
magnet for students of the Spanish language. The first schools were
set up more than 20 years ago, and have become extremely popular _
probably due to the gorgeous surroundings and the rock-bottom
prices.
</P>
<P>
   A week of one-to-one instruction, seven hours per day, costs
from $100 to $150, far cheaper than comparable schools in other
Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best reputation in all of Central America,''
said Jeanne Guthrie, an American who now lives in Costa Rica but
who came to Antigua to learn Spanish. ``I went to a school in Costa
Rica and the instruction here is 100 times better. All we did there
was play.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools tailor their instruction to the individual students'
level. Many people come for weeks or even months at a time,
spending their days laboring through classes, their nights
bar-hopping through the bistros and internet cafes and their
weekends traveling through the rest of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The nightlife is far from wild, but agreeable. Fine restaurants
_ many run by foreigners _ offer everything from Italian to Thai
and French food, while several American-style pubs offer beer,
burgers and American sports on satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   A popular spot is the Cafe Condesa, just off the central park,
which is housed in a 400-year-old home. Legend has it that the
Spanish count who once lived there returned from a journey, found
his wife in an amorous repose with the butler, and promptly killed
the servant. The body was buried in one of the home's
two-foot-thick walls, the story goes _ and the bones were
supposedly uncovered by a 1976 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Other, less historic bars offer entertainment in the form of
videos shown nightly in small rooms packed with overstuffed couches
and chairs. The movies are mostly in English with Spanish
subtitles, which helps students hone their Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   For history buffs, there is a colonial art museum, several
impressive churches and a convent that has been transformed into a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous, there is horseback riding, bicycling,
hiking in the surrounding mountains, golf and whitewater rafting.
Hiking is a bit risky, however, as bandits have been known to hold
up tourists venturing up the nearby volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will find plenty of Mayan handicrafts, jade, silver,
native artwork and other handicrafts. Barter with vendors on the
street, or step into gift shops that range from the kitschy to the
refined.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a Latin American veteran or a first-time
traveler, Antigua is simply too beautiful to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a film set, really,'' said Gee, the Brit on extended
holiday. ``It's an interior designer's dream. Around every corner
you've got these great colors, and you're surrounded by these
volcanoes in every direction. It's really quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   La Antigua, Guatemala or ``The Old Guatemala'' is aptly named,
as guidebooks say the quaint streets, well-preserved colonial
architecture and spectacular views of three surrounding volcanoes
make it one of the most beautiful cities in all of Latin America.
Known also for its Spanish-language schools, Antigua is the perfect
starting point for a Latin American vacation, or a pleasant,
inexpensive place to spend a few weeks or even months learning how
to speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING THERE: Guatemala City, the nation's capital, is served
by American, Continental and Delta, along with TACA and several
other Latin American air carriers, with non-stops from several
major American cities including Miami, Atlanta and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DOCUMENTS: American residents need only a passport. No visa is
required for tourist stays of less than 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GETTING AROUND:
</P>
<P>
   Rental cars _ If you plan to tour the entire country, a rental
car is probably the best way to go, although they are expensive,
from US$60 to US$90 per day. You must also be careful as cars are
targets for thieves _ best to stay only at hotels with secured
parking, and be sure to purchase collision/damage waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles _ If you plan to limit your visit to Antigua, you can
take a shuttle from the Guatemala City airport to Antigua, a trip
of about one hour that should cost from US$15 to US$30. For
information, call the Guatemalan Tourist Commission at
502-331-1333. Once in Antigua, you don't really need a car, as the
historical part of the city is pleasant and small enough for
walking.
</P>
<P>
   Buses _ Taking a public bus on an excursion in Antigua can be an
adventure all on its own. The buses are incredibly cheap _ as
little as US$2 for a several-hour trip _ and are filled with
residents packing children, market produce, luggage and practically
anything else you can imagine. Ask locals where to find the buses _
most leave from a large open lot west of the market. Be prepared to
stand if the bus is crowded and don't take lots of luggage or
valuables _ tourists can be targets for pickpockets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CLIMATE: Antigua is located at about 5,000 feet above sea
level. Rainy months are late summer to early fall. A sweater is
probably a good idea, but a must in winter as nighttime
temperatures can drop into the 40s. Days are generally pleasant
year-round, with highs rarely going above 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ACCOMMODATIONS: You can stay cheap or expensive. Budget hotels
range from as little as US$5 a night for a shared bathroom to US$15
for rooms with private bathrooms. In the mid-price range, expect to
pay US$30 to US$50 a night, while luxury hotels go for US$75 to
US$125 per night. If you enroll in a language school, they can
arrange a stay with a family, with meals and room going for about
US$60 a week.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RESTAURANTS: The selection varies widely, from very
inexpensive local spots serving Guatemalan fare of beans, chicken
and rice for US$3 to US$4 to fine dining establishments with
American and European cuisine. Favorites with tourists include the
Rainbow Reading Room and Cafe, a bookstore offering vegetarian
dishes; Cafe Condesa with its opulent courtyard and 400-year-old
building; Cafe Flor for Thai food; Fridas Mexican Restaurant and
Bar and El Sereno, a fine-dining establishment offering
international dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SIGHTSEEING: Highlights include the Catedral de Santiago off
the central park, built in 1542 and only partially rebuilt after
devastating earthquakes in 1780 and 1820. Also facing the park is
the Palacio de los Capitanes, which housed the Spanish capital for
200 years when Antigua was the administrative center for a
territory that stretched from Southern Mexico to Nicaragua. On the
north side of the park is the Palacio del Ayuntamiento, the town
hall, which includes a museum of colonial artifacts. The city's
most striking church is La Merced, located three blocks from the
park, which was built in 1548 and rebuilt after numerous
earthquakes. It features a huge fountain said to be one of the
largest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SPANISH SCHOOLS: Antigua boasts more than 50, which offer a
week of one-on-one instruction, up to seven hours per day, for $100
to $150. For a list of schools, call the Guatemalan Tourist
Commission 502-331-1333 or check a website at:
www.conexion.com/schools.htm
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EXCURSIONS: One-day tours to places like Lake Atitlan can be
arranged through travel agencies. Tours to Mayan ruins at Copan or
Tikal are also available, as are mountain-biking, whitewater
rafting trips and horseback riding. Among the tour companies are
Adventure Travel Center at 502-832-0162 in Antigua and Maya
Expeditions in Guatemala City at 502-363-4955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  PRECAUTIONS: It's safest to drink only bottled water and not
to eat food prepared by street vendors. Avoid peeled, uncooked
fruit or vegetables. Be careful with rented cars, parking only in
secured areas, and walk at night only in groups. Bandits have been
known to rob tourists hiking on the volcanoes surrounding Antigua,
so it's probably best to enjoy the view from town.

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 CORRECTS byline, ADDS tagline  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVEN ANN WILLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We seem to have kicked up a bit of a dust storm with our
editorial on Sunday titled ``McCain's temper is legitimate issue:
Hull's account of outbursts not unusual.'' It's been the topic of
national television and print news accounts for several days now.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the networks' new focus on what most Arizonans
consider to be an old issue has been riddled with inaccuracies and
misinformation. Let's set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his band of backers have sought to spin this
editorial as evidence of a ``grudge match'' this paper has with the
senator. Several in the national media have jumped on board,
portraying the editorial as part of a ``vendetta'' against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta?
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run for office five times since he moved to Arizona.
This newspaper has endorsed his candidacy all five times, most
recently just a year ago, shortly after I became editor of these
pages. McCain sat down with editorial board members and his
Democratic opponent for nearly two hours to discuss key issues in
the race and our questions about the candidates' positions on them.
At the conclusion of the meeting, McCain thanked us for the
``fairness'' we accorded him. Two of his staffers later caught up
to me to convey precisely the same message.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we've applauded McCain on these pages many times over
the years, including just last week for his role in seeking an
amendment to legislation having to do with quiet aircraft over the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   We supported McCain's efforts to open several major airports to
certain long-distance flights and to deregulate certain aspects of
the telecommunications industry. We've backed McCain's bold and
dignified leadership on re-establishing relations with Vietnam,
made all the more poignant by McCain's personal experiences as a
prisoner of war. We've commended his strong and knowledgeable
leadership on many national defense issues, most recently during
the Kosovo upheaval. We've lauded McCain's stances against
congressional pork and embraced portions of his call for campaign
reform.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper published an exceptionally evenhanded 16-page
special section on McCain just last month titled ``The Life Story
of Arizona's Maverick Senator'' that provoked not a peep of peeve
from the McCain camp. Heck, we even sported a front-page feature
last June on McCain's spunky mom _ a piece McCain critics blasted
as a puffery designed to promote the candidacy of the hometown
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Vendetta? Right, and the Grand Canyon is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we've also been critical of McCain. We criticized his role
in the Keating Five scandal, in which McCain was cited by the
Senate Ethics Committee for exercising ``poor judgment.'' And we
chastised his handling of the announcement of his wife's drug
addiction _ a problem that McCain acknowledged he didn't know about
until after Cindy McCain kicked the habit. (Cindy McCain's
admission that she stole painkillers from her own charity to
support her habit was the subject of a hard-hitting but hardly
unfair cartoon on these pages, so enraging McCain that it was years
before he returned phone calls from ``Republic'' staffers.) We've
banged on him more recently for a tasteless joke about Chelsea
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've been critical of McCain's volatility and his public
belittling of people with whom he disagrees _ whether they are
former Gov. Rose Mofford at a hearing in Washington, the Jewish man
he lambasted for objecting to McCain's speech referring to
``Christian'' compassion for the homeless, or a public reference to
the Leisure World retirement community as ``Seizure World.'' If
McCain comes unglued over this sort of local scrutiny, what can we
expect once the national scrutiny kicks in?
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his backers also have sought to paint Sunday's
editorial as part of an orchestrated campaign by Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to undermine McCain's campaign for president. Again,
patently untrue. Here are the facts:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``New York Times'' published a front-page story
about McCain's testy relations with Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, the
state's other top Republican officeholder, who described McCain's
difficulty in controlling his temper. It was followed by a critical
column by a member of the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial
board. In those pieces, McCain pleaded guilty to passion but
insisted he doesn't ``insult anybody or fly off the handle or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a debate about the virtues of passion. There are
many. This was an editorial correcting a statement McCain made
about his own conduct in those national pieces, a statement that
many in Arizona who have worked with him over the past 17 years
know to be simply untrue. We at ``The Republic'' may be
old-fashioned, but we believe that, as the major newspaper that
probably knows McCain best, we have an obligation to set the record
straight and provide as full and complete a picture of John McCain
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is McCain has ``insulted'' people and ``flown off the
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   To portray responsible journalism as puppetry to a rival
candidate is yet another example of the unfounded, sarcastic and
condescending charges to which McCain, unfortunately, is prone.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. McCain is alleging that the ``New York Times''
news pages, the ``Wall Street Journa''l's editorial pages (we all
know how close those two are), ``The Arizona Republic,'' Gov. Hull
and just about anybody else who criticizes him all take their
marching orders from the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That's absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the national discussion of all this so far has been
exceedingly disappointing. It's been characterized by half-truths
and untruths.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about passion, vendettas or candidate manipulation.
It's about character _ the issue around which McCain himself has
wrapped his campaign. It shouldn't come as a surprise that there
are more faces to McCain's character than the simplistic one he and
his backers are working so hard to put forward. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Berlin Wall fell on Nov. 9, 1989, it
pulled down with it the
</P>
<P>
   center of strategic gravity that had aligned the world's nations
and their people throughout half a century of Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the United States has emerged as the single
strongest nation in history, capable of bringing to bear enormous,
and often decisive, influence and power on a truly global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the old Soviet Union has sparked dizzying change
and spawned infinite possibilities for a whole generation of
American investors, interventionists and diplomats, who have spent
the past decade furiously tapping into new markets, confronting
humanitarian crises and weaving together alliances among former
foes.
</P>
<P>
   And the world, overall, is a very different place from the one
that was divided east and west along lines once symbolized by the
Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all of the gains, real or perceived, of the past
decade, the forging of a new world order to replace the old remains
very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   For if the end of the Cold War created new opportunities for the
United States, it also presented the country with four
interconnected imperatives, the resolution of which, now far from
complete, will largely determine the shape of the world well into
the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those areas _ managing the collapse of the Soviet
Union; reckoning with China's rise as an important world power;
reducing the threat of nuclear war; and building a global
marketplace _ progress has been limited and even threatens to
stall.
</P>
<P>
   Largely missing amid the celebration, self-congratulation and
talk of boundless potential that has come to characterize the age,
the world has arrived at a potentially dangerous moment, and the
path forward from here is anything but clear.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to fault President Clinton, as indeed many have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his administration are great underachievers,'' said
Richard Haas, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. `` He has been president at a
time of unprecedented American primacy and we simply don't have
much to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House counters that there are real limits to what the
United States can accomplish, despite its over-arching political,
economic and military dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this view that the indispensable nation can affect
outcomes at every place around the world. We can't,'' said Anthony
Blinken, director for European Affairs on the White House National
Security Council. ``All we can do is bring these unique resources
to bear in the smartest way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the crumbling of the Berlin Wall signaled the beginning of
the end for the Soviet Union, the finale followed just two years
later, when Moscow dissolved its far flung empire.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. challenge was to try to help cushion the collapse of
the Soviet empire, in hopes of preventing anarchy, chaos and the
potential for war, all of which have since been visited upon the
Russian motherland in its peril-fraught journey from a communist
state toward a free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky, messy, suspenseful, even dangerous
process,'' President Clinton's Russia point man, Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott, said several weeks ago in a speech at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Russia is that it remains, nominally at least,
under the control of its democratically elected president, Boris
Yeltsin. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December. And
next June, if all goes as planned, Russians will go to the polls to
pick Yeltsin's successor in the first democratic transfer of power
in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, though, possessor of more nuclear weapons than any other
nation on Earth, remains a deeply troubled state.
</P>
<P>
   It is listing through its fourth government in 18 months _
Yeltsin having sacked three others. Corruption, organized crime and
indebtedness have all but crippled Moscow's ability to provide the
services expected of a modern state. Soldiers and scientists alike
go unpaid, pensioners and entrepreneurs conspire to convert rubles
to deutsche marks, dollars or pounds, while tens of billions of
dollars in foreign aid and investment are believed to have been
siphoned off and spirited to banks and villas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, Russia is engaged in a civil war with
seccessionists in the republic of Chechnya, a conflict that has
clouded and threatens to disrupt relations between Clinton and
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   While critics, indeed, blame Clinton for vesting excessive faith
in one man's vision of democratic reform _ Yeltsin's _ others plead
for patience and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, keep your fingers crossed, Russia remains on the
democratic track,'' said Georgetown University professor of
government Thane Gustafson, author of the new book, ``Capitalism
Russian-Style.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. policy can influence and support Russia's painful
economic, political and social transition, he said, ultimately the
outcome is beyond outsiders' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about here is a drama in Russian,'' said
Gustafson. ``It's a Russian passion play on a Russian stage with
Russian actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. efforts to reduce the global nuclear threat bore
fruit early on, only to stumble badly over the past 18 months and
cause the global non-proliferation regime has come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to persuade India and Pakistan from testing a
series of nuclear weapons in a tit-or-tat display of atomic
ambitions in 1998. He was unable to prevent the
Republican-controlled Senate from spiking the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, which would have prohibited such tests among 154
signatory states, last month. And he's been helpless against the
Russian Duma's refusal to ratify START II _ a treaty negotiated by
former President Bush and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996,
which calls for massive U.S. and Russian reductions in
nuclear-armed missiles.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen nations believed to have nuclear capability, a
dozen other rogue states or well-organized terrorist groups seeking
to acquire them, and up to 70 other countries with the nuclear
expertise and equipment to build such weapons on short notice, the
threat of a nuclear attack has been anything but diminished since
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize it as a decade of unraveling,'' said
Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a
nonpartisan research group that advocates nuclear non
proliferation. ``I don't know too many people who I work with in
this field who think that we're any safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it's hard to point to concrete progress in relations
between the United States and China, the most populous nation on
Earth. With one-fifth of the world's people under its charge, China
is poised to assume a growing role as a regional and global
economic and military power over the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited poor relations with Beijing, taking office
less than four years after the brutal killings near Tiananmen
Square soured China's ties with most of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the complexity and contradictions of China have made it
difficult for Clinton to find openings for meaningful detente.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
June, Sino-American ties plunged to their lowest level since the
Tiananmen killings in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each country is more suspicious of the other today than it was
seven years ago,'' said Haas. As a result, he said, ``China has not
been effectively integrated into the world and there's growing
opposition in both countries, in the United States and China, to an
amicable relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to China's entry into the company of global powers is
its growing economic might. With a total stock market
capitalization of roughly $250 billion and exports this year
approaching $200 billion, China continues to sit on the sidelines
of the formal club of trading nations, the World Trade
Organization, or WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton balked at a deal last spring that would have accorded
China WTO membership in exchange for a host of concessions on
Beijing's part - tariff reductions, investment protections and the
like. Now, against long political odds in this country and in
China, Clinton is trying to patch together a deal that would allow
China entry in time for a new round of WTO talks set to begin in
Seattle late this month.
</P>
<P>
   China's absence from the WTO is but one shortcoming in a
longer-term plan Clinton had once hoped would result in a collapse
in global trade barriers mirroring the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market economies have blossomed around the world, from
Latin America and Central Europe to Africa and Eastern Asia, since
the Cold War's end. Hundreds of millions of people have profited:
an estimated 1.5 billion now live in countries where a family of
four enjoys an average annual income of $20,000 a more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's pleas for a free trade zone taking in the
entire Western Hemisphere have been thwarted by his fellow
Democrats, in the face of opposition from organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some controlled integration of China into the world market
economy and its institutions is very important,'' said Robert
Hormats, of the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard to have a stable and prosperous
system,'' said Hormats, ``if China is not brought into it over the
course of the next few years.''

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ With a badge and a gun and a loyal

of communist rule, in pursuit of lawbreakers and subversives who
threaten the social order.

<P>
   The fictional Major Zeman was the former Czechoslovakia's
favorite television police detective during communist times. But a
decision by Czech Television to re-broadcast the 1970s serial has
raised a fierce debate in the Czech Republic over whether the show
is propaganda or entertainment or history.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday night at 8 since its debut in mid-September,
Czechs in vast numbers have been tuning in for the next installment
of ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman.'' The heroic, hard-nosed cop
always gets his man and every episode sends a subtle if
unmistakable message: the Communist regime, as embodied by Zeman,
is the common comrade's only friend.
</P>
<P>
   And that has former political prisoners, human rights advocates
and reform politicians upset. They're demanding that the show be
taken off the air, and accusing Czech TV of offering up
brainwashing propaganda in the guise of a historical TV
retrospective. It comes at a sensitive time when the present-day
Communist Party is enjoying a surge in support amid the country's
economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes those who worked for freedom look like criminals,
which of course was its original intent,'' complains Frantisek
Sedivy, 72, who served 12 years in prison in the 1950s and '60s for
spreading democratic ideology among fellow university students.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over whether there is a place for Major Zeman in
the post-communist era goes to the very heart of how this Central
European country, now a member of the NATO alliance, is struggling
to define its fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The television producers who decided to rebroadcast the serial _
with accompanying documentaries exploring how the show was a tool
of the regime _ say that their intent was to force this nation of
10 million to begin to come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has stirred up the very questions we've been trying to
avoid,'' agrees Jiri Pehe, a Czech scholar who runs New York
University's campus in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 17 marks the 10th anniversary of the ``Velvet Revolution,''
which overthrew communism in what was then Czechoslovakia. (In
1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia mutually agreed to become
separate nations).
</P>
<P>
   However, the transition to a free-market economy has clearly
stalled in the Czech Republic, until a few years ago among the most
prosperous and fast-changing of the former Communist states.
Economic reforms were postponed in the mid-1990s, and the weak
Social Democratic government installed in 1997 elections has been
hamstrung by its lack of a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the past decade, few officials of the former era
have faced trial for crimes and murders committed during the harsh,
41-year communist reign. Only five officials from the period have
been convicted in the past 10 years in the Czech Republic, while as
many as 300,000 people were jailed as political prisoners or
committed to mental institutions during communist times.
</P>
<P>
   And unrepentant Czech torturers and secret police officials have
gone so far as to form an Association for the Protection of those
Prosecuted by the Capitalistic Regime within the last few years. It
has even filed discrimination complaints with international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The public dialogue about the past has been clouded because of a
collective guilt over the crimes committed and what, if anything,
should have been done to change things sooner, according to Pehe.
``People will always tell you how the others were involved, but not
what they themselves were doing back then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Czech TV officials regard the controversy over the show as
healthy, if not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that we have poked a wasp's nest. And we've
asked ourselves why people are so emotional about this,'' said Iva
Prochakova, a Czech TV producer who oversees the Zeman series.
``But the process of democracy-building requires us to look back at
our own past.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics regard the airing of the series as highly
insensitive to the still-raw wounds of the hundreds of thousands
who suffered under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Confederation of Political Prisoners has filed a
criminal complaint in court charging that the series promotes
hatred and the ``repression of citizens' rights and freedoms.'' The
country's broadcast regulators have warned of possible fines for
spreading ``totalitarian ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bret, a deputy director of the Czech police's Bureau for
the Documentation and Investigation of Communist Crimes, compares
the Zeman series to the powerful and artful propaganda of Nazi
Germany. It glorifies an agent of the Communist regime which
systematically persecuted innocent people, he contends, and it
should not be on TV because the country's young democracy cannot
handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years we're assuming that society is more critical
and more sensitive to the objective truth about their history and
about their past. This is not the case,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The scripts, based on real-life events, were artful distortions
that portrayed the communist regime as generally benevolent and
just. The villains jousting with Zeman were often priests,
intellectuals, artists, students and Western spies. During
production, government handlers from the interior ministry oversaw
the scripts and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one episode deals with the murder of several
Communist Party officials in a conspiracy said to involve Western
spies and priests. Evidence uncovered since the fall of communism,
and included in an accompanying Zeman documentary, reveals that the
assassinations were an inside job carried out as part of a power
struggle within the communist ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the country's economy faltering and the reform
government tainted by allegations of corruption, the opposition
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia enjoys the support of 20
percent of the population, according to recent polls. It marks a
high point in public support for the communists since the regime
fell in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials vow that if they came to power they would shift
the Czech Republic from its current capitalist course back to
socialism and seek to annul the country's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, granted earlier this year along
Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The airing of Zeman could hasten their return, by making
communism seem cool, say critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population today could be influenced by this series. Those
who see the problems of today's society may think it was a better
time when they view this propaganda,'' said Jaroslav Runt, 77, a
deputy chairman of the former political prisoners confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The country's best-known former political prisoner, President
Vaclav Havel, who spent almost five years in communist jails,
dismissed the series as ``not the first nor the last idiocy aired
by Czech Television.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is as melodramatic and dated as an episode of Mannix.
Many viewers, it seems, are drawn to the show out of nostalgia for
their youth, not the politics of the time. Tuning in each week to
see Zeman's latest exploits is merely a walk down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Zeman is kind of like putting on an old pair of boots
you've dug out of the closet,'' said Vera Kamenicka, 58, of Prague.
``They are kind of comfortable, but out of fashion.''

NOT COMING BACK

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ On a recent afternoon, Lothar Weinberg celebrated with
a sip of champagne the conclusion of his philosophical journey from
Karl Marx to Dale Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, 52, has a salesman's eye contact, smile and handshake
_ the markings of a man destined to win friends and influence
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with a few friends over hors d'oeuvres and drinks in a
sparsely furnished suburban office, Weinberg toasted the beginning
of a new and perhaps more perilous adventure _ running a business
in a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going at it full-bore, throwing himself into
capitalism's wildest and woolliest milieu: private consulting. He
and his partner hope their new business, Know How Inc., will make
them rich, an objective as distant as Mars just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin Wall was famously breached 10 years ago Tuesday,
Weinberg was fastened securely in East Germany's Communist
structure. He was an electrical engineer facing a future with
little risk or reward.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of the millennium, life for Weinberg _ as well as
his former East German countrymen _ is now full of both.
</P>
<P>
   For Weinberg, who felt the fires of ambition as a young man, the
changes that came in that momentous autumn of 1989 couldn't have
come soon enough. He regrets the years stifled in the old system.
``For me, the wall came down too late,'' he said during a break
from entertaining well-wishers. ``But my children. They will know
well what it means to have freedom and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Burkhard Rauschart sat on a wooden bench in an
open plaza sharing beer and cynicism with friends. Rauschart's eyes
were bloodshot and full of suspicion. He clinched an unlit
cigarette between his fingers as he listened to a stranger's
questions about life after The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' he said ``I wish they would build it back _ and 10
meters higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The park bench chorus confirmed this sentiment with grumbling
obscenities. It's been a hard 10 years. Within a few months of the
dawn of freedom, he got a divorce and lost his job as a train
security inspector.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Rauschart, the benefits of freedom seem
abstract, while the tribulations of capitalism are real.
``Freedom?'' he said with a caustic laugh. ``Freedom. Who can
afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, people often say that tearing down the
brick-and-mortar Berlin Wall was easy compared to removing the
barriers that remain in the minds of Ossies and Wessies _
Easterners and Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Ostalgia'' _ a sense of longing for the good old days _
expressed by Rauschart is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey indicated that some 13 percent of the population
would like to see the East and West divided again. The numbers were
nearly the same for both easterners and westerners surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent believed that Germans are now ``one
people,'' the poll said. Most _ 57 percent _ said another decade
would be needed to unite Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The malaise is deeper among Ossies _ people from the former East
Germany. Easterners say that they are paid less than their Wessi
counterparts and are treated as second-class citizens. ``They think
we're lazy and stupid,'' said Manfred Schneider, a 70-year-old
former East German army officer who now earns about $4 an hour as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ossies express a gnawing anxiety over losing the
cradle-to-grave security that they enjoyed in the past even if they
lacked privacy and personal freedom. In a September survey, only 38
percent of east Germans said they were satisfied with democracy
compared to 60 percent in the west.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent in the east favored continuing the free-market
economy. Most surprisingly, 51 percent of the Ossies said they were
happier in the communist German Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rauschart, for one, said his life is far more difficult now. He
lives on $600 a month in government welfare. After paying the rent
on a subsidized one-bedroom apartment in the poor Hohenschoenhausen
district, Rauschart is left with about $250 for groceries and other
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough,'' he says bitterly. ``Lamb cutlets cost four
times more than they did before.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have found political resonance. The Communists _
reborn as the Party of Democratic Socialism, or PDS _ are now
Germany's No. 2 political party behind Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats. And in a potentially more worrisome
trend, the far-right German's Peoples Union won seats in two
eastern state parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PDS positions itself as a hip alternative to the capitalists
of the West that stresses social justice issues and a respect for
the old ways of the East. The party is by far the biggest in
eastern Germany with nearly 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Even more moderate East Germans express feelings of uneasiness
about unification, particularly the way their former identities
seem to have been lost in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they feel like a conquered colony. ``I wouldn't
describe it as a unification as much as I would call it a
swallowing,'' said Christoph Links, a former East German journalist
who is running a successful publishing house in East Berlin. ``We
had all the systems and structures of West Germany imposed on us
with all the problems that were already there. It's as if our whole
biographies are not accepted _ we spent our lives in a wrong system
so our lives before unification don't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This nostalgia is puzzling to many, including former East German
politburo member Guenter Schabowski, the former communist official
who announced the end of travel restrictions on Nov. 8, 1989. In
his view, this decision brought an end to the wall's practical
relevance. ``At that moment, the wall became only a metaphor,''
Schabowski said during a discussion over plates of fancy Italian
food not far from the former location of Checkpoint Charlie, the
gate from East Berlin to the city's American Sector.
</P>
<P>
   Schabowski, now 70, is awaiting sentencing for his role in the
shooting deaths of people trying to flee the East over the wall. He
denies that he had a direct part in the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   He has little patience for all this ``Ostalgia.'' ``They are
concerned about the loss of the socialist institutions and the high
rates of unemployment, and I don't reproach them for that,'' he
said. ``But it was an illusion. You see, the failure of the GDR was
this: These positive traits weren't positive because we had no way
to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are selective about what they remember, he said.
``They say things were cheaper then, but they seem to forget that
they couldn't find anything to buy,'' he said. ``What has happened
in 10 years is enormous. If you don't see that, then you have
something else in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ossies aren't alone in their concerns. In the West, there
are fears that the once economic powerhouse has squandered its
wealth trying to prop up the East, which was an economic ruin in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent more than $600 billion in the
former East Germany, which to the annoyance of many in the West is
benefiting tremendously from the new infrastructure. It is
generally accepted that the phone system in the East is now much
more advanced than the older one in the West.
</P>
<P>
   West Germans often grumble about paying the 7.5 percent levy
known as a ``Solidarity Tax'' on their incomes to help the East.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Ossies feel the Wessies haven't been given any
credit for what they contribute. ``I wouldn't say. 'We pay the
solidarity tax, too,''' said Tom Sello, a former opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sello expressed a common sentiment . . . ``I'm personally better
off now, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining, Berlin is for most people today a
better place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Brauer, a Wessie who owns a yachting school with an Ossie
partner, said only a fool would want to return Berlin to being
isolated island in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no going back, and there shouldn't be, `` Brauer
said. ``The two parts of the city have to grow together and in time
become just one city.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to trace the wall on the landscape these days. The
city center, which was left to atrophy during the Cold War, is now
booming, in part because of the return earlier this year of the
national government for the first time since Hitler was in power.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to push the city into the future sometimes has paid
little attention to its past. Construction workers last month
uncovered part of the bunker where Hitler spent his last hours
before committing suicide. City officials wasted no time in
deciding to continue with plans to build a new road over the
bunker, paving it back to its inglorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1989, Michael Roesler's city map showed West Berlin as an
undefined white blot. Today he and his wife Kristina live in an
apartment in the white blot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the wall came down, they were forced to leave their
apartment in the east after the owner reclaimed the building and
began to remodel it. Their new apartment is spacious by European
standards and has a view of a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, the Roeslers looked through the pages of
the scrapbook they've made to recount their new lives. Their
greatest satisfaction seems to come from having been able to see
much of the world for themselves _ a nearly unheard of joy in the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   At first, they traveled with a keen sense of urgency _ as if the
wall would suddenly close again. They learned _ to their quiet
satisfaction _ that the West isn't quite up to their old fantasies.
``We've seen Vienna and it was fine, but it is no better than
Budapest,'' said Kristina. ``We see that not everything is perfect
in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   As their retirement years approach, they worry about their
financial security _ an unheard of burden in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they have managed well in this strange new system. ``We're
really benefiting from these capitalistic means of making money,''
joked Michael Roesler, who has switched jobs twice sense
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't say that the old days were better, but they also
wouldn't argue that they had nothing to commend them either.
</P>
<P>
   But the Roeslers are optimistic about the future. They plan to
visit Toronto to see old friends _ once a bold dream that is now
just a pleasant expectation.
</P>
<P>
   There's no hurry because the wall is gone forever.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Another barrier for the Gaza Strip
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 7, 1999.)
 &HT;    Corrects cut-off text
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been 30 years since I've been to the Gaza Strip. In that
span, the narrow shred of mostly arid land bordering the
Mediterranean has seen little progress from the days when it was a
refugee haven for Palestinians fleeing Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A report in last Sunday's New York Times about the new ``safe
passage'' highway between Gaza and the West Bank depicted an
internecine schism _ the West Bankers resenting Gazans now coming
to their towns and villages in search of jobs, of offering to work
for less. There is a comparable fear in the West Bank of a repeat
of the economic problems caused when affluent West Germany merged
with financially and infrastructure-deficient East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It never has surprised me that the people of the Gaza Strip
resorted to upheaval and violence under all those years of Israeli
occupation. Ever since the Egyptians abandoned them after the
creation of modern-day Israel, the Gazans have been shoved into a
corner _ more likely, a dusty tent _ to be used as a political pawn
between the Israelis and their antagonist Arab states. They feel
they have no friends; none in Israel, none in Egypt and, now, few
or none in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, under Israeli occupation _ its humanitarian needs
administered by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency _ the Gaza Strip
was a dead-end street. You were born, you were educated, you took a
job beneath your echelon; something like picking oranges near the
northern frontier with Israel. There was nothing to look forward to
except death. Many chose their deaths as martyrs for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   I have a chilling memory of my visit to Gaza in November 1969.
It is of squalor, of children in shabby classrooms, of women
beating wet clothes against rocks and of the dingy, provincial
hospital facilities that tried to serve the 270,000 who then lived
there. (It's now over 1 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Most vivid was the session I had with an Egyptian doctor who was
assigned to the hospital by Cairo in one of the few gestures of
brotherliness with the Gazans.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was counting the days when he could return to Egypt
to resume his practice, but he also was studying the people of Gaza
quite closely, and not just medically.
</P>
<P>
   He told me that the U.N. required all children under their
administration to complete 12 years of schooling. That, in addition
to the occupation, was the root of the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian child in the Gaza Strip got a good education, but
what happened to him (or her) afterward? In 1969, the child could
not go on to a college education because neither the Egyptians nor
the Israelis would accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a diploma, the Gazans stepped out into the world; in
this case, a most restricted world. They couldn't go here, they
couldn't go there. Many of them wound up taking menial jobs offered
by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   It is within those parameters that the hatreds begin to boil up,
to pass from generation to generation. Having an education with
nowhere to go can be most exasperating _ and enraging.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seemingly emerging from three decades of oblivion and part
of a growing Palestinian-administered entity (but still under the
wing of the Israeli military), the Gazans are running into new
obstacles: their own people living in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a challenge for Yasser Arafat. While he may have
Jerusalem on his mind, he ought to deal quickly with the Gaza Strip
problems of unemployment, health and education.
</P>
<P>
   He is the authority for both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
If ever he hopes to coalesce all the lands Israel occupied after
the 1967 war, he needs to defuse the provincialism that now
threatens to separate brother from brother.
</P>
<P>
   That should be uppermost on Arafat's mind; Jerusalem can wait.

MILD AT HEART

<P>
   It must be the eve of a new millennium when David Mamet, and now
David Lynch _ the director of ``Blue Velvet'' and ``Lost Highways''
and the creator of ``Twin Peaks'' _ both make G-rated movies in the
same year. (Though Lynch's elegant and elegiac ``Elephant Man'' was
a film for the whole family.)
</P>
<P>
   Lynch brings a hypnotic ease, and a leisurely oddness, to ``The
Straight Story.'' This sure exhibition of a filmmaker's joy in his
craft is the true story of Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old codger who
gets it in his head to go see his ailing brother, who lives in
another state. Alvin decides to drive the distance, hundreds of
miles, his John Deere lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' has its title presumably because ``The
Lawnmower Man'' was taken. This story has an intransigent quality,
like its protagonist, who is played by Richard Farnsworth.
Farnsworth's eyes have a steely sparkle. He doesn't have much
dialogue, but he makes what he does have count. He's the standard,
stoic Midwesterner, who seems to measure his words with an
eyedropper.
</P>
<P>
   When he hauls his aging body onto the mower, you feel every
ounce of his determination. It was smart of Lynch not to use a
well-known old movie star, to whom we'd bring associations of past
performances and a too-ready sentimentality. (Though Farnsworth has
had a long career in film, first as a stuntman then, late in life,
an actor. It's worth looking up ``The Grey Fox'' on videotape to
see him shine as a charming, willful bank robber in his later
years.)
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Farnsworth doesn't have a cubic centimeter of
stickiness in him. Because of his low-key mulishness and Lynch's
lyrical determination, you may find yourself wanting to like
``Straight Story'' more than you actually do. The attempts at humor
feel stale and older than the star. And someone in the audience
when I saw it muttered, ``At his age, you'd think (Alvin'd) be in
more of a hurry to get there.'' A cheap shot, but an understandable
attitude. ``Story's'' slow rhythms aren't for everyone. Yet,
Farnsworth's warmth and Lynch's surreal amiability make for an
honestly peculiar film. It crosses the line from practical-joke
fodder to a vision realized.

MONEY ISN'T KINGMAKER IN SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR'S CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Money still talks. But if the experience of the
big spending candidates in Tuesday's mayoral election in San
Francisco is any indication, it may be saying all the wrong things.
</P>
<P>
   In an election in which voters seemed to be turning up their
noses at the power of cash in politics, San Franciscans on Tuesday
rejected multimillionaire Clint Reilly, who spent an unprecedented
$3.5 million on the race _ enough to give everyone who voted for
him two free tickets to a San Francisco 49ers football game.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did voters appear to be strongly swayed by the $2.4 million
Mayor Willie Brown pumped into his re-election campaign, at a price
per vote that could have sent each of his supporters out for a
chicken dinner and a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with a tiny budget of $20,000, last-minute write-in
candidate Tom Ammiano will have captured tens of thousands of votes
by the time all the votes have been counted, each for about the
price of a pack of gum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens who are discouraged by the seeming dominance of money
in campaigns can be heartened by this election,'' said Rich DeLeon,
chair of the San Francisco State University political science
department. ``It shows the power of grass-roots efforts. It comes
back to the good old lesson that shoe leather is the key ingredient
of election success.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as votes were still being tallied to determine who will
face Brown in a runoff, it was clear that this election would be
remembered as a David and Goliath battle of campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented outpouring of campaign money, the four major
contenders for mayor spent a combined total of more than $6 million
to sell themselves to the approximately 200,000 voters in Tuesday's
election _ that's about $30 for every ballot cast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the differences in the four candidates' spending habits _
and what they ended up getting for their hard- won cash _ are so
stark that some observers are questioning whether money had any
effect in swaying the electorate at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are smart,'' said Arthur Bruzzone, former chair of the
San Francisco Republican Party. ``This election showed you can
spend all kinds of money and not create any change in the behavior
of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent state elections, political scientists have watched the
demise of one self-financed millionaire after another.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Democrat Al Checchi spent $39 million of his own
money in his losing bid for the gubernatorial nomination, while
Republican Darrell Issa forked over $13 million in his failed bid
to challenge Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. In 1994, Michael
Huffington spent $30 million to be trounced by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But when the cost is tallied per vote, it's hard to find a
millionaire who has spent more than Clint Reilly, who is likely to
take fourth place in this election.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the vote is counted, he should have somewhere in the
neighborhood of 25,000 votes, meaning he would have spent a
whopping $140 for every voter who punched his name on the ballot
card. With that money, he could have hired limousines to drive each
of his supporters to the polls, then taken them all out to dinner
at the Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the price spectrum, Board of Supervisors
President Ammiano, who parachuted into the race as a write-in
candidate two weeks ago with virtually no money, ended up getting
the Kmart special of campaign deals. While not all his votes are
tallied, he is expected to have spent about 50 cents a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't send out any slick mailers,'' said Robert Haaland of
Ammiano's campaign. ``We've had people walking the streets. Human
contact is a much more effective strategy for talking to voters.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Mayor Frank Jordan, who is vying with Ammiano for a
chance to challenge Brown in the runoff, was estimated to have
spent about $500,000 _ some where in the neighborhood of $13 per
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Election after election, the cost of campaigns has crept
dramatically upward in San Francisco. Four years ago Brown set a
new city record when he devoted a combined $2.8 million for the
general and the runoff elections. This year, Brown's campaign
estimates he is already close to spending that, without even
beginning to pay for the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance watchdogs say Reilly's campaign reiterates a
lesson that has come up repeatedly in recent elections: Money can
be a detriment to candidates _ especially when voters get the
impression they're throwing it around in excessive quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have typically rejected candidates who appear to be
trying to buy elections,'' said Tony Miller, a state advocate of
campaign finance reform.

LAZY `BONE' GOES FOR BY-THE-NUMBERS THRILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a movie's ads compare it to the best entries in its genre,
it sends mixed signals. It's shorthand for ``If you liked those
movies, you'll like this one, too.'' But it's also shorthand for
``Those movies did this first, and better,'' a sign that the new
movie is treading water.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with ``The Bone Collector,'' whose ads compare
it to ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and ``Seven.'' It does owe a lot
to those two movies: From ``Lambs,'' it borrows the plot of a
genius and a talented neophyte teaming to catch a serial killer;
from ``Seven,'' a pervasive gloom that takes place in a city where
sunshine is alien. But despite the presence of Denzel Washington
and Angelina Jolie, it's not a movie for the '90s so much as it's
every '90s TV cop show rolled into one and delivered in a two-hour,
R-rated package.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has the showier role here, even though he spends the
bulk of the movie lying in bed. He plays Lincoln Rhyme, a former
cop who wrote the book _ a dozen books, actually _ on forensic
science. After a career-ending accident paralyzes Rhyme from the
neck down (except for a finger, which he uses to control a bank of
amazing computers that never crash or freeze), he becomes so afraid
of turning into a vegetable that he's ready to pull the plug on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's distracted when a prominent New Yorker is murdered in
particularly gruesome fashion, and it's apparent that the killer
will continue dispatching victims in grisly, movie-style ways.
Jolie is Amelia Donaghy, a young patrolwoman who discovers the body
and impresses Rhyme with her moxie and instincts in preserving and
recording the crime scene. Naturally, he enlists her in solving the
case, and she becomes his reluctant pupil.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts off decently enough, especially with the cab
ride from hell that the killer's first victims endure. But when
Michael Rooker shows up early on as an intractable police captain,
the movie goes on autopilot. Rooker's character is, to be blunt, an
idiot: He's the type of movie cop who interferes with an
investigation that's working simply because without him, the movie
would lack conflict. He doesn't have a very well-honed ax to grind,
because his reasons for blocking the investigation are never made
too clear.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's cruise-control mentality veers into the relationship
between Rhyme and Donaghy, and it's a tribute to Washington and
Jolie that they can make something out of these underwritten
characters and their relationship. Their characters follow a
familiar arc, and Jeremy Iacone's screenplay (based on a Jeffrey
Deaver novel) brings them too close, too quickly. They don't share
the friction that propelled Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in
``Silence of the Lambs'' or Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in
``Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is good here, but he falls short of greatness; his
performance is more a tribute to his stardom than to his
considerable acting chops, because what holds the screen isn't his
talent but his charisma. It can't be easy acting virtually an
entire movie with only head movements, but it's also distracting _
you keep waiting for Washington to flinch involuntarily. Jolie
makes a finely tuned step up to leading roles, but she was better
this year in supporting roles in ``Playing by Heart'' and ``Pushing
Tin,'' which were also movies with problems. Can't wait to see what
she can do with a bull's-eye script.
</P>
<P>
   The primary culprit behind ``The Bone Collector's'' mediocrity
is director Phillip Noyce (''The Saint''), who has never met an
explosion he didn't like. Noyce's direction plays less on suspense
than on the jump factor; he's always got something waiting to
pounce out of the shadows, and it's such a familiar scare-movie gag
that it has little effect. Noyce also borrows from ``Seven'' a
tendency to linger on disgusting corpses; although he keeps the
onscreen violence to a minimum, he plays up its aftermath to the
max. When you're dealing with a genre as overdone as the
serial-killer movie, you need to bring something new to the game;
all Noyce brings is a sense of deja vu _ and a climax that takes a
merely ordinary movie and makes it ridiculous.

MIYAZAKI ANIMATES HIS AUDIENCE WITH `PRINCESS MONONOKE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are images in the animated feature ``Princess Mononoke''
as startling and primal as the worst nightmare. Children are
playing in a beautiful unspoiled field when a creature comes
rumbling toward them _ a mass of bloody, writhing worms eating away
at a giant boar as it gallops and moans across the countryside.
It's where master animator Hayao Miyazaki's gifts are best
realized, when he works on the level of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki has produced several of Japan's most beloved (and
highest-grossing) features, including my ``My Neighbor Totoro''
(which can be found on cassette). And though ``Mononoke'' was not
created for children _ this grew out of the Japanese respect for
animation, part of the movement where cartoons continue to be made
for adult sensibilities _ children will be fascinated by the world
of demons and gentle spirits and horrors in this fable about the
coming ruin of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the world of feudal Japan, ``Mononoke'' has some of the
harshness of Grimm's Fairy Tales. After saving the children,
including his sister, from the infected boar, Ashitaka (voiced by
Billy Crudup) is banished from his village. He has been infected by
the beast, and it's only a matter of time before he dies.
</P>
<P>
   On his quest to find the truth, and maybe a cure, Ashitaka comes
across a village industry run by rehabilitated prostitutes and the
sly Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver). He meets the cunning Jigo (Billy
Bob Thornton), who conspires to unleash forces that could finish
the world. And then there's Mononoke (Claire Danes), who lives with
the giant wolves; in another powerful image, Ashitaka spies her
pulling raw meat apart with her teeth and she glares at him as
blood drips from her chin.
</P>
<P>
   The movie may feel a little long, but that's partially because
Danes and some of the other actors doing the voices give such flat,
modern readings. The faces are a little inexpressive, too _ even
someone as immensely talented as Miyazaki hasn't quite mastered
that ... yet. Miyazaki's tableaux have an unforgettable beauty, and
the epic sprawl of ``Princess Mononoke'' has more sheer power than
any of the big-budget disaster pictures you can name. The violence
comes so swiftly that you almost laugh when it happens _ it's part
of the dreaminess.

  CORRECTS judge's name to Shaw (from Smith) 
Column first transmitted 10/30/99 
  
 FRIED KILLER NOW SERVED ON THE WEB  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photo No. 3 is a close-up and features a curdled rivulet of
blood running from the dead man's nose and down the broad leather
strap half-covering his baked pumpkin of a face.
</P>
<P>
   It was taken just after 350-pound Allen Lee ``Tiny'' Davis was
killed in Florida's electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before jailers flipped the switch on Old Sparky one day
last July, Davis developed a nosebleed, dripping electric ooze all
over the clean white shirt he wore for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander Shaw, the
photograph is stomach-turning proof that Tiny Davis, convicted of
the 1982 murders of a pregnant woman and her two young daughters,
was ``brutally tortured to death.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in September, Shaw found himself in the minority of a
4-3 decision in which Florida's highest court found the electric
chair had operated correctly in Davis' case and should not be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   So, Shaw posted three pictures of the executed man on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Photo No. 1 shows a dead Tiny with his shaved head exposed and
his bloody shirt opened.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 is a full view of a cinched-up, wired Tiny just after his
demise. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Barbarity in full view
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Justice Shaw posted the photographs on the Web site of Florida's
Supreme Court because he wanted average citizens to get a good look
at the barbarity of an electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to strip away the polite dialogue of a courtroom and
show you, in full color, what it's like to charbroil a man. He
hoped the nauseating photographs would shock and disgust good
people. He wanted to irritate anyone who saw them, make them angry,
furious, even outraged.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread across the Internet, hundreds of thousands of
people from all over America accessed the photographs. Viewers were
angry. They were furious. They were positively outraged _ that
Justice Shaw hadn't included ``more'' photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge never saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   I figured anyone with a shred of humanity had gone extinct long
ago, but apparently there is one example left and his name is
Leander Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Justice Shaw was so busy trying to reconcile justice
with compassion that he never saw ``Real TV,'' Jerry Springer, or
any program on the Fox network. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Real people, real pain
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
America loves programs showing real people in real pain,
particularly (but not exclusively) if the person suffering is a
``bad guy.'' That's why the death penalty is so popular.
</P>
<P>
   We've been dispatching murderers behind the dark walls of
prisons for years now, and Judge Shaw has proved we want more.
</P>
<P>
   We want to see it.
</P>
<P>
   If not, you wouldn't be asking yourself, ``When in hell is this
guy going to print the name of that Web site?'' (It's
www.firn.edu/supct/deathwarrants.)
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily pulled the plug on
Florida's electric chair. It's trying to decide if zapping someone
is legal under the Constitution. If the justices OK the procedure,
I'd guess the citizens of Florida and elsewhere will demand that
courts refrain from putting pictures of dead guys on the Internet
and, instead, broadcast the killings live.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arizona, we executed a murderer by lethal injection just
last week. Of course, in order to get TV viewers to watch a
killing, government will have to offer something besides a needle.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of thousands of men, women and children who've
sought out the Tiny Davis pictures prove that Americans enjoy
variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photos on this Web site are WONDERFUL!'' one woman
e-mailed the court.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal injection is efficient but tasteless. In fast food and
justice, Americans want choices, and could not care less if what's
being served is healthy. On the menu of execution techniques, which
do you think we'd choose?
</P>
<P>
   Regular or extra crispy? &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR'S RACE STILL UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE, RACHEL GORDON and CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano's
write-in bid for mayor has won the support of nearly one of every
five San Franciscans who voted, but it remains to be seen whether
it's enough to get him into a runoff next month with Mayor Willie
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano edged ahead of former Mayor Frank Jordan by fewer than
200 votes by the end of the day Wednesday in the race for second
place.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of write-in votes for Ammiano has slowed the
processing of ballots at City Hall, but election workers began
counting again Thursday morning and were expected to announce new
results by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The one certainty in the race is who is out: Clint Reilly, the
former political consultant, who formally conceded in a written
statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty over who will win the No. 2 spot hasn't stopped
backers of Brown, Ammiano or Jordan from starting to plot strategy
for the Dec. 14 runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results showed Brown leading with 42.3 percent,
trailed by Ammiano and Jordan, who had 18.7 and 18.6 percent,
respectively. Reilly had 13.6 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The returns reflect the votes of 143,388 San Franciscans, but at
least 33,000 write-in, provisional and absentee votes remained to
be tallied at the start of business Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the results were distributed at City Hall late Wednesday
afternoon, showing Ammiano surging into second place, his
supporters let out a whoop and began chanting, ``Win, Tom, Win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally optimistic,'' said Ammiano's campaign
spokeswoman Belinda Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's campaign manager, Ed Slevin, said the numbers were
still looking good for the former mayor. ``I say he's in,'' Slevin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors seemed to favor Ammiano: The Department of
Elections is waiting to count 5,000 write-in ballots, which are
overwhelmingly expected to go to Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan aides are hoping the 19,000 absentee ballots that remain
to be counted will swing their way. But 2,000 to 3,000 of those
ballots are write-ins, which again should favor Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   There also are 9,000 uncounted provisional ballots, where
questions were raised about voter eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   With little information released on which neighborhoods the yet-
to-be-counted votes are coming from, political analysts warned
against premature predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too early to tell,'' said David Lee, executive
director of the Chinese American Voters Education Committee, who
has been monitoring the vote.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day after the election, Brown seemed in good
spirits, although admitting, ``I don't feel good'' about being in a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to win it all and get it over with,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if Ammiano hadn't entered the race at the last
minute, he would have won more than 50 percent of the vote, and
there would be no runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it made no difference to him whether he faced a
candidate from the right, Jordan, or from the left, Ammiano. He
said he wouldn't tailor his campaign to his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to simply deliver the message of who I am and who the
people running against me might be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ammiano remained mostly out of sight Wednesday and
declined to comment on the race. His spokeswoman said he was
handling the suspense well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being very calm and laid back and funny in his usual
way,'' said Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters, Jordan said that whether it was he
or Ammiano in a one-on-one showdown against the better-financed
Brown, the result would be the same: ``This is a David vs. Goliath
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also spoke with reporters, surprising many by saying that
if he didn't get into the runoff, he'd consider endorsing Ammiano.
``The one person I will not endorse is Willie Brown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Jordan endorsement of Ammiano would be a strange political
alliance indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a career cop and former police chief, has his political
base among the city's more moderate and conservative voters.
Ammiano, by far the city's most liberal elected official with his
roots in gay activism, finds his strongest support with
left-of-center constituents, among them tenant activists, homeless
advocates, rank-and-file labor and a faction of the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not agree with everything he does,'' Jordan said of
Ammiano, ``but his heart is in the right place.''

PATRIOTS SCOUTING TAKES A TURN INWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Although it may seem foolish to turn the
microscope on a team that is 6-2 (and easily could be 7-1 or 8-0),
the Patriot coaches should use their free time this week to look
closely at the most inconsistent part of the team, the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, the Patriots are known for their offense, as
they have been since Drew Bledsoe arrived. But Patriot fans know
the offense, despite its celebrity, has not been dependable, game
to game, series to series, for several years. A large part of that
was due to injuries to key players. Another reason was the
ever-changing band of offensive coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll said his coaches will use their extra time
this week to scout themselves. The New England coaches will look at
tape of the New England formations, the New England tendencies, and
the New England players just as they would look at tape of an
upcoming opponent to spot weaknesses. This is common during bye
weeks in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-scouting is the primary focus this week,'' said Carroll
this week. ``And we'll do it on both sides of the ball. We want to
look at how how other teams are looking at us. Plus, we have a
whole schedule of things we want to bring into our offense and into
our defense. We'll work on a few things. We'll bring in some
wrinkles and we'll eliminate some things, too, based on our
self-scouting information.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Patriots will make some changes based on their
self-scouting ``that will make it harder for our opponents.'' Those
changes will come from plans already in the New England offensive
and defensive arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   New England's offense has more to go on in 1999 than perhaps in
any other year of the 1990s. Not only is the offensive line showing
a push in run-blocking that has not been seen here in more than a
decade, not only is fullback Tony Carter blocking with the force
Sam Gash used to provide, but New England finally has a
professional runner in Terry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin and Robert Edwards were very talented, yes, but
they gained their yards more with their legs than their wiles. It
is a joy to watch Allen pick and choose where to go, usually
picking the right hole, and almost always gaining as many yards as
possible given the situation in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   In short-yardage situations, and near the goal line, Allen has a
touch of Marcus Allen in him, intuitively finding the weakness and
reaching his goal. Patriot fans do not have to be reminded that
third and 1 had been the offense's most ticklish situation for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is still Bledsoe and his corps of
receivers, as deep as any team in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But, if the self-scouting is to bear fruit for the final eight
games, hopefully Carroll and offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese
will measure the distance the receivers travel in their routes when
the defense is blitzing.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has been sacked too often and hit too much this season.
The quarterback, as he always does, takes the fall for any mistake,
blaming himself for holding onto the ball too long. Carroll has
joined the ``holding the ball too long'' chorus.
</P>
<P>
   In the Patriots' win over Arizona Sunday, one touchdown pass
came on a short and quick pass to Shawn Jefferson. Another time,
Bledsoe looked immediately to his right and hit Terry Glenn on a
wide receiver screen. Those quick passes have been more the
exception than the rule this season.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, there is a whole other area of how well the
receivers adjust their routes when the defense blitzes. Only
coaches with their game tapes can give a true reading of that.)
</P>
<P>
   Lost amid Carroll's quietly angry reaction to Ben Coates's
strange ``me, me, me'' comments after the Arizona game was the
coach's reading of how well his defense has improved week to week.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, whether Carroll's feeling _ yes, it was more a
feeling than a statistical proof _ about his defense is accurate
will determine far more how the Patriots will do this season than
Coates's selfish whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're back to where we were at the end of the
season before last,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a promising statement because the Patriots' defense at
the end of the 1997 season was playing as well as any defense in
the NFL. Recall how New England's offense struggled in December and
came up empty in Three Rivers Stadium in losing a playoff game to
the Steelers, 7-6. But the defense was nearly unbendable,
unbreakable, and unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   This defense still cannot be compared to that one for two
obvious reasons. First, rookie Andy Katzenmoyer is still invisible
at times and is only a shadow of the inside linebacker the Patriots
had at the end of 1997 (Ted Johnson). Second, Willie Clay was
playing safety and playing it very well; Clay's replacement, Chris
Carter, is still learning his trade and is far from the safety Clay
was in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the defense is on the uptick.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 6-2, somewhat healthy and in an ideal position
for the remainder of the season. Time to turn off the microscope.
Quickly.

   NEWARK _ Residents of the housing project along Muhammad Ali
Avenue thought their eyes were playing tricks on them. There were
George Muresan, Stephon Marbury, Jayson Williams, and Willis Reed,
striding down their street.
</P>
<P>
   Donning coveralls, the entire New Jersey Nets basketball team
and their coaches had descended on Jesse Allen Park _ called Green
Acres by the neighbors _ to display their prowess, not on the
basketball court, but on the neighborhood's rinky-dink playground.
</P>
<P>
   They cleared the walls of graffiti, painted the park benches
dark brown, and hung up two basketball nets complete with gleaming
white backboards. A construction crew pitched in with paving and
landscaping. Suddenly a playground that had been a magnet for drug
dealers and gang members, had become a place to play for pupils
from the Louise A. Spencer Elementary School next door.
</P>

   The efforts of the Nets team, which go far beyond the fresh coat
of paint at Green Acres, are drawing President Clinton here to
promote the role of sports organizations in forming public-private
partnerships that help rebuild America's cities.
</P>
<P>
   Newark is the first stop on Clinton's second antipoverty tour,
which will also take him to Hartford, the eighth poorest city in
the country; to Little Rock and Hermitage, Ark.; and to Chicago
over the course of two days. During his first antipoverty tour, a
four-day trip in July, Clinton visited places he called untapped
``new markets,'' such as a South Dakota Indian reservation, the
hills of Appalachia, and the Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Having shown corporate leaders where such markets are located,
Clinton this time wants to show how they can tap into these markets
for the long haul, said his deputy chief of staff, Maria Echaveste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first trip was to say, `Hey, there are new markets. This
is what they look like. This is where they can be found,' ''
Echaveste said. ``This trip is about how do you create long-term
partnerships'' between businesses and communities.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no better example of this in the sports world than
what the Nets have done here. Two of the Nets owners, Ray Chambers
and Louis Katz, have pledged to give 38 percent of their profits to
benefit underprivileged youths in New Jersey. Chambers and Katz are
part of a group including comedian Bill Cosby that paid $150
million for the Nets last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the team doesn't make a profit, Chambers, who is from
Newark, and Katz, a Camden native, have guaranteed money for those
youth programs. With no profits last year, the programs received
$200,000; with no profits expected this year, at least $500,000
will go to scholarships, mentoring programs, and other services for
youths from New Jersey's urban neighborhoods, said Nets president
Michael Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers also raised tens of millions in private contributions
for the $180 million New Jersey Performing Arts Center, which
opened last year and has triggered other economic development in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here credit him with rallying other corporate
leaders to take a more active role in the city, a place Harper's
magazine once dubbed the ``worst city in America.'' Thousands of
new housing units have been built, a new minor league baseball
stadium sits downtown, and a clutch of telecommunications firms
have begun to lease space in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Boston, but it could be,'' said Rowe. ``There's not a
reason it can't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers is hoping the state will sign on to his plans to move
the Nets from the Meadowlands to downtown Newark, and he has
proposed paying $200 million of the roughly $300 million price tag
for a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became convinced that an arena would really be the engine
that would kick-start Newark's final start toward development,''
said Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Danielson, professor of politics at Princeton University
and author of a book on how professional teams affect the cities in
which they play, said it would be unprecedented if Chambers can
build the arena and return profits to youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would certainly be the largest, most signficant commitment
on the part of a major league sports team to put money back into a
community,'' Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are also proposing to spend more of their own money on
an arena than most teams, he said, ``unlike the majority of sports
deals, where teams try to extract as much as they can get from
government.''
</P>
<P>
   While previous redevelopment efforts fizzled, this one may work
because of the involvement of Chambers and other business leaders,
said Maria Vizcarrondo-DeSoto, a community activist and chief
executive officer of the United Way in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that people like Ray Chambers and his colleagues
bring to the table is (that) obviously they have the resources,''
she said. ``And if they decide that something's going to happen,
it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James praised the Nets for adopting a ``holistic
approach'' to the city, sprucing up neighborhoods, helping educate
children, and creating jobs. ``Professional sports should be used
to fuel the economic development of our urban cities,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were surprised when the basketball players showed up
to fix the playground on Muhammad Ali Avenue and then ate lunch
with the neighborhood children, the mayor noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not millionaries who run up and down the court in
short pants,'' he said. ``They were the guys next door.''

I THINK THEREFORE IBOOK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Okay, I admit it. I was beguiled by the blueberry and taken over
by the tangerine. When Apple started bombarding billboards with
color photos of its new iBook laptop computer, I wanted one. It
didn't matter that I had given up on Macintosh more than two years
ago. The iBook looked cool.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new iBook is a masterpiece of industrial design and
engineering. Built primarily for students, the iBook is sure to be
popular among the affluent high school and college set. But it's
important to realize the iBook is also hobbled by Apple's MacOS
operating system. Although Apple has made great strides in bringing
the Mac back from the abyss, Macintosh users are still second-class
citizens in many corners of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook felt different the moment I took it out of its carton.
Easy to hold, its case is covered mostly with a thick, rubberized
shell. Apple claims this shell, four times thicker than the plastic
of most laptops, makes the iBook easier to hold and reduces the
damage that a sudden impact might cause. I like it because it makes
the computer fun to hold.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook is the first laptop designed with a backpack in mind.
Missing are buttons, sliders, little doors or plug-in devices that
can easily break off or get lost. Sharp edges have been rounded.
Also missing is a latch for the lid, which might break off or get
jammed in a crowded backpack. The iBook also comes with a compact
charger that includes a spindle for winding up the fragile power
cord _ important for backpack users.
</P>
<P>
   The basic iBook costs $1,599 and comes with 32 megabytes of RAM,
a 3.2 gigabyte hard disk, a 300 Mhz PowerPC G3 processor, and a 800
x 600 TFT display. It has a built-in CD-ROM drive, a single
speaker, a stereo headphone jack, a Universal Serial Bus (USB)
interface, a 56K modem, and a 10/100 Ethernet port. There is a
single SO-DIMM slot for expanding memory (up to 128MB can be added)
and an internal slot for Apple's AirPort wireless networking card
(an AirPort antenna is already built into the computer's case). As
with the desktop-sized iMac, there is no floppy disk drive,
although you can buy an external floppy and connect it using the
USB interface.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook has lots of nice little touches. When you plug in the
battery charger, the charging plug glows yellow-green, letting you
know you have a solid connection. Another LED on the computer
pulsates when the iBook is in ``sleep'' mode, to let you know your
battery is slowly being drained. And speaking of sleeping, Apple's
implementation of ``sleeping'' and ``suspend/resume'' is flawless.
That's a welcome change from many Windows-based PCs, which
occasionally crash instead of waking up. The iBook also has an
improved touch-pad that works even if your fingers are moist, wet,
or greasy.
</P>
<P>
   Where the iBook falls down are its size, weight, battery life,
and operating system. It is 13.5 inches long, 11.6 inches wide, and
nearly 2 inches high, and weighs 6.6 pounds _ larger and heavier
than any textbook I ever carried during my student days. This size
lets Apple equip the iBook with a full-size keyboard, but the
weight increases the chance it will be slammed around when a
student drops his or her heavy backpack on the kitchen floor at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life is another subject of contention. Apple says the
iBook's lithium ion battery has enough juice for 6 hours of
operation. But when you turn it on, the built-in battery gauge
reports just 3 hours and 30 minutes of power is available. In my
testing, the battery delivered between 3 and 4 hours of life with
typical use. Replacing the battery is hard, too, and charging takes
2 hours when the computer is off _ and 4 hours when the system is
running. Fortunately many universities have begun installing
outlets in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the iBook's biggest liability is Apple's Macintosh
operating system. To be fair, MacOS 8.6 is much more reliable than
previous incarnations; not once did the iBook crash while I was
using it. This computer also goes to great pains to be
Internet-ready, walking you through the Internet setup process when
you first turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   But once I got out on the Internet, I ran into problems. Some
Web sites looked bad, and others wouldn't work at all, because
their designers had not tested them with Macs. Apple doesn't equip
MacOS with a Telnet or FTP client, making it difficult to use some
services on the Internet. I also ran across many applications,
screen savers, and demo programs that were designed for Windows and
wouldn't work on the iBook. Using the iBook reminded me what it's
like to be a computational minority.
</P>
<P>
   Java was supposed to be the big salvation of Mac users. But when
I went to the Sun Microsystems Javasoft Web site
(http://www.javasoft.com), I got Java run-time errors with Internet
Explorer. Downloading the latest version of Java from Apple didn't
solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
   I also was disappointed with the iBook's Web browsing speed.
Despite its fast processor, neither Netscape nor Internet Explorer
ran as quickly on the iBook over my cable modem as the Web browser
on my Pentium III desktop computer. Microsoft and Netscape seem to
have spent more effort tuning their programs on Windows than on the
Macintosh platform.
</P>
<P>
   My last quibble is the iBook's price. A friend asked if he
should buy an iBook for his 13-year-old daughter. While it's a
great piece of equipment, I have doubts about giving a child that
age anything that costs $1,500, then watching it being thrown into
a backpack and taken to school. A better direction, I think, was
Apple's now-abandoned eMate computer. It could run 8 hours on a
battery charge, had a nearly indestructible case, and cost less
than $600. I wish Apple was again building lightweight,
long-running, and low-cost computers for the educational market,
rather than high-priced designer laptops.

BIG BLUE'S $6 BILLION E-CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ads are ubiquitous: The television commercial in which
members of a focus group complain that they get pitches for
products that are completely irrelevant to their lives. One guy
stands up, walks over to the two-way mirror, and tells the
invisible observers behind it: ``You don't know me,'' as the song
``Getting to Know You'' plays and the observers look chastened.
</P>
<P>
   Or the full-page newspaper ads showing the CEO of a 23-person
company wishfully thinking, ``I want e-mail that does more than
chat. I want to be a dot com that's open day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM says it can help.
</P>
<P>
   Once known chiefly as a maker of large mainframe computers, IBM
Corp. has refocused itself on consulting and programming services
in an effort to capitalize on the growth of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   With clients ranging from banks to toy stores, IBM's e-commerce
work generated revenue of $6 billion in the first half of 1999,
compared to less than $500 million in the first half of 1998. (That
figure includes sales ofmemory chips and other hardware.)
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kilroy is one of IBM's top e-commerce executives, responsible
for its overall strategy and for overseeing a staff of about 500
programmers and technicians. A 17-year IBM veteran based in
Hawthorne, N.Y., Kilroy was named to his post in July after stints
in Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   We spoke with Kilroy recently about how Big Blue has benefited
from the shift to retailing and general-business applications on
the World Wide Web, and what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So tell me what the term ``e-commerce'' means to IBM. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For us, e-business crosses a lot of fronts. We've rearranged
our business so it now includes everything from selling on line to
our customers, to assisting them from an e-commerce perspective so
they can sell products on line themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the transformation of IBM as a whole in the
early 1990s. We have a business cycle we like to talk about,
starting with talking about exactly what types of businesses should
be conducted on line, to building it, then running it, and,
finally, leveraging it.
</P>
<P>
   These developments are obvious in our hardware platforms,
including servers and database (products). In the early 1990s, we
started to see the Internet and Web enablement as a trend that
business was moving down. I think it was a pretty lonely spot when
we stood up and said we were doing it; there were not a lot of
other firms that were moving down the same path.
</P>
<P>
   We started marketing ``IBM net.
</P>
<P>
   commerce'' products in 1996, as our customers were beginning to
move to commerce on the Internet, and it's taken off since then.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. E-commerce has taken off in the last few years, but for how
much longer will we see big rates of increase? Isn't there an
argument that the growth rates will level off soon? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the demand from our customers is going to make it go
up. But I don't want to speculate as to where our customers are
going.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Maybe you can talk about what specifically you're selling
that you call `e-commerce'? Some companies, I'm told, use the term
for divisions that mainly sell general servers and hardware. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. IBM goes to market with the perspective that we'll do a lot
of work using the consultants who reside within IBM, assisting
customers. Often we lead with a consulting engagement, then it
might lead to hardware or software sales.
</P>
<P>
   The retailers involved in e-commerce get a lot of coverage,
because it's a market that has adopted the technology relatively
quickly and it's obvious to consumers. But there are also a lot of
manufacturers who are connecting themselves to suppliers in a
business-to-business environment.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's connections between manufacturers and distributors,
or distributors to resellers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which segments are growing the most quickly? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To date it has been business-to-consumer, but what's growing
most rapidly now is business-to-business. That's because they're
not buying one book at a time, they're buying a whole tractor-load.
It's kind of a maturing of companies that have (already) gone
business-to-consumer.
</P>
<P>
   I think the two are trending to be equal (in size) within a few
years. That plays to some of our strengths at IBM, in terms of the
technology we have to offer. A lot of our customers have found a
need for scalability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mean small start-up companies that want to scale up their
operations? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That, but also the ability of a site to handle commerce even
as the traf-
</P>
<P>
   fic increases by tenfold or twentyfoldfor some customers. We've
seen a number of these situations. At IBM, we had a tenfold
increase in just one year. So the customers are looking to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a retail environment, as customers tie in their
ads with their regular promotions, they're seeing increased
traffic. As you do this, you have to understand the impacts and the
ability to serve customers. For example, do you have enough square
footage and inventory on hand to serve clients (who come in
through) the Internet site?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any areas of retailing or business in general that
aren't ripe for e-commerce? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think there will be some aspects of e-business (tied to)
almost everything we interact with. What's interesting is that
you'll be looking at a retail environment with a multichannel
approach. You could purchase items from a site, then return them to
a bricks-and-mortar location.
</P>
<P>
   This means there has to be a whole new set of policies and
procedures as well, to present one (business) front to the
customer. What our consultants can do is to work through how to
implement these.
</P>
<P>
   This also means looking at interactions between users coming
into a site and what type of products they're buying. You have to
look at the associations . . . and tailor their experience based on
their past usage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It seems like the lines are blurring between technology and
marketing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That's true, and the customers we're speaking with are
executives who look at this as a tool. There's a tight partnership
between the IT (information technology) executives and the
marketing executives now. And there has to be, so one side is aware
of what the other is doing. It's a change, it wasn't a natural
thing to do, in the past, to inform the IT department of the new
billboards that you're putting up along the highway. But now you
have to.

`STRUGGLING' BRADLEY CASHED IN AS A SPEAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear Bill Bradley tell it, he spent 1997 and
1998 ``struggling as a small businessman'' and getting to know real
people.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bradley says, he has collected campaign money this year
without relying on corporate political action committee money,
unlike some other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a challenge to Bradley's effort to present himself
as a regular guy and a reform-minded candidate, especially by
supporters of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator hardly struggled financially in
the two years after he left the Senate, collecting $2.7 million in
speaking fees and more than $500,000 in consulting fees, most of it
from special interest groups, brokers and bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley has been able to compete with Vice President
Al Gore in campaign fund-raising partly by using the practice of
bundling contributions from many people within the same company.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while Bradley won't accept a $5,000 PAC contribution from
a company, he did take $209,000 in bundled contributions from the
Wall Street firm of Goldman Sachs, according to a report this week
from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is more than 40 times better than taking PAC money,''
said the center's director, Larry Makinson, who oversaw the study.
Makinson said Bradley's acceptance of speaking fees _ which in one
case amounted to $300,000 from a single company _ and the bundled
contributions are part of a Bradley pattern that has gone largely
unnoticed until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds out how the system works, and he uses it to his
advantage,'' Makinson said. ``He does everything legally, but
certainly to his advantage. He hasn't broken any laws, but you
can't ignore the fact that someone got $300,000 from a
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane earlier this week mocked Bradley's
comment that he spent 1997 and 1998 pursuing interests not
available to him in the Senate. ``Apparently those interests
included millions of dollars in special interest speaking fees and
big business consulting money,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, to be sure, has some well-reported and questionable
fund-raising activities, such at his appearance at a California
Buddhist temple to raise money for the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection
campaign. This year, the vice president has hired a number of
lobbyists from special interest groups as top aides, including
Carter Eskew, who previously worked for the tobacco industry. Gore
also has taken bundled contributions, although not as much as
Bradley. Both Gore and Bradley do not take PAC money.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no suggestion of illegality about Bradley's
personal financial windfall or the bundled campaign contributions,
the practices could create a perception problem, something Bradley
has previously been careful to deal with as soon as they arose.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when he was a senator 10 years ago, Bradley was
criticized for accepting tens of thousands of dollars in speaking
fees and then became one of the first senators to stop accepting
such money. ``I didn't want to have to deal with questions about
potential abuses by other people,'' Bradley said in explaining his
decision in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But in the two-year period after Bradley resigned from the
Senate _ including a year in which he was actively preparing to run
for president _ he became one of the country's most prolific and
best-paid speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Often earning more than $30,000 per speech, he collected $2.7
million in two years, according to Bradley's financial disclosure
statements and income tax returns. Typically, Bradley flew to a
city, delivered a talk on ``America: The Path Ahead'' for an hour
or two to a corporate group, and collected his check.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Key Corp. Bank, liked Bradley's speeches so much
that it hired him for 13 lectures, paying Bradley an estimated
$300,000 to $400,000. The bank hired Bradley for speeches in
locations ranging from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore., to
Anchorage, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speeches, usually delivered to the bank's clients,
focused on ``the impact of the new economy on pluralistic
democracy,'' a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's customers included Barclays Global Investors, Sprint
Long Distance, Advanstar Communications, Lubrizol, First Union
Capital Markets, HealthPartners, the Professional Liability
Underwriting organization, the American Telemarketing Association,
and the Fabless Semiconductor Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also was paid $200,000 as an adviser to J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co., $100,000 as a consultant to Morgan Guaranty, and another
$200,000 in various other contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Bradley was asked on by New Hampshire radio station
WSMN-AM last January how he had spent the prior two years, he
answered: ``For the last two years I've been a small businessman
with about three people working for me. I've been out here
struggling as a small businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's fund-raising success in the campaign arena has come
partly from his ability to raise so many bundled contributions from
Wall Street firms. In addition to the $209,000 from Goldman Sachs,
Bradley's campaign received the following, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics: Citigroup Inc., $90,450; Lehman Brothers,
$87,650; Merrill Lynch, $74,190; Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter &AMP; Co.,
$67,375.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, Gore's largest bundled contribution was $122,875
from Ernst &AMP; Young, while Republican George W. Bush's largest was
$185,000 from Vinson &AMP; Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, frequently
worked on legislation that affected many of the companies that paid
him speaking fees or gave his campaign bundled contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Bradley described his committee work:
``Whenever we considered a big tax bill, the room would be full _
standing-room only _ and the hall outside would be lined with
lobbyists, each trying to get a provision in the tax bill that
would reduce his or her clients' taxes while leaving the rest of us
paying higher taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking fees, or honorariums, for members of Congress became a
controversial topic a decade ago, leading Congress eventually to
ban them in exchange for a pay raise. Even after Bradley stopped
accepting the fees in 1989, he defended them as an appropriate
supplement to his income, and he denied that any policy was
influenced by the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said Bradley stopped accepting the
money to avoid any questions about possible improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley resumed accepting the fees after retiring from the
Senate because ``he hadn't decided to run for president,'' Hauser
said. ``He wasn't thinking of running for president.''

`BANSHEE' HASN'T LOST NAFZGER'S CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Racing is the ultimate ``now'' sport. A horse
is only as good as its last race, but ``What have you done for me
lately?'' is not a question trainer Carl Nafzger wants to hear
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger's charge, Banshee Breeze, this year won her first four
races impressively. The 4-year-old filly was practically anointed
as the female handicap champion by August. But she lost her next
two starts, and has fallen to the 4-1 third choice in Saturday's $2
million Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger became animated Wednesday when asked if Banshee Breeze
had to win the Distaff to become the champion. ``No way, no way
anybody else should get it,'' he said, while waving his arms for
emphasis. ``This is the only sport that kills its champions. We
don't ever put our horses out there to compete on an even playing
field. Oh, no! We have to have a handicap, and put 20 extra pounds
on the best horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze, who was the 4-5 favorite, was beaten a nose by
the older Escena in last year's Distaff at Churchill Downs, but was
still named top 3-year-old filly following a 10-6-2-2 season. This
season, she ripped off wins in the Rampart Handicap at Gulfstream
in February, the Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn in April, the
Fleur de Lis Handicap at Churchill Downs in June, and the Gor For
Wand Handicap at Saratoga in August. In each case, Banshee Breeze
gave her rivals weight.
</P>
<P>
   The first blot on Banshee Breeze's 1999 record came when
Beautiful Pleasure defeated her in the Personal Ensign Handicap
over a sloppy track at The Spa Aug. 27. Banshee Breeze carried 124
pounds that day, while Beautiful Pleasure carried 113.
</P>
<P>
   Keeper Hill upset Banshee Breeze, at equal weights of 123
pounds, in the Spinster at Keeneland Oct. 16. Nafzger blamed that
loss on a five-wide trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``She beat every filly out there every time she ran, until she
gave one 11 pounds,'' said Nafzger. ``At Saratoga, she gets beat
and nobody said anything about her carrying the high weight. They
just jumped up and said: `Banshee Breeze isn't what she used to
be.' That's what they did. She was behind by nine lengths down the
backstretch, and closed seven of them to get beat by just two. But
they said she's not good enough. You can't keep bouncing back and
forth like a rubber ball. If the Breeders' Cup alone is going to
decide who the champions are, why run horses the rest of the year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Weight killed Skip Away last year. They kept putting weight on
him, and putting weight on him. He tried his guts out in the
Classic (chasing the pace before finishing sixth), but he had
carried too much weight. People talk about the champions of the
past carrying weight. But they never saw an airplane, they weren't
flown here and there for target races. It's a different world
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze is a special horse to the 58-year-old Nafzger.
She is by Unbridled, whom he trained to win the 1990 Kentucky
Derby, putting him on the map. Unbridled went on to win the
Breeders' Cup Classic at Belmont the same year. Nafzger earned the
Eclipse Award, while Unbridled was voted 3-year-old champion colt.
Until Banshee Breeze, who is owned by James Tafel, Nafzger had not
had another nationally prominent horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done everything. Since her first race (finished seventh
in debut), she's been 1-2-3 every time,'' he said, referring to the
career record of 17-10-4-2. ``She's had a remarkable career. She's
just a great filly. She hasn't run a race this year that she hasn't
given her best.''
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger may be right in thinking Banshee Breeze has been sold a
little short for the 1 1/4-mile Distaff, but she still faces a
difficult task. Silvebulletday, the 3-year-old filly who has won 8
of 10 races this year, and 14 of 17 lifetime, has been made the 5-2
favorite. Beautiful Pleasure, who followed up her victory in the
Personal Ensign with another win in the slop in the Beldame at
Belmont Oct. 10, is 3-1, and Keeper Hill is 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but Banshee Breeze's best, and that of her rider, Pat
Day, will do. As with the Spinster, the Distaff is weight-for-age,
with 3-year-olds carrying 120, and older 123.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeper Hill got a dream trip in the Spinster, and we got a
wide trip,'' said Nafzger. ``Banshee Breeze had a rough trip, and
Keeper Hill got through a gap, and grabbed the rail. Horses on the
rail won all day. I don't like to make excuses, but you can look at
the films and see she was five wide from out of the gate to the
finish. Still, Keeper Hill is a very nice filly. It's no disgrace
to be beaten by her.''
</P>
<P>
   For bettors, Banshee Breeze has a strong positive on her record:
She is 4 for 4 at Gulfstream, while none of her eight Distaff
opponents have ever raced over the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's an advantage, but it's definitely not
against her,'' said Nafzger. ``She has consistently run good races,
and she will run big on Saturday.''

<P>
   Cate Whitfield is on her third job in 25 months. She didn't even
look for her newest one, at a hot new Web site design firm with a
roster of big-name corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based iXL Inc. found her, wooed her, and made an
irresistible offer: A 20 percent raise, a pile of stock options,
and a mod office in Cambridge, Mass. where rows of employees' gray
cubicles are decorated with lava lamps and Austin Powers posters.
Just as important, Whitfield felt at home among a phalanx of young,
creative co-workers, many of whom, like her, happen to be amateur
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to job hop _ I really didn't. There were
opportunities because the market's so hot,'' said Whitfield, the
company's new quality-control director, who is 29. She said she is
determined to stay at iXL ``as long as humanly possible.''
</P>
<P>
   How long she stays is a question.
</P>
<P>
   Federal data indicate Americans are changing jobs at a faster
pace than they have in years. The US Department of Labor's ``quit
rate'' is a proxy used by economists to gauge labor-market
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The quit rate, or percentage of people who are not working each
month because they left their jobs voluntarily, typically to take
another position, has jumped from 11.8 percent, on average, in 1997
and 1998 to more 13.2 percent this year. The monthly rate soared
this year as high as 14 percent or more in April and again in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that they can change jobs and get a
significant salary increase. That's accurate _ they can,'' said
Jack Mohan, president of Management Recuiters International of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In today's white-hot job market, people like Whitfield are
changing jobs at a rapid clip. With joblessness at record lows,
companies desperate to hire talent are throwing money and perks at
prospective employees, and workers aren't shy about shopping their
talents in the search for better pay, bigger challenges, and a
livelier lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   For years after the 1991 recession, the quit rate was flat, said
Wayne Ayers, chief economist for FleetBoston Financial Group.
Suddenly, ``a rapidly expanding economy and tight labor market''
are ``making workers more confident and more willing to roll the
dice and take a chance,'' Ayers said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's greatest
worries. While the Fed has no evidence ``wage inflation'' is
occurring on a national scale, labor markets in certain industries
and in certain parts of the country are extremely tight and wages
are accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a nationwide war for talent, particularly among
high-tech companies,'' said Sam Williams, president of the Metro
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, which is launching a nationwide
campaign to recruit workers to the Georgia city's budding high-tech
community.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech centers such as Massachusetts are experiencing an
acute shortage of workers. The state's unemployment rate, which
dropped last month to 2.9 percent, is driving up wages in the
state. Massachusetts' workers wages are up between 6 percent and 9
percent, on average, over the year ending March 1999, the latest
figures available. Nationwide, wages were up 3.9 percent during
that period.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech job market, competition is fiercest, especially
for college-educated workers whose jobless rate has fallen below 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Big boosts in pay aren't just going to young employees willing
to work long hours. Middle-aged computer programmers had a tough
time finding work in the emerging Internet economy of the early
1990s, because they knew one computer language, Cobol, and
employers wanted C(plus plus) writers. Today, those programmers are
wildly in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Basser, who is 49, got a 25 percent raise by leaving his
old job, after two years there, to accept a position at Intrinsix
Inc. Basser has 20 years of experience as a programmer under his
belt and quickly lined up interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Intrinsix's recruiter, Amy Tomaiolo, knew that when she set out
to hire Basser. The Westborough, Mass. firm, which contracts with
clients to design customized chips, agreed to pay Basser a $120,000
salary _ more than he had asked for, she said. ``We bumped it up.
We wanted him now. We didn't want him to look at other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Basser, who had interviewed with four companies, never seemed to
doubt he could find more interesting work, at higher pay. ``There
are jobs everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The seller's market for jobs has missed some segments of the
population. While computer programmers are in demand, managers in
high-tech have a tougher time finding work. David Mooradian said he
sent out 75 resumes before landing a job as project manager for
Acadia Software Co. in Boxborough. ``It's not as good as it appears
to be. It's not as good as the press is making it out to be,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And some industries, such as banking and health care, are
shrinking, rather than generating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are growing signs of tight labor markets in a variety
industries. For hospitality-industry staff, for example, ``You're
more apt to get a big boost to take a lateral move'' to a new
company, rather than wait for a merit raise from a current
employer, said Benton Prentice, president at The Diversity Search
Network, which specializes in searches in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates for high-tech jobs are in negotiations, it's
clear he or she _ and not the employer _ is in the driver's seat.
Such confidence is justified, given the constant reminders of how
highly valued technical employees have become.
</P>
<P>
   Aneka Williams, who joined GTE Internetworking in Manhattan last
March, said headhunters called her at least twice a week at her
last job. She mostly ignored them. But when she decided to get
serious about a job search, she lined up seven interviews, which
led to five job offers.
</P>
<P>
   As an account executive for GTE Internetworking, the combination
of a bigger salary and greater potential for bonuses could, if
things continue to go well, result in a 50 percent pay hike
compared with her pay at her prior employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to negotiate much because they knew it was hard
to find people,'' Williams said. ``So they made me a good offer
from the start.''

POKEMON: TOY OR TROUBLE?

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no doubt about it, Pikachu is cute, with its pointy
little ears and rosy red cheeks. Eevee, Meowth, and Sqwirtle are
cute, too, and cuteness does count, at least for 7-year-old Phillip
Nyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes my stomach hurt when the cute ones get hurt, like
when Pikachu races around like crazy and gets dizzy,'' says
Phillip, who offers sound effects to accompany each character.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, cuteness is not all there is to the Pokemon
craze, whose sale of trading cards alone is projected to exceed $80
million for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   For every 4- to 9-year-old who is counting the days to the
release of the Pokemon movie Nov. 10 or anticipating Pokemon
trading cards for Christmas, there is a parent soothing hurt
feelings from bungled trades or worrying about whether Pokemon
distorts their child's play.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon _ the name originated in Japan and means ``pocket
monster'' _ tends to baffle adults: Is it a good or bad thing?
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Pokemon involve a dizzying array of items _ TV
cartoon, video game, trading cards, stuffed animals, posters,
plastic figures, and clothes _ but it's a mixed bag of values.
</P>
<P>
   Because it appeals to girls as well as boys, it provides some
social glue, bringing kids together. But the Pokemon raison d'etre
is to use individual powers to attack each other and evolve into
something bigger and more powerful. Despite what your kids may tell
you, there is violence, but because it's bloodless _ Pidgey, for
instance, blinds opponents with gusts of sand _ it's not as
offensive as other videos and games.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Nyce, Phillip's mother, offers a good example of how
Pokemon can cut two ways. One recent night, Phillip and his brother
Matthew, 5, assumed Pokemon personae and played school, the kind of
creative play she encourages. But when they play Pokemon with
friends, she says, the play tends to be violent and follows the
scripted story line.
</P>
<P>
   That bothers her, so she limits Pokemon video watching to once a
week and card trading to each other. ``Friendships shouldn't
revolve around a commodity,'' she tells them.
</P>
<P>
   One of Pokemon's attributes is what popular culture researcher
Kathy Merlock Jackson calls ``conversational currency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For kids who are socially shy or inept, it gives them common
ground and an entree into peer play,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It also feeds into some developmental needs. ``Pokemon creates a
complicated world that connects kids to peers and separates them
from adults. That's an issue kids are working on. And collecting
has been a mainstay of childhood for decades, because it feeds into
the need for control through rules and logic,'' says Jackson, a
professor at Virginia Wesleyan College who specializes in mass
media and children's culture.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike collecting baseball cards, say, where there are
statistics and teams and categories to organize around, Pokemon is
scripted and arbitrary. There are 150 Pokemon, some more rare and
powerful than others. This makes collecting exciting but also
potentially dangerous, leading to such intense competition that
schools from Montreal to Connecticut have banned Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   School problems
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lynch, principal of three elementary schools in Wentham,
Mass., banned it after a misunderstanding over a trading card led
one fourth grader to punch another. At the McGovern School in
Medway, Mass., a school for first and second grades, principal
Annette Packard banned Pokemon three weeks ago because it
interfered with schoolwork. ``Children were losing cards and
getting so upset they couldn't concentrate,'' she says. Meanwhile,
parents were angry because children were selling cards on the bus
and coming home in tears, wanting their card back.
</P>
<P>
   From Packard's perspective, 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds are in over
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get into it because they're imitating older kids, not
because it necessarily meets their own needs,'' she says. There's
also a troubling gambling-like aspect to the trading.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock College early childhood educator Diane Levin, a
specialist in children's play, says she's seen children buy trading
cards, then close their eyes, rub the pack, and kiss it, hoping for
good cards. ``That looks to me just like what compulsive adult
gamblers do,'' she says. ``It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Maressa Hecht Orzack says the manufacturing genius
of Pokemon is that it works on chance. ``You don't know when you
buy a pack if there will be a rare and valuable card in it,'' she
says. Most children under 7 cognitively aren't able to grasp this
concept. ``Not even all 8- and 9-year-olds do,'' she says. That can
lead to great disappointment as well as an increased appetite to
buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Orzack, who is coordinator of the Computer Addiction Service at
McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., says Pokemon leads kids to
addictive behaviors. ``Some get so preoccupied, it's all they think
and talk about,'' she says. ``It consumes them.''
</P>
<P>
   She first noticed this when her 8-year-old grandson, Jacob
Friedman, arrived at a family gathering only to plop down in the
middle of the relatives with his Pokemon Game Boy. ``That he could
block out everything that was going on around him and not interact
with anyone speaks to its seductive power,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For the 8- to 11-year-old, the appeal is not surprising. The
more complicated the game, the more intrigued they are. There's
intellectual value in that, but, again, Pokemon potentially takes
them to a risky extreme, says Eugene F. Provenzo Jr., an education
professor at the University of Miami who researches childhood
culture and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon is so engrossing, it creates a different reality for a
child, where the real world is replaced by a simulated one,'' he
says. ``The more a kid is in that world, the more real it becomes
and the harder it is for him to disengage. He can begin to lose
connections to people and the environment, to shut himself off, and
to think that violence doesn't have real consequences.'' Pokemon,
for instance, ``don't kill each other,'' explains Orzack's
grandson. After they're attacked, he says, ``They just faint. Then
you can revive them.''
</P>
<P>
   While some parents want to forbid Pokemon, Jackson warns against
it: ``That makes it more desirable.'' Ignoring it isn't good,
either, though. Better strategies include:
</P>
<P>
   --Setting limits. Much as Nyce has done, Jackson suggests
containing the play in ways that make sense given your child's
personality. If it makes her overly competitive _ ``I can't believe
Sara has that card! I have to get it!'' _ then perhaps the limit is
that she can trade with friends but only at home, where you can
monitor, or that she cannot trade at all. If Pokemon interferes
with homework, play, or mealtime, set priorities with her.
</P>
<P>
   --Encouraging other activities. Support and accommodate other
interests your child has. Be sure she's not sacrificing other
activities to play Pokemon. Seven-year-old Aaron Nevin was about to
do that recently. His mother, Signe, says, ``He gets up early every
day to watch it on TV at 7 a.m. One day he was planning to skip
hockey for a special episode. `Uh-uh, bud,' I told him. `That's not
how it works.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --Facilitating self-censorship. The more conversations you have
about Pokemon, the better able she will be to place her own limits
on it. Tell her what you do and don't like about it, and ask her
questions. For instance: What is it about Pokemon that appeals to
you? Are you learning anything from it? If it's just fun, how does
it compare to other things you do that are just for fun? Why do you
think your friends like it so much? With an older child, talk about
the elements of chance: Do you think the manufacturers manipulate
children into wanting to buy more? What values do you think Pokemon
teaches?
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Orzack's grandson likes it so much is because
he loves to collect things, including rocks, minerals, and baseball
and basketball cards. ``The good thing about Pokemon cards is that
even though you don't find rare cards in every pack, no matter what
pack you get you get a holographic card,'' says Jacob. ``It's
really fun to look at them in the car when the sun is shining and
reflect them onto the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Now how's that for a reminder that there may be more to Pokemon
than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Children who are prone to obsessive behavior, are easily
pulled into new fads, or are exceedingly anxious to please peers
are most at risk for negative influences from Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   --Children who spend a lot of time in their Pokemon world,
especially the Game Boy, may seem confused and disoriented as they
try to transition back to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   --Some parents accept Pokemon because its violence is less
graphic than other computer/video violence. But researchers say it
still sets young children up to be more accepting of the next level
of violence, whenever and wherever it comes along.
</P>
<P>
   --Help your child learn to be a better consumer by talking about
the marketing behind Pokemon. To get some idea of how extensive it
is, check out the Pokemon Web site, http://www.pokemon.com.
</P>
<P>
   --Limit the Pokemon paraphernalia your child has and how much
you buy for him. When parents purchase it, it feels to a child that
it has your endorsement. When he has a lot of items, it's easier
for him to immerse himself in the Pokemon world. If he wants
Pokemon for Christmas, don't buy more than one item. If you only
give one gift, don't make it Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   --A child whose family can't afford to keep pace with the
Pokemon buying frenzy may be picked on by peers and feel sorry for
himself. Empower him by taking the focus off affordability and talk
instead about the values Pokemon represents: ``In our family, we
don't believe in violence, even a little bit.'' &QL;

SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF THE BUBBLING TOILET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. An injector in my basement pumps sewage from a basement
toilet up to the sewer for disposal. Whenever that basement toilet
is flushed, I get bubbling in the toilet upstairs. There is no
overflow, only bubbling. Why? It started about a year after it was
installed five years ago. A plumber did not know what was causing
the bubbling.
</P>
<P>
   JOE, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The handyman might not know, either, but here's an educated
guess. As the sewage is pumped up to the sewer, it may be passing
the inlet from the upstairs toilet _ the pipe that goes into the
sewer. This pressurizes the air in the drain from the upstairs
toilet, which pushes against the water in that toilet and causes
the bubbles. As long as there is no overflow and as long as water
stays in both toilets, it is not a problem. I can't tell you why it
started a year after the injector was installed. Check with the
manufacturer or the dealer of the injector to see what either has
to say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just had a new rubber roof installed on my 12- by 23-foot
addition roof. There is R19 insulation in the attic floor, under
the roof. A building inspector said I should vent the roof.
Wouldn't roof vents up there attract snow and rain, and resulting
leaks and ceiling stains?
</P>
<P>
   GLENN STIVERS, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The inspector may have said that you should vent the roof,
but I'll bet he didn't say how, because the roof is a shed roof
with one shallow slope butting up against the wall of the house, so
how can you put any kind of a roof vent up there?
</P>
<P>
   There are ways. One is to put flat, shallow vents high up on the
roof, one between each set of rafters. These will work well enough.
There is always a chance of snow and/or rain getting into a vent,
but the vent openings are deeply indented, further reducing the
risk of weather penetration. You could extend little roofs over
these flat vents, which are about 12 inches square, to prevent
water from backing up or blowng into them.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet is to put up half a ridge vent, where the roof butts
into the wall. Sounds crazy, but it's crazy like a fox. The
handyman did just that years ago on his similar roof, without
leaks. Cut a 2-inch-wide slot in the sheathing right at that
juncture. Now you can buy a ridge vent, the type that comes in
4-foot sections and has two plastic baffles that you normally fit
over a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of putting it on the ridge, cut off the baffle parts
of one side of the vent, leaving half of the vent's back; this
flange goes under the siding, acting as flashing, and the other
half, with baffle intact, goes over the roof. The baffle is shallow
enough to prevent backlash water from entering. The handyman added
a little aluminum flashing roof over the whole vent, extending the
drip edge to further prevent backlash water from coming in.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. When I had a leak in my hot water system pipe, which was
embedded in concrete, I had a new system installed, with baseboard
heaters and above-the-floor pipes. It works nicely, and the leak
has been bypassed. Trouble is, there are a number of new pipes
wrapped in black insulation above the floor, where there are no
baseboards. They are pretty ugly, sitting there. And in one room,
the pipe meanders in and goes around a door frame. This is really
ugly. What can I do about it? The door frame where the pipe
circumnavigates it has 18 inches of wall space on one side; the
other side is close to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   BOB McLAUGHLIN, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Box in the wayward pipes. You could build a wood baseboard to
match what is there now, to cover the pipe. If you are not getting
a lot of heat in that room, you could take off the insulation and
put a metal baseboard cover over it. As for the pipe in the other
room, I think this will work: Build a whole wall to cover the pipe.
Take off the door casing (the frame around the door opening), and
build the wall with an opening for the door. Extend the width of
the jambs and put the casing back in place. You are reducing the
length of the room by 6 inches or less, but that should not be a
problem. The pesky pipes will be hidden.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a gambrel-roof house dated 1905. There is a little
insulation on the attic floor, without a vapor barrier. A house
inspector suggested that I add unbacked insulation. Would that help
reduce the loss of heat and make the house more comfortable? I
don't intend to do the walls, but should I insulate the basement
ceiling? There are old knob-and-tube electric wires in the basement
ceiling that still work.
</P>
<P>
   JACK FLICK, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could add insulation to the attic floor, but without a
vapor barrier it will not be terribly effective. Insulation needs a
vapor barrier to do its work. Therefore, I suggest taking up the
old insulation and installing polyethylene plastic between the
joists, right on the ceiling below.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can add the old insulation, and more, unbacked
insulation. Or start from scratch and put in all new fiberglass.
And, insulate the basement ceiling. With the knob-and-tube wiring,
make sure the wiring is below the insulation; that is, exposed in
the basement. If wiring is covered with insulation, excessive heat
buildup could cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When using a bleach-and-water solution to kill mildew, can I
roll it on, or should it be brushed on?
</P>
<P>
   LOVE THAT BLEACH
</P>
<P>
   A. You can roll it on, especially if you have a big area to
treat. Another good reason to roll it is that you can control
spattering more easily than with a brush. One thing, though: The
bleach might destroy the roller, depending on what material it is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What adhesive can I use to apply a strip of metal to a hard
plasticized rubber?
</P>
<P>
   HERMAN MATTHEI, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try construction adhesive, which claims to bind anything to
anything, almost, except maybe things like foam and fiberglasss
insulation. You can buy it in a caulking cartridge, which, in a
caulking gun, makes application neat and easy. Liquid Nails is one
popular brand, and the handyman has found it effective in all the
projects he has used it in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am painting my front door, and although it is gray, it is
not metal. I bought latex paint. Can I use that?
</P>
<P>
   AN ANXIOUS RITA
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can use the latex paint, if it is labeled exterior,
trim, or house paint. That gray is a prime coat. So, put on the
latex, but make sure you use thin coats. Two will do well, and
could last for 20 years if the door is protected from the weather.

<P>
   The land was ours before we were the land's.
</P>
<P>
   She was our land more than a hundred years
</P>
<P>
   Before we were her people. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _``The Gift Outright'' by Robert Frost
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Washington was a farmer, like most of the Founding
Fathers, and he led the first American generation that defined
themselves by the land they worked, not by their loyalty to the
British crown.
</P>
<P>
   On the bicentennial of his death, he is a distant figure we can
hardly relate to: seemingly able, honorable, and brave, but stiff
and dull. But by examining Washington's passionate relationship
with his land, garden historian Mac Griswold has executed a
flanking maneuver on the general, trying to gain unguarded insights
into his interior life. Her new book, ``Washington's Gardens at
Mount Vernon: Landscape of the Inner Man'' (Houghton Mifflin), is a
character sketch disguised as a garden book.
</P>
<P>
   Though Washington was embalmed by fame in his own lifetime and
turned into a wooden national symbol in iconographic paintings,
Griswold seeks a more intimate ``secret George'' in his planting
lists, account books, planning sketches, and gardening
correspondence, as well as the memories of some of the 400 visitors
a year who trooped to his plantation to visit the Great Man. And of
course there's the wonderfully preserved 18th-century landscape of
Mount Vernon itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington she finds in the garden is industriously
home-loving rather than scholarly, a vigorous doer more than a
thinker, ``dignified yet fashionable, productive, temperate,
observant, even scientific.'' There is no debunking here, for
Washington was who he appeared to be, even when rolling up his
sleeves and getting his hands dirty (which shocked European
visitors). And yet the land also yields a more human GW, a man who
often compares building a farm to building a country.
</P>
<P>
   There are some surprises. A theater lover, Washington had a
flair for gesture (more than for speech) that served him well as a
leader. It also shows up in the Mount Vernon landscape, which he
designed with ``little teasers, hidden entrances and little views
that _ blam! _ open up into big displays. He's great at
surprises,'' says Griswold in an interview. ``There's a theatrical
aspect to Mount Vernon, a sense of tension different from other
gardens of the period. It's a series of acts.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're fast-paced. ``No other plantation has that
succession of little flashing views. Washington was the best
horseman of his day, and he rode very fast. Other places had more
fixed views, but here the views are meant to be seen while moving
along, glancing left and right,'' the author says.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a man who had to keep busy every minute. Mount Vernon
was one of five farms Washington owned and visited daily. The
others produced the money crops. Washington was the first in his
area to switch from growing tobacco to mixed farming, because the
English controlled the tobacco market and set the prices. He worked
hard to make a go of the farms financially, a battle he gradually
lost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon as mecca
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon was the home farm and, after the war, the display
place for welcoming a stream of visitors, many from countries
seething with revolutionary discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens of Mount Vernon are today, as 200 years ago, laid
out in five separate areas: the botanical garden for rarities, the
upper garden, the kitchen garden, the vineyard enclosure for mostly
fruit trees, and the classic 18th-century landscape garden with its
lawns and views.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, another Virginia planter, is the most famous
gardener among the Founding Fathers. And yet many experts think
Mount Vernon a better garden than Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was the new republic's greatest intellectual, while
Washington was relatively uneducated, the only one of our early
presidents who didn't attend college. ``Jefferson once said a
wonderfully cruel thing: Washington spends the time on his farm
accounts that another man might spend reading a book,'' Griswold
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But while Jefferson experimented endlessly and wrote eloquently
about growing things, Washington had the greater ability to
envision a goal and doggedly see it through. Not that Washington
didn't live in the future, like all gardeners. Some of the final
entries in his papers are projections for crop rotations for
1800-1803. But when he died, on Dec. 14, 1799, the Mount Vernon he
left after 45 years of work was essentially a completed vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Washington was his persistence. If 92
trees died one spring, he'd plant 92 more that fall in a different
place,'' Griswold says. ``He'd write: `I planted the grass and it
got washed away. I replanted the grass and it got washed away. I
replanted the grass.' Some of it's pretty dull reading. But he
doesn't sound like a dull man, but a man who's comforting
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His pride and joy
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Mount Vernon did comfort Washington when life was rockiest.
During a dispiriting period in 1781, between the mutiny of his own
troops and punishing raids by the traitor Benedict Arnold, General
Washington wrote his cousin Lund Washington, who was running the
farm in his absence:
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anything doing, or like to be done with respect to the Wall
at the edge of the Hill in front of the house? Have you made good
the decayed Trees at the ends of the House, in the Hedges &AMP;ca. Have
you made any attempts to reclaim more land for the meadow? Any
acct. of these things would be satisfactory to me, and infinitely
amusing in the recital, as I have these kind of improvements very
much at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet after his cousin sent wine and felicitations to the British
when they anchored their ships in the Potomac River near Mount
Vernon (in hopes they would spare the plantation), the general was
furious. He sent Lund Washington a scolding letter, saying he'd
rather the British burned Mount Vernon to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his idealistic consistency, George Washington was
faced with a monstrous inconsistency. Though he was fighting a war
for independence, his Mount Vernon was built and run with slave
labor. In fact, he was one of the biggest slaveholders in the
Chesapeake area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote in his private correspondence that he would not dare
speak against slavery because it would split the new country
apart,'' says Griswold. ``He tried to work his way out of slavery
after the war. He accepted it before. When he came back from
fighting the War of Independence, he decided he would never again
break up a slave family by selling its members, and he was alone
among the slaveholding Founding Fathers in freeing his slaves upon
his death.''
</P>
<P>
   The general amazed everyone by returning to his farm after
winning the war instead of heading the new country, as either
president or, as many wanted, king. Mount Vernon became not only a
place of international pilgrimage, but also Washington's excuse for
staving off the burdens of power. The farm needed him. According to
Griswold, Washington's happiest years were from 1783 to 1789 at
Mount Vernon, after the war and before he was practically forced to
assume the presidency by a grateful nation reassured by his lack of
power lust.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was old for his time when he died, from an acute
throat infection after returning to Mount Vernon. What had kept him
out in a wet December snowfall the day before was planning for a
new gravel walk and fishpond down by the river. He was buried at
Mount Vernon. The land was his, and he was the land's.

EVERY DAY, IN EVERY WAY, IT GETS BETTER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; headline caught my eye: ``Positive thinking may rejuvenate
elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   The story reported that researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center have found that using words such as ``wise'' and
``astute,'' as opposed to ``senile'' and ``diseased,'' was all it
took to make older subjects pick up the pace on walking tests. The
researchers concluded that stereotypes about getting old may
significantly affect how older people function.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific research never ceases to amaze me. What a
breakthrough this is. It should be of particular interest to
members of my own generation, the first in recorded history that
steadfastly refuses to grow old, AARP memberships notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   This finding is a red flag to alert us that we should stop
dealing in age-ist stereotypes now, before we become officially
elderly. When is that likely to happen? It's a mystery. As J.N.
Hook put it, ``No one knows for sure when elderliness begin, but
suddenly it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   We should try to banish words such as ``old'' and ``elderly''
from our vocabularies and refuse to describe ourselves as anything
but ``young.'' After all, youth could be construed as a relative
concept. You're always younger than somebody. Even when you're 104,
there's bound to be somebody out there who's 106, which means
you're young, comparatively.
</P>
<P>
   You say you're hard of hearing? I think not. You're a discerning
listener. It's not hard to listen to something interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not cranky. I have high standards. It's not my fault if
others fail to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Gray hair? It's always premature.
</P>
<P>
   And these aren't split ends. They're nature's own hair
volumizers.
</P>
<P>
   Considering a face lift? Think of it as an exercise in surgical
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Dentures? A handy portable smile.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn? A natural appetite suppressant.
</P>
<P>
   You're not nearsighted. You see selectively.
</P>
<P>
   And don't imagine for a moment that you're suffering E.D. It's
merely power-napping.
</P>
<P>
   Forgetful? Of course not. It's just that your memory is highly
selective.
</P>
<P>
   Adult diapers? Think of them as convenience lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Liver spots? Beauty marks.
</P>
<P>
   Your jowls aren't sagging. Your cheekbones are getting higher.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what those young _ excuse me _ younger whippersnappers
may say, you're not eccentric. You're a non-conformist, a free
spirit, an independent thinker.
</P>
<P>
   And you're not ``irregular,'' as they say in the laxative ads.
You're unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   These are not elastic waist pants I'm wearing. They're
conveniently adjustable.
</P>
<P>
   And don't call it a girdle, or a corset, or a foundation
garment. It's a body shaper.
</P>
<P>
   Varicose veins? Trophies of experience, road maps of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Meals-on-Wheels? Your caterer.
</P>
<P>
   And let's get this straight. This isn't fat around my waistline.
It's a health precaution, a hedge against starvation.
</P>
<P>
   You're not rambling. It's your personal oral history project.
</P>
<P>
   Pain? It's your body's way of reminding you that you're still
alive.

BANKS MOVE TO BLOCK BAN ON ATM SURCHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of bankers is seeking an injunction
to block enforcement in San Francisco of a voter-approved ban on
ATM surcharges long before the ordinance can become law.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, just one day after voters overwhelmingly voted to
outlaw the fees, attorneys for a banking trade association as well
as counsel from Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank were in the
courtroom of Judge Vaughn Walker of U.S. District Court in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   They requested an expedited hearing at which they will ask for a
preliminary injunction to suspend enforcement of Proposition F,
which passed by 62 to 38 percent in Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Walker granted the request and set a hearing date for Nov. 15,
rejecting arguments by the city attorney's office that the
expedited hearing was inappropriate because the ordinance would not
take effect until 10 days after the Board of Supervisors certified
the election results, meaning perhaps early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a slap in the face of voters,'' said Jon Golinger,
consumer director for the California Public Interest Research
Group, which led the Prop. F campaign. ``They march into court to
claim that they are above the law of San Francisco, but they have
to live by the law, no matter how much money they have.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based California Bankers Association is
joining the two banks as a plaintiff, and in the same action will
seek an injunction against an identical surcharge ban approved by
city council of Santa Monica, Calif., on Oct. 12 and scheduled to
take effect next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers argue that this is a case of federal preemption.
</P>
<P>
   They say municipal laws cannot regulate nationally chartered
banks under language in the National Bank Act. That is supported by
recent rulings by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeal in an Iowa case
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, of the
Department of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller grants to national banks authority to charge for
their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``State or local ordinances that would take away that right are
of no effect,'' said John Stafford, a banking association
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers spent $380,000 in the campaign to defeat Prop. F _
compared to $15,000 spent by proponents _ and said voters had
suffered a disservice because CalPIRG and other advocates had
failed to tell them about major legal obstacles to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the tax-funded city attorney's office is embroiled in a
lengthy and serious litigation they are not likely to win,'' said
Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   CalPIRG's legal theory is that the surcharges of around $1.50
imposed on non-customers of banks cannot be justified and that
legislation, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, grants states and
cities ``the right to protect their citizens by enacting ATM
consumer protection laws,'' said Golinger.
</P>
<P>
   Prop. F was placed on the ballot after CalPIRG and other groups
gathered 17,000 voter signatures in a three-month period ended in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Slavin, a deputy city attorney, said the vote was message
to banks that their customers are tired of paying double charges
for taking money out of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the consumers have gone to the ballot box and
dedicated the resources of the city to seek redress for their
grievances'' he said. ``That is our system at its best.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association in
Washington, said prices and fees should be decided by the market,
not the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price controls will only inhibit innovation, put a halt to
future ATM growth and shut down thousands of ATMs placed for bank
consumers' free use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has rejected several attempts by former Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., to eliminate ATM surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   But Golinger said that by using the courts to block ATM
measures, banks are losing the loyalty of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks have misread this issue from day one, and are spending
so much money and are losing so badly and now think their lawyers
can get them out of it. It's more evidence they're out of touch.''

TUCKING IN THE GARDEN, THE DEVIL IS IN THE PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bedtime is nigh in the garden. And like other children,
gardeners facing bedtime suddenly get active.
</P>
<P>
   This gardener has been busy getting things ready for winter. And
I haven't been alone.
</P>
<P>
   Removing a pile of stones, I notice a tiny snake with a yellow
band around its neck (a deadly banded krait, no doubt, or perhaps
just a ringneck snake, common hereabouts). The pile of stones is
perfect winter cover for a small serpent. It wiggles down among the
stones, and, fearing I will accidentally cleave the poor thing, I
abandon that job.
</P>
<P>
   A job I had abandoned for too long was the removal of pots of
poinsettias that I had thrown into a corner of the deck when their
time had passed last winter. Leaves and dirt had accumulated there
over the summer, and by the time I removed the sodden mass, it
resembled the forest floor (not good to replicate on wooden decks).
It was such a close match that it attracted three red salamanders,
which wriggled about, perturbed at having been disturbed as they
prepared for their seasonal slumber. They got tossed under the
``Golden Showers'' rose, where they can burrow to their tiny
hearts' content.
</P>
<P>
   A closer encounter, at least a mammal, was with a mouse that
stood its ground in a crate I was emptying in the shed. It had
built itself a nice fluff-and-stuff nest and looked at me with
proportionately huge black eyes. It ran off as I removed the items
I needed from the crate, but I know it is back there now, curled
up, snoozing.
</P>
<P>
   In animals, shorter days and cooler nights trigger instincts to
hunker down. They trigger plants to suck nutrients from leaves,
shut them off, and let them go. They trigger the gardener to
reseed, rework, remove _ really a lot of work, the busiest time
since spring.
</P>
<P>
   The devil may be in the details of what is to be done, but even
more so in the priorities. Manuring the veggie garden is vital, but
that can be done later, much later, January even. Removing plant
detritus, especially any that might have been diseased, is more
pressing. More urgent still is digging tender bulbs that have to be
stored for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   That's because once their tops have died down and disappeared,
the only way to find them is to dig. And sure as shooting, every
trowel thrust will be right through a big, fat,
up-until-then-healthy canna rhizome.
</P>
<P>
   The caladiums are all but gone, the tuberoses are tender and
wanting no further cold, and the gladiolas would like to come in
now, please. I must get at this chore. After removing the rhizomes
and corms (it is tempting to simply call them all bulbs), they will
dry in the shade for a couple of days, then get popped in boxes
filled with that ubiquitous plastic-foam packing ``popcorn.''
They'll spend the winter in a cool, dry spot in the cellar. (I
check once or twice to make sure they're not too dried out; I can
give them a spritz of water from a spray bottle.)
</P>
<P>
   The lawn has rebounded from the drought, except for some dead
patches, which I have reseeded (rake, add topsoil, rake, scatter
seeds, water for two weeks). With autumn rains, everything has
rebounded. The garden has a certain lushness in a decadent way, for
while some plants thrive, others are yellowing and shriveling.
Rugosa and English roses are in bloom and fill the October air with
heady scent. The hibiscus, which were tall and spectacular with
giant tropical-looking pink flowers, are withering.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``between time.'' Not winter, not summer; not on, not
off; not grow, not go.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the gardener. The veggie garden must come out.
Collapsed, slimy squash vines, brittle, dead bean stalks. Into the
compost with them. Peppers may bear a flower or two, but they'll
produce no fruit. Nor will the cucumbers. Unreasoned greed prompts
me to leave the tomatoes; those cherries may ripen.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic goes in now. Two inches deep, in good soil. First,
though, I remove the garlic missed in the harvest, for some of
those tops, too, had disappeared. Recent wet cool weather prompted
regrowth, so I dig those bulbs; they get dried and go to the
kitchen, not the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Small boulders come out, headed for the front stone wall that,
chunk by chunk, is taking shape. A pile of boulders half up the
hill is surrounded by poison ivy, but I take care to not bruise the
foliage and get those rocks out, too.
</P>
<P>
   There is still weeding to do, plant locations to mark on my
garden plan, plant absences to note on my list of plants to
replace. All the beds must be patrolled, inspected (imprinted
mentally for long winter nights), readied for next season.
</P>
<P>
   It's bedtime, and the gardener is getting tuckered.

FUN IS STANDARD EQUIPMENT WITH THIS MERCEDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Words I associate with Mercedes-Benz: reliable, quiet,
comfortable, classy, engineered, solid.
</P>
<P>
   A word I have not associated with Mercedes-Benz: fun.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. I have met the 2000 E55 AMG in all the guttural glory
of its 349-horsepower engine, its pin-you-back-in-the-seat thrust,
its 0-60 in 5.7 seconds launch time, and I can say this about this
five-passenger sedan: FUN.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it does not look radically different from the previous
E-Class design. Same four lights peering ahead; same puckered look
to the grille. But the fenders have been made more aerodynamic; the
bumpers have been integrated into the bodywork; and the nose has
been dropped just under an inch. Subtle changes that make it look
less boxy, far sleeker.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, comfortable leather seats _ buckets up front, 10-way
adjustable, three-position memory _ with broad, firm bottom support
and fat, sure lateral trim, hold you tight for the ride. The back
seats are essentially two buckets with a hump in the middle for a
third passenger.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat, the view is excellent: just a hint of
the end of each fender and that three-pointed star-in-a-circle
looming at the end of a hood you cannot see and acting like a
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are crisp and simple: temperature and time (Why do
manufacturers keep sticking clocks behind the wheel where only the
driver can see them?) are added to tachometer, speedometer, and
temperature gauges.
</P>
<P>
   At center dash, three horizontal lines of controls operate many
of the car's features: on top is a hodgepodge that includes
switches for the heated front seats, the wipers for the headlights,
the rear-seat headrests (it drops them), central locking, and
towing.
</P>
<P>
   Below that is climate control with separate controls for each
front-seat passenger and below that, audio and telephone controls.
Steering controls for audio and telephone are an option.
</P>
<P>
   Front-seat adjustments are located in each passenger door;
buttons to raise and lower a sunscreen for the back window, or to
open the trunk, are located just behind the floor shift.
</P>
<P>
   One annoying bit of ergonomics was the location of the
cruise-control stem on the steering wheel just above, and on the
same side as, the stem controlling wipers and turn signals. Reach
out in the dark to flip the turn lever and it is possible to resume
cruise control at its last set speed. They are too close together.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage _ door bins, glove box, center console, dash _
is quite good and even the cup holder at center console, rising and
unfolding like a mechanical hand, is an unexpected touch since I've
found cup holders in most German cars to be signs of reluctant
concession on the part of manufacturers rather than a heartfelt
desire to help us sip coffee in our cars.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, of course, is smooth, stable, and quiet. The car
bursts from the line, its torque is tangibly strong at 3,000
r.p.m., and by the time you reach that you know there is something
special about this engine. Because then you realize it can get loud
_ big, American loud, rumbling, pushing you back in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The sound emanates from a 5.4-litre, SOHC, 24-valve V8. It's got
twin-spark ignition, two plugs per cylinder, and individual
cylinder control of fuel spray.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of mostly highway driving _ some of it pretty
aggressive _ the E55 got just under 20 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The driver-adaptive five-speed automatic transmission can be
used manually, clicking left and right in the drive position. Set
in winter mode, it starts the car off in second gear to avoid
slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Under way, you've got a lot going on _ for you. Automatic Slip
Control and Electronic Stability Control combine to keep you moving
where you intend to go. ASC senses drive-wheel slip and brakes the
slipping wheels or cuts back on power until the slipping stops.
ESC, monitoring steering, acceleration, yaw, individual wheel
speeds, and brake inputs, senses what the driver is trying to do.
It can apply brakes individually to wheels or reduce power to
correct oversteer or understeer.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for a stable yet nimble cruise in and out of highway
traffic and for tight, firm grip through sharp corners at speed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the ride's stability and comfort, the front suspension
is independent double wishbone, with antidive devices, stabilizer
bar, gas-pressurized shocks, and coil springs. The rear features
independent, five-arm, multilink suspension with antilift,
antisquat, stabilizer bar, gas-pressurized shocks, and coil
springs.
</P>
<P>
   The AMG wheels are big 18-inch beauties, front and rear, capped
with ultra low-profile high-performance tires.
</P>
<P>
   The ABS assists by braking front wheels individually and rear
wheels together (for stability). The Brake Assist function that
goes with it senses when you are putting on the brakes in an
emergency and beats you to the punch, applying maximum boost to the
braking.
</P>
<P>
   And if all this does not save you from the fact of a crash, the
airbag system deploys. It's got full airbags up front and side bags
in all four doors with multichamber ``curtains'' that pop up in a
severe side-impact crash and cover the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the E55, the new E-Class includes an array of variously
powered sedans, a station wagon, and the option of all-wheel drive
on select models. Prices range from around $47,500 to upward of
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --Put the E55 in reverse and check your outside mirrors. They
turn inward and go down so you can see your rear wheels as you back
up. Then they return to their original position.
</P>
<P>
   --The rear window sun shade that goes up and down at the touch
of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The center-seat front armrest. It's too far back, and you have
to lean back to get your elbow comfortably on it.
</P>
<P>
   --The exterior mirrors should be just a bit bigger. I wasn't
confident that I was seeing all I should be seeing.

BETRAYING   THE VICTIMS OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing, President Clinton knew, could make up for the loss of
their loved ones. But at least the families of Americans murdered
in terrorist attacks should have the right to sue the nations that
dispatched the killers. About that, he was adamant. As he stood
before the cameras on Feb. 26, 1996 _ two days after the Cuban Air
Force murdered four unarmed Americans who were flying a
humanitarian mission over the Florida Straits _ his sincerity
seemed beyond question.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the shootdown ``an appalling reminder of the nature of
the Cuban regime _ repressive, violent, scornful of international
law,'' Clinton urged that the victims' families be permitted to
seek legal redress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am asking that Congress pass legislation that will provide
immediate compensation to the families _ something to which they
are entitled under international law _ out of Cuba's blocked assets
here in the United States. If Congress passes this legislation, we
can provide the compensation immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks Congress passed the law Clinton wanted _ the
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996. The president signed it with much
fanfare. It empowered American citizens for the first time to seek
damages in federal court from foreign governments that sponsor
terrorism, and to collect the judgment out of those governments'
frozen assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among those invited to the signing ceremony was Stephen Flatow,
whose daughter Alisa had been murdered a year earlier. A Brandeis
University student spending a semester abroad, she was one of seven
victims killed when a terrorist trained by Islamic Jihad blew up
the bus they were riding.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow decided to invoke the new law and file suit against Iran,
Islamic Jihad's chief backer. When he notified Clinton of his
intentions _ he met the president at a fund-raiser _ Clinton said,
``I know what you're doing. We're behind you 100 percent.'' Sure
enough, when Flatow and his lawyers asked the government for data
on Iranian assets, the information was readily provided. When they
needed to serve documents on the Iranian government, the State
Department rushed to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take on the responsibility of suing a foreign
country lightly,'' Flatow told a Senate hearing last week. ``In
fact, we might not have done it at all if not for the very clear
signals from the Clinton administration that it would back us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the families of the men shot down by Cuban missiles _
Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Pablo Morales, and Mario de la
Pena _ went to court as well. They too had been encouraged by the
Clinton administration. In private meetings in Washington, they
were assured that the government would support their efforts to
seek compensation from the Cuban government. Relying on that
assurance, they filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, the Florida families were awarded $187 million
in damages by the US federal court in Miami. Three months later,
Alisa Flatow's parents won a $247.5 million judgment against the
government of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the administration was doing everything it could to
prevent the families from collecting. The Treasury Department
refused to release any Iranian or Cuban assets. Dismayed, Congress
passed an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act that stripped
Treasury of its power to thwart the families. Clinton signed the
new bill _ then turned around and signed a directive suspending it
for reasons of ``national security.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Florida families' lawyers beseeched the court's help in
enforcing the judgments they had won, they were stunned to discover
that the administration was now working actively to defeat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``No words can possibly explain our shock when we went to
court,'' said Maggie Khuly, Armando Alejandre's sister, at the
Senate hearing last week, ``and found US attorneys sitting down at
the same table with Cuba's attorneys. How can you explain to a
mother who has lost her son, a wife who has lost her husband, that
their own government is taking the murderers' side?''
</P>
<P>
   The administration argues that frozen assets provide leverage
for US diplomats negotiating with terrorist states. It claims that
permitting such assets to be seized would endanger US properties
overseas. And it maintains that allowing the families of the
murdered pilots to collect their judgment would be unfair to the
thousands of Cuban-Americans who have longstanding claims for
property stolen by the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   That last argument is specious. The law has never allowed
refugees to settle property claims out of frozen assets; Cuban
immigrants were specifically told as much when they registered
their claims.
</P>
<P>
   But even the administration's ``valid'' arguments are moot. It
has been 3 1/2 years since Congress debated the wisdom of making
blocked assets available to the victims of terrorism and voted to
permit it. The Anti-Terrorism Act is the law of the land. Clinton's
responsibility is not to undermine it but to enforce it _
especially since it was he who demanded the law in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The president's betrayal has infuriated the families' supporters
in Congress, especially Senator Connie Mack of Florida, their
foremost champion. ``What kind of message are we sending,'' he
asks, ``when the US government chooses to protect terrorists from
US law and deny justice to American citizens?''
</P>
<P>
   To lose a loved one to terrorism is an agony few of us will ever
know. That the president would compound that agony by promoting the
interests of the killers over those of their victims is
unspeakable. But if he feels twinges of remorse for the pain he is
causing the families of those who died, he has at least this
consolation: In Teheran and Havana, his actions are a source of
considerable delight.

LATEST KENNEDY BOOK SHORT ON SCANDAL, LONG ON DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost every biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy
has two essential properties: a catchy title and a lot of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``The Senator,'' the 1992 book that accused Kennedy of
using cocaine. There's ``Senatorial Privilege: The Chappaquiddick
Cover-Up,'' a 1988 book whose name speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks the pile of Kennedy biographies will get bigger. A
lot bigger. But for once, the scandal list is not.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Clymer, a veteran New York Times reporter, says he spent
nearly eight years crafting the first-ever authorized biography of
the senior senator from Massachusetts, aiming to give a ``sense of
how he has reached so many millions of Americans'' with everything
from Meals on Wheels to voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer began the project shortly after the scandalous incident
involving a weekend of partying in Palm Beach, Fla., that ended
with rape charges against one of Kennedy's nephews.
</P>
<P>
   The author says he wanted to write ``something that would have
some meat in it.'' The resulting book, ``Edward M. Kennedy: A
Biography,'' is unlikely to be considered fluffy, with early
reviews calling it the most academic book on the senator to date.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 chapters, Clymer addresses the decidedly less spicy side
of Kennedy: his legislative and political record since the
beginning of his career. Meticulously researched and reported,
sometimes in mindboggling detail, the book is not going to make
tabloid headlines, with chapter titles such as ``Unconventional
Wisdom, Airline Deregulation'' and ``More Incremental Health Care
Progress.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what Clymer intended. ``I had the sense that
Kennedy was not really understood for what he had accomplished,''
Clymer said. ``To a lot of the country, except, perhaps, Senate
insiders, his image didn't have a lot to do with his legislative
accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ($27.50, William Morrow &AMP; Co.) is being released as
Kennedy battles the Republican majority on issues ranging from
minimum wage to health care.
</P>
<P>
   The book's long gestation period appears to be a product of
Clymer's detailed reporting, which included interviews with more
than 300 people connected to Kennedy, as well as about 20
interviews with Kennedy himself. And, even though he has covered
Congress since 1963, Clymer also spent many weekends inside the
libraries of the Globe and the Boston Herald, poring over old
newspaper clips.
</P>
<P>
   What he does not do is plumb the depths of the already
well-covered scandals. There is one chapter on the senator's 1969
car crash at Chappaquiddick, in which Clymer concludes that Kennedy
was almost certainly not legally drunk by the standards of the day
and that, even if he were, his decision not to summon help
immediately afterward did not have an impact on the death of his
passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one tabloid-style vignette from Kennedy's wedding
day in 1958, in the galley proofs surveyed by the Globe, in which
his older brother, John F. Kennedy, told him ``that being married
didn't really mean you had to be faithful to your wife.'' JFK was
wearing a microphone for a family movie when he made the remark;
Edward Kennedy's bride, Joan, heard it later when she watched the
film.
</P>
<P>
   But racy stories are not by any means the backbone of the book,
which is presumably why Kennedy cooperated to such a large extent,
turning over papers _ and, at times, members of his staff _ to help
Clymer compile a complete record of his legislative work.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the advance reaction has been positive: In an October
review, Publishers Weekly said that ``Clymer's deft explanations of
complex congressional maneuverings are models of good political
reportage, and his judgements of Kennedy's character are
even-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Library Journal, a trade publication for libraries, had a
similar assessment: ``Although the writing at times becomes bogged
down in detail when complex issues such as health care are
discussed, this is likely to remain the authoritative investigation
of Kennedy's impressive legislative record.''

DODGE REVS UP FOR A RETURN TO RACING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   A lot when you are an auto manufacturer or an auto dealer and
your product's name is emblazoned on a NASCAR racer on the Winston
Cup circuit. It is seen by millions again and again on race
weekends, and by millions more when the cars appear at promotional
events leading up to races.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Dodge is going back to move forward: going back in
a historical sense to the days when Dodges were hot machines, raced
by drivers whose names we all recognize but most of whom moved on
to other brands; going back in a literal sense by turning a
front-wheel-drive Dodge Intrepid into a rear-wheel-drive Winston
Cup car.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to get back on the circuit on Feb. 18, 2001, at the
Daytona 500. For many Dodge dealers, it will be a reemergence that
has been too long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Dodge appeared in a Winston Cup race was more
than 14 years ago. The last time a Dodge won a Winston Cup race was
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sport where auto dealers have long repeated the mantra,
``Win on Sunday, sell on Monday,'' that's 22 years of potential
lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   So the dealers clamored and DaimlerChrysler, newly melded and
putting together a company ``bible'' that outlines its objectives
into the next century, included as one of its tenets that the name
Dodge would once again dance before the eyes of America's millions
of race fans.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge will build cars for five teams and be the primary sponsor
for two of them. The other three teams will be open to other
primary sponsors who step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, one of the Dodge teams will be run by Ray
Evernham, who guided Jeff Gordon to three Winston Cup
championships.
</P>
<P>
   And also significant is that the dealers who clamored for the
return _ knowing that in Winston Cup racing, there will be a return
on this return _ have stepped forward with money.
</P>
<P>
   They will take advertising money from their 39 Dodge advertising
associations around the country and pump it into the company's
racing effort.
</P>
<P>
   But they do so knowing they are not really giving up any
advertising. It's just that a different form of advertising will be
streaking around a track 33 weekends a year at speeds up to 200
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   And they know that these rolling, roaring ads will be seen: This
year, in what has become a billion-dollar-plus business, 10 million
fans have gone to Winston Cup races; 112 million watched the races
on television. It is a venue that Dodge simply could no longer
resist.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodge first ran in a NASCAR race on May 30, 1950, at Canfield
Motor Speedway in Canfield, Ohio. Between then and Nov. 20, 1977,
at Ontario, Calif. _ when Neil Bonnett won the last race a Dodge
would win _ a slew of great drivers drove Dodges and won 160 races
in them.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Lee Petty, Richard Petty, Junior Johnson,
Bonnett, David Pearson, Bobby Isaac, Bobby Allison, and Buddy
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baker, in a Dodge, who was first to break the 200 m.p.h.
barrier in a NASCAR race, reaching 200.447 m.p.h. at Talladega,
Ala., on March 24, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pettys, Baker, Pearson, and Isaac all drove a Dodge during
a championship season.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodge was at the focal point of what many consider to be a
historic moment in NASCAR history, when a driver first became
bigger than the car he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in midseason, 1978, when Richard Petty got out of
his Dodge and switched to a Chevrolet. There were rumblings that
all the Dodge fans would desert Petty. Instead, they followed him
into the Chevrolet and stuck with ``The King'' forevermore, no
matter what he drove. But they did notice what he drove.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Dodge's NASCAR fortunes plummeted, and after the
immortal Phil Good drove a Dodge to a 30th-place finish at Pocono
International Raceway on June 9, 1985, Dodge was out of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   But now the company, which has kept its hand in racing with
Vipers at the FIA World GT Championships, Rams on the NASCAR
Craftsmen's Truck series, and drag racing with the Team Mopar Pro
Stock Dodge Avengers, is back in the loop, back at a most lucrative
time for the sport. And through the Daimler-Chrysler merger,
they've got Mercedes-Benz on their side _ not a bad thing when you
consider the West McLaren Mercedes successes on the Formula One
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to give our Dodge owners, Dodge dealers, and our
employees the opportunity to cheer for their brand,'' Jim Julow,
vice president of the Dodge Division for DaimlerChrysler, said when
he announced the reentry.
</P>
<P>
   He could have added, ``and time to let non-Dodge owners cheer
for a famous driver and maybe run out and buy the car he's
driving.''

   VIEQUES-ROSSELLO-PROFILE (Washington) _ Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Rossello almost single-handedly has transformed a U.S.
bombing-range accident on the island of Vieques into a fierce

FUN IS STANDARD EQUIPMENT WITH THIS MERCEDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Words I associate with Mercedes-Benz: reliable, quiet,
comfortable, classy, engineered, solid.
</P>
<P>
   A word I have not associated with Mercedes-Benz: fun.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. I have met the 2000 E55 AMG in all the guttural glory
of its 349-horsepower engine, its pin-you-back-in-the-seat thrust,
its 0-60 in 5.7 seconds launch time, and I can say this about this
five-passenger sedan: FUN.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it does not look radically different from the previous
E-Class design. Same four lights peering ahead; same puckered look
to the grille. But the fenders have been made more aerodynamic; the
bumpers have been integrated into the bodywork; and the nose has
been dropped just under an inch. Subtle changes that make it look
less boxy, far sleeker.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, comfortable leather seats _ buckets up front, 10-way
adjustable, three-position memory _ with broad, firm bottom support
and fat, sure lateral trim, hold you tight for the ride. The back
seats are essentially two buckets with a hump in the middle for a
third passenger.
</P>
<P>
   From the driver's seat, the view is excellent: just a hint of
the end of each fender and that three-pointed star-in-a-circle
looming at the end of a hood you cannot see and acting like a
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Gauges are crisp and simple: temperature and time (Why do
manufacturers keep sticking clocks behind the wheel where only the
driver can see them?) are added to tachometer, speedometer, and
temperature gauges.
</P>
<P>
   At center dash, three horizontal lines of controls operate many
of the car's features: on top is a hodgepodge that includes
switches for the heated front seats, the wipers for the headlights,
the rear-seat headrests (it drops them), central locking, and
towing.
</P>
<P>
   Below that is climate control with separate controls for each
front-seat passenger and below that, audio and telephone controls.
Steering controls for audio and telephone are an option.
</P>
<P>
   Front-seat adjustments are located in each passenger door;
buttons to raise and lower a sunscreen for the back window, or to
open the trunk, are located just behind the floor shift.
</P>
<P>
   One annoying bit of ergonomics was the location of the
cruise-control stem on the steering wheel just above, and on the
same side as, the stem controlling wipers and turn signals. Reach
out in the dark to flip the turn lever and it is possible to resume
cruise control at its last set speed. They are too close together.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage _ door bins, glove box, center console, dash _
is quite good and even the cup holder at center console, rising and
unfolding like a mechanical hand, is an unexpected touch since I've
found cup holders in most German cars to be signs of reluctant
concession on the part of manufacturers rather than a heartfelt
desire to help us sip coffee in our cars.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, of course, is smooth, stable, and quiet. The car
bursts from the line, its torque is tangibly strong at 3,000
r.p.m., and by the time you reach that you know there is something
special about this engine. Because then you realize it can get loud
_ big, American loud, rumbling, pushing you back in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The sound emanates from a 5.4-litre, SOHC, 24-valve V8. It's got
twin-spark ignition, two plugs per cylinder, and individual
cylinder control of fuel spray.
</P>
<P>
   In a week of mostly highway driving _ some of it pretty
aggressive _ the E55 got just under 20 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The driver-adaptive five-speed automatic transmission can be
used manually, clicking left and right in the drive position. Set
in winter mode, it starts the car off in second gear to avoid
slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Under way, you've got a lot going on _ for you. Automatic Slip
Control and Electronic Stability Control combine to keep you moving
where you intend to go. ASC senses drive-wheel slip and brakes the
slipping wheels or cuts back on power until the slipping stops.
ESC, monitoring steering, acceleration, yaw, individual wheel
speeds, and brake inputs, senses what the driver is trying to do.
It can apply brakes individually to wheels or reduce power to
correct oversteer or understeer.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for a stable yet nimble cruise in and out of highway
traffic and for tight, firm grip through sharp corners at speed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the ride's stability and comfort, the front suspension
is independent double wishbone, with antidive devices, stabilizer
bar, gas-pressurized shocks, and coil springs. The rear features
independent, five-arm, multilink suspension with antilift,
antisquat, stabilizer bar, gas-pressurized shocks, and coil
springs.
</P>
<P>
   The AMG wheels are big 18-inch beauties, front and rear, capped
with ultra low-profile high-performance tires.
</P>
<P>
   The ABS assists by braking front wheels individually and rear
wheels together (for stability). The Brake Assist function that
goes with it senses when you are putting on the brakes in an
emergency and beats you to the punch, applying maximum boost to the
braking.
</P>
<P>
   And if all this does not save you from the fact of a crash, the
airbag system deploys. It's got full airbags up front and side bags
in all four doors with multichamber ``curtains'' that pop up in a
severe side-impact crash and cover the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the E55, the new E-Class includes an array of variously
powered sedans, a station wagon, and the option of all-wheel drive
on select models. Prices range from around $47,500 to upward of
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches
</P>
<P>
   --Put the E55 in reverse and check your outside mirrors. They
turn inward and go down so you can see your rear wheels as you back
up. Then they return to their original position.
</P>
<P>
   --The rear window sun shade that goes up and down at the touch
of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances
</P>
<P>
   --The center-seat front armrest. It's too far back, and you have
to lean back to get your elbow comfortably on it.
</P>
<P>
   --The exterior mirrors should be just a bit bigger. I wasn't
confident that I was seeing all I should be seeing.

COULD MESSAGE BE THE MESSENGER'S PROBLEM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
REPUBLIC OF DENIAL 
Press, Politics, and Public Life 
By Michael Janeway 
Yale University Press, 216 pp., $22.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real problem afflicting today's news media is bad news,
explains Michael Janeway in his book ``Republic of Denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind of bad news _ like presidential scandal and
celebrity tragedy _ that fills today's headlines and has the public
clamoring for some psychic relief. It's the kind of bad news,
Janeway holds, that has become the plotline of America's civic
culture in the past quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news will fail to engage people . . . and worse, will
alienate them, as long as social fragmentation pulls them away from
a common engagement with the news and as long as government and
politics in our country remain what they've become: ineffective,
degraded, debased, despised, incompetent to deal with society's
real and deep problems and irrelevant to so many millions of
Americans,'' writes Janeway, the former Boston Globe editor and
former dean of Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism who is
now director of the National Arts Journalism program at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have guessed, ``Republic of Denial'' is not for the
faint of heart. Janeway's unflinching analysis is the ``give it to
me straight, doc,'' version of media criticism. The language is
strong, the implications overwhelming, and the prognosis grave.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-paced but far-reaching, the book traverses the political,
social, and journalistic landscape in 177 bracing pages of text.
And its core thesis _ that the media and political culture are
inextricably intertwined in a downward spiral _ challenges
tinkerers and tweakers to recognize that the nation is in deeper
trouble than they might think.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the book, Janeway ties the ``upheavals in American
circumstances and consciousness that began in the '60s'' to a
series of oft-discussed factors. Foreign misadventures, social
upheaval that encompasses everything from birth control to the
environmental movement to race riots, the assassination of John F.
Kennedy, Watergate, the diminution of political parties,and urban
decay _ all helped sour the American narrative and ``unravel . . .
the assumptions'' that drove the news industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, it seemed, people did not want to know, or hear,
about a great deal that was happening in modern life,'' he writes.
And ``Republic of Denial'' is at its most provocative when it
assesses the dramatic changes this portended for a bewildered media
business.
</P>
<P>
   Like all modern media critics, Janeway addresses journalism's
destructive preoccupation with scandal and the ``character issue,''
but with a decidedly different spin. When a public figure was found
to be significantly flawed, the citizenry wanted the press to act
as ``exorcist'' and expunge the sinner, he writes. But the mood
would shift, he adds, when journalists' overagressive tactics
transformed the ``hunted animal'' into a more sympathetic figure.
</P>
<P>
   Janeway spends considerable time discussing the economic and
corporate pressures that reshaped the media in recent decades. The
sell-off of powerful family-owned papers to acquisitive chains
became a ``recipe for the generation of enormous profits,'' he
says, and created the intense synergy between the papers' bottom
lines and Wall Street. (When the recession of the late 1980s and
1990s struck, some newspapers responded by cutting back more
far-flung ``unprofitable'' circulation.) By the time Times-Mirror
CEO Mark Willes came along _ with his radical cost-cutting and
belief in the cross-pollination of news and business cultures _
much of journalism seemed to be held hostage to the vagaries of the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Janeway asserts, however, that Willes's strategy, like the
efforts of so many other desperate news executives, ignored ``the
profound roots of the news industry's troubles in political,
social, and cultural disintegration in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the author hold out any hope? Not much. He tips his hat to
the decade-old ``civic journalism'' movement for trying to connect
journalism to public life and politics, but doesn't see it as a
savior. In fact, he advances the idea that it might take a major
``crisis that stopped the nation cold,'' a ``doomsday'' scenario,
to create the reform impulse needed to fix our sick society and its
messengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forest is vast and dark,'' he warns. ``And we are in it
with no clear path out.''

LATEST KENNEDY BOOK SHORT ON SCANDAL, LONG ON DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Edits, fixes thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost every biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy
has two essential properties: a catchy title and a lot of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   There's ``The Senator,'' the 1992 book that accused Kennedy of
using cocaine. There's ``Senatorial Privilege: The Chappaquiddick
Cover-Up,'' a 1988 book whose name speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks the pile of Kennedy biographies will get bigger. A
lot bigger. But for once, the scandal list is not.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Clymer, a veteran New York Times reporter, says he spent
nearly eight years crafting the biography of the senior senator
from Massachusetts, aiming to give a ``sense of how he has reached
so many millions of Americans'' with everything from Meals on
Wheels to voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer began the project shortly after the scandalous incident
involving a weekend of partying in Palm Beach, Fla., that ended
with rape charges against one of Kennedy's nephews.
</P>
<P>
   The author says he wanted to write ``something that would have
some meat in it.'' The resulting book, ``Edward M. Kennedy: A
Biography,'' is unlikely to be considered fluffy, with early
reviews calling it the most academic book on the senator to date.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 chapters, Clymer addresses the decidedly less spicy side
of Kennedy: his legislative and political record since the
beginning of his career. Meticulously researched and reported,
sometimes in mindboggling detail, the book is not going to make
tabloid headlines, with chapter titles such as ``Unconventional
Wisdom '' and ``Health Care, Bit by Bit.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what Clymer intended. ``I had the sense that
Kennedy was not really understood for what he had accomplished,''
Clymer said. ``To a lot of the country, except, perhaps, Senate
insiders, his image didn't have a lot to do with his legislative
accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ($27.50, William Morrow &AMP; Co.) is being released as
Kennedy battles the Republican majority on issues ranging from
minimum wage to health care.
</P>
<P>
   The book's long gestation period appears to be a product of
Clymer's detailed reporting, which included interviews with more
than 300 people connected to Kennedy, as well as about 20
interviews with Kennedy himself. And, even though he has covered
Congress since 1963, Clymer also spent many weekends inside the
libraries of the Globe and the Boston Herald, poring over old
newspaper clips.
</P>
<P>
   What he does not do is plumb the depths of the already
well-covered scandals. There is one chapter on the senator's 1969
car crash at Chappaquiddick, in which Clymer concludes that Kennedy
was almost certainly not legally drunk by the standards of the day
and that, even if he were, his decision not to summon help
immediately afterward did not have an impact on the death of his
passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne.
</P>
<P>
   There is also one tabloid-style vignette from Kennedy's wedding
day in 1958, in the galley proofs surveyed by the Globe, in which
his older brother, John F. Kennedy, told him ``that being married
didn't really mean you had to be faithful to your wife.'' JFK was
wearing a microphone for a family movie when he made the remark;
Edward Kennedy's bride, Joan, heard it later when she watched the
film.
</P>
<P>
   But racy stories are not by any means the backbone of the book,
which is presumably why Kennedy cooperated to such a large extent,
turning over papers _ and, at times, members of his staff _ to help
Clymer compile a complete record of his legislative work.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the advance reaction has been positive: In an October
review, Publishers Weekly said that ``Clymer's deft explanations of
complex congressional maneuverings are models of good political
reportage, and his judgements of Kennedy's character are
even-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Library Journal, a trade publication for libraries, had a
similar assessment: ``Although the writing at times becomes bogged
down in detail when complex issues such as health care are
discussed, this is likely to remain the authoritative investigation
of Kennedy's impressive legislative record.''

THE LEAST YOU CAN DO FOR THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It turned out that former football star Walter
Payton was too sick with cancer to be a candidate for a liver
transplant. Does that fact some how lessen the acuteness of the
national organ donor shortage?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   All it means is that the great Chicago Bears' running back
became another cancer casualty instead of one of at least 10
Americans each day who die waiting for a donated liver, heart,
lung, kidney or pancreas, or the infusion of bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that Payton did not have to die knowing that
somebody out there had the capacity to save him.
</P>
<P>
   For the short time he was on the organ donation waiting list,
when all he knew was that he had a rare liver disease called
primary schlerosing cholangitis, Payton had lots of company: More
than 64,000 severely ill patients are in line in the U.S. for one
or more organs.
</P>
<P>
   For a kidney alone, the wait is about three years _ for those
who can survive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only about 18,000 women, men and children got the
life-saving organ they had been waiting for. Meanwhile, the number
of patients whose last hope is a transplant grew at a rate four
times that of the increasing number of donors.
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala, President Clinton vowed in December 1997 to raise
the number of organ donors by 20 percent in 1998. An
administration-sponsored ad campaign and educational program was
launched and the nation's 1.4 million federal employees received
donor cards.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness did grow, as did the number of donor pledges, but not
by 20 percent. Two months before the new century, there are now
nine times the number of people on the waiting list as there are
people who have identified themselves as potential donors.
</P>
<P>
   As one frustrated California pulmonary transplant specialist put
it: ``The organs are out there, but people are taking them to the
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   For a small percentage of the population, organ donation is out
of the question for religious reasons. But none of the major faiths
prohibit it. That pretty much leaves inertia, superstition and
mindless selfishness as the primary excuses for not making the
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans talk a good game, especially when a high profile
case like Payton's makes the news. They admire families and
individuals who extract something positive and beautiful from the
sudden, often violent, death of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   When they make themselves push past the natural human aversion
to thinking too long about one's own accidental demise, they know
there is no good reason to waste life-giving body parts in a crypt
or crematorium.
</P>
<P>
   They mean to do something about becoming a potential organ
donor. But they don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Payton died, before it was widely known that he
was beyond the help of a liver transplant, former 49er Keena Turner
publicly beseeched Payton's fans to stop talking and avail
themselves of a plan offered in most states: Affix an official
donor sticker to your driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the least you can do for the man,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   It still is. Even more important, you can talk over organ
donation with your family and friends and make it clear that _ if
the sad occasion ever arises _ their grief at your death should not
be an obstacle to some stranger's opportunity for life.
</P>
<P>
   After you talk it over, put it in writing. The 45-year-old
football god they called ``Sweetness'' would have been honored to
know he inspired you.

FOR SOME JOURNALISTS, AN INTRUDER FROM WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some Los Angeles Times watchers, last week's Staples Center
episode seemed like an accident waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that the Times published an Oct. 10 Sunday
magazine devoted to the new Staples Center sports facility under an
agreement to split half the profits with the center created
national headlines, roiled the newsroom, and generated mea culpas
from publisher Kathryn Downing.
</P>
<P>
   What gives the Staples story resonance is the intense media
scrutiny of the Times ever since Times Mirror CEO Mark Willes
became the paper's publisher in 1997 and ignited controversy with
his bottom-line fixation and desire to ``blow . . . up'' the wall
between the paper's business and editorial departments. When he
relinquished the publisher's job earlier this year, Downing,
considered a Willes protege, succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was everything that the old-line journalists
feared would happen with Mark Willes' attempt to marry the
editorial side to the business side,'' says Steve Geimann, former
ethics chair for the Society of Professional Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily see it as resulting from the Mark Willes
philosophy,'' counters Portlandian editor and former
American Society of Newspaper Editors president Sandra Mims Rowe.
But it is ``a huge cautionary tale about how fragile our
credibility is.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper editors' organization did some recent polling in
conjunction with its Journalism Credibility Project _ with
disconcerting results. Half of the 3,000 respondents believed
newspapers allow advertisers to influence news decisions. Almost 60
percent said papers were more concerned with making profits than
serving the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Many media analysts suggest these public concerns are not
unfathomable at a time when Wall Street's demands for fat newspaper
profit margins _ in an era of declining circulation _ pose
potential threats to journalistic independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is that kind of pressure on the economic side,
and we know it has been driven by the stock market in some way,''
says Bob Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter
Institute for Media Studies. ``At a time when folks in the counting
house are asking (journalists) to better understand the business
side . . . there are these new complicating issues.''
</P>
<P>
   One industry response to this pressure has been the
proliferation of cross-departmental teams _ featuring staffers from
news, business, and marketing _ to brainstorm on everything from
advertising to editorial projects. Of the 339 newspapers that
responded to a 1998 Presstime magazine survey, nearly 60 percent
said they had marketing committees which included editorial
employees. More tellingly, two-thirds of those committees had been
created within the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a sense that with tougher times for newspapers, there
are people trying to come up with creative ways to remain useful,
to remain economically viable,'' says Geimann. ``I don't have a
problem fundamentally with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's no surprise that the Times became ensnared on the
Staples Center issue since the explosion of new sports venues has
provided fresh economic opportunities for big market dailies. (The
Times agreement with Staples called for pursuing other cooperative
efforts that would generate new revenues.) But with them, come
ethical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, The Boston Globe published a pullout section
as a guide to the new Fleet Center that generated some income for
that facility. Globe spokesman Rick Gulla says ``the overwhelming
bulk of advertising was sold by the Globe and kept by the Globe.''
But he acknowledges that the paper treated Fleet ``as a sales agent
for a short list of potential advertisers it already had a
relationship with'' and it earned a commission on those sales. The
exact amount was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gilman, who became Globe publisher in July, said
Wednesday that the paper's policy is that ``editorial sections will
always be separate and distinct from commercial concerns. Special
promotional sections, produced by our advertising department, will
be considered on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Papers in major markets routinely produce special editorial
products to trumpet newly built athletic facilities and often
develop sponsorship and promotional arrangements with them. Some
are more creative and intricate than others. The Arizona Republic's
contract with the new baseball stadium entails running ads for the
paper on game broadcasts. In return for signage space on the
scoreboard at the new football stadium, The (Nashville) Tennessean
provides free ad space on its pages. The Baltimore Sun has a number
of promotional tie-ins with the local sports teams and supports
their community reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers clearly have less than arm-length relationships with
local teams. The Chicago Tribune Company owns the Cubs and Sammy
Sosa jerseys are sold in the Tribune Tower. Earlier this year, the
A.H. Belo Corporation _ which owns The Dallas Morning News _
created unrest in its newsroom when it purchased a small interest
in the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and in the organization
that will build a new arena.

<P>
   Like the Times incident, the controversy at the Morning News
became a major media story. And some analysts believe an open
discussion of such ethical dilemmas is the best medicine. ``I give
Kathryn Downing credit,'' says Poynter Institute president James
Naughton. ``She's at least the first to admit `I made a mistake.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``A news organization has to be very clear of what its
obligations are,'' adds Steele. ``If you don't have the principles
to guide you, to mix metaphors, you're in the whitewater without a
paddle.''

HAVE A GOOD TIME ADDING TO YOUR TOY COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every man needs tools, and in these days of liberation, every
woman as well. And there should be no distinction; in the old days
the pontificators suggested certain lightweight tools for the
``ladies' toolbox,'' usually in pink.
</P>
<P>
   But no more. As it is so sagely said, if a woman can't handle a
16-ounce hammer, she should get out of the project.
</P>
<P>
   So, what kind of toys (er, tools) would be good for the
handyperson, woodworker, or craftsperson, who probably has more
than is needed, anyway? Well, maybe an extra hammer or screwdriver
will suffice, or something as a holiday gift. But remember, if you
are thinking of buying a tool for your loved one at Christmas, let
the blessed receiver pick it out.
</P>
<P>
   But for the handyperson just starting out, here are the basics,
in no particular order of preference. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hammer. Yes, but what kind? A good question, and the answer is:
1. A 16-ounce curved-claw hammer. 2. A straight-claw ripping
hammer, sometimes heavier than 16 ounces, and good for tearing
things apart. The straight claw also makes it easier to pull nails.
</P>
<P>
   And, for those pesky little jobs of driving nails in restricted
areas, and for driving small nails, a 12-ounce miniature with a
small head. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saw. This tool is another one the handyperson needs more than
one of. Although power saws have taken over most of the sawing
chores, hand saws are still useful for short jobs, and small jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not quibble about the handyperson having duplicates.
Each handyperson has his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   As for saws: 1. Crosscut saw, one that cuts across the grain. 2.
Ripsaw, one that cuts parallel to the grain. 3. Japanese saw. Ah,
these are great, because they saw on the pull stroke, not the push,
and because their blades are thin, resulting in a thin kerf. The
blade is also flexible, allowing the cutting of dowels and other
wood inserts flush with the face of the wood without butchering it.
4. Hacksaw, for cutting metal, especially nails. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screwdrivers. You can't have too many of these: slot and
Phillips (the end of the blade has a cross instead of a slot), in
lots of sizes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pliers. Several of these will come in handy: two or three
slip-joint pliers, and a needle-nose and a bent needle-nose. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Measuring sticks. That is an old-fashioned term, but its meaning
is clear. Buy a tape rule or two; they come in many guises:
easy-to-read, even ones with electronic readings (I could never get
one to work). Buy a long one, 20 feet or more, and a wide one. A
wide blade can be stretched horizontally for good distances without
bending out of shape. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Level. A 4-foot-long mason's level is a good choice. The longer
the level, the more accurate it is, and you can use it as a
straight edge as well. It won't hurt to add a 2-footer to your tool
trove, plus a line level, one that hangs on a taut string for
checking items too long for a standard level. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knife. A knife for the handyperson is usually a utility knife,
which comes in many sizes, shapes, and weights, for light or heavy
cutting. Stock extra blades. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chisel. This tool, for cutting wood, is best bought in sets.
And, do not skimp on cost; a cheap chisel is worth far less than
its price. You have to keep chisels sharp, so invest in a honing
stone or even a grinding wheel. One rule about chisels is: Never
use a hammer on a chisel. Fat chance. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drills. The eggbeater drill, one that looks, well, like an
eggbeater, if anyone remembers what one looks like, is the old
standby and very useful. Like a utility knife, a drill should have
lots of spare bits.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of drills, one of the few power tools you really need
is a power drill. If it has a low speed it can double as a power
screwdriver. As for power, cordless tools, are the way to go. Maybe
you can add a cordless saber saw to your collection. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nailset. This is a small item that is easily bought for small
dollars and just as easily lost. It is also called a countersink,
doing the obvious chore of countersinking nailheads into wood so
the hole can be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, old-timers and fastidious workers do it differently.
They actually (so we are told) cut a tiny sliver out of the wood,
leaving one end intact, sort of like a hinge, drive the nail into
the depression, countersink it, and glue back the sliver to cover
the nailhead. It's called madness, but the end result looks great.
</P>
<P>
   Another trick to countersink nails is also by old-timers: If you
don't have a nailset, lay the edge of the head of a large nail on
the driven nail, and whack it with a hammer. You'll make a
funny-shaped hole, but you can fill it with wood filler.
</P>
<P>
   There is always something new in tools, even if the tools
themselves are still the same-old same-old.
</P>
<P>
   Oxo, the company that developed big, black, soft handles for
knives, paring knives, and other kitchen tools, has added those
handles to hammers, utility knives, pliers, and screwdrivers. They
are called Good Grips, and really are comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The screwdrivers also have magnetized ends that are specially
coated for holding screws. And, the tape rules have little buttons
of soft material on the hook, which keep them from slipping off
whatever you are measuring. Ingenious idea.
</P>
<P>
   These tools will be in stores in November, Oxo said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one final tool, even though it's not a tool, inspired by
the handyman's wife: a big box of Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can branch out into every power tool you've ever wanted.
They're called toys.

HEARTLESS TIMES FOR YOUNG LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My attitude about sex has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   If I had teenagers today, I'd be talking a blue streak about the
benefits of abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   I'm surprised at myself because I always regretted having missed
the sexual revolution. Married in 1959, I'd been taught that no man
would buy a cow when he could get the milk for free, and that it
was prudent, not manipulative, for women _ more or less _ to trade
their virginity for a wedding ring. I may have given my heart to a
number of men, but my body wasn't part of the package without an
ironclad commitment. That seems terribly calculating today, but
love and sex weren't joined at the hip back then, and I was a very
``good'' girl.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that by the time the orgy began, I was home with
babies. It was too late for me, but I was convinced my job was to
raise my children without passing on my inhibitions. For a brief
moment, it appeared the worst sex could do was break your heart,
and that could be fixed by a change of attitude. In 1960, the Pill
put an end to the fear of unwanted pregnancy and, as far as anyone
knew, only prostitutes worried about sexually transmitted diseases.
Gossip and prudishness were artifacts of a dying civilization,
affection was natural, and sex, without strings attached, was our
birthright. God, it seemed, had finally seen the way His creatures
loved one another and, behold, it was very good.
</P>
<P>
   The irony could make you cry: What we once considered the most
innocent of pleasures has become one of the most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I think it's no coincidence that AIDS appeared just as
earth's population approached 6 billion. This planet's feedback
mechanism goes into high gear whenever any species threatens
environmental limits. Why should we be the exception? If nature is
attempting to reduce our numbers, what could be a more effective
predator than deadly microbes passed on in the act of reproduction
itself? What better target than adults in their child-bearing
years?
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, of course, isn't the only threat around. Don't forget
herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, venereal warts and the
hepatitis B virus, crabs and scabies, trichomoniasis, monilia,
candida and God-only-knows-what-else. Sexually transmitted diseases
are more prevalent. They're more virulent. They're also becoming
drug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer reasonable to assume you're invulnerable, or that
the people you desire are too nice or too smart or too young to be
a source of infection. It isn't only the poor, or the promiscuous,
or the jaded who present a threat. According to Planned Parenthood,
an estimated 15.3 million cases of sexually transmitted infections
occur annually in the United States, two-thirds in people under the
age of 25. It's been estimated that anyone who has unprotected sex
with more than four partners, for example, has an 80 percent chance
of contracting genital warts, which has been linked to cancer of
the cervix and can be passed on to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   This is an unacceptable level of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Protected sex actually isn't that much safer. How can we call
protected sex ``safe'' when in actual use approximately 12 percent
of condoms fail? What kind of ``safeguard'' places participants in
grave danger one out of every eight times? It's indefensible to
teach adolescents that such a flimsy device can protect them.
Instead, we should be explaining to youngsters why sexual
experimentation is no longer an acceptable rite of passage. Casual
sex, once a thoughtless pleasure soon forgotten, is now far more
likely to lead to a lifetime of regret.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't become an old fogy, looking to the past for answers. I
consider myself a futurist who sees that changed circumstances call
for a different response. I still believe kids should feel good
about their bodies and look forward to the pleasure sex can bring.
At the same time, it's irresponsible of adults, including the ones
who produce TV shows aimed at teens, to encourage adolescents to
behave in ways that may reduce their quality of life for the rest
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a question of morality, or of certain behaviors being
good or bad. We have to make sure our children understand that it's
as important to be wise as it is to be passionate.
</P>
<P>
   Love once had the luxury of being blind.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. We now need 20/20 foresight.
</P>

COMPLEX `LEPRECHAUN' PLOT A FINE IRISH STEW

(Eds: FOR USE SUNDAY, NOV. 7 or thereafter).  
 
  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it ``Darby O'Gill and the Little People'' meets ``Local
Hero'' meets ``Romeo and Juliet'' with a dash of ``Riverdance''
thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   If that were all there was to NBC's ``The Magical Legend of the
Leprechauns,'' it would already be a weird Irish stew, but the
Hallmark Entertainment miniseries manages to incorporate a subtext
that is a light commentary on the situation in Northern Ireland.
Somehow, though, this silly tale of fairies and leprechauns has a
sufficient number of fun moments to make it worthwhile family
entertainment, even if it isn't always coherent.
</P>
<P>
   To give you the gist, here's a summary: Businessman Jack Woods
(Randy Quaid) is sent to a bucolic spot in the Irish countryside to
buy up cottages for rich Americans to use as vacation homes. Posing
as a vacationer looking for a bit of relaxation, he scopes out the
properties, but as fortune has it, he gets entangled with the
locals _ in this case that means Seamus Muldoon (Colm Meaney),
leader of the mischievous leprechauns, and an Irish beauty named
Kathleen (Orla Brady), who he quickly falls for.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, even most of the locals don't believe in
leprechauns, who keep popping up in Jack's life at the most
inconvenient times, especially when he's trying to woo Kathleen and
come clean about his real reason for being in Ireland. In the
meantime Muldoon's son, Mickey (Daniel Betts), and his friends
crash a masquerade ball held by their longtime nemesis, the
fairies, who help keep nature in balance. At the dance, Romeo, we
mean Mickey, falls in love with Princess Jessica (Caroline Carver),
the beautiful daughter of the fairy King Boric (Roger Daltrey).
When Jessica runs off with Mickey, the uneasy truce turns into a
deadly war.
</P>
<P>
   The war, as the all-seeing, all-knowing Grand Banshee (Whoopi
Goldberg) has warned, has dire consequences. First, the
``practically'' immortal leprechauns and fairies lose their
immortality. Second, nature goes haywire without the fairies
looking after it (which proves a perfect reason for wild special
effects). Despite the deaths and catastrophes, both sides are so
caught up in their own prejudices and pride that they are unwilling
to back down. If you haven't caught the analogy to Northern Ireland
by this point, there's even an appearance by some devious and
ineffectual English fairies. In the end, it's left to Jack to sort
out his life with Kathleen and make peace between the leprechauns
and fairies.
</P>
<P>
   Convoluted as the plot is, ``Leprechauns'' would have worked
better in a shorter telling. There is no real character
development, making the two-night format feel bloated. In fact, it
seems that every time the filmmakers run out of inspiration they
toss in a scene of energetic Irish dancing, a la ``Riverdance.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes a long way toward summing up this production _ a lot
of it doesn't make sense, but somehow it manages to be fun to watch
if you're not too demanding or under the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   And we have to admit that casting Whoopi Goldberg as the Grand
Banshee is crazy enough to work. After all, it makes as much sense
as NBC airing ``Leprechauns'' between Halloween and Thanksgiving
rather than around St. Patrick's Day.

HOW A CYBER SCHEME MUSHROOMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A colleague at Playboy Enterprises calls him a ``hustler,'' and
competitors in the adult entertainment industry describe him as a
``con man.'' But that didn't stop Ron Harris from grabbing
headlines and airtime worldwide this week after launching a Web
site that claims to auction the eggs of beautiful ``models.''
</P>
<P>
   The story broke Saturday in The New York Times, and by Monday
morning, the self-described ``fashion photographer'' was on all
three television networks and the front page of USA Today. The
site, www.ronangels.com, caused a stir, and infertility experts and
ethicists debated it all week on CNN and talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   But in the murky, anonymous world of the Internet, anyone with a
modem can set up a cyber shingle and claim expertise in, say,
genetics or geriatrics. On line, credibility is everything: Anyone
who's ever been fooled by the parody sites or the urban legends
that proliferate in cyberspace knows that you cannot believe
everything you read on line. And then there's the money. The
Internet is like television: the more people who tune in or ``hit''
the page, the more money the owners can charge for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a questionable cyber scheme by a pornographer
mushroom into a major news story in the mainstream media?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Harris's spokesman. ``It's controversial. It's sex.
It's power. It's money. It's the Internet,'' said the public
relations agent, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the eggman saga did not spread on line, like some mad
scientist's version of ``The Blair Witch Project.'' Matt Drudge
didn't herald an unsubstantiated rumor on his widely read
gossip/news site. It didn't spread via hysterical chain e-mail or
proliferate through anonymous postings to news groups.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the story spread the old-fashioned way, through word of
mouth and the traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   But while most of the traditional media took the story
seriously, it was almost instantly ridiculed in cyber circles. A
parody site
(http://www.nightwares.com/the-indigestible/eggs/index.htm) went up
almost immediately, featuring boxes of chicken eggs and the slogan,
``The gift that says to her, `You're not good enough for me.'''
Another site, www.topfive.com, mocked the story and listed the 15
reasons not to buy an egg from a model. And Clay Shirky, a
professor of media studies at Hunter College in New York, published
a scathing on-line article that accused the media of naivete.
``People are willing to believe things on the Net that common sense
would have kept them from believing,'' he said during a phone
interview. ``If this story had showed up on your doorstep, you
would have had a million questions, but because it's on the Net, it
pushes all the right buttons at the same time it dismantles
everyone's skepticism. A sniff test on this alone should have made
this story fall apart in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   By typing the name Ron Harris into any of the major search
engines, for example, the results link to his home page and its
gallery of ``supermodels of erotica,'' as well as a slew of adult
sites with prurient names. Most of the adult sites have been
eliminated, with the exception of a site run by Harris' company,
Erotic Home Box Office. Anyone can then run a ``Who Is'' on the
addresses of the prurient sites. This feature is available free at
www.networksolutions.com, the company that registers domain names
and compiles a list of their owners. More than a dozen prurient
sites are registered to Harris and his various companies in Santa
Monica and Venice, including Eros Entertainment Inc. and A &AMP; S
Electronic Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ronangels.com itself offers other clues. The
user agreement on the site requires that users be at least 18
because they will be ``exposed to materials ... of a sexually
oriented and frankly erotic nature.'' Last week, the site featured
eight models, and several of those models were also featured in
compromising positions on one of Harris's porn sites. The purported
``auction'' site has no auction mechanism akin to eBay or Amazon. A
$24.95 monthly membership promises to provide access to larger
pictures of the models, a common come-on on adult sites. On Monday,
the membership offered access to three grainy photographs of
models, their measurements, and a few words about their desire to
sell their eggs. But that information is now available free to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   So, just how did this story get into print, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Harris's spokesperson, the photographer dreamed
up the idea for the auction several months ago after reading that a
couple was offering $50,000 for donor eggs from a leggy Ivy League
student. Harris registered the name for the site on June 17,
according to Network Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Harris's spokesperson offered an exclusive to USA Today reporter
Bruce Horovitz, who began researching the story three weeks ago. He
contacted law enforcement officials and infertility experts,
including Diane Aronson, executive director of Resolve, the
national infertility association based in Somerville. Horovitz's
queries coincided with a Resolve conference in Cambridge on Oct. 20
and 21; the site became a heated topic at the national meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that Times reporter Carey Goldberg attended
the conference on Oct. 21 while working on a story about in vitro
fertilization. Aronson told Goldberg about the Web site; her story,
headlined ``On Web, Models Auction Their Eggs to Bidders for
Beautiful Children,'' ran two days later. The Times piece appeared
almost verbatim on the wires, and the same story, without any
additional reporting, appeared all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Horovitz lost his scoop, but he had his own trump card:
exclusive access to the ``models.'' His Page One story appeared
Monday, quoting a Misty-Lee McFern, described as a 26-year-old
mother and struggling actress from Arcadia, Calif. who is asking
$50,000 for her eggs. Another model, identified as Nicole Newman,
said, ``My only bad habit is I exercise too much.'' (Attempts by
the Globe to find both women came up empty.)
</P>
<P>
   USA Today also quoted a 40-year-old television producer named
Beth who reportedly ``stumbled across'' the site on a search engine
and bid $42,000. The ronsangels site, however, does not turn up on
searches for key words like ``egg donor'' or ``IVF'' or
``infertility,'' and it is not listed by the established
infertility sites, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our story,'' said John Hillkirk, managing editor
for the Money section of USA Today, adding, ``We have been rapidly
learning about using the Internet to check on all types of facts
and sources for all sorts of stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times ran another story Thursday that included details of
Harris's online activities. The Times National editor, Dean Baquet,
defended Goldberg's story. But what about covering the Internet in
general? ``We have a lot to learn about writing about the Internet
_ I do, in particular. But we also have a lot to learn about a lot
of the things we write about, including banking and international
trade. You make some mistakes and you keep working hard and you
keep doing your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional media outlets have been trying to write about a new
medium in which ``facts'' aren't always real, and the mistakes have
been breathtakingly embarrassing. Last year, two actors convinced
the mainstream media that they were going to lose their virginity
online; the story later turned out to be a publicity ploy for a
porn site. Earlier this year, the Globe wrote a story about the
phenomenon of cyber-squatting, and the headline happened to be the
address of a porn site.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Times ran a Page One story about a trend called
page-jacking, in which innocent visitors to innocuous Web sites are
diverted to porn sites. According to Jane Duvall, the proprietor of
Jane's Guide to Net Sex, Ron Harris is a notorious page-jacker.
``He's directing kids to porn sites, which is highly irresponsible
and gives the whole industry a bad name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has been busy since the story since broke. He's taken
five of the models off the site. He's changed the user agreement,
replacing it with the agreement posted on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The site now features an advertisement for a company providing
mail-order prescriptions for Viagra. On Thursday, the New England
Journal of Medicine published an article about such companies
warning that they ``may increase the inappropriate use of
medications and the risk of adverse events.''

UNFAIR IS FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Life is unfair, thank God. If nobody was richer, tougher or
smarter than me, I'd be sitting in a cave somewhere. All of us
benefit from unfair advantages held by others. And while it's
sometimes tempting to level the playing field a bit _ say, by
lowering Steve Jobs's IQ by 20 points or breaking up Microsoft
Corp. _ in the long run we'd lose far more than we'd gain.
</P>
<P>
   But to those in the public sector, any hint of social or
economic inequity is a call to arms. Which is why city governments
from Cambridge to Portland, Ore., have inserted themselves into a
major battle over the future of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The city officials are going to bat for an unlikely underdog _
America Online Inc., the world's largest Internet company _ in its
battle with AT&AMP;T Corp., the world's largest cable TV company. At
issue is AT&AMP;T's rollout of high-speed Internet access over their
cable systems. People who subscribe to AT&AMP;T Internet service are
supposed to subscribe to one of the company's favored Internet
providers. If you also want AOL, you have to pay separately for an
AOL account.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, along with a number of local phone companies and Internet
providers, are demanding that AT&AMP;T provide ``open access'' to its
cable system. If you want AT&AMP;T high-speed Internet access, but want
to keep AOL as your Internet provider, you should be able to get
AOL service without having to buy AT&AMP;T's chosen Internet service.
The open access forces say this approach will provide a lot more
choices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really? Let's look at the record.
</P>
<P>
   Why did AT&AMP;T chief executive C. Michael Armstrong suddenly
decide to get into the cable business? It happened because AT&AMP;T had
been trying for years to negotiate open access agreements of its
own. With delicious hypocrisy, the same company that doesn't want
to share its cable with AOL demanded that local phone companies
share their wires with AT&AMP;T. The federal government agreed. But
local phone firms have been dragging their feet for years.
</P>
<P>
   So AT&AMP;T decided to do an end-run. It spent $61 billion to
acquire Tele-Communications Inc., a major cable company. Now AT&AMP;T
is in the midst of closing a $58 billion deal with MediaOne Group.
Next, AT&AMP;T is spending additional billions to upgrade its new cable
properties so they can carry telephone traffic and high-speed
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   All this because a competitor wouldn't give AT&AMP;T a cheap, easy
way to use existing telephone technology. The hardball tactics of
the local telco firms increased consumer choice by spurring the
development of an alternative technology.
</P>
<P>
   It's an alternative that terrifies AOL. The company's 20 million
subscribers use dial-up telephone connections that can't begin to
compete with the speed of cable modems. That's why the company is
so eager to shove its way on to AT&AMP;T's wires.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, AOL and the rest of the open access folks
are pouring money into their own alternative technology. It's
digital subscriber line, or DSL, a service that allows high-speed
data transmission over standard phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   DSL was invented about 10 years ago. Where's it been all this
time? Sitting idle on a shelf, because telephone companies had no
economic incentive to roll it out. Until recently, the only users
of high-speed Internet access were big companies that cheerfully
paid thousands of dollars a month for special phone lines. Why
introduce a service that could deliver the same performance for
one-hundredth the price?
</P>
<P>
   Now AOL is doing a joint DSL venture with Bell Atlantic. Local
phone companies are rushing to wire up customers. Hardly anybody
had home DSL service a year ago. Today, there are a couple of
hundred thousand DSL users, compared with over a million cable
modem users. DSL means more choices for consumers, and we owe it to
a bunch of cable guys who won't play fair.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's arguments against AT&AMP;T aren't without merit. Forcing open
access would indeed provide additional choices for cable modem
users. But it would undercut AT&AMP;T's incentive to invest in the
technology and weaken AOL's incentive to invest in rival systems
like DSL. That's why I hope AT&AMP;T gets its way. City governments
want Internet service to be fair. I want it to be excellent.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-U.S. (Tehran) _ On the 20th anniversary of the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy, amid the strident speechmaking and the punching
of the air, there was something out of temper, something
registering unmistakably that for Iran, too, the years have marched
on, that what made pulses race in 1979 has a faded quality about it
now. There can hardly have been more than 5,000 people at the
gathering, 7,000 by the most optimistic estimate, in a city,
Tehran, that has a population of 12 million. Many in the crowd,
especially the young, seemed to have trouble working up the
requisite degree of animosity for the United States. By John F.
Burns.

by allegations of financial irregularities, she is defended by
African-American members who charge racism in the investigation;
Sen. Jesse Helms, meanwhile, relents on scheduling after White
House supplies requested documents. By Lizette Alvarez.

   MASS-EMBRYOS (Boston) _ As lawmakers around the country have
dragged their feet on addressing who owns what with frozen embryos,
case law is being made around the country in a patchwork way,
raising _ but not yet figuring out _ issues about such things as
whether embryos are property or children or whether fathers or
mothers have constitutional rights not to have children. By Carey
Goldberg.

   TEAMSTERS-STRIKE (Moonachie, N.J.) In what is proving to be
James P. Hoffa's biggest test yet, the Teamsters Union is locked in
a 12-day-old strike against Overnite Transportation, a giant
trucking company that has fought against unionization for decades.
In standing firm, Hoffa hopes to prove his mettle and show all of
labor that it is possible to win against a fervently anti-union

<P>
   SCI-PERFECT-PITCH (Undated) _ Native speakers of languages like
Chinese, which use tones to convey meaning, may have a form of
perfect pitch, a new study suggests _ something that is very rare
in Western countries. Some scientists think this may mean that many
or most babies are born with perfect pitch but retain it only by
learning a tonal language or undergoing early musical training;
others believe that most people, even in Western countries, do
retain an almost perfect pitch memory but simply lack a way of
expressing it, as speakers of tonal languages are able to do. By
James Glanz. (1200 words)

   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (`'f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-JUNGLE (Monte Dourado, Brazil) _ Two decades ago, the
American billionaire Daniel K. Ludwig bought a piece of the Amazon
jungle larger than Connecticut and spent a large chunk of his
fortune building an industrial, mining and agricultural complex.
Today, a scaled-down version of the project is for sale for $1.
There is, of course, a catch. The complex comes with $320 million
in debt, its attractive bauxite and clay mines have already been
sold off, and the project will require several hundred million
dollars in new investment. Ludwig's project shows that like the
China market, the notion that there are unlimited riches to be had
from the Amazon is a myth that never seems to die. Since the first
Spanish colonizers in the New World fell under the spell of the
legend of El Dorado, adventurers have arrived with the conviction
they can build empires, only to run afoul of one of the most
hostile natural and business environments on the planet. By Larry
Rohter.

WEB HELPS YOU SORT OUT CALLING PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN GOGGIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a barrage of advertisements and promotions facing
consumers, how on Earth are you supposed to know which cellular
phone calling plan is right for you?
</P>
<P>
   Turn to the Web, of course. These sites let you compare prices
and options of calling plans. Each allows you to compare all the
plans they offer, or to narrow the list down to only those that
will meet your needs.
</P>
<P>
   None are run by cell phone or calling plan companies; they make
their money through commissions on every sale or partnerships.
Since they seem to have a partnership with virtually every cell
phone company in existence, their claim that these arrangements do
not affect their impartiality rings true.
</P>
<P>
   Decide (www.decide.com) lets you compare 117 plans in the Boston
area. You can buy 39 of the plans on line; the site gives you
telephone numbers to contact the other companies.
</P>
<P>
   This site lets you compare calling plans, phones, and phone
accessories like batteries and chargers.
</P>
<P>
   In the calling plans section, there are three ways to make
comparisons: The ``instant comparison'' feature lets you choose a
usage pattern most like your own: Safety User (use your phone
mostly for emergencies) or Talking Head (a heavy user), for
example. For a ``custom comparison,'' you answer a few simple
questions, then get a comparison. Or you can check all available
calling plans.
</P>
<P>
   When you look at the details of a plan, examples of phones you
can use appears to give you an idea of whether a phone will cost
you $9 or $99. And on-line promotions are offered for some plans.
</P>
<P>
   Cellmania (www.cellmania.com) provides comparisons of 63 plans
for the Boston area. However, since the comparison includes only
those plans that you can buy on line, Boston customers aren't
offered carriers such as Cellular One, Bell Atlantic, and
Omnipoint.
</P>
<P>
   There is an easy-to-understand glossary, and a feature called
``Quick Picks'' that lets you type in your zip code and shows you a
few recommendations in your area for different types of users, such
as emergency only, students, or folks who use their phones a lot.
</P>
<P>
   You can also comparison shop for phones and accessories here.
</P>
<P>
   Point (www.point.com) allows you to make an on-line purchase of
30 of the 114 plans that are available for comparison in the Boston
area.
</P>
<P>
   As the details of each individual plan appear, you can obtain
information on which phones you can use with the plan, as well as a
list of local dealers or stores that offer each plan.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers an easy-to-access glossary, as well as a helpful
list of tips and tricks for choosing a plan. Promotions such as
rebates and free minutes are offered on some of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   And like the other two sites, you can shop for phones and
accessories.

NEW WAYS TO SHOP THE WEB

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those already enmeshed in the World Wide Web of on-line
shopping, the three main forms of e-commerce are as familiar as
Pokemons and Furbys.
</P>
<P>
   First is traditional retailing, practiced by such huge e-tailers
as Amazon.com and eToys.com: You want an item, like a book or a
toy, you go to a Web site, buy it, and they ship it to you.
</P>
<P>
   Then came on-line auctions: You want an item, you go to an
auction site, bid on it, and cross your fingers that you'll have
the highest bid by the time the auction ends. (Or keep checking
back and outbid the highest bidder in the 5 seconds before the
auction ends.)
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the hot way to buy on line is name-your-own-price. Post
on the site what you'd be willing to pay for an airline ticket or
hotel room, and see if an airline or hotel is willing to sell to
you for that price. But as fast as these styles of buying
developed, variations on the themes are also coming fast and
furiously.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble is expected to propel e-commerce revenues from $32
billion this year to $500 billion by 2002, according to
International Data Corp., a Framingham market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are trying to reach a large number of people
and hope to be the killer electronic commerce application,'' says
Michael Goulde, executive vice president at the Patria Seybold
Group in Boston, a technology consulting firm. ``In the end, the
winner will be the site with the highest customer value _
familiarity, ease of use, meets specific needs, easy to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of the new models of e-commerce, coming soon to
a PC near you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Un-traditional retailing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's strength in numbers: Get lower prices by joining with
other shoppers who want the same item and aggregating your
collective purchasing power. Mercata.com sells hard goods such as
home audio and video equipment, tools, and health and fitness
equipment priced below standard retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   The final price fluctuates based on the number of buyers who
agree to buy the same item within a specific time, usually several
days. Thus, a DVD player that retails for $400 could drop to $330
if say, 500 people agree to order it at the same time. (On the
site, the company does not disclose how many other people are
trying to buy the same item as you.)
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mercata offered a 32-inch Philips television with
picture-in-picture for $799, but by the end of the week, the TV
sold for $734.48, with free shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet retailers are peddling unique services, such as a
day at a health spa.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com, best known for its wine-ordering service, has branched
out to offering a day of golf at courses around the country. So a
pair of duffers can buy a round of golf at the Dunes Golf and Beach
Club in Myrtle Beach, S.C., with a golf cart and practice balls for
$399.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers who hate filling out order forms and credit card
information at every site, there are shopping destinations and
virtual bazaars with access to a collection of on-line retailers
who agree to a single payment for everything purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lycos started LYCOShop (www.lycos.com) with more than
1,000 on-line stores, including Barnes &AMP; Noble, The Sharper Image,
Crate &AMP; Barrel, and Neiman Marcus, integrated with on-line auctions
and classifieds. After a one-time registration, buyers can pick the
products they want from the various retailers, put them into a
single shopping cart, and pay for it all with one credit card
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Snaz.com offers multiple retail sites via a universal
shopping cart for Land's End, eToys, CDNow, Pets.com, Godiva,
Buy.com and MarthaStewart.com, also using a single password.
</P>
<P>
   Still ahead are easier ways to pay for purchases using
``electronic wallets,'' software that stores and manages personal
data and makes it unnecessary to retype credit-card numbers and
addresses every time you buy something. Whenever you come to an
order form that has to be filled out, you activate your wallet and
it fills out the form for you.
</P>
<P>
   One firm, Brodia Inc. of San Francisco (www.brodia.com), plans
to offer e-wallets that can handle multiple credit card numbers and
addresses and let consumers store their receipts. The company _ one
of eight in the field _ also plans to offer banking, grocery
ordering, and multiple forms of payment.
</P>
<P>
   To speed up your computer's understanding of each purchase, new
software is being tested that can ``tag'' products as content and
index them. Current systems extensively describe items, but do not
identify products by their content. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reverse auctions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are personal referral service sites that bring together
buyers looking for an item or service and sellers who can fulfill
the request.
</P>
<P>
   IWant.com allows individuals to anonymously state what they want
_ vacations, stereo equipment, theater tickets, computers, etc. _
including a description and price, and let sellers who have those
items find them.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers and sellers communicate by posting e-mail messages. If
they make a deal, they exchange phone numbers and mailing addresses
and arrange for payment.
</P>
<P>
   To build traffic, the service is free for now. But starting
early next year, sellers will be charged anywhere from 25 cents to
$10 for each would-be buyer they contact, according to Shabbir
Dahod, the company's chief executive. (In contrast, eBay charges
sellers $2 to $50 per listing, depending on the item.)
</P>
<P>
   Even information has a price in the on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites field questions and answers in an auction
format. Exp.com (formerly advoco.com), links users seeking advice
or services in such categories as finance, education, parenting,
careers, and pets with its database of 2,000 authorities. If you
want some information or a service, you consult a specific adviser,
or throw your question out to all advisers.
</P>
<P>
   You'll receive an initial response that describes the
information or service available. If you accept it, negotiate a
price with the adviser, get the info or service, and then receive
an on-line invoice. Exp.com handles the billing and takes a
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a more open approach is InfoRocket.com, which debuts this
month, by letting anyone post a question and the amount they are
willing to pay for the answer. Responders reply by stating their
qualifications to answer the question. If both parties agree, the
answer is sent to the questioner, who pays only if he or she is
satisifed with the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Questions might range from advice on buying a handheld device to
step-by-step guidance on tuning a guitar. This travel question was
listed on the site: ``I am running with the bulls of Pamplona next
month. Can someone please recommend three inexpensive hotels within
walking distance of the site? Please tell me . . . how dangerous
the experience is. I would also like two recommendations of fiction
authors who have written about the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A potentially huge new arena is business-to-business auctions,
where buyers and sellers can establish long-term relationships and
where items carry big price tags.
</P>
<P>
   AdAuction.com brings buyers and sellers of television, print,
radio, outdoor, and Internet advertising space together and hosts
real-time auctions on the Web. The appeal is to bargain-hunting
media buyers who can bid for what they want without having to spend
time negotiating with sales representatives from each media outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, FastParts.com operates a trading market for
overstocked electronic parts, matching buyers to sellers in an
on-line auction. Considered a neutral marketplace, buyers get
market-driven prices that are lower than those of traditional
brokers, while sellers get higher prices than they normally could,
with FastParts earning up to 8 percent in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Two sites, eWork Exchange (eWork.com) and FreeAgent.com, are
aimed at self-employed professionals who compete with one another
for short-term jobs by posting information on their skills, fees,
and promised delivery dates in an on-line auction. Employers can
even rate their performance. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Name your banana &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on established time-sensitive services such as airline
tickets and hotel space, where prices can fluctuate based on demand
and availability, is catching on. Now the site that started it all,
priceline.com, is adding price-bidding on home mortages, cars, and
even groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's expedia.com, a travel service that the software
giant plans to spin out as a separate company, has started offering
a ``hotel price matcher'' for users who want to name their own
price for rooms. But Priceline has filed suit, charging Microsoft
with patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still other models, particularly in
business-to-business, where intermediaries will bring fragmented
buyers and sellers together _ people who don't take sides, but
provide a needed service,'' says Thomas R. Eisenmann, an assistant
professor at Harvard Business School who instructs students about
Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the horizon are some very local business models that
combine the Internet and cash. Imagine the neighborhood kids
organizing themselves to set up regular, weekend auctions on line
for such basic jobs as raking leaves, mowing lawns, shoveling snow,
and babysitting _ with their own families outbidding each other.

DIARY OF AN ON-LINE SHOPPING TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, instead of starting my Christmas shopping after work
on Christmas Eve, caught in a crush of other harried shoppers
fighting the clock and each other to snatch up any old junk just to
have something to hand over in 12 hours, I booted up my computer in
late October to see what the world of on-line shopping had to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't come naturally to me, but I have to say, I kind of
like this on-line shopping thing. No crowds, no lugging bags home,
no snippy sales assistants, no shoes. Just me, my mouse, and all
those on-line sites with the pretty colors and the happy copy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not completely perfect, though. There is something
profoundly frustrating about not being able to touch and turn over
the stuff you're going to buy, to hold it up against you, or read
the labels. And sometimes, stylists and photographers can make
scarves and silverware look gorgeous on your computer screen, when
in real life they might be cheap and nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of these dangers, I forged ahead, into the rosy world of
the Web site, Christmas list in hand. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sweater for, uh, maybe sister Catherine
</P>
<P>
   For my sister Catherine, I decide to hop on line and get her the
beautiful merino wool V-neck I tried on in the J. Crew store a few
weeks back. This is because I love my sister very much, but also
because I am thinking that if it arrives in the mail and I really
like it, I will keep it for myself.
</P>
<P>
   So I visit the J. Crew Web site (www.jcrew.com), thinking it'll
take five minutes, tops, to hunt down my, um, her, quarry.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, number one, the J. Crew home page is nice, but the
pictures _ which are all of headless models lined up side by side _
aren't very clear. All the clothes look like bits of them are under
water.
</P>
<P>
   But I quickly forget this little imperfection when I see the
``everyone wins on line'' icon, and click to find that if I order
on line, and it's my first time, they will deliver my goodies free,
provided I order before Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is organized according to clothing genre. I click
on sweaters, and scroll across 35 of them, only to find that my
merino V-neck must be in another category. I try the Weekday Knit
Collection, and there it is. I think. It sure doesn't look like the
one I saw in the store, but it must be it, right?
</P>
<P>
   I forge ahead to find it is, indeed, my sweater, but that it is
not available in the color I want. It does come in haze (Is that
really a color?), black, blueberry heather (How do they come up
with those names, I wonder?), but no burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   At a loss, and willing to cheat, I head into the living room and
grab one of my J. Crew catalogs, two of which arrive at my house
every day. The catalog says I've been missed over there at J. Crew.
That's nice.
</P>
<P>
   I find my sweater and enter it into the ``order by item number''
box, and there it is, in a whole bunch of completely different
colors. There, I discover that my burgundy won't be available until
Dec. 10. Too late. So back I go, and decide on the blueberry
heather, whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   But the sweater costs only $48, and I need an order of $50 to
qualify for free delivery. What to do? Socks, I think. And what
better for winter than a pair of wool heathered tipped socks in
gray? Especially because, at $8, they're the cheapest way to make
it to the magic $50.
</P>
<P>
   But when I click on the wool heathered tipped icon, J. Crew
gives me the marled ragg sock. I don't want the marled ragg sock. I
want the wool heather tipped.
</P>
<P>
   When I click on marled ragg sock, hoping the two have simply
been swapped, I get the semi-opaque tight. I don't want the
semi-opaque tight, do I? Click on the multi-thin stripe, and I get
the mini-argyle anklet, both of which are incredibly ugly, even if
they are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   I can't buy the wool heathered tipped to save my life, and I'm
darned if I'm going to go back to the catalog for those. But I do,
only to find they're not in the catalog anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The J. Crew site seems to be trying to defy me. It seems to be
taking pleasure in thwarting my buying experience, and this is
profoundly annoying to me.
</P>
<P>
   So, I decide to buy my husband a T-shirt instead. This involves
breaking a firm rule I have recently established, which is never to
buy my husband another item of clothing as long as he lives,
because he doesn't defer to my tastes with enough unquestioning
gratitude. But I need free delivery, so I spend the $14 to save
$8.95.
</P>
<P>
   Having saved the $8.95, I tell myself I can now afford 3-day
express delivery, which is only $5 extra. My total is now $67. And
it all arrives in three days, as promised.
</P>
<P>
   If I had bought just the sweater and chosen normal, 2 to 7-day
delivery, I would have spent only $56.95, but we won't talk about
that. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The mini food chopper for me
</P>
<P>
   What? I don't deserve a little something too? Besides, a part
from my chopper melted in the dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   To find the best deal on some items on my list, I used
Yahoo!Shopping (shopping.yahoo.com). Throw in the name of your
product, and Yahoo!Shopping will come back, like a good doggie,
with all the places you can get them, and all the prices.
</P>
<P>
   Excite also has a shopping site (previewshopping.excite.com),
but for the items I wanted, it wasn't as good as Yahoo!. Sometimes
it fetched a list of all kinds of unrelated products that I had to
wade through.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted a mini food processor. Yahoo! gave me six options, with
prices ranging from just $26.67 from Adatom's Internet Superstore
(www.adatom.com) to $39.79 from Hector's Hardware Store
(st13.yahoo.com/hectors876). In real life, these little mixing
marvels run about $30, so bye-bye, Hector.
</P>
<P>
   And on closer examination, Adatom's wasn't such a deal either:
Delivery time on the tiny appliance would run as long as 22 days,
according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a busy woman. Besides, Adatom's says the recommended retail
price on the mini processor is $48, and that price is so high, it
gives me an icky feeling.
</P>
<P>
   So, I go with the nice folks at electronics.net. Their price is
reasonable at $29.97, so I take the plunge. Since I want three-day
delivery, however, the price is bumped to $39.37, but it beats
fighting the crowds in Lechter's.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, my little package of joy arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more than I can say for the CD I ordered on the same
night, also through Yahoo!Shopping. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The CD for friend John
</P>
<P>
   This was going to be the easiest of my gifts: My friend John is
a bit of a world music buff, so I decided to get him a CD called
Rai Rebels, a bunch of very beautiful songs by Algerian artists.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! lined up all the sites for me again.
</P>
<P>
   All Direct (www.alldirect.com) can give it to me for $11.24,
with a delivery time of two to three days.
</P>
<P>
   CD Connection (www.cdconnection.com) will charge me $14.89, and
shipping happens in three to 10 days. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   W3CD (www.w3cd.com) will charge me just $11.95, the CD will ship
in two to three days, and the site has a really cool logo.
</P>
<P>
   I went with W3CD, which boasted ``the lowest domestic and
international shipping on the Internet!'' It promised me ``the same
deal the guys in the warehouse get for their mothers!''
</P>
<P>
   It did seem like a pretty good deal, especially for buying just
one CD _ $1.75 per order, and 95 cents per item, which brought my
charges to a total of $14.65. As an added bonus, these folks
promise prominently that they will not give anybody my personal
information unless they ask me first. How nice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   And I like the idea of buying from someone other than the big
guys, so I pull the trigger, and wait for the CD to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   I wait a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   The site says shipping time is normally three to seven days. But
11 days after I place my order _ and they tell me the CD is
immediately available, mind you _ still no Rebels. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wine for sister Thelma &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First of all, can somebody tell me why all the wine sites are so
darned tacky looking?
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! threw a bunch of them at me. I went through 12 of them,
one by one, and they're just not that pretty: some of them look
like they were set up five years ago, with their boring graphics
and grainy photographs. Sure, I'm shopping in my PJ's and furry
slippers, but that doesn't mean they should skimp on aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: www.spiritz.com. On my first visit, its home
page delivered a grainy picture of a woman flanked by two men, all
of them in ecstasy over some white wine or other, mouths agape.
``Good friends bring out good spirits,'' says the banner. At least
they didn't spell that with a z, but yeesh, not the kind of image
that has me leaping for the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   (A couple of days later, the home page has been completely
changed. It still looked a little dinky, but the happy folks of
yore had been replaced by some cute little no-nonsense icons that
made the site easier to navigate.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite my artistic objections, I wade into some of the
sites, looking for nice Aussie reds for when my sister Thelma comes
for Christmas this year.
</P>
<P>
   After several fruitless searches on other sites, I settle on K&AMP;L
Wine Merchants (www.klwines.com), which bills itself as ``The
Internet's Best.'' I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, they're not bad at all. Huge selection, nice full
descriptions of wines. In the end, I settle on a Riesling from New
Zealand, an Australian Merlot, and a red from California, and
proceed to the checkout, popping in my address and selecting
three-day delivery _ where I discover that my entire shopping
experience at K&AMP;L has been in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, they tell me, they don't ship to Massachusetts. I would
have been grateful for this information a little earlier in my
shopping experience, thank you. Perhaps a warning that this might
have been a possibility could have been more prominently displayed
on the home page?
</P>
<P>
   It'll be far less trouble to head over to the wine store a block
away, which I resolve to do. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chew toy for Max &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to get something really special for Max, my friend
Mark's very nervous North-American Shepherd. Mark told me Max would
simply kill for a Kong chew-toy, which bounces every which way,
driving dogs crazy with delight.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! gave me a bunch of pet stores to choose from, but
Petcrazy.com was the prettiest, immediately presenting me with the
day's specials, then a list of mini-cyberstores organized by
species.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Kong was easy to find, and the medium size
clocked in at just $6.39, compared to a recommended retail price of
$8.48. Cha-ching. Add another $3.50 for shipping, and a few days,
and Max is a happy boy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Naboo Starfighter for Peter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-olds are capricious creatures. For the whole of
November, they will plead for Santa to bring whatever toy is de
rigeur. This is often the same toy of which the stores have been
cleaned out in October, and for which Santa's little helpers must
scour the city.
</P>
<P>
   But come Christmas morning, the little beggars are sometimes
underwhelmed by said toy: In kid time, a month is an eternity.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was with some trepidation that I entered eToys.com,
looking for a present for my friends' son Peter. Luckily, however,
eToys will show you what everybody else is buying for kids right
now. If Peter is crestfallen on Christmas morning, I will at least
have the satisfaction of knowing that hundreds of other misguided
adults are feeling as stupid as I am.
</P>
<P>
   A list of top sellers for six-year-olds reveals that Star Wars
toys are still hugely popular, even though the film was panned by
the critics.
</P>
<P>
   The Naboo Starfighter by Lego ($19.95) allows kids to recreate
the ``sleek'' vehicle Anakin Skywalker uses in his ``final struggle
against the evil Trade Federation.'' This should keep the kid
happy. Just to be safe, I also throw in Episode 1: Lightsaber Duel,
also by Lego ($5.99), which included Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul
figures.
</P>
<P>
   To the checkout I go. With $9.90 for delivery, my grand total is
$35.88. It all arrives in about a week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How happy this whole experience has been, errant CD
notwithstanding. And so good for my self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Site after site tells me how glad it is to see me, how it hopes
I'll enjoy my shopping experience, how overjoyed it would be to
keep in touch until the goods hurtle to my home, how it hopes to
see me again real soon.
</P>
<P>
   They really genuinely seem to like me. Yes! Feel free to send
all manner of junk e-mail to my address. Thanks ever so for asking.
Of course I'll come again!

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost the end of the millennium, and just as the
science-fiction writers predicted, robots are everywhere. But most
don't look anything like those dreamed up by Isaac Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they're quite invisible. These robots, more commonly
called bots, are computer programs that scour the Internet to do
our bidding. Instead of nuts and bolts, they're made of bits and
bytes. But that doesn't make them any less useful. As a matter of
fact, they can even help you do the shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopbots'' or ``shopping agents'' are programs that will hunt
down bargains on the Internet. Sites with names like mySimon.com,
BizRate.com, DealPilot.com and BottomDollar.com enable anyone to
shop dozens or hundreds of on-line retailers in seconds. It's more
than a consumer's dream; it's an experiment in instant capitalism,
with fascinating implications for the way we buy and sell things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we search over 1,800 merchants,'' says Josh Goldman,
president and chief executive officer of mySimon.com Inc. in Santa
Clara, Calif., ``from small mom-and-pops who put up a storefront to
the biggest of the big.''
</P>
<P>
   At mySimon you can search for a variety of items, from software
to shoes. When a user enters a search, the bot instantly fires off
a query to the Web site of each retailer that would carry such an
item. Back comes a listing of suitable products, the on-line
retailers that sell them, and the prices charged.
</P>
<P>
   While mySimon gives pride of place on its site to companies that
pay for more prominent display, most of the sites listed have no
business relationship to the site. A team of Web surfers has simply
identified them as good retailers and added them to the bot's
database.
</P>
<P>
   Some of mySimon's rivals do more than look for the lowest
possible price. For instance, BizRate offers guidance about which
retailers are worthy of trust. ``Our plan has always been to take
the Web and use it for the benefit of consumers,'' says Farhad
Mohit, president, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Los
Angeles-based BizRate.
</P>
<P>
   Any Web retailer can request a listing on BizRate (so far, about
1,900 have), but none can buy premium placement. Indeed, all are
subject to the scrutiny of BizRate monitors, who try out every
store and rate the quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers also rate BizRate stores, and their reports are used to
generate site ratings that are prominently displayed next to the
name of each store.
</P>
<P>
   BizRate also has a share-the-wealth policy. Some retailers pay a
rebate to BizRate when a BizRate user makes a purchase. Instead of
keeping this money, whenever a registered BizRate user runs up more
than $15 in rebates, BizRate deducts $3 for itself and sends the
rest to the user.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Books.com, a retailer that competes with on-line giants
like Amazon.com, Barnes &AMP; Noble (www.bn.com or
www.barnesandnoble.com) and Borders.com, runs the most surprising
shopbot on the Web. Ask for a book, and Books.com comes back with a
price quote _ and a price-comparison button. Press it, and a bot
checks the price of the same book at rival booksellers. If one of
them has the book at a lower price, the bot automatically cuts the
Books.com price even lower.
</P>
<P>
   To Jeff Kephart, who studies bots at IBM's Watson Research
Center, this heralds a future in which bots could make some of our
economic decisions for us, with no direct human intervention.
``They start behaving as economic agents themselves,'' Kephart
says. If designers aren't careful, Kephart notes, bots could
generate automated price wars, with computers trying to
out-discount each other in an uncontrolled race to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But this assumes that bots won't get any smarter, and they're
actually getting smarter all the time. What if bots could search,
not just for the lowest price, but the best value, based on the
tastes and desires of each consumer?
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge-based Frictionless Commerce (www.frictionless.com) has
created a next-generation shopping agent that aims to do this.
Waltham-based Lycos, one of the world's biggest Web portals, has
signed on to install the Frictionless bot on its new LycoShop
(shop.lycos.com) shopping site. Instead of just looking for
discounts, the Frictionless agent gently leads the user through a
series of questions to determine just what he or she is looking
for. For instance, if a user asks to see CD players, the bot will
ask whether the user is a hard-core music lover in search of top
performance, or a casual listener with a limited budget. The
questions keep coming: What brand does the user prefer? How many
discs should the changer hold? Should the player have a remote
control? In this way, the bot can satisfy the consumer who wants
more than just a low price.
</P>
<P>
   If such bots got into a bidding war, they could compete on
service as well as price. A future automated shopping system could
let a customer agree to a higher price in exchange for some other
consideration _ an earlier delivery date, say, or a longer
warranty. Bots from several retailers would race across the Web,
swapping offer and counter-offer, each vying to come up with just
the right package to win the deal and leave rival bots out in the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a Hollywood-style vision of robot warfare, but
it'd be a lot more profitable.

VIRTUAL CREDIT CAPERS ARE FEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nervous about shooting your credit card number and personal data
out into cyberspace? Join the club: Despite the 17 million American
households estimated to have flocked to on-line shopping, millions
of people remain ill at ease with e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, this is not entirely irrational. There's a big
difference between handing your credit card to a waiter you've
never met _ or reading the digits to an airline telephone agent _
and sending it into a network where, if mishandled, your card
number could go anywhere in the world in seconds. Or your name,
address, and shopping habits could get zapped to merciless spammers
and catalog houses eager to clog your mailbox and e-mail with
unwanted offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the vulnerabilities are today in the traditional
system of using a credit card,'' says Matthew Kovar, a senior
analyst with The Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm that
specializes in e-commerce, telecommunications, and energy
businesses. ``We don't really know what the vulnerabilities are in
the Internet society. It's a mighty scary place out there, and
nothing is 100 percent safe in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen other ways, however, many specialists think fears about the
security and risks of e-commerce are vastly overstated _ especially
if you compare them to the risk of getting in your car and driving
to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, virtually every large, reputable business
selling goods and services over the Web uses elaborate encryption
technology that, during a transaction, keeps your card number far
better protected than it is during the three minutes a restaurant
waiter walks it to a back room to charge your meal tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet itself is very safe,'' says Marc Rotenberg,
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington. Encryption technology, Rotenberg says, ``basically
scrambles your number and operates much like a kryptonite
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet security, in fact, is a booming business. The Yankee
Group projects that by 2003 ``intrusion detection and security
assessment'' software and services will generate $740 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if you use a credit card for your Web purchases _
which is considered the First Commandment of on-line shopping _ the
federal Truth in Lending Act limits your liability for unauthorized
purchases on your card to $50 per theft. Some companies, including
American Express, NextCard, and Yahoo!, offer Internet-based cards
that purportedly release you from any liability for unauthorized
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say the odds are one in 1 million that, over the course of
a year of Web shopping, you will be the person whose card number is
somehow stolen and misused. Exact numbers on Web-based card number
thievery cannot reliably be estimated, but specialists say so far
it seems extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Say the hassle of sorting out the mess and canceling the card
costs you another $50. That means your financial risk is on the
order of one-hundredth of a cent per year for the convenience of
being able to shop to your heart's content without ever leaving
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Given the risk/reward ratio of on-line shopping, and the
elaborate security procedures widely used, analyst David Truog of
Forrester Research of Cambridge, an Internet research company, says
fears about card numbers being purloined are out of proportion to
the actual danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really should be worrying about,'' Truog says, ``is
the security of the data about yourself you reveal to the
merchant.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time you buy something over the Internet, you tell a
business some very valuable information: Who you are, where you
live, what you like to buy, and perhaps (based on what you buy) how
much money you make. This is the kind of data companies can make a
lot money selling and trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers are going to worry,'' says Truog, ``I think
that's what they should worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission blasted the on-line
shopping industry, saying it had ``fallen far short of what is
needed to protect consumers'' from having the personal information
they furnish to sellers misused.
</P>
<P>
   As the FTC was preparing its report, however, more than 100
companies came together to form the Online Privacy Alliance in
hopes of staving off federal regulation. Members include America
Online, IBM, Microsoft, and the Direct Marketing Association. The
group hired a former FTC commissioner, Christine Varney, to help
push companies to adopt better privacy policies and to do a better
job spinning the e-commerce risk debate.
</P>
<P>
   However, a May survey by Georgetown University researchers found
that nearly 93 percent of the most frequently visited Web sites are
collecting ``personally identifying information'' from visitors
that many people would not want to share.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are indications that Web shoppers are eyes-wide-open
sophisticates willing to trade some privacy for convenience and
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy and American Business, a Washington research firm, found
that 86 percent of 460 adult Internet users surveyed said they are
willing to give personal data to Web-based sellers, as long as they
are told how the data will be used and given some benefit (like
discounts or special offers) in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out as to whether self-regulation will
work,'' FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky told The New York Times
earlier this autumn, ``but there is no doubt that the industry has
made a lot of progress on the Internet privacy issue in the last
year or so. If the industry keeps making as much progress as it has
recently, I don't see how you can really argue that we need
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   One key legislative step has been taken already. The Children's
On-Line Privacy Act, passed by Congress in October 1998, requires
Web sites to get parental permission before collecting any personal
information from children under 13.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Enonymous Corp., a San Diego-based company, unveiled
a free service that rates more than 10,000 Web sites on how good a
job they do keeping your personal information secret.
</P>
<P>
   By visiting www.enonymous.com, you can download onto your
computer's hard drive a program that will display, in a little
window, a site's privacy rating. Sites are ranked with from one to
four stars. A recent check included AOL.com, Buy.com, and QVC.com
among the four-star rankings while Ticketmaster.com and Gap.com had
just one star.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use an Enonymous ``universal alias'' when you
register. This device will cause any e-mail spam generated by a
shopping site to go to an electronic trash can at Enonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Another new option to improve the security and convenience of
on-line shopping was unveiled this fall by Microsoft. Called
Passport, it allows users to store credit card and shipping
information in one purportedly secure place. It is then instantly
transmitted _ so you don't have to retype it _ when you shop at
more than 50 sites, including Barnes &AMP; Noble, which can be accessed
at www.barnesandnoble.com, as well as Costco.com, and
OfficeMax.com.
</P>
<P>
   How does Microsoft make money? To complete your transaction, you
are moved to a Microsoft page that carries ads. Microsoft also
charges companies to participate in Passport-aided transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is how you feel about Bill Gates having
this data. ``Using the service,'' says Margie Miller of Microsoft,
``you are saying, `Yes, I'm comfortable using the service with my
information stored on Microsoft servers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One reason to feel uncomfortable was briefly, if embarrassingly,
revealed in September when hackers found an easy way to break into
40 million Microsoft Hotmail electronic mail accounts, a glitch the
Redmond, Wash., giant quickly fixed.
</P>
<P>
   But given the enormous convenience and quick access to
comparison shopping information offered by the Internet, many
analysts see e-commerce as an unstoppable train that has left the
station in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research predicts that within 5 years, 49 million US
households will be on-line shoppers, spending $184 billion a year.
That would amount to 7 percent of all retail spending, all done by
simply clicking on credit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INTERNET SHOPPING TIPS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Trust your gut. Skip companies that seem shady, offer prices
that are too good to be true, or pressure you to make an instant
buying decision.
</P>
<P>
   --The same old scams in print advertising and telemarketing _
``work at home'' offers, snake-oil miracle drugs, lose weight fast,
foreign lottery schemes, pyramid scams _ are around in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   --Find and read the site's privacy policy, carefully, to
understand what data the seller is collecting on you, how it will
be used, and how you can block dissemination of your personal
information (to spammers or other companies that will besiege you
with e-mail). Boycott businesses with no privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   --Use a credit card for Web purchases. Federal law generally
limits your liability for bogus card charges to $50.
</P>
<P>
   --Check your credit card statements as soon as they come for any
unauthorized charges.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider getting one credit card to use only for Web
purchases. This can protect your other cards and credit rating if
your Web-shopping card is pirated.
</P>
<P>
   --Some Web sites' addresses begin with https, adding an ``s'' to
the more common http. That indicates that the site uses an
encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer to keep your
credit card number secret.
</P>
<P>
   --Another indication a site uses security software to protect
your credit card and personal data is a lock or padlock icon at the
bottom of the screen or the status bar.
</P>
<P>
   --When buying goods through an auction site such as eBay,
consider paying a little extra to have your payment put in escrow
until you get what you paid for and are satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   --Be skeptical of rating services for auction sites, which can
be loaded up with favorable comments by scammers' accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   --If the site does not post return, refund, and shipping
policies, call or e-mail the seller asking for them before you buy
anything.
</P>
<P>
   --Print out and save offers, purchase forms, and e-mail from
companies you shop with on line.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't answer questions on registration forms you think are
intrusive or unnecessary, or _ if you can do this and keep a clear
conscience _ lie and tell the company you are an unemployed high
school dropout. They won't bother trying to sell you anything
later.

<P>
   Unless your idea of a festive night out is hearing the Muzak
version of ``Rocking Around the Christmas Tree'' while perfume
hawkers spritz you senseless, we suggest you throw a log on the
fire and fire up the Internet because there is a plethora of
presents out there for everyone on your list.
</P>
<P>
   Herein, in no particular order, is a Top 10 list of some of the,
er, more interesting items we discovered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The Ginsu Safe and Easy Bagel Cutter. $17, www.netmarket.com.
Go to NetSanta, click on ``Gifts for the Home.''
</P>
<P>
   No Christmas would be complete without a Ginsu product, don't
you agree? The sharp people at Ginsu have realized that bagel
slicing is serious business. Do it wrong, and you land in the
emergency room, a perfect Sunday ruined by the slip of a knife.
Just place the bagel in the Ginsu gadget, pull the lever and voila!
Two bagel slices without a drop of blood spilled. It even comes
with a free cream cheese spreader. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. The English/Irish/Scottish/Welsh Breakfast. $40,
www.iol.ie/resource/imi/breakfast/. Ignore the ``This service is
temporarily unavailable'' message _ just scroll down and keep
clicking through.
</P>
<P>
   When a kilt just won't cut it again this year, give the Anglo or
Celt on your list a true taste of home: Rashers, sausages, and
black and white puddings are shipped in two days, ready to eat
Christmas morning. Add a fried egg and a pot of tea and you've got
the beginnings of a feast to launch Braveheart into battle. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Foreign Language Furbys. $39.99,
www.tigertoys.com/store/toystore.htm
</P>
<P>
   The hottest Christmas toy from last year is back, and speaking
in tongues _ namely, Italian, Japanese, German, and French. Oh, and
Furbish, of course. Furby has gone international and is the perfect
gift for the French immersion student or bon vivant on your list.
Furby babies and the Millenium Furby _ dressed in blue, signed and
numbered _ also promise to be hot Net sellers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. The ``There's No Place Like Home'' ruby slippers doormat.
$16, www.wbstore.com. Type ``doormat'' in the Search box or Keyword
box.
</P>
<P>
   It's never good form to show up at a Christmas open house empty
handed, and this ``Wizard of Oz'' welcome mat from the Warner
Brothers Studio Store, depicting Dorothy's lower legs, ruby
slippers, and a ribbon of yellow brick road, is a neat of way of
saying, ``Hey, thanks for the grub and the 'nog.'' You'll be fondly
recalled the whole year through when guests wipe their feet on your
gift over and over. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. The Body Benefits Powerful Water Jet Bath Spa. $54.99,
www.drugstore.com. Click on ``Holiday Store,'' and under ``Holiday
Favorites,'' click on ``Massage and Relaxation Gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, you slacker shoppers are going to wind up at the
drugstore on Christmas Eve anyway, so why not do your last-minute
shopping at a cyber-drugstore? Only here, you don't have a frazzled
clerk glaring at you from behind the crowded counter as you try to
remember if you got dad Brute or Old Spice last year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the standard perfumes and Totes umbrellas, this site
offers some unique treats like the Body Benefits Powerful Water Jet
Spa, which turns any regular bathtub into a frothy trough of fun.
Get it for your stressed-out colleague who can't afford a Jacuzzi
but is in dire need of a really long soak. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. The Mercedes Mountain Bike. $3,300, presentpicker.com. Click
on ``Outrageous'' gifts under ``Top 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Okay, so it's a little much. But it's literally the Mercedes of
bikes, complete with, according to the ad, ``a unique full
suspension system that gives unprecedented comfort and control over
varied terrain.'' (Read: Your wealthy butt will not take a
beating.) It also has disc brakes and twice the normal stopping
power. The Dom Perignon bottle holder is optional, as is the
bejeweled bike helmet. The extreme biker on your list will be so
happy to park it in the garage next to the Mercedes sedan, Mercedes
convertible, and Mercedes SUV. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. The Couples Hammock. $210, www.hameck.com. Click on
``Nicamaka Hammocks.''
</P>
<P>
   If that Sofa-With-A-Secret loses its intrigue, give that loving
couple on your list this cozy, double-knit, double-sized hammock
from Eck and Associates. The ad shows it hung from one end of the
living room to the next, a roaring fire creating the mood as the
entwined lovers snuggle in hammock harmony. Gilligan never had it
so good. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Powerhouse Reds. $189, www.send.com. Under the category
``Taste,'' click on ``Wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Have to buy for an onerous oenophile who's impossible to
impress? The folks at Send.com, a gourmet-lovers delight of a Web
site, promises that this gift of two ``collector quality''
California cabernets will bowl over even the most accomplished wine
lovers. The site offers champagne, scotch, and cognac boxed sets as
well, for a full round of holiday cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure the state where the gift recipient lives allows
the shipping of liquor; Massachusetts does _ sort of. The
out-of-state liquor company you order from can't ship directly to
you; under state law, it has to get a local retailer to deliver the
stuff. Send.com has a convenient list of states to which liquor
cannot be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   If those reds don't fit the bill, this Web site also offers
rounds of golf and golf lesson packages at some of the most
prestigious clubs in the country. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. Generation Girl Barbie. $16.99, eToys.com. Click on ``1999
holiday hot list.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Mattel meets MTV with these five new and hip Barbies, who
all have better lives than you ever will. There's Barbie, Nichelle,
Chelsie, Lara, and Ana, all plastic, perky, teenage dynamos who are
not ``just another pretty face,'' according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie is ``an aspiring actress and popular student at
International High School.'' Nichelle is ``a high school student by
day, professional teen model by night,'' Chelsie is ``an aspiring
singer and songwriter,'' Lara was ``raised in Paris, lives in New
York City and has a talent and flair for fashion,'' and Ana is ``an
athlete intent on winning, but knows it's how you play the game
that counts and is going for the gold in style.''
</P>
<P>
   We're still trying to grow up to be the Barbie stewardess. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10. Gift of Gags. $8, www.yippeee.com/stuff. Click on ``Package
Deals.''
</P>
<P>
   This box of buffoonery is for the 50-something who has
everything, including the funny bone of a 14-year-old. Made by a
company called, appropriately, Yippeee, the Gift of Gags includes a
whooppee cushion (an under-the-tree side splitter!) belch and
sneeze powders (Grandma's favorite, especially around the holiday
table!), snotty nose (ditto), hand buzzer (such a classic!), and
the dollar stretcher. We hear Santa orders eight of these every
year. Those reindeer are such comedians.

MILK'S GONE _ GOT AMMIANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is San Francisco, and we love the underdog,
the guerrilla campaign, and a good old slash of the tires of the
establishment machine. In three weeks of campaigning, with
thousands of strokes of write-in voters' pens, Tom Ammiano has
brought Mayor Willie Brown's limo to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears we have an interesting race, although it's
currently stalemated by the balky abacuses of City Hall workers
trying to count the votes. We don't know yet if Ammiano or Frank
Jordan will be in the Dec. 14 runoff against Brown, but we do know
Ammiano has established himself as a power in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   There are six weeks to go until election day for the runoff, and
some of that time may be filled by recounts, legal challenges and
spell checks of Ammiano's write-in votes. Ammiano and Jordan are
probably both happy with a runoff delayed, but imagine the
frustration of Brown and his campaign consultant Jack Davis at not
knowing whom to attack.
</P>
<P>
   About all Ammiano and Jordan have in common is a dislike of
Brown and documented proof that they've been naked with men.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cares. This is San Francisco, and Ammiano is the gay
president of the Board of Supervisors, and big deal. Jordan is a
former mayor whose most popular act in office was getting naked
with some DJs in the shower. These are not character issues in a
city of characters.
</P>
<P>
   It's such fun thinking of the binds so many people are in.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has endorsed surtaxes on the wealthy in the past and now
is focusing his efforts on providing a ``living wage'' for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't yet advocated eating the rich, but if he did it would
be with a nice bargain-priced Cabernet, one he might pick up on a
bus trip to Trader Joe's. This is the one public official who takes
a train to work.
</P>
<P>
   Big business interests hate Ammiano, and if he's in the runoff
they'd love to target him. But how do they do it without further
inflaming the fires of resentment about the rich that burn even
among the middle class in San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   What does San Francisco labor do? They have overwhelmingly
supported Brown for mayor, but many unions also have supported
Ammiano and work with him closely on the board. Some labor leaders
who back Brown won't breathe a negative word about Ammiano.
</P>
<P>
   Other labor leaders, like most of Brown's supporters, are highly
critical of Ammiano for getting into the race so late. One Brown
backer I know called Ammiano's act ``anti-democratic.'' Personally,
I think it was the pinnacle of democracy in an age of big-money
machine campaigns. It sure wasn't a bad move.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Ammiano robbed us of the chance to see him debate the
three official major candidates, Brown, Jordan and Clint Reilly. He
would have added a needed point of view from the left, where Willie
Brown used to be. He also could have been the one guy saying
something outrageous or funny, since Brown seemed to have been
advised to look statesmanlike and emulate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Ammiano saved money, kept his name unsullied until the pens
were passed out, and escaped being trashed or closely examined. If
you knew the wily likes of Reilly and Davis were lying in wait for
you, you wouldn't want to let them have months to shoot at you. You
would take cover behind a wall of indecision as long as possible,
like a good last-minuteman, then you'd let them have it.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest goals in politics, besides winning, are escaping
scrutiny and mud. Ammiano achieved both goals with flying rainbow
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, rich Willie Brown. There's no advantage to incumbency in
this town. There's little advantage to being a mayor who's the best
politician in America. This town chews up mayors and spits them
out. Sometimes those chewed-up mayors come back and run as
anti-establishment candidates themselves, the way even Frank Jordan
has.
</P>
<P>
   When I interviewed Ammiano two weeks ago, he talked like a man
with no hope of coming close to winning. He said he mainly wanted
to get voters into the booths to vote for his initiative to
restrict banks' ATM fees. Now, suddenly, he's the man.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the emperor with no clothes. Ammiano may be the
candidate with no coat who has coattails. His last-minute write-in
candidacy may have helped liberal District Attorney Terence
Hallinan in his race against Bill Fazio, and it may have changed
the vote on the Sunshine and Central Freeway measures.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ammiano has to listen to the cheers and read his own
notices. He told me before the election that, in his profession as
a stand-up comic, he followed Laurence Olivier's advice and never
believed either the negative or the positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to ignore the electricity he created on the
longest election night in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now he thinks he can win against Willie Brown, and
wouldn't a close, hard-fought, serious and funny race be fun? Of
course, Ammiano is still up against Frank Jordan and the Department
of Elections, both of which may be in for the long haul.

THE STORY OF JEFFREY WIGAND, WHISTLEBLOWING IN THE DARK (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of director Michael Mann's movies seem to have been fired
from the barrel of a gun. And it's intriguing that Mann decided to
tell the story of ``The Insider,'' the battle between CBS News and
Big Tobacco, since plumes of cigarette smoke often curl in the
backdrop of his films, a touch of heather gray against the
blue-black lighting schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' features the requisite meetings in hidden
places, solitary figures peering into the distance and characters
maintaining their preference to speak on ``land lines'' (wired
phones, instead of cell phones). With his big-shouldered stories of
masculine loyalty and the ties that hold families together, Mann
works in a genre that could be called hard-boiled melodrama, films
that owe something to both Norman Mailer and German filmmaker
Rainer Werner Fassbinder. His films are stocked with large-scale
emotional sprawl, laid out with a Germanic visual precision.
</P>
<P>
   Al Pacino stars as ``60 Minutes'' producer Lowell Bergman,
brainy tough guy and searcher for truth, who uses a cell phone as
unerringly as Pacino employed a sleek handgun in ``Heat,'' his
previous teaming with Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insider'' is a story of two heroes and two martyrs _ Bergman
and his source, research scientist Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe).
Wigand becomes the lever Bergman wants to use to pry open the door
protecting chemical manipulation of tobacco by the cigarette
companies to make their products more addictive. It's a subject
that they publicly plead ignorance of. (''The Insider'' reminds us
that until recently, the tobacco companies never lost a lawsuit
accusing them of intentionally endangering public health.) As
Bergman sinks his teeth deeper into the story _ it's one of several
he's juggling _ he feels more fiercely protective of Wigand, whom
he's had to coax into coming forth. But Bergman is protective of
everyone, even Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer), who's given to
hammy tantrums. The ``60 Minutes'' diva pitches a fit before
beginning an interview with a Hezbollah leader, wanting to show
he's not to be trifled with. (Bergman's lion-taming act is similar
to the way directors have to soothe movie stars.)
</P>
<P>
   When Wigand decides to come out with the truth and puts his
family members _ and his relationships with them _ at risk,
corporate faith in the story drops. ``60 Minutes'' backs away from
the story and, much to Bergman's surprise, so does Wallace.
``Insider'' toys with the Don Juan aspect of journalism, seducing a
subject into giving up a story and then abandoning him once the job
is done. But the abandonment here takes place prematurely. And both
subject and victim are hung out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe has ballooned up like the Pillsbury Doughboy. He's so
stocky that all that's left of his leading-man profile is the
suggestion of the dimple on his chin. Wigand is a surly loner with
an affinity for science. When his young daughter has an asthma
attack, he comforts her by explaining to her exactly what's going
on in her body, while giving her medicine. It's the way Wigand
connects with the world, through tools and technology. (Crowe's
waddle is a little too studied, though his fighting his body works
in his portrayal of a man who's physically uncomfortable.)
</P>
<P>
   Wigand takes a stubborn pride in his ability to understand
science, and this straw-haired paranoiac isn't out to be liked.
Neither is Bergman. Which makes the rocking their relationship
takes all the more touching, especially when Bergman is betrayed by
his network and his boss, legendary ``60 Minutes'' honcho Don
Hewitt (played as if he were a weaselly member of the Nixon White
House by Philip Baker Hall), and is unable to keep his promise to
Wigand. ``60 Minutes'' will air the piece, but won't use Wigand
on-air.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in ``Heat,'' where he was given to barking
melodramatically as if he suffered from some Actor's Studio form of
Tourette's syndrome _ who can forget Pacino's bellowing ``Gimme all
you got!'' as he banged his palms on a table? _ this time Pacino is
a center of focused calm. His Bergman is all presence, and seems to
have selected his monochromatic professional wardrobe to match his
intensity. Mike Wallace is said to be concerned enough about how he
is depicted to be on the phone to most major news organizations,
making a case against the film. (He must feel that Bergman wants
all the credit for going through the door first, and maybe Bergman
even deserves it, but the fact is that TV revolves around stars _ a
fact this movie is willfully naive about, given it's fitted around
a star.)
</P>
<P>
   But as portrayed by Plummer, Wallace is saturnine and given to
lofty turns of phrase to describe his fears; he's afraid of not
getting to leave the kind of legacy he wants. But he is a glamour
junkie. At one point, he mentions not wanting to be shuffled off to
``the wasteland of National Public Radio'' as his reason for
initially backing off the story. (Where Daniel Schorr, my colleague
on NPR's ``Weekend Edition'' ended up after a career at CBS, though
NPR hasn't hurt Cokie Roberts.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is a rousing tale, a piece of muckraking
storytelling oozing a compelling liberal hippie paranoia.
(Bergman's background seems to be similar to Mann's. Both attended
the University of Wisconsin, though Bergman ended up at the
screamingly left-wing '60s magazine ``Ramparts,'' which once ran a
story about chemically enhanced meat featuring a hunk of gelatin
shaped like a side of beef. Subtle!) There are a few other minor
problems, too. Bergman's ridiculously well-connected _ he massages
both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times into doing his
bidding. If he were that powerful, he wouldn't need ``60 Minutes.''
And the picture's a little long; ironically, it could've benefited
from some of the dazzle-me editing of a ``60 Minutes'' piece. But
Mann and his co-writer, Eric Roth, have built a credible and
engrossing story about another kind of irony: A news organization
that prides itself on having become an institution by telling
classic ``Black Hat vs. White Hat'' stories is a lot more
complicated than it ever lets on.

STUDY: HUMAN NOSES CAN SNIFF IN STEREO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``The nose knows,'' goes an old saying.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   Your left and right nostrils perceive smells slightly
differently, Stanford researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is probably too subtle for you to notice most of
the time _ say, by holding a finger under one nostril, then the
other. But it's significant enough to be detected in careful lab
experiments, researchers Noam Sobel and John Gabrieli and their
colleagues report in Thursday's issue of Nature.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, scientists have known that the human brain
allocates different responsibilities to the left and right halves
of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Sobel and Gabrieli's work shows that the human nose
does the same thing, although for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This nasal division of labor makes sense in evolutionary terms,
Gabrieli says. By making one nostril especially sensitive to
certain smells and the other nostril to others, the nose can sense
a broader range of smells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `two heads are better than one,''' Gabrieli said in
a phone interview Wednesday. Likewise, ``two nostrils give you two
good (smelling) instruments instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences are caused by variations in airflow through the
nostrils. Curiously, a given nostril's ability to smell certain
odors varies over time, and occasionally shifts to the other
nostril. It's like a husband and wife who occasionally swap
responsibilities, such as watching the kids, washing the dishes or
taking out the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's mysterious is why it goes back and forth,'' Gabrieli
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers detected the nasal phenomenon by having 20
volunteers, each with one nostril sealed, smell different odors.
</P>
<P>
   These were octane, which smells like anise, and l-carvone, which
has a peppermint scent.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers found the difference in smell was ``not as dramatic
as smelling apples with one nostril and oranges with the other,''
Sobel said. ``It's a difference subtle enough that we had to have a
careful experiment to tease it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Their co-researchers were Rehan Kahn and Edith Sullivan of
Stanford and Amnon Saltman of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental
Protection.

HARMONY KORINE DOESN'T TAKE ANY STEPS FORWARD WITH `JULIEN
DONKEY-BOY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Humphrey Bogart once dismissed those who found any worth at all
in the comedy thriller ``Beat the Devil'' as ``phonies.'' ``It's a
mess,'' he reportedly snarled.
</P>
<P>
   It came to mind as Harmony Korine's new opus ``julien
donkey-boy'' unspooled, and viewers who were repelled by his
previous film, ``Gummo'' _ one disgusted critic likened it to ``a
hairball'' _ struggled to find something, anything, nice to say
about it. But it's like looking through the sofa cushions to dig up
enough change to tip the pizza delivery guy: a fool's errand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julien'' is about a dog show of a family with Ewen Bremner (of
``Trainspotting'') as the protagonist, a depressive guy whose
hairstylist seems to be Edward Scissorhands. Flares of solarization
emphasize the low-fi filmmaking, as Chloe Sevigny pounces around as
a pregnant woman, and director-turned- ... well, camera object
Werner Herzog glowers and bellows as the angry father who wants his
son to experience as much toughening discomfort as possible.
Unfortunately, the audience ends up getting sprayed with cold water
from this garden hose of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``julien'' a found-art freak show is its adherence to
the list of restrictions that give the film the ``Dogme '95'' seal
of approval; a seal that, for the most part, seems to come with
flies buzzing around it. Dogme, the film collective formed by
director Lars von Trier and others, urges a utilization of craft
that involves using natural light and no music score _ essentially
distilling film into a recording medium.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt at minimalism seems to miss the point, since the
actors aren't exactly involved in this slouch toward naturalism, as
anyone who saw Emily Watson's hemorrhaging-from-the-soul
performance in von ``Trier's Breaking the Waves'' can attest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the choice of camera lens or film stock becomes a form of
distortion.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gummo,'' your response _ whatever it was _ partially came
from the fact that Korine was doing something new. He was part of
an East Coast pack of filmmakers, like Todd Solondz, whose bile and
creepiness grew out of an honest aesthetic. There seems to be no
room for evolution in this brand of filmmaking. It's just the same
thing over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Bogie's probably firing up a fresh Camel in his grave just
thinking about ``julien donkey-boy.'' The whole enterprise
resembles a live-action version of a ``Ren &AMP; Stimpy'' episode.

 &HT;    MOTHER'S LOVE CAN DETERMINE A RAT'S FATE
 &HT;    600&AMP;trims.
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Infant rats showered with maternal affection grow
up to be smarter and less timid than those reared by more reserved
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   And infant rats removed from the litters of reserved mothers and
reared by foster mothers who lick and groom them while they nurse
also become smarter, less timid adults.
</P>
<P>
   The findings may be relevant to understanding early intervention
programs for human beings, said Canadian researchers who conducted
experiments with the rats.
</P>
<P>
   While the results seem to indicate that early life experiences
are more important than genetic inheritance in guiding the
development of personality, Michael J. Meaney, a neuroscientist at
McGill University in Montreal and leader of the research team, said
the ``nurture-versus-nature'' question is actually blurred by the
research.
</P>
<P>
   That's because genes responsible for brain development are
directly related to different personalities. The genes appear to be
activated in some way by the treatment a rat gets at the beginning
of its life, Meaney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not comfortable with the nurture-versus-nature
discussion,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``In the real
world, the two influences seem to conspire.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaney's research, which is being published Friday in the
journal Science, also showed that ``reserved'' mothers become
significantly more affectionate toward their offspring when the
infants are regularly petted by human handlers. In such litters,
female infants grow up to become affectionate mothers.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Subjects of the experiment were members of a laboratory colony
of Norway rats, the same ugly critters that scurry around garbage
dumpsters and destroy untold tons of farm crops worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Meaney said he thinks rats have had a bad rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Norway rats are incredibly, playful, cute creatures,''
he said. ``They are like puppies. This is a very, very smart
animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists _ as well as farmers and public health workers _
already know of one example of the Norway rat's ability to pass
knowledge from one generation to another, Meaney noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a colony of rats is exposed to poison bait, an old male
will often sample it,'' Meaney said. ``The others will wait from 24
to 48 hours to see what happens to him. If he dies, it may be two
generations before any rat in that colony will go near anything
that looks or smells like that bait.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   To learn whether personality traits could also be transmitted
across generations, Meaney and his associates studied the
differences in two types of rat mothers _ those inclined to lick
and groom their infants and nurse them in a certain arch-backed
posture that the young rats evidently find more comfortable, and
mothers that do not exhibit these inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   Offspring of high LG-ABN (''licking, grooming and arch-back
nursing'') mothers are consistently less timid in confronting novel
situations and perform better in laboratory learning tests. Blood
tests for stress hormones show the animals also are calmer in the
face of novelty or threat.
</P>
<P>
   These traits can be related to the concentration of transmitter
chemicals, the substances that carry impulses between brain cells,
and the receptors they target, Meaney said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the offspring of a low LG-ABN female are removed and
placed in the litter of a high LG-ABN, they not only grow up with
improved ability to learn and deal with novelty, those physical
brain characteristics are altered accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when young rats that have been weaned by low LG-ABN
mothers are given ``plenty of toys _ playthings, blocks, bells and
the like'' _ much of the physical and behavioral effects of the
maternal neglect can be reversed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when laboratory attendants give the offspring of
reserved low LG-ABN mothers daily sessions of handling for the
first 10 or 12 days of their lives, their mothers begin to lick
them, groom them and nurse them in the arch-back posture, he said.
Evidently, being handled caused some difference in the infants'
behavior and the mothers responded to it.
</P>
<P>
   These infants then grow up to be similar in personality to those
of females naturally given to affectionate behavior. Females in
such litters will be more inclined to shower their offspring with
affection _ as are their daughters, Meaney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at them, they lick and groom exactly like the ones
born to lineages of high-licking rats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meaney speculated that even more fundamental genetic mechanisms
than those governing brain development may be at play in the rat
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to think of rats that are more at ease and
more curious about their surroundings as ``better'' rats than their
more timid cousins, this may not be true.
</P>
<P>
   Under some conditions, a rat's survival odds might be improved
by a cautious approach to its environment. Those same conditions
might generate the kind of stress that would incline the mother to
be reserved toward her brood, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am on hold. It's not the ``Hold me, hold me, hold me'' warm
embrace kind. It's the ``Thank you for your patience. Someone will
be with you before the next millennium'' kind of hold.
</P>
<P>
   I can't hang up. I've invested too much time into this call. If
I hang up, I'll lose my place in the infinitely long line of people
waiting to speak to a human being, any human being, at this
company.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for cellular phones. I've been able to purchase
groceries, fill my car with gas, cook a four-course meal (milk
counts as a course), and clean up the kitchen while waiting for a
customer service representative. My four-hour battery will need
charging again real soon, but with luck I'll reach a live one
before then.
</P>
<P>
   It all started innocently enough. While reviewing my credit card
statement, I found an item that I had a question about. A simple
question. So I dialed the toll-free service number under the
illusion that I could resolve the matter in a few minutes. Instead,
I got this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for calling Bank of Eternity; for faster service,
please have your account number available.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, got it right here. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``For account information or service, press 1. To apply for a
new account, press 2. To hear an oral reading of Volumes 1 and 2 of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica while you wait, press 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's a nice attempt at humor, I thought. Little did I
realize: They were serious. So I pressed Number 1.
</P>
<P>
   Then I heard, ``Please enter your 28-digit account number
followed by the pound key within the next 10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   It took me five attempts to accomplish that feat within the time
limit. I was disconnected twice in the meantime. After that, I
received more instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please enter the last two digits of your mother's weight on
her 18th birthday, followed by the pound key.''
</P>
<P>
   I clicked over, called my Mom, verified the information, hung up
with Mom, and entered the two digits. I kept thinking that at any
moment they were going to ask me to pull a sword from a stone and
slay a dragon to prove that I actually deserved to speak to a
customer service representative.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel; I heard the
automated voice say, ``Please hold while we connect you to your
account representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, I finally heard a real voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for waiting,'' she said. ``This is Tammy. May I have
your account number please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Tammy, I just entered my account number five times. Didn't
your computer save it or something?''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, ma'am, our computers have been down most of the day, so
that information didn't transfer. May I please have your account
number, your telephone number, and your home address?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Tammy, when I applied for the card, I gave a deposition on
everything there is to know about me. I even sent you a vial of
blood with the 14 copies of my birth certificate. Isn't that
account number linked to my account information?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, I just work here. There are two of us left since they
downsized the department. We share a single computer and it's 10
years old. Jean takes care of 25 states and I handle the others.
I'm sure all of your information is in the computer somewhere, but
I could carve it in stone faster than I can pull it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. I gave her all of my information again and waited some
more while she went to lunch. But when she came back from lunch,
she was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was your question, ma'am?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I could hardly remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's a $30 charge on my card for some kind of phone
or Internet service. I've never heard of this company and my
husband says that he doesn't know what it is either. Can you tell
me anything about these charges?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, you'll have to call the company for that information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What company is it? All I have here are some initials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand ma'am. I'd like to help you but, unfortunately, I
just noticed that you live in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, that's Jean's area. I'll have to transfer you. Please
hold.''

   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   A lot when you are an auto manufacturer or an auto dealer and
your product's name is emblazoned on a NASCAR racer on the Winston
Cup circuit. It is seen by millions again and again on race
weekends, and by millions more when the cars appear at promotional
events leading up to races.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Dodge is going back to move forward: going back in
a historical sense to the days when Dodges were hot machines, raced
by drivers whose names we all recognize but most of whom moved on
to other brands; going back in a literal sense by turning a
front-wheel-drive Dodge Intrepid into a rear-wheel-drive Winston
Cup car.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to get back on the circuit on Feb. 18, 2001, at the
Daytona 500. For many Dodge dealers, it will be a reemergence that
has been too long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Dodge appeared in a Winston Cup race was more
than 14 years ago. The last time a Dodge won a Winston Cup race was
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sport where auto dealers have long repeated the mantra,
``Win on Sunday, sell on Monday,'' that's 22 years of potential
lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   So the dealers clamored and DaimlerChrysler, newly melded and
putting together a company ``bible'' that outlines its objectives
into the next century, included as one of its tenets that the name
Dodge would once again dance before the eyes of America's millions
of race fans.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge will build cars for five teams and be the primary sponsor
for two of them. The other three teams will be open to other
primary sponsors who step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, one of the Dodge teams will be run by Ray
Evernham, who guided Jeff Gordon to three Winston Cup
championships.
</P>
<P>
   And also significant is that the dealers who clamored for the
return _ knowing that in Winston Cup racing, there will be a return
on this return _ have stepped forward with money.
</P>
<P>
   They will take advertising money from their 39 Dodge advertising
associations around the country and pump it into the company's
racing effort.
</P>
<P>
   But they do so knowing they are not really giving up any
advertising. It's just that a different form of advertising will be
streaking around a track 33 weekends a year at speeds up to 200
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   And they know that these rolling, roaring ads will be seen: This
year, in what has become a billion-dollar-plus business, 10 million
fans have gone to Winston Cup races; 112 million watched the races
on television. It is a venue that Dodge simply could no longer
resist.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodge first ran in a NASCAR race on May 30, 1950, at Canfield
Motor Speedway in Canfield, Ohio. Between then and Nov. 20, 1977,
at Ontario, Calif. _ when Neil Bonnett won the last race a Dodge
would win _ a slew of great drivers drove Dodges and won 160 races
in them.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Lee Petty, Richard Petty, Junior Johnson,
Bonnett, David Pearson, Bobby Isaac, Bobby Allison, and Buddy
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baker, in a Dodge, who was first to break the 200 m.p.h.
barrier in a NASCAR race, reaching 200.447 m.p.h. at Talladega,
Ala., on March 24, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pettys, Baker, Pearson, and Isaac all drove a Dodge during
a championship season.
</P>
<P>
   And Dodge was at the focal point of what many consider to be a
historic moment in NASCAR history, when a driver first became
bigger than the car he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in midseason, 1978, when Richard Petty got out of
his Dodge and switched to a Chevrolet. There were rumblings that
all the Dodge fans would desert Petty. Instead, they followed him
into the Chevrolet and stuck with ``The King'' forevermore, no
matter what he drove. But they did notice what he drove.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Dodge's NASCAR fortunes plummeted, and after the
immortal Phil Good drove a Dodge to a 30th-place finish at Pocono
International Raceway on June 9, 1985, Dodge was out of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   But now the company, which has kept its hand in racing with
Vipers at the FIA World GT Championships, Rams on the NASCAR
Craftsmen's Truck series, and drag racing with the Team Mopar Pro
Stock Dodge Avengers, is back in the loop, back at a most lucrative
time for the sport. And through the Daimler-Chrysler merger,
they've got Mercedes-Benz on their side _ not a bad thing when you
consider the West McLaren Mercedes successes on the Formula One
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to give our Dodge owners, Dodge dealers, and our
employees the opportunity to cheer for their brand,'' Jim Julow,
vice president of the Dodge Division for DaimlerChrysler, said when
he announced the reentry.
</P>
<P>
   He could have added, ``and time to let non-Dodge owners cheer
for a famous driver and maybe run out and buy the car he's
driving.''

GLOBAL WARMING ALREADY IMPACTING CALIFORNIA, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Warmer, wetter winters. Hotter, drier summers.
Species disappearing and fish stocks in flux. More floods,
landslides, wildfires, pests and pestilence.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the apocalypse?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those changes are likely in California's future,
according to a two-year study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists and the
Ecological Society of America concludes that shifts in temperature
and rainfall over the next century will probably reduce the already
scarce supply of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's good evidence that the climate will change globally,
and it will change in California,'' said Christopher B. Field, lead
author and faculty member of Carnegie Institution of Washington's
Department of Plant Biology on the Stanford University campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best available evidence indicates warming over the next
century of 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and 1 to 2
degrees in the summer,'' Field said. ``The evidence also indicates
wetter winters and probably drier summers. All the changes acting
together will have a profound effect on water resources in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the predictions of ``Confronting Climate Change in
California: Ecological Impacts on the Golden State,'' the 62-page
study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Summer water shortages could intensify competition for water
among cities, farms, businesses and ecosystems that depend on
rivers and runoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grapes, cotton, alfalfa and other crops that use lots of water
may reap smaller profits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Droughts could intensify economic and environmental loss from
wildfires and damage to forests from pine bark beetles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Less fresh water entering the San Francisco Bay would change
water salinity, quality and circulation, disrupting the food chain.
This could threaten the commercial supplies of anchovies and
herring and endangered salmon and steelhead trout.
</P>
<P>
   _ More winter rain could cause flooding _ including along 1,100
miles of Delta waterways _ landslides, erosion and risks of
waterborne and pest-borne diseases. A one-foot rise in sea level
from melting icecaps by 2100 means that reaching high-tide peak on
the lower San Joaquin River would change from an event that occurs
every 100 years on average to every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ El Nios, which have had a particularly dramatic effect on
California's weather and economy, may increase in intensity and
frequency as the climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   These turbulent weather patterns would amplify the impact of the
rise in sea level on coastal wetlands, agriculture and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though winters may be wetter, warmer weather means more of
the precipitation would be rain that would fill rivers, the study
found, instead of snow that would build a Sierra snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means we'll have much more winter runoff,'' said Field.
``By the time you get into the summer, the stream flow may be less.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer summers increase evaporation, which will further increase
water shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of more
than 500 scientists, concluded in 1995 that warming would increase
between 2 and 6 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 100 years, the
fastest pace in human history.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the climate change is driven by human activities, it
said, as carbon dioxide is released by burning fossil fuels, and,
to a lesser degree, its removal from the atmosphere is decreased by
the cutting of forests. The gas traps solar heat within Earth's
atmosphere in a greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few dissenting voices, scientists agree the sea
level in California will rise by 8 to 12 inches in the next 100
years, two to three times the increase seen in the Pacific Ocean at
San Francisco over the past 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of climate change already have begun in California,
some studies show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a warming of the currents off California in recent
decades has been linked to population declines of zooplankton, tiny
creatures at the base of the food chain, and of seabirds called
sooty shearwaters.
</P>
<P>
   In kelp forests off the Southern California coast, the
proportion of northern cold-water fish species has dropped by half
since the 1970s. The proportion of southern warm-water fish species
has increased nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At least one California butterfly species, Edith's checkerspot,
is shifting from the southern to the northern limits of its range,
a likely consequence of rising temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last decade, with more precise models, could
scientists predict the regional effects of global climate change.
The predictions are still sketchy, but the scientists agree that
the changes are likely to vary widely across the state.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario predicts much more rain over California with dry
areas to the east of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Winter
precipitation over the coast and Sierra could rise by 25 percent or
more, it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Another shows the strongest warming in the northern Sierra and
Central Valley, with increased drought in the southeastern corner
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state's changing climate could result in major shifts in
ecosystems, the study predicts. Grassy savannahs would likely
encroach on the arid foothill chaparral of the coastal ranges and
the Sierra Nevada. At higher elevations, shrubs could replace
forests. Off the north coast, changing current temperatures could
influence the fog, which is favorable for redwood forests.
</P>
<P>
   California's ecosystems are already vulnerable, sometimes
whittled down to small patches harboring imperiled species.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of scientists recommended limiting fossil fuel
emissions. In addition, it advised limiting development to provide
more breathing room for ecosystems to deal with climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all bad news, and there are some things that can be
done,'' said Field. ``We hope the study will help to consider the
environmental consequence of future change, and take steps to
protect these environmental values.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Concerned Scientists is a 30-year-old nonprofit
dedicated to advancing responsible science and technology public
policies, and the Ecological Society of America is an association
of 7,000 professional members. Both are based in Washington D.C.

 &HT;    STUDENT PLAY BECOMES UNLIKELY BATTLEGROUND IN IRAN'S POWER
STRUGGLE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Nov. 6 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ College student Ali Abbas Nemati pleaded his
defense through his tears.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, as jury, judge and prosecutor, was Saeed Mortazavi,
known for closing newspapers and jailing editors. Behind Nemati was
a row of turbaned clerics.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of student supporters sat on metal chairs in the back of
the courtroom, a drab, closed-in space similar to a large
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time in my life that I wished I was dead was when I
heard about the charges against me,'' said the slender student, his
voice cracking, during his trial last month.
</P>
<P>
   He had not committed murder or treason. He was a playwright,
charged with insulting the 12th Imam, a messianic figure in Shiite
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   This week(Nov. 2), Mortazavi made his decision. He sentenced
Nemati and another student to three years in jail. The judge's
ruling is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows that Iran's religious establishment, bent on
maintaining its influence, will flex its muscle against artists
just as it has many times against rival editors and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Nemati's play had become the object of the battle between
Iranians who cling to strict fundamentalist Shiite rule and those
seeking a transition to a civil democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor guy was a victim of the big political struggle,''
said Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati.
</P>
<P>
   The play, ``Final Exam: Trying to Emerge,'' was controversial
for its treatment of the Imam Mohammad(CQ), called the ``Mahdi,''
or ``One lead by God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Imam vanished in the ninth century and Shiite Muslims
believe he will return someday, ushering in justice and true Islam.
They pray for his ``emergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever his name is mentioned in public, crowds are obligated
to shout praises to Allah. Nemati's trial was punctuated by such
chants at the frequent mention of the Imam's name.
</P>
<P>
   Nemati's play appears to satire those who call for the Imam with
insincerity. His central character, Abbas, prays for the Imam's
emergence. When the Imam arrives and tells Abbas to perform a task,
Abbas refuses, saying he has an important exam.
</P>
<P>
   The play was never performed and was only printed in a student
magazine circulated to 150 people. But, a conservative newspaper
highlighted it. Inflamed by Nemati's use of colloquial, rather than
formal language in discussing the Imam, religious leaders called
for his punishment. One police official said he would personally
execute Nemati, who is in his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, however, said the play was
being used by those trying to undermine his attempts at reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though a certain group wants to create a haze
across the country with particular ambitions,'' Khatami said, in
the veiled references typical of Iranian political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Though Khatami is not as powerful as conservative, religious
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, writers during his two years
in office have seen growing freedom. The writers' association has
been able to meet more freely and assert freedoms of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Some even consider it a sign of progress that Nemati's play was
handled in court, rather than through street violence or
imprisonment without trial.
</P>
<P>
   There have been harsh setbacks and major victories. Four writers
have been killed in the last year and a half. But, when security
agents were linked to the killings, the scandal lead to the
resignation of the country's intelligence chief and replacement by
a Khatami ally.
</P>
<P>
   Simin Behbahani, a leading Iranian poet and a member of the
writers' association, has been a target of the conservatives. She
says that, despite the growing freedom, the rules for writers are
still hard to define.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of power in Iran is too vast and broad. You never
know who will approve and who will not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the play,'' she said after the sentencing last week.
``It was so simple and childish that I think the Imam himself would
regard it as a weak satire, a piece arisen from devotion and
seeking affection and love.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, religious topics are sensitive anywhere. Here, in the
Islamic Republic of Iran, any perceived challenge to Islam can also
be seen as a challenge to the revolutionary government that is
based on the religion.
</P>
<P>
   Mojtaba Kheyrollah, a 37-year-old Iranian leaving prayer
services on a recent Friday, said the play was an insult to the
sacrifices Iranians have made for their country and religion. ``If
it happened on a daily basis,'' he said. ``We could no longer call
this the Islamic Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemati unknowingly crossed the line. A member of a religious
family and graduate of a religious high school, he told Judge
Mortazavi that he meant to honor the 12th Imam.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth can I insult the 12th Imam when I deeply believe
in him?'' Nemati asked as his anxiety grew. ``My message was that
if you are really honest in calling him, then you will change your
way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortazavi, a stout man in a blazer and slacks, is jovial and
good-humored outside the court. But, with Nemati, he was on the
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have ridiculed the 12th Imam and those who have invested
their lives in the revolution,'' he said, referring to the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the court were women in black veils holding
pictures of sons who died in the Iran-Iraq war. The mothers were
the official plaintiffs in the case, claiming the play insulted the
ideals of their martyred sons.
</P>
<P>
   Masoud Riahi, lawyer for Nemati and three others charged in the
case, said the play was written out of devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is reading the play without pre-judgments,'' he
said, ``he would understand that the writer is trying to show the
thoughts of one who is not a true believer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in today's Iran, the question of who is a ``true believer''
is the subject of punishing debate.

CIGARETTE PARODY AD WILL BE SEEN WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California-bred ad parody showing a rugged
cowboy confiding to another horseback rider about his
cigarette-induced disease will be seen worldwide through a World
Health Organization anti-tobacco campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The spoof of the familiar Marlboro Man ads will appear with the
words ``Bob, I've got cancer,'' and be printed in six languages as
part of the U.N. agency's stepped-up efforts to eradicate smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In California the ad ran with the words ``Bob, I've got
emphysema,'' but officials found that too hard to translate in some
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco activists see the ad as one way of combating the
widespread idea that smoking is part of a glamorous American
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the WHO convened a working group of 109 nations to
begin drawing up a treaty on tobacco that will likely tighten
restrictions on smuggling, advertising and promotion, as well as
add rules about how tar and nicotine in cigarettes are measured and
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Yach, head of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative, is in
California this week, attending a meeting of the state's tobacco
control officials to learn more about the successful campaign here.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 1996 cowboy ad, the state has produced spots
displaying a drooping cigarette to show its link to impotence and
ran footage of executives testifying to Congress in 1994 that
tobacco isn't addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Yach said many of the other California ads are expected to be
incorporated as well, depending on how they would fit in with the
local cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1990 with some of the proceeds of a 25-cent-per-pack
tax on cigarettes, the state campaign has been credited with
helping bring the rate of smoking down from 26.7 percent in 1988 to
18.2 percent last year. California now has the second-lowest rate
of smoking, after Utah, according to Colleen Stevens, chief of the
Department of Health Services' tobacco control media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO has $1.5 million from the United Nations Foundation to
build the basic structure for a local tobacco-control effort in 14
countries, including China, Germany, India, Thailand, Mali and the
Ukraine. Yach said they hope to convince officials in each country
to pick up the effort and add funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that one of the routes they would see makes
sense is raising the excise tax as a means of financing their own
campaigns,'' Yach said.
</P>
<P>
   While some countries, particularly in Europe, have strong bans
on tobacco advertising and others tax it heavily, the WHO has a
steep climb ahead of it. Tobacco use has fallen in the United
States, but it is rising in many developing countries, An estimated
1.15 billion people worldwide smoke.
</P>
<P>
   In places like the Philippines, cigarette makers advertise their
products next to the image of the Virgin Mary on calendars.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Joe Camel has been translated into Jose Camel, and
cuddly stuffed versions of him are available. In Sri Lanka, women
in short skirts walk around dispensing free packs of cigarettes to
passers-by, Yach said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has seen many of the foreign ads and found them
startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of these ads really glamorize American life and have
messages about independence and freedom and ideas like if you smoke
you can be like these blond, blue-eyed Americans,'' she said. ``I
should live as well as the people in these ads.''
</P>
<P>
   She said officials trying to reduce smoking worldwide have their
work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going up against the world's smartest marketers,'' she
said. ``We're going up against 50 years of advertising that has
convinced people it's normal to roll some leaves up in a piece of
paper and smoke it.''

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.

   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas

AUTHOR FINDS PERILS IN INVESTING TOO MUCH OF SELF IN WORKPLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Work has become too important.''
</P>
<P>
   American workers are putting in more hours annually than even
the workaholic Japanese. Major corporations are encouraging
relationships at the office, in their constant effort to push
production. Day-care facilities are becoming more common in
companies so parents can put in more time at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this all lead?
</P>
<P>
   Dave Arnott, a Dallas Baptist University management professor
and lecturer, sees it pushing us off the edge if we aren't careful.
He voices his views in his new book, ``Corporate Cults: The
Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming Organization'' (Amacom, 240
pages, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every organization has some degree of cultedness,'' he writes.
``People join organizations to accomplish things that they cannot
do on their own, so individuals subordinate themselves to some
extent. However, in corporate cults, the organization has become
work, family, and community for the employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Many corporations are pushing their culture to the extreme,
seeing productivity rise with every after-hours party or employee
retreat, Arnott writes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, Arnott says that the companies most
applauded for treating employees well in this country may be the
ones hurting their employees' balanced lives the most.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Arnott offers several attacks against Southwest
Airlines in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture at Southwest Airlines clearly is good for the
organization,'' he writes. ``Employees are unabashedly devoted to
the organization, as shown by their willingness to work extra days,
stay late, and attend parties and other business functions on their
own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a culture can lure many away from other interests, however,
such as raising a family or being involved with a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad (for the individual) because it takes away the
individual's identity,'' he writes. ``Spending time and effort in
the pursuit of organizational goals reduces the time and effort
available to spend in pursuit of individual goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott brings up Texas-based EDS as another example of an
all-consuming corporation, but in a different light. Where
Southwest offers appealing lures to get employees to work harder,
EDS bullies them in a ``ridged, hard-driving, quasi-military
culture,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the military is a strong example of a cultlike
organization, Arnott writes. Studies show that suicides in the
military are highest right after people join or leave. The military
is known to exclude all other aspects of life, tearing a recruit
from outside support groups such as family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   When members leave, they have to deal with the loss of the cult,
Arnott writes.
</P>
<P>
   Similar signs of cultlike cultures are showing up in corporate
America. Arnott says he has counseled a number of employees who
have left their organizations and feel exiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feelings of rejection and low self-worth, the frustration
and anger are closely akin to those of recent divorcees,'' he
writes. ``That's because employees of specialist collections view
their workplace as a corporate family. The family bonds are broken
when the employee leaves the corporation, and the same feelings of
familial rejection ensue.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott says the companies that are less touchy-feely in their
corporate culture are actually better for mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend a cold and contractual workplace because it forces
employees to meet their emotional and affiliation needs at home,''
he writes. ``Emotional needs should not be supplied in the
workplace setting; they should be supplied by family and
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Arnott cites numerous examples of corporate cultures
going too far, he states upfront that the ultimate responsibility
for an employee's well-being lies in the employee's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``While leadership certainly contributes to cultish behavior,
the major part of the responsibility lies with the individual,'' he
writes. ``Only the voluntary replacement of `who I am' with `what I
do' can produce corporate cult membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnott's book deals primarily with how the individual can
identify cultish behavior in himself or herself and watch for
danger signs of becoming too emotionally involved with the company.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of people from divorced families, crime victims
and other childhood catastrophes rising, Arnott sees a dangerous
trend in companies filling some of that emptiness. That's not their
role, he says, and individuals should learn to recognize corporate
inroads into their souls and safeguard against them.

DALLAS, HERE'S AN OLYMPIC KIND OF DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey. Yo. Dallas, Big D, D-Town, have I got a deal for you.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I mean, I have an idea that Fort Worth ought to run at you
and that you should ruminate upon very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Olympics here _ the 2012 summertime kind, the
really big show that some of your leading lights believe would
focus overdue and much-deserved international attention upon you
and surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Folks on this end of the I-30 and I-20 Metroplex hyphens have
been much intrigued of late by entreaties from visiting leading
citizens of your city who have been imploring Fort Worth to support
Dallas's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Those emissaries from the east expressed some concern that Fort
Worth's embrace of that initiative has been lukewarm at best. And
they stressed the need for Cowtown to rally around the five-ringed
flag if Dallas ... uh, the North Central Texas region, is to have a
really good shot at lassoing the coveted event.
</P>
<P>
   And they came promising that this would not be one of those
cases of ``everything for Minneapolis and nothing for St. Paul.''
They stressed that Fort Worth would get its share of significant
competition venues, which caused one Fort Worth wag to suggest
kayaking in Trinity Park.
</P>
<P>
   But another argued that Fort Worth could lose such water sports
to Johnson Creek in Arlington unless the supporters of that project
sink it with incessant rhetorical overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, rhythmic dancing at the Fort Worth Convention Center,
tennis at Texas Christian University, preliminary basketball and
volleyball competition,
</P>
<P>
   archery and shooting have been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Real exciting stuff, ya? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Fort Worth would get some enormous economic spillover
even if it had no big events. That's really not the point of why
support for the Olympic bid is so tepid in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Among the real reasons are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The widespread belief that Dallas hasn't much of chance of
being selected, given the insufferable heat in this area during the
summer and the difficulty of getting around in the prevailing
traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disillusionment among some with the commercialization of the
Olympics and the corruption of the city selection process, as
evidenced by the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   _ A feeling among a few (and they are right) that the Summer
Olympics should be permanently situated in Greece, but that if any
Texas city is really suited for the games, it is San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the overriding thing mitigating against stirring up fervent
backing of Dallas' bid for the Olympics is that most Fort Worth
residents no longer trust Dallas. They have become convinced that
Fort Worth will wind up getting the short end of the stick in any
cooperative effort with Big D.
</P>
<P>
   Much history supports that distrust. The latest betrayal, of
course, is Dallas' effort to weasel out of the obligations imposed
upon it by the 1968 bond agreements entered into by the two cities
for the construction of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to the proposition that Fort Worth should
make to Dallas. Fort Worth should offer to come out vehemently,
vociferously and even monetarily, if necessary, in favor of Dallas'
getting the Olympic Games of the summer of twenty and a dozen _ if
Dallas will recommit itself to protecting D/FW Airport from
injurious competition at Dallas Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas can do that simply by agreeing to exercise its authority
as owner of its municipal airport to limit the number of gates to a
figure that would not undermine D/FW's ability to continue
functioning as one of the top national and international commercial
airline hubs.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for that reasonable accommodation, Fort Worth should
offer to withdraw the lawsuit that has stifled needed expansion and
improvement at D/FW for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dallas leaders have said in the past that they are
willing to make a deal if Fort Worth will first drop the lawsuit
challenging it to live up to its bond covenant obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's a nonstarter. Fort Worth can't and won't do that
because no one here trusts Dallas anymore. Fort Worth has been St.
Pauled by Dallas too many times in the past to ever again kayak
into the murky waters of intercity cooperation without a life
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But if Dallas would just agree to put the needed restraints on
Love Field growth and expansion, Fort Worth could safely withdraw
the lawsuit, D//FW Airport could proceed with its expansion plans,
and the whole Metroplex could jubilantly endorse the idea of a
Dallas Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck? If such an agreement could be reached, there
might emerge some strong sentiment for changing the name of Dallas
Love Field to Dallas Olympics Airport.

PREFER CHARM OVER CHIC? CHAMA, CLOUDCROFT, LAS VEGAS ARE DOWNRIGHT
NEIGHBORLY
</HEADLINE>
  &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHY FRISINGER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Texans, New Mexico is like your favorite relative, a
good-times pal always open to a friendly visit.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, New Mexico has gotten a little too sophisticated for
some folks' taste, not to mention a little crowded. At least that's
how it seems sometimes in chichi cities like Santa Fe and Taos,
where every other person is a Texan and every other dinner costs
$100.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other places, smaller towns, where New Mexico's
charms are unsullied. If you're looking for a simpler, less
tourist-trampled version of New Mexico, there are these: Instead of
Taos, try Chama, for a ride on a vintage train; instead of Ruidoso,
try Cloudcroft, where the hotel clerks apologize for the cool
weather in mid-August; instead of Santa Fe, try Las Vegas, for a
taste of, well, Santa Fe-past.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Chama
</P>
<P>
   Tucked along the northern border of New Mexico is a tiny town
that's the starting point for a journey back to the rugged and
romantic West of 100 years ago. The town is Chama, and the Cumbres
&AMP; Toltec Scenic Railroad is both the means of travel and the
destination.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, the Denver &AMP; Rio Grande Railway began
constructing a network of narrow-gauge railways (rails that were 3
feet apart vs. the standard 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches) in the West. The
narrow gauge was both cheaper to construct and easier to maneuver
through winding mountain passes. Eleven years into the project, the
line abandoned narrow gauge and switched to standard gauge. The
Cumbres &AMP; Toltec is the longest and highest surviving portion of
narrow-gauge line in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is lured by the romance of the steam-engine train
will be smitten by the ride from Chama to Osier, Colo. The train
departs Chama at 10:30 a.m., giving passengers plenty of time to
enjoy a sumptuous morning meal at their bed and breakfast and then
make a leisurely inspection of the train yard before boarding.
Choose a seat on the right for the best view heading out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the altitude (7,863 feet in Chama, 10,015 feet at the
highest point, Cumbres Pass), the temperature is cool even in
midsummer. And once you're past the outskirts of town, the
aspen-covered-mountain scenery is lovely. Enjoy the sights out your
window or, better yet, move to the open car in the back. You may
get a few cinders, but the view and the crisp air make it
worthwhile. And then there are the sounds _ the engines chuffing,
the loud whine of the steam whistles, the occasional hissing of
water being blown out the side of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the ride is the steepest climb, but the
most interesting part of the trip is the crossing of the Lobato
trestle. The trestle isn't sturdy enough for two engines, so the
train stops short of the bridgework. The first engine is unhooked
and proceeds across; when it reaches the other side, the second
engine follows, pulling the train's cars. Across the trestle, the
engines are recoupled. The maneuvering involves a lot of
whistle-blowing, and the sound echoes off the mountains, making it
all seem very important.
</P>
<P>
   The ride to Osier takes about 2 1/2 hours. Keep an eye out for
wildlife, which could include elk, deer, mountain lions, bobcats or
perhaps even a brown bear. Snap some photos of the front of the
train as it curves along a switchback.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone piles out of the train at Osier for a lunch that, to be
honest, ranks in the lower echelon of institutional fare. But with
all that fresh air, you're hungry and you don't care. For the
return trip, your train will swap engines with another excursion
train, which has chugged down to Osier from Antonito, Colo. The
train arrives back at the Chama station at 4:20.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, at the close of the season, the Cumbres &AMP; Toltec
Scenic Railroad Commission terminated the lease with the company
operating the railroad. Leo Schmitz, executive director, said a new
operator is expected to be in place for the beginning of the 2000
season in May.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is Chama's livelihood. There are a few tchotchkes shops
and a dozen or so restaurants for whiling away the rest of your
day.
</P>
<P>
   When we visited Chama, our dinner at one of the restaurants that
cater to the train crowd was deliciously capped off by an
announcement from the cook that ``a bear that isn't afraid of
people'' was wandering around town and that we all should remain
inside for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the bear was real or a neat little fiction for the
tourists, it was a great ending for a charming trip.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Cloudcroft
</P>
<P>
   Nestled among the quaking aspens of the Sacramento Mountains,
the tiny town of Cloudcroft, elevation 9,000 feet, feels like it's
perched among the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudcroft's tippy-top location means grand views _ you can see
the white sands of White Sands, 35 miles away _ and delightfully
cool weather, even in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   This town also traces its origins to a rail line, but The Lodge,
a historic hotel in the mode of ``Grand Hotel'' and that is
celebrating its centennial this year, is the reason to go there.
Greta Garbo was never a visitor, but other ``names,'' including
Clark Gable, Gilbert Roland, Judy Garland and Pancho Villa, were.
</P>
<P>
   The original log-building Lodge was built by the Alamagordo and
Sacramento Mountain Railway in 1899 as a luxury retreat, and the
management is claiming this as its 100th year, though a fire
destroyed the first building in 1909 and it was rebuilt on its
current, more scenic site. The Lodge is a charming combination of
elegant and rustic, with a ghost legend adding a touch of whimsy. A
large fireplace is the centerpiece of the lobby. For active
recreation, there's a heated swimming pool and a golf course. Feel
like being pampered? There's a masseuse on staff and a fudge shop _
candy samples are left on your pillow at night.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The lovely restaurant, Rebecca's, is named for the ghost, a
slain chambermaid who was a red-headed beauty, of course. Rebecca's
serves nouvelle American cuisine with a New Mexican touch, which
includes items like margarita shrimp (jumbo shrimp sauteed in gold
tequila with green chiles and Roma tomatoes) and blackened blue
corn sea bass (a whitefish fillet coated with blue cornmeal and
Cajun spices). Be sure to make reservations and pack some dress-up
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   For the more active, abundant hiking trails in the Lincoln
National Forest beckon. If your image of New Mexico is desert,
you'll be surprised at how lushly green it is around Cloudcroft. A
trail that begins just outside of town leads, in an hour or so, to
an abandoned railroad trestle.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of time to get in a round or two of golf, as
well. The Lodge's golf course is memorably unusual. Head down,
down, down on the first hole. On the fifth hole, helmeted young
spotters keep an eye on your ball for you, because a substantial
hill not far from the tee means you can't possibly see the green _
or the spot where your ball has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, skiing takes over; Cloudcroft averages 75 inches of
snow per year. Snow Canyon, which is the state's southernmost ski
resort, is not far from town.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen or so attractive shops for browsing, and a
sweet shop for grabbing an ice cream cone and more fudge, but aside
from Rebecca's, Cloudcroft's restaurants are disappointing. A
couple of low-end sandwich shops and barbecue places are the
choices.
</P>

   Las Vegas
</P>
<P>
   If you look really hard, you can see the faint remains of the
wheel ruts left by the wagons rolling into Las Vegas on the Santa
Fe Trail.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen hard, you can hear the crack of a gun fired by
Billy the Kid in yet another murderous rampage. Well, not really,
but Billy the Kid, Doc Holliday and other outlaws did create a
rowdy past for Las Vegas, and history is much of what this town is
all about.
</P>
<P>
   For the size of the town (about 18,000), Las Vegas must have
more buildings on the National Register of Historic Places (about
900) than any other spot. It's a mixed heritage of Spanish-style
casitas, Italianate architecture and elegant Victorian houses.
There is a self-guided walking tour using maps from the Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza Hotel, built in 1882, has been restored, and the
Theodore Roosevelt Rough Riders Memorial and City Museum houses a
collection of artifacts from the Spanish-American War (not as much
of a stretch as you might imagine; 40 percent of the Rough Riders
were from New Mexico). The United World College, a striking
red-slate building, is designed to look like a castle. A lodge
built by the Santa Fe Railroad in the early 1800s, Montezuma's
Castle, is undergoing restoration and might reopen as a convention
center in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The strip of shops downtown has started undergoing
gentrification _ though not to the extent of more touristy
neighbors like Taos or Santa Fe. Here, you can still find good buys
on Indian jewelry, Spanish-inspired furniture, locally made
clothing, paintings and sculptures by New Mexico artists, and
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Even more compelling than the historic buildings is Mother
Nature's architecture in the Las Vegas region. The Pecos River cuts
a canyon through the Pecos Wilderness. The upper Pecos River is
renowned for fly-fishing, and on summer weekends the riverbanks are
crowded. There are foot and horseback wilderness trails in the
Santa Fe National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Like Santa Fe, its neighbor an hour to the west, Las Vegas is a
place to sample Indian culture. Be sure not to miss the Pecos
National Historical Park, which lies between the two towns, and
includes pueblo ruins dating back to 1200. The pueblo is thought to
have stood 4 stories tall in the 1400s, when it was home to more
than 2,000 people and was a major trading center. In the 17th
century, Franciscan monks built a pair of missions on the site.
Excavation here began in the 1920s, and it is considered one of the
most important archaelogical sites in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Santa Fe, there's no rush to impress in laid-back Las
Vegas. Las Vegas is Santa Fe's easy-going country cousin.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes that country cousin is just the fella you're
looking for.

`INSIDER' LOOKS LIKE AN OSCAR CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Mann's absorbing new film, ``The Insider,'' is a welcome
throwback both to the great old inside-journalism movies of the
'30s and to the devastating muckraking-dramas that were the
hallmark of Sidney Lumet in the '70s (``Prince of the City,''
``Serpico'').
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, the buzz in Hollywood has been that the
film is so against the grain and over the head of the mass
movie-going audience in America, that it's doomed to box-office
oblivion. But the exact same thing was said about ``The Sixth
Sense,'' so we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it's a terrific movie _ intelligent, magnificently
acted, highly compelling as a thriller, and down-right scary in its
implications for the corporate-run world of the new millennium.
Box-office or no, this should be one of the year's big Oscar
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   It's the true story of Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a
former top research executive for a major tobacco company, who gave
evidence to CBS' ``60 Minutes'' about, among many damning things,
his company's nefarious plan to lace its product to make it even
more addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Seen mostly from the point of view of CBS producer Lowell
Bergman (Al Pacino), the first half of the film deals with the
efforts to entice the reluctant Wigand to go public, while the
industry attempts to intimidate him with death threats and
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the crux of the film comes after the segment is produced,
and CBS _ intimidated by a potential tobacco industry lawsuit, and
its own executives' fear of spoiling a profitable merger _ buckles,
decides not to air the interview, and leaves Wigand hanging in the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Like most hard-hitting films based on recent real events, this
one has drawn fire, most prominently from CBS star-reporter Mike
Wallace _ who, as portrayed by Christopher Plummer, is a major
character in the film, and has more or less denounced it as a
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But what's on the screen is certainly true to the contours of
the real story that's gradually come to light, and it's done with
such a thoughtful, even hand that it's hard to understand exactly
what Wallace (who actually comes off rather well by the end) is
crying about.
</P>
<P>
   As a piece of technical filmmaking, the film is a considerable
feat. Mann's script and direction holds our interest like a vise
over a lengthy running time, and with scenes that resolutely refuse
to dumb up the material and more often than not consist of
characters speaking to each other via cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The cast offers up three likely Oscar-nominations: Pacino,
splendidly outraged as the ex-radical turned establishment TV
producer; Crowe, brilliant as the complex, nervous, bitterly
paranoid witness; and Plummer, who finds both alarming shallowness
and unexpected backbone in the Avenging Angel of ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' also has a great edge. It doesn't easily resolve
itself. Its characters are not enriched by their ordeal and its
portrait of inherent corporate corruption is so unsettling that it
should give much aid and comfort to all those World Trade
Organization protesters currently piling into town to question the
ability of corporations to run the New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   The Insider. Directed by Michael Mann. Written by Eric Roth and
Michael Mann. Cast: Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer,
Diane Venora. Touchstone. 160 minutes. Rated R for language.

BRUTAL `BONE COLLECTOR' WALLOWS IN GRUESOME ABSURDITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mystery film, television and fiction is littered with physically
challenged detectives: blind detectives, deaf detectives,
wheelchair-bound detectives, near-senile detectives, detectives so
obese they never leave their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Bone Collector,'' however, we may have the ultimate
handicapped sleuth: a quadriplegic detective who has to match wits
with a diabolical serial killer while his mind and body are quickly
slipping into a total vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Australian old-pro Phillip Noyce, the film has
its moments, and it's well cast. But it's also very contrived,
rather glaringly derivative of Hitchcock's ``Rear Window'' in
places, and finally so incorrigibly gruesome that it's an
unpleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Jeffery Deaver, the story is sparked when a
rookie woman New York cop (Angelina Jolie) stumbles on a brutal
murder scene, and is smart enough to preserve the bizarre physical
evidence _ a set of clues deliberately left by the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   This evidence soon gets in the hands of Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel
Washington), a massively handicapped cop, true-crime author and
criminologist who quickly deciphers the killer's puzzle and is hot
on his trail _ using the beautiful young cop as his eyes and ears.
</P>
<P>
   As it goes through its familiar paces, the movie earns some
points from its noir-ish look, the clever high-tech apparatus that
the hero uses to overcome his physical limitations, and the casting
of the always likable Washington and the surprisingly charismatic
Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict that rises between the protagonists seems
forced, contrived and unnecessary; the dark production design
gradually becomes ludicrous (its overwrought vision of New York is
right out of a ``Batman'' movie); and the plot is finally just
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   It's also absurdly grisly. With its determination to rub our
faces in dismembered body parts, mutilated corpses and unpleasantly
ghoulish torture scenes, the film quickly loses all interest as an
intellectual whodunit, and assumes the esthetics of a bad slasher
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Bone Collector. Directed by Phillip Noyce. Screenplay by
Jeremy Iacone. Cast: Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Queen
Latifah, Michael Rooker, Luis Guzman, Ed O'Neill.
Universal/Columbia. 110 minutes. Rated R for extreme violence.

 `PRINCESS mONONOKE' SHOULD DAZZLE U.S. AUDIENCES AS WELL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though Japanese animation has a considerable cult following
in Seattle and other areas _ and has been perhaps the most
profitable arm of the Japanese film industry for some years now _
it's never had any real impact on the world movie market,
especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miramax people are betting that this will change with
the U.S. release of ``Princess Mononoke,'' an animated epic that
grossed a record $150 million in Japan in 1997, which they've
painstakingly re-dubbed with a cast of familiar English voices.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right. It's a dazzling movie, gorgeous to look at,
involving on both an emotional and intellectual level, and often
genuinely thrilling. Audiences here could find it a welcome relief
from the increasingly formulaic animated offerings of late-'90s
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Japan of the distant past and based on Japanese folklore,
it's the story of a war between the elements of civilization and
the endangered spirit of nature, whose various animal minions are
struggling to fight back the encroachments of man.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is a young prince (Billy Crudup) who, in the process of
slaying one of these creatures _ a demon wart hog _ receives a
wound that quickly turns into a strange cancerous growth that
appears to be slowly spreading over his whole body.
</P>
<P>
   To save his life, a wise village matriarch sends him on a quest:
to journey deep into the war zone _ the imperiled western forest _
to find the ``Great God of the Forest'' who alone understands the
mystery of this curse, and can perhaps lift it.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the hero is thrown headlong into the middle of
the war, and between the conflicting ambitions of a ruthless
dowager (Minnie Driver) representing human ``progress,'' a
treacherous monk (Billy Bob Thornton) out to line his own pockets,
and an environmentally radical young woman raised by wolves, the
Princess Mononoke (Claire Danes).
</P>
<P>
   In outline, it sounds like a kid's movie, but it's definitely
not. For one thing, it's realistically violent, filled with
decapitations, mutilations and spurting blood. And, while its
animation (mostly hand-drawn) is stunning, it's also moody, and
often upsetting, evoking the harshness of humanity as often as it
does the soft beauty of nature.
</P>
<P>
   The script is also filled with philosophical ambiguity and a
surprising complexity of character (so it's never very easy to tell
the bad guys from the good guys). And it makes its thematic point _
the need to strike a balance between the forces of man and nature _
in such a thoughtful, low-key way that kids could miss it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for older teens and grown-ups, ``Princess Mononoke''
makes an exhilarating and uniquely entertaining mystical adventure
_ one that creates its own magical world so effectively that it
just might well be the long-expected hit that will turn on the U.S.
mass audience to the glories of Japanese animation.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Mononoke. Directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki.
English language adaptation by Neil Gaiman. Voices: Billy Crudup,
Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton. Miramax. 135
minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.

WHAT A DRAG: SAN FRANCISCO'S FINOCCHIO'S TO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news 
 file)  
 By JESSE HAMLIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ A San Francisco landmark is about to pack it
in _ wigs, falsies and all.
</P>
<P>
   Finocchio's, the world-famous Broadway nightclub where female
impersonators have strutted their campy stuff since 1936, is
folding November 27.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a big rent increase and a dwindling audience for
old-style cross-dressing entertainment, the club's owner, Eve
Finocchio, is calling it quits. Wherever he is, the late, legendary
drag star Charles Pierce, the king of queenly impersonators, must
be weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do it, but we have no choice,'' said
Finocchio, whose husband, Joe, created the club at 506 Broadway in
the city's North Beach neighborhood. That's where countless locals
and tourists first saw men in spangled dresses and heels, singing,
dancing and cracking lusty jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My landlord upped the rent from $4,000 to $6,000,'' Finocchio
said, ``and we have to take care of the plumbing, too. You have to
collect an awful lot of money to meet the rent and pay your bills,
and we can't do it. I don't feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's landlord, Peter Mar, said: ``She's been at $4,000 a
month for 15 years. That's 8,000 square feet. You tell me where on
Broadway you can find (space) for about 75 cents a foot. I think
it's a more than reasonable increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the famed North Beach poet and
bookseller, summed up his feelings in three words: ``What a drag.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction was shared by Enrico Banducci, the legendary
impresario who for many years owned the Broadway cafe that bears
his name downstairs from Finocchio's. ``I'm sorry to see it go,''
he said. ``When you say Finocchio's, people think San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mark McLeod, co-owner of the current version of Enrico's:
``It's the loss of a venue with a wonderful tradition and sense of
quality, in contrast to a lot of the sleazy stuff on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Men in drag are commonplace in San Francisco these days. But
they still had the power to shock and delight when Joe Finocchio
began putting them in the spotlight 63 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian immigrant who worked in his father's San Francisco
speakeasy during Prohibition, Finocchio was inspired to focus on
female impersonation while running his own Stockton Street
speakeasy in the late '20s. A well-oiled customer got up and sang
in a dazzling style that sounded exactly like Sophie Tucker. The
crowd ate it up, and Finocchio saw his future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite San Francisco's tradition of bawdy entertainment,
Finocchio ran into resistance from the police when he opened his
Broadway club. The joint was raided, and he was arrested in July
1936 for ``keeping a disorderly house and selling liquor after 2
a.m.,'' according to The Chronicle, whose reporter noted that the
bust occurred at 1:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops, they objected,'' Finocchio recalled in a 1970s
interview. ``I had to fight a little bit of trouble, but then they
told me if you run the place straight everything would be fine.
They don't want the entertainers to mingle around with the
customers. I promised to run it like a regular theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a wide range of female impersonators _ some
noteworthy, others just another guy in a dress _ paraded across
Finocchio's stage.
</P>
<P>
   They include such headliners as Lucien Phelps, the Sophie Tucker
expert who starred for 27 years. He was one of many Finocchio
performers who was straight, a married man with children.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular act was Don McLean, otherwise known as Lori
Shannon, the 6-foot-5 comic who became nationally known after
playing Archie Bunker's drag queen friend on ``All in the Family.''
Appearing in a wig, heavy mascara and a tight dress, McLean would
tickle the tourists with such one-liners as, ``Welcome to Boys Town
_ I'm Father Flanagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The club was a gold mine for years, with celebrities such as Bob
Hope and Tallulah Bankhead making the scene and Gray Line tour
buses pulling up out front and disgorging tourists night after
night.
</P>
<P>
   But tour buses no longer stop there on a regular basis, and five
years ago Eve Finocchio, who took over the business when her
husband died in 1986, cut down to three nights a week: Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business was good,'' she said, ``but then one thing or another
started coming up, and people just weren't interested in going out
to see a show. I don't know whether it was our kind of show or
what, but they're content to rent a movie and stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Finocchio has no special plans for closing night, except to
present the current crop of performers, among them a Madonna
impersonator, a guy who does Whitney Houston and a chap named
Alejandro Cruz, who does a Barbie doll bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel terrible (the club is closing) because this is an
institution,'' Finocchio said. ``Joe felt he was giving the
customer something different. It was all clean entertainment,
nothing to be ashamed of. People weren't sure what they were going
to get when they came in, but they went out laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others in town, she feels bad. ``I can't imagine
Finocchio's not being in San Francisco, but honey, that's the way
it goes.''

quality, in contrast to a lot of the sleazy stuff on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Men in drag are commonplace in San Francisco these days. But
they still had the power to shock and delight when Joe Finocchio
began putting them in the spotlight 63 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian immigrant who worked in his father's San Francisco
speakeasy during Prohibition, Finocchio was inspired to focus on
female impersonation while running his own Stockton Street
speakeasy in the late '20s. A well-oiled customer got up and sang
in a dazzling style that sounded exactly like Sophie Tucker. The
crowd ate it up, and Finocchio saw his future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite San Francisco's tradition of bawdy entertainment,
Finocchio ran into resistance from the police when he opened his
Broadway club. The joint was raided, and he was arrested in July
1936 for ``keeping a disorderly house and selling liquor after 2
a.m.,'' according to The Chronicle, whose reporter noted that the
bust occurred at 1:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops, they objected,'' Finocchio recalled in a 1970s
interview. ``I had to fight a little bit of trouble, but then they
told me if you run the place straight everything would be fine.
They don't want the entertainers to mingle around with the
customers. I promised to run it like a regular theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a wide range of female impersonators _ some
noteworthy, others just another guy in a dress _ paraded across
Finocchio's stage.
</P>
<P>
   They include such headliners as Lucien Phelps, the Sophie Tucker
expert who starred for 27 years. He was one of many Finocchio
performers who was straight, a married man with children.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular act was Don McLean, otherwise known as Lori
Shannon, the 6-foot-5 comic who became nationally known after
playing Archie Bunker's drag queen friend on ``All in the Family.''
Appearing in a wig, heavy mascara and a tight dress, McLean would
tickle the tourists with such one-liners as, ``Welcome to Boys Town
_ I'm Father Flanagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The club was a gold mine for years, with celebrities such as Bob
Hope and Tallulah Bankhead making the scene and Gray Line tour
buses pulling up out front and disgorging tourists night after
night.
</P>
<P>
   But tour buses no longer stop there on a regular basis, and five
years ago Eve Finocchio, who took over the business when her
husband died in 1986, cut down to three nights a week: Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business was good,'' she said, ``but then one thing or another
started coming up, and people just weren't interested in going out
to see a show. I don't know whether it was our kind of show or
what, but they're content to rent a movie and stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Finocchio has no special plans for closing night, except to
present the current crop of performers, among them a Madonna
impersonator, a guy who does Whitney Houston and a chap named
Alejandro Cruz, who does a Barbie doll bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel terrible (the club is closing) because this is an
institution,'' Finocchio said. ``Joe felt he was giving the
customer something different. It was all clean entertainment,
nothing to be ashamed of. People weren't sure what they were going
to get when they came in, but they went out laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others in town, she feels bad. ``I can't imagine
Finocchio's not being in San Francisco, but honey, that's the way
it goes.''

ASTEROID NAMED AFTER FORMER CAL CHANCELLOR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese astronomers have named an asteroid after Chan-Lin Tien,
the former chancellor at the University of California at Berkeley,
telling him they hope it will ``shine forever in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the countless thousands of asteroids, most of which
circle the sun between the orbits of Mars and Venus, some 7,000
have been named for scientists, mythological figures or historical
characters.
</P>
<P>
   But only two have been named for Berkeley leaders _ Tien and the
late Nobel laureate Glenn T. Seaborg.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers at the Zi Jin (Purple Gold) Mountain Observatory
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered the asteroid more
than 20 years ago. But before Tien's name could become official,
the precise orbit of the rocky object had to be calculated, and
then the Chinese scientists had to submit their proposed name to
the astronomical bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The First International Astronomical Union's Small Bodies Names
Commission had to approve the name, and then the union's Minor
Planet Commission had to agree.
</P>
<P>
   So now the asteroid, which until now bore only the boring
designation of 3643, is officially known as Tienchanglin, the
Chinese version of Tien's name. The Chinese did not give the
dimensions of their newfound asteroid, but the Zi Jin observatory
staff spotted it in their telescope and tracked it precisely
through two orbits around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Like all its thousands of brethren, Tienchanglin is little more
than a large rocky lump, probably pitted with scars from the
impacts of even smaller asteroids, and irregularly shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Most such asteroids, or dwarf worlds, as they're sometimes
called, range from boulder size to several miles across. The
largest of all is Ceres, about 650 miles in rough diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Tien, who served as Berkeley's chancellor from 1990 to 1997, is
both a mechanical engineer and a physicist, and he has held
honorary research posts in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, where he
was born.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese astronomers said they wanted to honor him as a
``world-renowned educator and thermophysicist'' who has played an
important role in fostering scientific exchanges with Chinese
researchers.

`THE BACHELOR' PROPOSES TO A DUMBED-DOWN AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an innocuous waste-of-time called ``The Bachelor,'' Chris
O'Donnell plays an immature San Francisco man who suddenly finds he
has one day to get married in order to fulfill the first condition
of his grandfather's will and inherit a hundred million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   He's actually already in love with his long-time girlfriend
(Renee Zellweger), but the insensitive goof somehow managed to put
his proposal in such crude scatological terms (``it's time to s--t
or get off the potty'', he tells her over a candle-lit dinner) that
she now wants nothing to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   So he has to run around the city with a long-suffering priest
(James Cromwell) in tow, asking one unsuitable ex-girlfriend after
another (10 in all, including Brooke Shields in a cameo) to be his
bride. When, despite the massive financial incentive, no one is
interested, he's forced to even more desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   If this situation sounds familiar, it may be because the film is
a remake of ``Seven Chances,'' the 1925 Buster Keaton comedy that
is one of the masterpieces of the Silent Era. (I still think the
most laughter I've ever heard in a movie theater was at the Seattle
International Film Festival's revival of the film several years
ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, the spectacularly uninspired team of writer Steve
Cohen and director Gary Sinyor have junked up the premise and
turned it into such an incorrigibly low-brow and juvenile affair
that _ if you know and love the old Keaton classic _ it finally
becomes downright painful to endure.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell also executive produced the film, so it's designed to
be his personal vehicle. The camera is rarely off his clean-cut,
baby face with its perpetual vacant stare. But even his mother is
likely to recoil at some of his stumbling attempts at comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Zellweger, who is usually above things like this, is almost as
incompetent. She spends the movie alternately breaking into giggles
or over-pouting.
</P>
<P>
   The Bachelor. Directed by Gary Sinyor. Written by Steve Cohen.
Cast: Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger, Ed Asner, Hal Holbrook,
Peter Ustinov. New Line Cinema. 101 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
language and sexual references.

`SOME FISH CAN FLY': TO WHAT GREAT LENGTHS TRUE LOVE WILL TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kevin meets Nora, she's still a virgin. So when she says
she has slept with another man, she means exactly that: slept.
</P>
<P>
   Given genuine life by the dimpled enchantress Nancy St. Alban,
Nora makes palpable the bittersweet love at the honest heart of
``Some Fish Can Fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kane Pappas' first film tells a story of true love beset
by obstacles, a tale linked to a satirical account of the travails
of a young filmmaker trying to put that story on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   So, while recapitulating the 10-year tale of Kevin (Kevin
Causey) and Nora, ``Some Fish Can Fly'' busies itself with poking
barbed fun at the business of raising money, at meddling,
inconstant producers and at actors with inflated egos.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in Pappas' satire of cinema don't always behave
logically, but Nora and Kevin are characters that ring with truth,
and the filmmaker is at his clear-eyed, level-headed best in
following their affair to its credible conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin and Nora meet on a blind date, and while his first impulse
is to dump her he realizes before long that he has met the love of
his life. And so does she.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that Nora comes from Cork City, Ireland, and
doesn't believe she could ever live in the United States. And Kevin
the aspiring filmmaker, being a true New Yorker, can't imagine life
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they become engaged. But when Nora returns home,
love's path grows ever steeper and more perilous. Kevin flies to
Ireland, where Nora's parents refuse to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   Nora says she will come to New York, but delay follows delay.
Kevin's patience wears thin. His disappointment turns to anger. He
grows vulnerable to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Time is passing. Life is moving on and growing more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In telling his love story with the considerable help of the
charming Ms. St. Alban, it is Pappas' achievement to determine that
on the map of love between Cork and New York, there is no
Hollywood. &QL;

`BONE COLLECTOR': A TAXI RIDE TO TORTURE PROVOKES A CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since movies keep pushing the envelope of the acceptably
gruesome, even the nastiest sights glimpsed in Phillip Noyce's
preposterous thriller ``Bone Collector'' should strike jaded
moviegoers (those who relished ``Seven,'' for instance) as ho-hum
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   A woman found shackled in the bowels of New York and cooked
alive by scalding steam resembles a giant oozing radish. A young
man, also held underground in shackles, is discovered covered with
squirming rats that, when dispersed by a gunshot, reveal his
greedily picked-over body.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the film, during a life-and-death tussle, one
character sinks his teeth into the jugular of his attacker and
emerges looking like a vampire with unusually sloppy table manners.
</P>
<P>
   These unsettling moments have become par for the course in a
modern horror thriller. And ``The Bone Collector,'' which stars
Denzel Washington as a brilliant forensic detective tracking down a
serial killer who leaves elaborate clues near his victims' bodies,
is an efficient purveyor of such stock genre jolts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to corpses and gushing veins, those jolts include
the usual false alarms: harsh musical clangs, slowly turning
doorknobs and menacing shadows. There is even one glowering,
character whom the movie blatantly manipulates us into assuming is
the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   The killer meets his victims in a way that should tap into a
paranoid New Yorker's worst nightmares. He picks them up in a taxi,
at the airport or Grand Central Terminal, locks them in his car and
speeds off into the middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Most find themselves strung up in deserted turn-of-the-century
slaughterhouses and abandoned subway stations that resemble
medieval torture chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is nothing remotely believable about this
drawn-out cat-and-mouse game of a movie crossed with a whodunit,
that's almost the point. ``The Bone Collector,'' adapted from a
novel by Jeffery Deaver, is a cinematic game that might be called
Urban Creep Show, New York-style, and its rules are comfortably
predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   We can be pretty sure that the hero, Lincoln Rhyme (Washington),
a detective who has been a quadriplegic for four years and suffers
from seizures, any of which could reduce him to a vegetative state,
will outwit the demon killer.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick is that Lincoln can solve the case without budging
from bed. Using a computer and an illuminated viewing screen to
pore over the evidence, he is able to make impossible,
lightning-quick determinations about where the next victim is
likely to found.
</P>
<P>
   Communicating by cell phone with Amelia Donaghy (Angelina
Jolie), a beautiful young police officer (and former model) whom he
has drafted as his assistant, he instructs her on what to look for
at the crime scene and how to handle the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Lincoln is a piece of cake for Washington, who
departs from his customary Boy Scout mode to display matching
streaks of imperiousness and cunning. The film revels in close-ups
of Washington's handsome face, whose glinting eyes and dazzling
teeth do a seductive duet.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is even more enamored of Ms. Jolie, with her
impossibly sensual lips and eyes that brim with a soft melting
fire. In sheer smoldering screen charisma, Ms. Jolie has every
other young Hollywood actress beat hands down. Whether she can
really act remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lincoln is a quadriplegic, the film suggests that there
is little hope of a sexual relationship between him and Amelia. But
in the same way that it delivers jarring false alarms, the movie
suggests an unacknowledged erotic heat between its stars. Unlike so
many other screen couples nowadays, these two have chemistry.
</P>
<P>

MOVE OVER, MONKEES _ MEET S CLUB 7 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They sing. They dance. They try to act. And they're boffo in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   S Club 7 will now try to duplicate its ``tweener'' success in
the United States, with the arrival of ``S Club 7 in Miami'' on
cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   From Simon Fuller, the promoter who also created the Spice
Girls, the pre-fab singing group is squarely aimed at kids in the
7-to-12 range. Their ``Monkees''-style TV series, which took five
weeks to become the top-rated kids' show in Britain, launches
Saturday on the Fox Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven members of S Club 7 _ four girls and three boys.
They range in age from 17 to 22, but the attitude is younger.
They're all genetically blessed, and exude a sort of squeaky-clean
sexiness.
</P>
<P>
   The show itself is helium-weight television. It's an
unchallenging mixture of attractive stars, Florida sunshine, bright
colors, music, dance, banal comedy and self-conscious
image-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``S Club 7 in Miami'' owes something to MTV's ``Real World'' as
well as to the Monkees. The story line is that the British members
of the group have been booked as entertainers in a Miami hotel.
Aspiring to stardom, they arrive to find that the Florida Paradise
Hotel is something of a dump and its comically unscrupulous manager
(Alfie Wise) expects the group to clean the pool and wash windows.
</P>
<P>
   But by golly, these kids have spunk. Some of us older folks
might recall Lou Grant's heartfelt proclamation: ``I hate spunk!''
Still, one can imagine American kids deciding that, yeah, Bradley's
the funniest S Club 7 guy, and maybe Paul is the coolest, and
Hannah has the cutest smile.
</P>
<P>
   You know, your basic Ginger Spice vs. Posh Spice argument.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the show's climb to the top after its premiere on the
BBC last April, the group's first single _ ``Bring It All Back,''
and it sounds much like the old Jackson 5 _ topped the English
music charts in its first week of release. The next single hit No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, considering that there's no visible evidence that
anyone in S Club 7 plays a musical instrument. The choreography is
slick, though.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, of course, there's no telling whether American
kids will embrace S Club 7. Fox Family Channel isn't the most
conspicuous television venue, and the group's accents could be
encumbrances.
</P>
<P>
   But if Fuller, the show's co-executive producer, comes close to
the lightning he struck with the Spice Girls, he'll be back in pay
dirt. He said in a rare interview recently that the Spice Girls had
sold 35 million albums worldwide en route to becoming an $800
million phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   An S Club 7 movie is a possibility, Fuller said. With the
group's high-energy performances and infectious optimism, he added,
S Club 7 might even come to stand for more than mere entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't just want to come back with another pop group,
because that would be predictable,'' Fuller said. ``Hopefully,
they're going to set a new precedent for what is expected of
entertainers ... The world needs altruism, and they're young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think older kids will like them because they're cool and
they're talented. And I think young kids will like them because
they want to be them.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``older'' kids, he probably means as old as an overripe 14.
After that, there's only the Backstreet Boys and geezerhood.

`THE BACHELOR': HEY, BABY, WANT TO MARRY A GUY WORTH $100
MILLION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

 By STEPHEN HOLDEN

<P>
   Unmarried men are like wild mustangs charging lustily through
life in a continual search for new varieties of sweet, succulent
grasses, announces Jimmy (Chris O'Donnell), the smirking narrator
of ``The Bachelor,'' a crude, frantic farce satirizing yuppie
mating rituals in the age of the cigar bar.
</P>
<P>
   Thin-lipped and shifty-eyed, with too-slick hair and a blandly
handsome baby face that is just beginning to get a little puffy,
O'Donnell suggests a swinging '90s variant of what used to be
called a ``button-down man.'' He strongly resembles the young Bob
Newhart, who in the early 1960s recorded a series of best-selling
comedy albums from the perspective of ``the button-down mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's rampaging bachelor life is threatened when he realizes
that he can no longer delay popping the question to his fun-loving,
curly-haired sweetheart, Anne (Renee Zellweger), whom he has been
dating for three years. But when the big moment presents itself
over Champagne in a fancy restaurant while a singer aggressively
shouts ``The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face'' over Jimmy's
shoulder, his words come out wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win,'' he says to Anne with a sneaky grin as he pulls out
an engagement ring. Anne, deeply stung by his not-so-latent
hostility, storms off in a fury.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zellweger's Anne is a likable variation of what threatens to
become her stock screen persona: a stubborn, quirky tomboyish
ingenue who beneath her defensive exterior turns out to be a
blubberingly sentimental old-fashioned girl.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jimmy's crusty grandfather dies, leaving a will
stipulating that his grandson must marry by 30 or forfeit a $100
million inheritance, Jimmy is thrown into a panic because that
birthday turns out to be just 27 hours away. But Anne, still
smarting, can't be budged from her refusal.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy, armed with bouquets and riding around San Francisco in a
limousine with a minister (James Cromwell) ready to perform a
wedding ceremony at a moment's notice, bombards one ex-girlfriend
after another with a last-minute proposal and is turned down.
</P>
<P>
   In the comedy's climactic scenes, a classified newspaper ad
placed by Jimmy's pal Marco (Artie Lange) draws a stampeding horde
of prospective brides, all wearing white, to the church. As they
chase Jimmy through the streets of San Francisco, they become the
female equivalent of Jimmy's wild mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor,'' directed by Gary Sinyor from a screenplay by
Steve Cohen, was adapted from a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, ``Seven
Chances.'' Once the movie gets going it builds up some of the zip
of a silent-film comedy, although its satire is too broad to carry
much of a sting.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally the screenplay succeeds in slipping in a
zinger. The bridal mob that briefly corners Jimmy in the church
turns out to be a savvy multicultural cross section of San
Franciscan women. Pelting Jimmy with questions about his
preferences, they sneeringly challenge him to deny that what he
wants is a ``skinny blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for one woman whom Jimmy remembers as being ``too
clinging,'' his exes are a spunky self-determined bunch who don't
fall into a swoon at the prospect of being legally joined to $100
million. They include a stockbroker, a chef, a narcissistic opera
singer (Mariah Carey) and an icy socialite (Brooke Shields). Most
are caricatures of late-'90s workaholics.
</P>
<P>
   For all its obsession with marriage, bachelorhood, man chasing
and ``breeding'' (as one character puts it), ``The Bachelor'' isn't
the least bit sexy. Drenched in an atmosphere of materialistic
frenzy, the movie is only excited about one thing: going for the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES

`LAST NIGHT': STRANDED IN THE CITY, ON DOOMSDAY TO BOOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The teasing question that is the hook of Don McKellar's somber
thumbsucker of a film, ``Last Night,'' is one that most of us have
probably asked ourselves: What would you do if you knew for certain
that tonight was your last night on earth?
</P>
<P>
   As it methodically links together a group of quirky Canadians
living in Toronto during the final hours before an unidentified
cataclysm, ``Last Night'' offers itself as a smart, stiff-upper-lip
alternative to a movie like ``Armageddon.'' There is not even the
hint of a superhero waiting in the wings to rush in and save the
day with his space-age razzle-dazzle and macho wisecracks. Everyone
in the film, even those who are rampaging in the streets, seems
resigned. In downtown Toronto, thousands have gathered for a New
Year's Eve-like ``countdown'' to the end that, oddly enough, is
scheduled to come precisely at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's simply no telling how the majority of us
would react to the news that the world would suddenly be vaporized
at a particular moment. But my guess is that there would be a lot
mial of the inevitable, not to mention more chaos, craziness
and sheer blinding panic, than the movie imagines. The film wisely
doesn't try to come up with a scientific explanation for the
cataclysm. Instead of tracking every detail of the disaster, which
is what radio and television do with hurricanes and earthquakes,
the media treat the end of the world like New Year's Eve. One radio
station is playing ``the 500 greatest all-time hits, a mind-numbing
compendium of middle-of-the-road schlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' focuses on two strangers who ultimately find
themselves alone together in the final moments. Sandra Oh,
best-known for playing Rita, Robert Wuhl's cheeky assistant in the
HBO comedy series, ``Arliss,'' is Sandra, a young woman stranded in
the city after her car is vandalized while she is shopping. Sandra
is desperately trying to contact her husband, Duncan (David
Cronenberg), a gas company executive who has spent his final day at
work leaving reassuring telephone messages on his customers'
answering machines.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar, the director, plays Patrick, a despondent young man so
embittered by the recent death of a woman he loved that he walks
around in an angry sulk. Patrick, who has chosen not to spend the
evening with his family (his mother has made ``Christmas dinner''),
reluctantly helps Sandra try and get a ride home. In the movie's
most touching scene, these two strangers strive for an instant
last-minute intimacy by pouring out their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Flashes of sardonic humor run through the movie, especially in
its scenes of Patrick's best friend, Craig (Callum Keith Rennie),
who has chosen in his final hours to try and complete a checklist
of sexual fantasies that includes sleeping with a black woman, then
with his old French teacher (Genevieve Bujold), and then with
Patrick. In the movie's wittiest moment, Patrick arrives at Craig's
apartment as the teacher (the same one Patrick had in high school)
is leaving, and they spontaneously revert to a teacher-student
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' is the directorial debut of McKellar, who
collaborated with Francois Girard on the screenplays of
``Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould'' and ``The Red
Violin.'' In its eerie glumness, the movie looks back to 1950s Cold
War horror films like ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in which
you sensed a world emptying of people as it transformed into a
nuclear wasteland. Softening that apocalyptic undercurrent is a
counter-strain of quiet nobility that recalls another, more benign
end-of-the-world '50s movie, ``On the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Last Night'' eschews sentimentality, the situation is
so extreme that there is ultimately no avoiding it. But the intense
performances of Ms. Oh, whose face and body seem pinched with an
acute, aching anxiety, and of McKellar, who almost visibly shrinks
into the cocoon of Patrick's despair, keep the suds from billowing
into more than a few discreet bubbles. &QL;

AMERICANS PLAY WITH THEIR FOOD IN THE '80S AND NEW COKE COMES AND
GOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Alice Waters wrought in Berkeley, Calif., in 1971, exploded
across the country the following decade.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by an economy that was ethically out of control, America
was turning dining into theater.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s were chock-full of the likes of junk-bond kings
Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky. John Z. DeLorean was acquitted on
charges of smuggling cocaine to help his financially strapped
automobile company. The Donald and Ivana Trump were living the high
life in New York City. Across the way, Leona Helmsley was
browbeating her staff. On the other coast, Zsa Zsa Gabor was
slapping Beverly Hills' finest.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan's presence in the White House made for a new set of
White House china and more formal entertainment than the barbecues
of the Carter era.
</P>
<P>
   The living was high, and lots of young chefs were having no
trouble finding backers for restaurants that would showcase the new
American cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, modern Southwestern food emerged from the work of
Stephan Pyles, Dean Fearing, Robert Del Grande and Anne Greer. Mark
Miller, an alumnus of Chez Panisse, took his show to Santa Fe and
opened the Coyote Cafe, updating New Mexico classics. Jasper White
was working with New England ingredients in Boston. Nouvelle
American was the specialty of Michael Girard in California.
</P>
<P>
   Those chefs were helped in their quest by a burgeoning group of
boutique producers _ from cheese makers to specialty vegetable
farmers to operations such as Texas' Broken Arrow Ranch, which
raises game animals.
</P>
<P>
   And American food was getting raves beyond U.S. borders, too. By
1988, McDonald's had established itself as one of France's most
popular fast-food operators. Burger King opened a location in
Dresden, East Germany, as the Berlin Wall came down.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market crash of 1987 took a lot of air out of the
social balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Good spirits were further dampened by American Medical
Association recommendations that blood serum cholesterol levels
shouldn't exceed 200 milligrams. Eggs were bad, fried foods were
bad, caffeine was bad, beef was bad, butter was bad. Grocery stores
nationwide experienced runs on oat bran by consumers pumping
themselves full of fiber to flush their systems of cholesterol.

`PORTRAITS CHINOIS': SELF-CENTERED, STYLISH PARISIANS IN PURSUIT OF
AMOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a single characteristic shared by the circle of
friends and acquaintances who are the focus of ``Portraits
Chinois,'' it is near total self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   The characters created by Martine Dugowson, who wrote and
directed the film (its French title is translated as ``Shadow
Play''), are well cast, well directed and skillfully acted, if not
a particularly admirable lot. While their problems in finding love
and tranquillity have a certain universality, little grandeur
surrounds their quest.
</P>
<P>
   These people are a stylish and talented group of Parisians whose
careers center on film and fashion, but whose yearnings for love
determine their behavior. This prompts plenty of anguish, betrayal
and jealousy, but not an enormous amount of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   So fixed is their self-focus that toward the latter part of the
film, which opens Friday in Manhattan, it comes as something of a
surprise when their continual self-centrality abates long enough to
allow an argument over an attempt to punish a French World War II
collaborator. Most of those present find excuses to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the cast is Helena Bonham Carter as Ada, an English-born
designer working for the haute couture house of Rene Sandre
(Jean-Claude Brialy) and living with Paul (Jean-Philippe Ecoffey).
Paul is one half of a screenwriting team that includes Guido
(Sergio Castellitto), whose romantic life swiftly leaves him in
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and Guido are preparing a script for Alphonse (Miko
Manojlovic), a producer known as General Custer for the sexual
fantasy he plays out with the women in his office, and for Yves
(Yvan Attal), a director married to Nina (Marie Trintignant).
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the circle are Lise (Romaine Bohringer), a young
designer who fancies herself in love with Paul, and Emma (Elsa
Zylberstein), an aspiring cabaret artist whose materialism exceeds
her means.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, relationships break, strain, form and reform, and
along the way each learns something about the possibilities of
life. And while the price may be painful, in this little film, it
is never too high.

   VENISON CHILI WITH TEXAS GOAT CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds venison, well-trimmed of fat, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons ancho chile puree, see Note
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chipotle chile puree
</P>
<P>
   4 medium tomatoes, blanched, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground toasted cumin seed
</P>
<P>
   1 quart brown veal stock or water
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces fresh goat cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Note: To make chile puree, wash and thoroughly dry the dried
chiles. Cut off stems and slit open the dried chiles with a knife
and remove the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 450 degrees, place chiles in single layer on a
baking sheet and roast for 1 minute. Transfer chiles to a bowl,
cover with warm water and keep chiles submerged for 30 minutes to
rehydrate. Strain chiles, reserving liquid, and place chiles in a
blender. Puree the chiles, adding just enough of the soaking liquid
to make pureeing possible; you should have a thick paste. The puree
can be passed through a medium or fine strainer at this point, or
strained in the sauce or final product.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in heavy pan and add venison, garlic and onion. Cook
over medium heat until meat has browned, about 15 minutes. Add
chile puree, tomatoes and cumin seed and cook for 15 minutes
longer. Add stock or water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally, or until meat
is perfectly tender and chili is quite thick. Season with salt and
pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle about 1 cup per serving into individual bowls and garnish
with goat cheese. Blue-corn skillet sticks or jalapeno corn bread
would be a good accompaniment.

 SHOW US THE MONEY: High-stakes quiz shows take on
high-priced  miniseries during sweeps  
 (Eds.: Check local listings for times and channels.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The money's up on the screen in sweeps months, but this time
some loose change will find its way into the public's pockets.
</P>
<P>
   That's loose change in the form of contestants' winnings on quiz
shows, which are staging a TV comeback. Two quiz shows, including
ABC's trendsetting ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' are part of
the November sweeps heat on the networks.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the usual battery of special miniseries and movies.
This Sunday, in fact, figures to be the most sizzling night of the
sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' will add to this Sunday's
sizzle, because that's when the August phenomenon makes its return,
with Regis Philbin back as host.
</P>
<P>
   The show's English producer, Michael Davies, says there have
been two changes to level public competition to get onto the
program.
</P>
<P>
   First, a new toll-free phone number _ (877) 258-5808 _ went into
operation Monday to screen prospective contestants.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the show used a 900 number in most states. But a free
800 number was available in nine states that prohibit or limit such
900 calls. The result was that those nine states provided a
disproportionate number of contestants. Now the routine is the same
for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Davies says the show got too many male contestants
because prospective players were rewarded for calling fastest and
most often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize our repeat callers were, on the whole, men who were
calling again and again and again,'' Davies said in a phone
interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he said, speed in making calls and answering
first-round telephone questions won't be a determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   Over two weeks in August, the show was a ratings blockbuster and
awarded $1.4 million in prize money. This time, it'll be on for 15
consecutive nights and face first-run competition rather than
reruns.
</P>
<P>
   One of its Thursday competitors will be Fox's ``Greed: The
Multi-Million Dollar Challenge.'' Antique TV personality Chuck
Woolery will host.
</P>
<P>
   (Sudden thought: Has anyone seen Chuck Woolery and Wink
Martindale together in the same place, at the same time? Did you
get their autographs?)
</P>
<P>
   Fox is being coy about ``Greed,'' refusing to divulge many
details. But it's scheduled to be on for three consecutive
Thursdays, and a lucky winner could, theoretically, take home as
much as $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant thing about ``Greed'' is that it'll begin with
contestants collaborating in teams. Then, in the next round, the
game becomes nastier as teammates can turn on one another.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Fox, I wouldn't rule out live ammo in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   The gentler proceedings this Sunday involve the first segment of
two-part miniseries on CBS and NBC and a musical remake on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``Shake, Rattle &AMP; Roll'' stars Brad Hawkins and Bonnie
Somerville as young musicians who embrace rock 'n' roll in the
1950s. Dana Delany, James Coburn, Frank Whaley and Kathy Baker have
supporting roles in the miniseries, which features vintage and
newly written music.
</P>
<P>
   NBC counters with ``The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns,'' a
fantasy miniseries enriched with special effects. Randy Quaid,
Whoopi Goldberg and Roger Daltrey head the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The other big entry on Sunday is ``Annie'' on ABC's ``The
Wonderful World of Disney.'' It's a remake of the Broadway musical,
starring Alicia Morton as Little Orphan Annie, Victor Garber as
Daddy Warbucks and Kathy Bates as the cruel Miss Hannigan.
</P>
<P>
   There's keen competition on other nights during the November
sweeps, right up through Thanksgiving, but nothing as tough as this
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's other November goodies include the inspirational movie
``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' produced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver and
her son Bobby Shriver, on November 14, and Ken Olin in the timely
thriller ``Y2K'' on November 21.
</P>
<P>
   In NBC series programming, Debbie Reynolds guest-stars again as
Grace's (Debra Messing) mother on the November 9 installment of
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' model Elle Macpherson guests on the November 11
episode of ``Friends'' and the pregnant Nurse Hathaway (Julianna
Margulies) goes into labor Thanksgiving night on ``ER.'' Twins, I
hear.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-part ``Aftershock: Earthquake in New York,'' on
November 14 and 16, CBS takes a bite out of the Big Apple. Charles
S. Dutton, Tom Skerritt and Lisa Nicole Carson star. Glenn Close
reprises an old role for CBS in ``Sarah, Plain and Tall: Winter's
End,'' on November 21. Julie Andrews and James Garner, who made
``Victor/Victoria'' and ``The Americanization of Emily'' together,
reunite for a love story called ``One Special Night'' on November
28.
</P>
<P>
   Among the CBS series developments are a three-episode love story
for Ted Danson on ``Becker,'' beginning Monday; late-night host
Craig Kilborn as an FBI agent on ``Martial Law'' this Saturday; and
a ``King of Queens''/``Everybody Loves Raymond'' crossover on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shania Twain has a CBS music special on Thanksgiving night, and
the next night Ricky Martin goes loco in his first music special,
taped in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has a movie about a TV show in ``Come on Get Happy: The
Partridge Family Story,'' on November 13. It'll be about the less
savory stories behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from ``Annie'' and ``Come on Get Happy,'' it's a light
month for original movies on ABC. Theatrical movies figure more
prominently: ``Dante's Peak'' on Saturday and ``Forrest Gump'' on
Thanksgiving are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Do we care that there are wedding plans on ``Boy Meets World''?
No? I'm guessing that Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick (Billy Campbell)
might possibly have sex on ``Once and Again,'' as they continue to
rifle the Kama Sutra. The big series event is the live broadcast of
``The Drew Carey Show'' _ performed live for each time zone _ next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'' is due to be repeated
Thanksgiving night on Fox, and Fox's other sweeps movies include
``Scream'' on November 23 and ``Jerry Maguire'' on December 1.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I hear they're planning to kill the dog on ``Party of
Five.'' For a couple of extra rating points, they'd probably cook
it and eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal looms in a special ``7th Heaven'' two-parter on the WB.
In the Monday and November 15 episodes, Mary (Jessica Biel) needs
the help of her family when she gets into deep trouble at school.
This is what happens when you chew gum in class. Kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are David Boreanaz and Sarah Michelle Gellar, also
known as Romeo and Type B. The stars of ``Angel'' and ``Buffy, the
Vampire Killer'' will pay visits to each other in a two-hour
crossover event November 28.
</P>
<P>
   I just know that UPN viewers will enjoy the ``Bikini Biker Beach
Bash'' on Monday night. Unpredictable events _ who knows, bikers in
bikinis? _ will be spread through the night in the form of
``interstitial'' filler between and within regular shows.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for UPN. No, wait. On December 1, Jason Alexander will
host ``Ultimate Trek: Star Trek's Greatest Moments.''
</P>
<P>
   A very special night of ``WWF Smackdown!'' is being planned for
Thanksgiving. And on November 23, Gary Busey will join his son,
regular cast member Jake Busey, on ``Shasta McNasty.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm practically weeping already. It's just the season, I guess.

THE FIGHT OVER 50: HOLLYWOOD'S ACTRESSES BATTLE A GRAY CEILING

entertainment column)

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Women throughout the world may face a glass ceiling which limits
their potential to succeed, but it's nothing compared to the ``gray
ceiling'' confronted by some of Hollywood's top actresses.
 &HT;    When an actress turns 40, says Melanie Griffith _ who is now 42
_ her chances for satisfying movie roles plummet. And by the time
she's 50 those chances are all but gone. Just ask such
Oscar-winning, ultra-talented but 50-something actresses as Meryl
Streep, Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange.
 &HT;    A few years ago Streep, who's now 50, very publicly slammed the
industry for paying leading men so much more than leading ladies.
Nowadays she's equally incensed over Hollywood's tendency to cast
young actresses even in roles which are based on real-life or
literary characters of 40 or more.
 &HT;    Oscar-winner Susan Sarandon, the 53-year-old star of ``Anywhere
But Here,'' opening Nov. 12, is also a vocal critic of Hollywood
for its shabby treatment of women. But Sarandon, who played the
older of the two pistol-packing female outlaws in the acclaimed
women's-rage drama ``Thelma and Louise'' (l991), actually has less
to complain about than most actresses _ she's come to personify the
strong, sexy older woman, a rare commodity in a Hollywood where
male stars can be seen as sexy into their 70s.
 &HT;    But it's the Spanish-born Antonio Banderas who has become an
unlikely crusader against what he perceives as a gross Hollywood
injustice. In fact, he's hopping mad because of the way filmland
treats older women _ particularly his wife, Griffith, whom he
directs in the current film, ``Crazy in Alabama.''
 &HT;    ``Hollywood is cruel to women over 40,'' he says. ``Melanie is
being offered only character or supporting roles. She's a glamorous
leading lady, but is suffering from the same fate as stars like
Jessica Lange.''
 &HT;    Banderas considers European cinema's attitudes toward older
women much healthier.
 &HT;    ``It's quite ridiculous,'' the Spanish actor/director notes.
``When women in European film pass their 40th or 50th birthdays,
they are not tossed on the rubbish heap. Look at stars like Simone
Signoret from France and Anna Magnani from Italy _ when they died,
they were still huge box-office draws in their country.''
 &HT;    American stars such as Streep, Lange and Diane Keaton _ all of
whom turned 50 in 1999 _ as well as Sarandon, 52-year-old Glenn
Close and 54-year-old Goldie Hawn, are not so lucky. It's all the
more ironic, Banderas says, because male actors face no such
pigeonholing.
 &HT;    ``Look at Harrison Ford or Sean Connery,'' the 38-year-old
Banderas says, citing two stars who are, respectively, 57 and 69.
``I romanced Catherine Zeta Jones, who is in her late 20s, in `The
Mask of Zorro' (l998). Then along came Sean in `Entrapment' (l999),
and he was romancing her, too, at his age. It's ridiculous.''
 &HT;    But a double standard has been alive and well in Hollywood for
some time: What's no problem for men is the kiss of death for
women. It's not uncommon for virtual senior citizens such as Woody
Allen, Warren Beatty and Clint Eastwood to get the girl, even
though they may be 30 years older than their co-stars.
 &HT;    On the rare occasion that someone comes up with a script that
calls for the reverse _ younger man and older woman _ Hollywood is
predictably appalled.
 &HT;    ``That's OK for the French,'' a Hollywood executive says, ``but
in America we think it's pretty disgusting.''
 &HT;    Asked about this inequity, Hollywood leading men frequently get
defensive. When Ford made ``Six Days and Seven Nights'' (l997) with
20-something Anne Heche as his romantic interest, he airily
dismissed questions about their three-decade age gap.
 &HT;    ``Every time I see somebody commenting on the difference between
an actor's and actress's ages,'' he said, ``I say to myself, `Hey,
look around at life.' This frequently happens. So I don't have a
problem with it.
 &HT;    ``If it was an older woman and a younger man,'' he added, ``that
wouldn't be too much like real life. Obviously there are not that
many relationships of that nature _ it doesn't happen that
frequently.''
 &HT;    Streep, arguably America's greatest living actress, has seen her
career opportunities dwindle as she's aged. She won her latest
role, in ``Music of the Heart,'' only after Madonna _ far less
accomplished an actress, but more than a decade younger _ dropped
out of the film.
 &HT;    ``I was grateful Madonna turned it down,'' Streep says,
``because it was one of those rare roles for a woman my age: The
character is really confident, strong and determined _ all the
things we want to play.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately,'' she adds, ``what's usually available for me
these days, particularly in a comedy, are witchy, demonized and
grotesque women. The only good characters for women over 45 are
secondary roles in dramas.''
 &HT;    In self-defense, stars such as Close, Barbra Streisand and Bette
Midler have formed their own production companies, letting them
tailor movie projects for themselves and exert control over the
roles they play.
 &HT;    Close, who was Michael Douglas' lover-turned-stalker in ``Fatal
Attraction'' (l987) and is three years younger than the now-55
actor, no longer gets offered romantic leads, though Douglas was
cast opposite the 25-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow only last year.
 &HT;    ``Now most of what I'm offered is simply not right for me,'' she
says. ``I find it's essential to find my own parts.''
 &HT;    Since triumphing on Broadway as Norma Desmond, the aging
Hollywood star in ``Sunset Boulevard'' (1994), Close has been doing
mostly high-quality television, including CBS' ``Sarah Plain and
Tall: Winter's End,'' a sequel to her television movie ``Sarah
Plain and Tall'' (1991) that will air Nov. 21.
 &HT;    ``Now I only do films where I'm executive producer,'' Close
says. ``My newest is `The Ballad of Lucy Whipple,' and I've agreed
to star in a remake of `South Pacific' for television.''
 &HT;    Sarandon often works with her longtime companion, actor/director
Tim Robbins, who is 12 years her junior. She appears in his
upcoming ``Cradle Will Rock,'' and won an Oscar as a nun who tries
in vain to stop the execution of a convicted killer in Robbins'
``Dead Man Walking'' (l995).
 &HT;    ``After that film, all Hollywood ever saw me as was a somber
type,'' she recalls. ``I was suddenly very limited in my movie
choices _ producers no longer wanted me to be frivolous. That's why
I was thrilled to do `Anywhere But Here,' playing the mother of a
teen-ager (Natalie Portman) _ I got to wear fabulous, flashy
outfits, eyeliner and garish makeup again.
 &HT;    ``The horrible thing about the entertainment business,'' she
adds, ``and it's something I'm trying to make my children aware of,
is that instead of being judged on your personality or intelligence
or your heart, it's all about breasts and your teeth and your hair
and your age.''
 &HT;    After a moment, however, the actress _ who doesn't have it in
her to be downbeat for long _ brightens.
 &HT;    ``Mind you,'' she says, ``I don't have much to complain about.
My children are bright and healthy, I have a man that continues to
make me laugh _ and I get paid pretty well.''

TAOS' SPIRITS SPEAK TO WRITERS, ESPECIALLY THE OUTLAW VARIETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAOS, N.M. _ Some of the world's greatest writers have escaped
to Taos over the past century, searching for solitude, secrets in
the breeze or, perhaps, a decent medicine man unhassled by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The bards lay it on pretty thick when describing the Taos spell.
</P>
<P>
   D.H. Lawrence felt a ``shattering force'' that changed him
forever, then he set up a ranch sanctuary atop a Taos mountain
peak.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Waters saw a ``vision'' in a Taos washbowl while shaving,
then sat down to write ``The Man Who Killed the Deer.''
</P>
<P>
   C.G. Jung discovered God through a Pueblo Indian's eyes:
``Obviously all life came from the mountain,'' Jung mused.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's pure magic, intense goofiness or spirituality that
whacked these writers on the head, the Taos spell can't be denied.
</P>
<P>
   It has something to do with the convergence of desert,
mountains, purple skies, piney perfume, sage, wild flowers,
rambling ghosts and the beautiful, ubiquitous mud. It has something
to do with being so close to ancient mysteries tucked inside
underground chambers of the 1,000-year-old Taos Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   Dad and I fled to Taos recently to stalk some of the bards'
sacred places and, hopefully, to pick up a few ancient secrets. Our
only companions were dog-eared Rumi poems and writings of the
Southwest's best authors.
</P>
<P>
   Taos is overlooked as a literary hot spot. Better-known for its
ski runs and art scene, this puzzling little place in the Sangre de
Cristo mountains has also been a hideaway for outlaw novelists,
poets and playwrights who have stoked fury _ generally, by
championing nature, passion and the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawrence's novel ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' and his nude
paintings were banned in England, he and his works found exile in
Taos. When New York writer Mabel Dodge Luhan sought meaning outside
the Big Apple's socialite world, she fled to Taos and married a
Pueblo Indian. When wilderness prophet Edward Abbey was growing his
ornery roots, he took a job editing the Taos newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taos reflects the outlaw spirit of New Mexico,'' said Dad, a
Colorado poet who gives readings in Taos. So come here with a Clint
Eastwood squint and Ry Cooder blaring from the car speakers. It
helps set the outlaw mood.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was Lawrence's ranch atop Lobo Mountain. Dad
makes a good tour guide, as long as he keeps his eye on the road.
He has this habit of drifting into creative trances or flipping his
notebook over the steering wheel to jot down brilliant lines that
strike him.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration must have struck, because we almost missed the
entrance off U.S. 64 as Dad skidded into a roadside cloud of dust
and sagebrush. We got back on track and made the five-mile trek to
the ranch, which spans 160 acres, offering amazing slingshot views
into neighboring states. Lawrence spent a good part of the 1920s
here when he had tuberculosis, hosting friends, writing his St.
Mawr book and a lot of goose-bump-laden poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The grouchy caretaker pointed us toward his ashes, which rest in
a small white chapel at the top of the steepest point. Every week
or so, 10 to 30 devotees of Lawrence make pilgrimages here from
across the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for teaching me the proper way to eat a fig in
society,'' a Lawrence follower scribbled into the guest book.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, topped by a phoenix sculpture, is partly devoted
to the strange tug-of-war over his ashes. Lawrence's widow, Frieda,
wanted his remains stored in an urn. His literary muse, Mabel Dodge
Luhan, wanted them scattered. In a moment of triumph, Frieda dumped
the ashes into a wheelbarrow filled with wet cement and blurted,
``Now, let's see them steal this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence exalted Taos, and Taos still exalts Lawrence, perhaps
more than any other writer. The exception could be John Nichols,
author of a string of spirited novels such as the ``The Milagro
Beanfield War,'' ``The Nirvana Blues'' and ``On the Mesa.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nichols hasn't documented every tumbleweed in the Taos
valley, he's come close. His books, a mix of ruminations about this
wild territory and indictments of encroaching development, are
displayed here like tourist brochures.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Mesa'' is a richly descriptive ``New Mexico Walden''
that celebrates the giant desert plain west of Taos around the Rio
Grande Gorge. Salamanders, stock ponds, coyote tracks and the
exquisite bareness of it all get sacred treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, you can catch Nichols giving readings of his
works at the Cafe Tazza coffee shop. We just missed him, but we did
hear New Mexico poets Renee Gregorio and John Brandi howl some
passionate verse, luring wide-eared tourists off the sidewalks and
into the cafe's orange light.
</P>
<P>
   Caffe Tazza is a good place to take in the contemporary literary
scene. including poets and writers such as Peter Rabbit, a former
Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer who helped launch the Society of
the Muse of the Southwest and the Taos Poetry Circus, an annual
June gathering modeled after a heavyweight boxing match that ranks
among the nation's most popular poetry festivals.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Gregorio, who help found the now-defunct The Taos Review
literary journal when she lived here, says the Taos community
embraces writers in a nonjudgmental way. But the natural elements
scrub the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I noticed this past weekend was the light,'' she
said. ``I know, everyone says this, but it's really true ... all is
washed clean in that light, all is sharper. And that's seductive,
let's face it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, we poked our head into the La Fonda Hotel to check out
Lawrence's nude paintings. The oils were seized by London police in
1929, the same year ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was banned as
obscene. The paintings can be viewed for 3 bucks in a small room
behind the registration desk; we agreed that they're mostly just
silly and not especially compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to our Adobe Wall Motel, we wandered through the late
Mabel Dodge Luhan estate. Luhan is the Taos luminary who gets
credit for the genesis of Taos' literary scene. She came here in
1916 and hosted scores of renegade intellectuals, artists and
literary figures. It was Luhan who enticed Lawrence to come here.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on Morado Lane, the estate is a quiet, rambling 22-room
adobe Eden that greets visitors with towering birdhouses shaded by
cottonwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a hotel, where visitors can wander, knowingly nodding
their heads at the astonishing mountain views Lawrence blissed out
over. Even in the bathrooms, you're reminded of Lawrence's
presence; he painted flowers and birds on the walls and windows.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to identify all the writers and artists who've
found peace and inspiration at this estate or elsewhere around
Taos, but you can't forget Frances Crane, Frank O'Rourke, Thomas
Wolfe, Nancy Wood, Thornton Wilder, Max Evans, Georgia O'Keeffe and
Myron Brinig.
</P>
<P>
   Any inventory of literary haunts should include the Taos Pueblo,
a magnificent riddle of a communal village built around 1350 by the
Pueblo Indians. Home to one of our country's oldest Indian tribes,
it ranks among the pyramids of Egypt, the Taj Mahal and Vatican
City as a World Heritage Site.
</P>
<P>
   Six kivas, or underground ceremonial chambers, are off limits to
the public but have endured as a source of relentless spiritual
investigation by writers. As one story goes, when the mountain
peaks are shrouded in clouds, the Indians disappear inside them for
mysterious rites.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Pueblos were up to nagged at both Lawrence and the
Swiss psychologist Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence was obsessed with the Indians' beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Taos pueblo on some brilliant snowy morning and see the
white figure on the roof,'' Lawrence wrote. ``Or come riding
through the dusk on some windy evening, when the black skirts of
the silent women blow around the white wide boots, and you will
feel the old, old root of human consciousness still reaching down
to depths we know nothing of.''
</P>
<P>
   Jung, obsessed with the secrets, sought out Pueblo Chief Ochwiay
Biano during a visit around 1925. They had a deep talk atop one of
the Pueblo roofs.
</P>
<P>
   He later wrote: ``If for a moment, we put away all European
rationalism and transport ourselves into the clear mountain air of
that solitary plateau, which drops off on one side into the broad
continental prairies and on the other into the Pacific Ocean; if we
also set aside our intimate knowledge of the world and exchange it
for a horizon that seems immeasurable; and an ignorance of what
lies beyond it, we will begin to achieve an inner comprehension of
the Pueblo Indian's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jung, Dad had his own mystical encounter with a Pueblo
Indian. His name was Sam 2 Deer and he leaned on a cane in the Taos
Plaza, dispensing jokes and bits of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that you get to the origin of things, the
origination,'' he whispered to my Dad. ``All is one, one is all.
We're all the same under our skin. Rare to find a brother like you.
I like your laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come closer. Come closer, I want to tell you something. You've
got the sign. Believe me, I know. I see things others don't see.
</P>
<P>
   As my dad arched his ear close to Sam 2 Deer's lips, the Indian
said, ``Hey, you got another quarter?''
</P>
<P>
   So, Dad found that some ancient truths bear a small price. But
if Frank Waters can see a vision in a washbowl and still be taken
seriously, then Dad should be able to purchase wisdom for a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If you go:
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Taos is small and walkable. Park anywhere near Taos
Plaza. You can easily hoof it to a number of great haunts _ art
galleries, old hotels, coffeehouses, diners and bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Galleries are everywhere _ more than 80. On the plaza square,
you're a skip away from LaFonda Hotel, where D.H. Lawrence's
formerly banned paintings and some writings are safe-kept in a tiny
room.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll down Kit Carson Road to the Taos Book Shop to plumb the
depths of Taos' colorful literary history _ everything from John
Nichols first editions to T.N. Luther's Collecti Authors.
Next door is Caffe Tazza coffee shop, where local bards read their
works.
</P>
<P>
   On Morada Lane, you'll find the Mabel Dodge Luhan House, a
literary hideaway for ``radical revolutionary'' writers and artists
since the turn of the century.

`THE INSIDER': MOURNFUL ECHOES OF A WHISTLE-BLOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in ``The Insider'' the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand sits despondently in a hotel room and contemplates
the steep price of what he has done. The setting is somber except
for the bright pastoral mural on the wall behind him, looking like
a window onto an unsullied, unattainable world. Then the image
begins to roil and morph, and it turns into a vision of the home
and family that Wigand has lost. This is a flashy visual effect,
but it's also one that piercingly captures the man's state of mind.
And although Michael Mann is a filmmaker whose stylistic brio has a
way of overpowering his subject matter, this time he strikes a
balance, and he gets it right.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has directed ``The Insider'' with a pulse-quickening
panache that heightens the tensions within its story. In describing
Wigand's progress from a staid corporate existence into a risky and
unpredictable one, the film entails both visual and moral vertigo.
Once Hollywood had a favorite folk tale: that the lone truth teller
battling political or corporate evil would triumph, however
bitterly, when the facts became known. But in the chillingly
contemporary world of ``The Insider'' it's not that simple. Almost
every character in the story is compromised by business
considerations. And in the film's vision of television news
reporting, moral relativism is a big part of playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   The film centers on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and does the kind of
muckraking that would ordinarily be that program's own province.
The connection between CBS and Wigand's revelations _ that the
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. knew that cigarette smoking was
addictive even as it sought new ways to make nicotine deliver even
more of a kick _ is a producer named Lowell Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   In the film Bergman keeps a portrait of Cesar Chavez on display,
mentions that Herbert Marcuse was his mentor (``major influence on
the New Left in the 1960s'') and otherwise calls attention to his
political credentials. ``How did a radical journalist from Ramparts
magazine wind up at CBS?'' he is asked. He replies modestly: ``I
still do the tough stories. `60 Minutes' reaches a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's casting stacks the deck to lionize Bergman, even
while that casting also makes for dramatic fireworks. Christopher
Plummer does an acute Mike Wallace impersonation, summoning all the
mannerisms familiar to television audiences, including Wallace's
canny way of listening. And Russell Crowe, a subtle powerhouse in
his wrenching evocation of Wigand, takes on the thick, stolid look
of the man he portrays.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bergman is glamorized into a crusading Al
Pacino and becomes the only beacon of rectitude to be found here.
But ``The Insider'' is a movie about shadows, not absolutes. And it
would have reached deeper if its Bergman weren't so self-righteous
a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' as written by Eric Roth (``Forrest Gump'') and
Mann, suspensefully lays out the facts of its story. It begins as
Wigand surreptitiously reveals what he has learned as a chemist for
Brown &AMP; Williamson: its cigarettes are designed to deliver an
extra-quick fix of nicotine despite obvious health risks. Sensing
that Wigand may be a loose cannon, the company's chief executive
(played commandingly by Michael Gambon) binds Wigand to a strict
confidentiality agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But as the pressure on him begins to mount, Wigand finds his
situation becoming intolerable. ``Can you imagine,'' he asks Diane
Venora, as the wife who will soon be walking out on him, ``me
coming home from some job and feeling  &UR; good &LR;  at the end of the
day?''
</P>
<P>
   Along comes ``60 Minutes,'' with promises to give Wigand's
charges a public airing, but with too much corporate baggage to let
that happen. ``The Insider'' offers an account of how the program
wound up sidestepping the confidentiality agreement to interview
Wigand and exposing him to threats of retaliation, only to bail out
on running the interview when it ran afoul of CBS's larger
interests. What emerge as controversial here are not the facts
themselves but the ways in which ``The Insider'' uses docudrama
ethics to draw its close-up views of CBS's inner workings.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about telling the truth, and yet at times it seems
manipulative itself, as when it presents Wallace confessing his
innermost thoughts about his career and reputation. This venerable
television star could have been captured just as fully in the scene
that finds him venting outrage at Gina Gershon's smooth corporate
lawyer. ``Mike?'' he thunders when she addresses him.  &UR; ``Mike? &LR;  Try
 &UR; Wallace. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is still sleek, gripping entertainment with a
raw-nerved, changeable camera style that helps to amplify its
meaning. So what if, when Bergman finds himself feeling betrayed
and alone, he happens to be standing in the turquoise waters of
some tropical hideaway? And so what if when the Wigand story pushes
him to the edge, the film visualizes this picturesquely as the Gulf
Coast of Mississippi?
</P>
<P>
   There are stunningly evocative images here, like perilous
nighttime scenes at a golf driving range and in the Wigand
backyard, with dramatic meaning only heightened by their obvious
beauty. This is the kind of movie in which Bergman can make a phone
call and reach somebody who happens to be in the cockpit of a Lear
Jet. Thanks to the dazzling cinematography of Dante Spinotti (whose
other Mann films include ``Heat'' and ``The Last of the Mohicans'')
visual interest is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' by far Mann's most fully realized and
enthralling work, features brief, sharply-etched performances from
Bruce McGill as a Mississippi prosecutor raging in a courtroom,
Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife and Philip Baker Hall as the ``60
Minutes'' executive who labels Bergman an anarchist and a fanatic.
Each of these characters contributes memorably to the film's
troubling resolution and to Bergman's verdict on the emblematic
crisis within ``The Insider.'' As he puts it regretfully, ``What
got broken here doesn't go back together again.''

<P>
   Otis Chandler, the former publisher of The Los Angeles Times and
the former chairman of the board of its parent company, Wednesday
night offered a sweeping denunciation of the newspaper's current
management for its ``unrealistic and impossible'' circulation
goals, its ``unbelievably stupid and unprofessional'' agreement to
share profits with the management of a downtown arena, and its
contribution to the decline in morale among the newspaper's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler made the comments in a letter to the newspaper's staff.
In a frank repudiation of the policies of the current publisher,
Kathryn M. Downing, and Times Mirror's chief executive, Mark H.
Willes, Chandler, an heir of the family that founded the newspaper,
wrote, ``One cannot successfully run a great newspaper like The Los
Angeles Times with executives in the top two positions, both of
whom have no newspaper experience at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler resigned from the board of Times Mirror last year after
reaching the compulsory retirement age of 70 and has remained
largely silent about the company's new direction under Willes.
While Chandler remains a large stockholder, he has had no
day-to-day role in the company in 19 years. Thus his statement was
regarded as a powerful piece of symbolism, but its likely effect
was unclear at best.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at an automobile museum he runs in Ventura County,
Calif., Chandler said he would not comment on the letter until he
had had a chance to speak to reporters at The Los Angeles Times.
The opening sentence of the letter is addressed to ``the employees
of The Los Angeles Times, particularly of the editorial department
because they have been so abused and misused.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came as The Times newsroom was still seething over
last week's revelation that the newspaper had entered into an
agreement with the new Staples sports center to share the profits
of a special Oct. 10 issue of the Times Sunday magazine devoted
solely to the center.
</P>
<P>
   It came from a man who spent the decades of the 1960s and 1970s
as publisher, pushing to make The Los Angeles Times a newspaper of
national and international stature. In 1980, Chandler bowed out of
active management.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, with the slumping Southern California
economy sapping the newspaper's financial vitality, Chandler _
whose more liberal politics had been an irritant to his
conservative cousins _ faded into the background. His fellow heirs'
desire for management change and a better financial return resulted
in the hiring of Willes, a General Mills executive, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler concluded his message with a reference to the members
of his family who founded and ran The Times, saying: ``When I think
back and realize the history of this great newspaper under the
hands of General Otis, Harry Chandler and my father Norman and
succeeding publishers, I realize how fragile and irreplaceable
public trust of a newspaper is. The trust and faith in a newspaper
by its employees, its readers and the community, is dearer to me
than life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing, in an interview conducted shortly before Chandler's
letter was read to the newsroom by the city editor, Bill Boyarsky,
said she had not seen a copy of it. Willes could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Willes, who became chairman and chief executive of Times Mirror,
the newspaper's parent company, in 1995, undertook cutbacks and
economies at The Times and the company's other newspapers that
resulted in a swift rise of the company's stock price, which was
re-energized this summer after languishing in the early part of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler family, through a series of trusts, still holds a
majority of the voting shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Chandlerement came as it was learned that the Staples
Center not only had entered an agreement with the newspaper to
share the profits from the magazine but encouraged one of its
suppliers to buy advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a newspaper to enter into any financial
relationship with an institution that is the subject of continuing
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the arena in selling the advertising has become a
bone of contention inside the newspaper, even after Ms. Downing
moved last week to quell a fierce protest in the newsroom over the
profit-sharing arrangement, apologizing to the staff and saying it
reflected her ``fundamental misunderstanding'' of the role of a
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Michael Roth, a spokesman for the
Staples Center, denied that the center had any role in selling
advertising in the magazine. ``It was 100 percent the ad department
at the L.A. Times,'' he said. At a meeting attended by 200 staff
members on Thursday, Ms. Downing was asked about the ad-selling
issue, raised first in an article in The Los Angeles Business
Journal, and left the impression among many editors and reporters
that she had denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the answer was pretty categorically no,'' said John
Lindsay, a managing editor in charge of the magazine. ``That's my
recollection.'' But, in two letters sent by the center to a
subcontractor, Anthony Crane &AMP; Equipment, Staples urged that
advertising be purchased. One was signed by Tim Leiweke, the
president of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the two letters were faxed to The New York Times by
Bob Burt, the marketing director of Anthony Crane Equipment's
parent company in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was soliciting the advertisements, Burt said, ``it was
more a joint thing, and mostly the Staples Center.'' The company
did purchase an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 11 letter, Kevin B. Murphy, the senior vice president
for development of the L.A. Arena Co. wrote, ``As an important part
of the Staples Center development team, we expect and would
appreciate your participation in this magazine by purchase of an
advertisement of appropriate size to represent you.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter added, ``I attach an information sheet with some
statistics and rates for advertisements in this issue. A
representative of the L.A. Times will be contacting your firm.''
</P>
<P>
   A second, similar letter, dated Aug. 24, was signed by Leiweke.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the Staples letter Wednesday night, Ms. Downing said she
had told the staff meeting that ``to the best of my knowledge,
Staples didn't sell any ads.'' She added: ``They didn't. The Los
Angeles Times sales force sold the ads for this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she viewed the letters from the Staples management to
its subcontracter, Ms. Downing said, ``They are encouraging people
to participate; they're not selling people the advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the letters to the crane company Wednesday, Roth, of the
Staples Center, said, ``I wasn't aware'' of them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, dozens of the newspaper's top journalists,
including its entire Washington bureau and bureau chief, demanded
that the editor, Michael Parks assign reporters to write an
extensive reconstruction of what transpired in the Staples deal. At
first, Parks refused.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, in a meeting with projects editor Kit Rachlis and
several other senior journalists, Parks said he had changed his
mind, according to Rachlis.

<P>
   You'll hear a little authentic 1950s rock in ``Shake, Rattle and
Roll.'' But while most of the music is synthetic, this package is
trimmed with some real '50s sensibility. Four hours of network
television with nary a hint of postmodern cynicism? Good golly,
Miss Molly!
</P>
<P>
   This mini-series, which CBS is showing on Sunday and Wednesday
nights, has much in common with the infectious pop tunes that
inspired it. It tells a simplistic tale built of heartbreak,
hormones and hokum.
</P>
<P>
   It may have all the depth of an old 45-rpm record, but there's
fun here, especially in the first installment (before the plot
thickens), as long as you don't think too hard.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows the rise of a fictional rock star named Tyler
Hart (Brad Hawkins) from his small Missouri hometown in 1955 to
national success. But the story's real centerpiece is the brilliant
and talented Lyne Danner (Bonnie Somerville), the gal behind the
guy. (Remember, '50s sensibility.)
</P>
<P>
   Lyne falls in love with Tyler the moment she meets him in the
high school band. She then introduces him to the emerging sound of
rock 'n' roll; writes the song that will propel Tyler's group, the
HartAches, onto the record charts; plays in the band until she's
forced aside, and stays true to the lug even when demon ambition
clouds his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing you can do with a plot like this (the story is
attributed to the director, Mike Robe) is to play it straight. And
that's just what the attractive principals do. The dark-haired
Hawkins has just a hint of the young Elvis about him: that
combination of danger and vulnerability, unencumbered with
intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Somerville, all blond hair and adoring blue eyes, is the
opposite that is attracted to him with a pull as steady as an old
rock beat.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne and her best friend, Marsha Stokes (Samaria Graham), have
come to town in their senior year because their fathers have just
been transferred to the nearby Air Force base. Marsha is black, but
racial distinctions did not count for much when the girls were
growing up on Guam, their dads' last posting, where there wasn't
much to do but listen to records.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler has been playing country music (living in the country and
all), but the girls put Chuck Berry on the Victrola, and Tyler is
hooked. ``If that's race music,'' he declares, ``I must be the
wrong color.''
</P>
<P>
   The film takes pains to acknowledge rock's black roots; the
early stars impersonated here include black artists like Berry,
Little Richard, Fats Domino and Jackie Wilson. And Marsha's
awakening to the realities of racial prejudice is entwined in the
plot, which includes the beginnings of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   But for better of worse, this is no historical docudrama about
rock 'n' roll. Unlike NBC's recent Alan Freed biopic, ``Shake,
Rattle and Roll'' is an old-fashioned far-fetched love story about
a pair of '50s white kids, set against the era of early rock.
</P>
<P>
   This being a network mini-series, some familiar faces make
fleeting appearances. Kathy Baker is effective as Lyne's supportive
mother, who once dreamed of her own music career.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Delany is over the top as the manipulative record executive
who, for a time, calls the shots for Tyler in the studio and the
bedroom. Talk about retro. In keeping with the period sensibility,
the sex is handled as discreetly as in a '50s movie, as opposed to
a thinly coded '50s rock song.
</P>
<P>
   Now what of those songs? Well, you'll hear snippets of real hit
records, like ``Sh-Boom'' and ``Only You.'' And the blues legend
B.B. King makes a very brief appearance. But the other rock stars
are ersatz, and the soundtrack blends their studied impersonations
with new tunes in the old style, some written with help from the
likes of survivors Carole King and Graham Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The HartAches get their deal with Czar Records on the strength
of their performance of ``One Bad Stud,'' a forgettable song by the
unforgettable Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.
</P>
<P>
   Some current pop stars stand in for their rock forebears. As
Bill Haley, Dicky Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones gives a
lively rendition of the film's title song. K-Ci and JoJo of the
group Jodeci appear as members of a street-corner doo-wop group.
They're all part of the soundtrack CD that CBS is pushing in some
not-so-retro marketing synergy.
</P>
<P>
   If the mini-series sends you to a record store (or Web site),
look for some genuine '50s rock. That's a better bet to lift your
doggone soul.

   &UR; What a Review Has Wrought &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Barry Levinson's newest film, ``Liberty Heights,''
which opens on Nov. 17, has unusual roots. The comedy-drama, which
is about anti-Semitism and racism in Baltimore in the 1950s, was
the direct result of Levinson's anger at a review of his film
``Sphere'' that characterized one of the stars, Dustin Hoffman, as
a Jewish psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Levinson, the Academy Award-winning director
of ``Rain Man,'' as well as ``Bugsy,'' ``Diner,'' ``Tin Man,''
``Wag the Dog'' and others, picked up an issue of Entertainment
Weekly to read a review of ``Sphere,'' a science-fiction story
about a mysterious underwater discovery. The review was negative.
But Levinson said that what irritated him was the comments made
about Hoffman's portrayal of Dr. Norman Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   The review said: ``OK, so he's not officially Jewish; he's only
Hoffman, who arrives at the floating habitat and immediately
announces, `I'd like to call my family.' You do that math.'' The
film was ``a matzo ball,'' the review concluded, adding, ``Norman's
mother knows what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said: ``It was the craziest thing I've ever read,
insulting. The film is not about anyone's religion. Dustin is an
actor in a role, the same way Mel Gibson was an actor who played an
industrialist in `Ransom.' Nobody referred to him as a Catholic
industrialist.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said that because of the review he began to think about
anti-Semitism in Baltimore in the 1950s _ where and when he grew up
and the setting of several of his films. Levinson, who wrote this
new movie in only three weeks, said the story depicted many
real-life incidents involving his immediate family, his relatives
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes place in 1954-55, when school segregation had
ended but swimming pools were ethnically and racially segregated.
Levinson, who is 57 and Jewish, said: ``It was the beginning of the
car culture, where people actually left the Jewish ghetto to drive
into other parts of the city. Before then, everyone stayed where
they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is about a Jewish family on the edge of turmoil. The
thoroughly decent father (Joe Mantegna) runs a fading burlesque
theater and an illegal numbers racket. The stalwart mother (Bebe
Neuwirth) struggles to keep the family together. The youngest son
(Ben Foster) becomes infatuated with the only black girl in his
class, whose upper-class family is as upset about the developing
friendship as the boy's parents are. And the oldest son (Adrien
Brody) becomes equally infatuated with a beautiful, aristocratic
country club girl whose friends initially mock him because he is
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, who lives north of San Francisco and has a home in
Annapolis, Md., clings firmly to his Baltimore roots. He has been
working for eight years on a documentary about his friends, using
old videos and photos of them with current interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, in some ways, the first rock 'n' roll generation, who
are dealing now with marital breakups, remarriages, family issues,
illness, death,'' Levinson said. ``Some of them are very successful
doctors, lawyers, that kind of thing. One has wandered around the
world all his life and can't keep a job. Another is a
multimillionaire. Somehow we all deal with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson is one of the few A-list film directors to move
effortlessly from television (he helped create ``Homicide: Life on
the Street'') to big-budget movies to smaller, more adventurous
works like ``Wag the Dog.'' He is now making a modestly budgeted
comedy, ``An Everlasting Piece,'' set in Dublin and Belfast in the
1980s, about two wig salesmen, one Catholic and one Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets harder and harder to make movies about human beings,''
he said. ``These movies are like an endangered species. Everything
is simplify, simplify now. How many movies have subplots anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said studios seek uncomplicated films partly to be able
to promote them in 30-second television spots before an opening
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to try to sell `All About Eve' in 30
seconds, or `On the Waterfront'?'' Levinson asked. ``How would
these great films do on an opening weekend?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; After `Shine' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What happens to a documentary filmmaker, struggling anonymously
for years, after the release of an acclaimed and successful feature
film turns his life upside down?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself I knew I couldn't repeat myself, I'm not going
to try to top myself,'' said Scott Hicks, the 46-year-old
Australian filmmaker who struck gold as director of ``Shine,'' the
drama about the troubled career of the Australian pianist David
Helfgott.
</P>
<P>
   That 1997 film, which earned seven Academy Award nominations,
turned Hicks into one of the most sought-after directors in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got 130 to 140 scripts,'' said Hicks. ``It was a deluge.
Initially I got a lot of scripts about music, madness and child
abuse. I finally said to my agent, `Please, let's spread the net a
little wider.''' Hicks, pony-tailed and soft-spoken, said the one
project that appealed to him was ``Snow Falling on Cedars,'' the
adaptation of the successful 1995 novel by David Guterson.
</P>
<P>
   The book, set on Bainbridge Island, off Puget Sound, where
Guterson has lived for 15 years, is a love story set against the
internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942. The film, opening on Dec.
22, stars Ethan Hawke and Youki Kudoh, as well as Max von Sydow,
James Cromwell and Sam Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who wrote the screenplay with Ron Bass, said he read the
novel on a plane while finishing ``Shine'' and became entranced
with the story's evocative language and strong characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not sure what obsessed me about this story,'' Hicks
said. ``The strength of the story is that its roots are in reality.
There is this intricate story and dense atmosphere. It was
irresistible to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said the success of ``Shine'' didn't quite overwhelm him
because he lives in Adelaide, in southern Australia, with his wife
of 28 years, Kerry Heysen, who has worked side-by-side with him on
all his films. Moving to Los Angeles was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided early on that I couldn't do it,'' Hicks said. ``If I
did, I'd get so completely caught up in the day-to-day neuroses of
the business. You read the trade papers here and you're quivering _
`Why aren't I doing that project?' There's too much anxiety. And I
felt that perhaps there was a point of view about `Shine' that had
to do with being outside the business. Maybe I should try to hang
on to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he was working on an adaptation of Donna Tartt's
novel, ``Secret History,'' partly about murderous college cliques.
He added that he recently realized that no matter what he did and
what projects he undertook, nothing would quite match ``Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to a point where I realize that `Shine' was a unique
thing for me,'' he said. ``Even if I made a film that was more
successful, nothing could replace that experience. For me, it came
from nowhere and went as far as things could go.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From Music to Movies  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's trying hard to turn into a film producer,
Michael Stipe admits that he'll always be known first and foremost
as the lead singer of REM, one of the world's most successful rock
bands. ``I love films; it's really as powerful a medium as music,''
Stipe said. ``And, very naively, I wanted to start a company that
makes great films. I knew too many actors, writers and directors,
mostly from New York, who went out to Hollywood and were just
frustrated at what was available.''
</P>
<P>
   Stipe began putting together a production company in 1988. ``The
major hurdle,'' he said, ``was money.'' But in the last two years,
Stipe's producing ambitions have turned successful. With his
partner, Sandy Stern, in Single Cell Pictures, Stipe was executive
producer of Todd Haynes' ``Velvet Goldmine.'' More recently, they
produced Chris Smith's comedy ``American Movie'' and won a top
award at the Sundance Film Festival. Stipe has another production
company, C-00, with the director Jim McKay, which specializes in
lower-budget films.
</P>
<P>
   But Stipe's most successful film so far, as producer, is ``Being
John Malkovich,'' which opened last week in New York and Los
Angeles and is slowly expanding around the nation. The innovative
comedy-fantasy, written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike
Jonze, a prominent music video director, was perhaps the most
discussed movie at the recent New York Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I just wanted to do something where I'm not in the
spotlight but I can help people support their vision,'' Stipe said.
``I have absolutely no desire to be an actor or director. And it
was just amazing to me to be able to stand slightly behind Spike
Jonze and the actors as they were soaking up all that applause at
the festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Stipe said it was a cliche that rock stars live weird and wild
lives and are totally uninvolved in business matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performing is hard work; it's a hands-on business,'' he said.
``So is producing.''

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Kevin Sorbo
in a scene from ``Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Herc's journeys are just about complete.
 &HT;    After six years, 100-plus episodes, an animated feature, several
television movies, two spinoffs and a cottage industry of
conventions, trinkets and fan clubs to rival ``Star Trek,'' Kevin
Sorbo is hanging up his bow and arrow. ``Hercules: The Legendary
Journeys'' will come to an end the week of Nov. 22 with a series
finale entitled ``Full Circle,'' only the eighth episode of the
season.
 &HT;    Despite intense speculation that he wanted out, Sorbo insists
that the abrupt finish is entirely due to Studios USA, the
production entity behind the show, The studio, he says, had enough
episodes for syndication and simply didn't want any more.
 &HT;    ``I'd love to get in a conference room with them, have 1,000
people from the press there and get out the truth,'' the actor says
by telephone from his home in Las Vegas. ``But the truth is they
didn't want it to go anymore.
 &HT;    ``I don't have a problem with that,'' he adds. ``I understand it
_ it's a business. My contract was for eight episodes in season
seven, and they really had no interest in doing any more episodes
because they had enough in the vault and they were just ready to
move on to something new.
 &HT;    ``What are you going to do?'' he says. ``That's a sign on the
wall anyway that it was time to move on, that it was time for me to
go do bigger and better things.''
 &HT;    Sorbo has already selected at least one of those things, but
before getting to that, let's talk about ``Full Circle.''
 &HT;    ``The show deals with final statements of sorts between Hercules
and his father, Zeus (Charles Keating), between Hercules and Hera,
between him and Ares (Kevin Smith), and between him and Iolaus
(Michael Hurst),'' Sorbo says. ``There are resolutions and there
are story arcs that come to mostly happy endings.
 &HT;    ``Of the last eight original episodes we shot, the finale is
definitely the most character-driven, as opposed to being
gag-driven or action-driven,'' he says. ``It's a dramatic episode.
 &HT;    ``It's a nice way to go out.''
 &HT;    For the record, the actor cites ``The Mercenary'' and ``The
Apple'' _ the latter of which he directed _ as his favorite
``Hercules'' episodes. ``The Cave of Echoes,'' a ``clip show''
featuring flashbacks, earns the most prominent Sorbo seal of
disapproval.
 &HT;    In May Sorbo will head for Vancouver, B.C., to embark on the
bigger-and-better phase of his career: He'll star in the syndicated
sci-fi series ``Andromeda,'' based on a concept developed by ``Star
Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry in the 1970s and produced by Majel
Barrett Roddenberry in association with Tribune Entertainment _ the
same team behind ``Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict.''
 &HT;    The series debuts next autumn, and already has a 22-episode
commitment. Former ``Deep Space Nine'' writer/producer Robert
Hewitt Wolfe will serve as ``Andromeda's'' show runner, with Sorbo
pulling double duty as a co-executive producer.
 &HT;    ``It's about a guy trying to restore what was lost in his
life,'' Sorbo says. ``I will be playing Commander Dylan Hunt. Hunt
has been in suspended animation for between 340 and 360 years. He's
picked up by a salvage ship that finds him floating just in the
right spot near a black hole, so that he was never sucked in.
 &HT;    ``The ideas they have are pretty great,'' he concludes. ``I've
been asked not to speak about it too much yet, but you'll be
hearing a lot more about `Andromeda' pretty soon.''
 &HT;    Sorbo couldn't be happier in the meantime. He guest-starred in
an October episode of the sitcom ``Just Shoot Me'' and is relaxing
at home with his wife, Sam, shooting rounds of golf at every
opportunity and taking meetings about possible film roles.
 &HT;    It'll then be on to ``Andromeda.''
 &HT;    ``For me, it was a natural step,'' Sorbo says. ``I'm sort of
trading the past for the future.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the many charms of the rotund pundit Jack
Germond is the fact that despite 40 years of wandering among the
illusions and artifices of the national political scene, he
resolutely remains a realist, feet firmly planted on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Germond has just published a lively memoir of his adventures
covering the high and mighty, called ``Fat Man in a Middle Seat,''
published by Random House. The title is a reference to the
uncomfortable seats into which he was jammed on hundreds of
last-minute flights as well as his centrist location as the sanest
participant in the televised shouting match run by right-wing
dogmatist John McLaughlin.

   As the book title implies, Germond is not about to take himself
or his subjects too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean he is a frivolous fellow. He is among the
most respected reporters writing about politics today, with a
column in the Baltimore Sun and regular appearances as a talking
head on various televised panel shows.
</P>
<P>
   Germond has been a friend for roughly 30 years; so I am not a
neutral observer here. But his book is a great read for anyone
interested in how reporters and politicians interact, what life on
the campaign road is really like, who's naughty and who's nice
among the famous and why it can be fun to tell people what's going
on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Germond is a leading proponent of the horse-race school of
journalism, which puts more emphasis on tracking winners and losers
than on explaining the issues. He is not ideological, although he
admits to being ``a sort of garden-variety liberal.'' What he likes
is the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fatal flaw in the sorting of candidates by issues is that
it is almost impossible to anticipate which issues will confront a
president during his four years in office,'' he writes. ``No one
was thinking about Saddam Hussein when George Bush was elected or
Monica Lewinsky when Bill Clinton was elected.''
</P>
<P>
   The one quality Germond believes to be essential to the making
of a good president is the ability to understand that political
opponents are adversaries, not enemies. More even than pure
intelligence, emotional and mental flexibility is the key. A
president can never have either friends or enemies; he has only
interests.
</P>
<P>
   But then Germond adds, with the wisdom of long experience,
``That alone is probably not enough. Ronald Reagan had that
quality, and look at some of the bizarre things he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Germond was never bored by politics, he does despair,
as a senior citizen on the cusp of retirement, that ``politics has
become too often a mindless contest between competing media
consultants and fund-raisers working for candidates programmed by
their poll takers.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates become ``serious,'' he concludes, for the wrong
reasons _ only when they raise gobs of money and follow the advice
of their pollsters. Or do not commit a gaffe. ``The most egregious
weakness of those of us who cover politics is our lack of any sense
of proportion,'' he says. ``If a candidate misspeaks, God help
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And he freely denounces his colleagues collectively for
sometimes sinking good presidential candidates. For instance, he
personally admired Senate Republican leader Howard Baker Jr. of
Tennessee and thought he would be the perfect president if the
selection could just be made by appointment. But as a candidate in
1979, Baker blew an unimportant straw poll early in the contest
that the press interpreted as evidence of gross political
misjudgment. Baker's goose was cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Germond contends his colleagues magnified that trivial issue to
exaggerate the importance of their own coverage of a meaningless
story. Actually, there was more to Baker's failings as a candidate
than that one episode. I also view Baker as an underrated statesman
and covered his brief presidential foray as well. But I found him a
poor campaigner on many counts. And in a democracy, a talent for
campaigning _ connecting with voters _ is an essential quality in a
president.
</P>
<P>
   Germond's least favorite presidents were Bill Clinton, for the
obvious moral reasons, and George Bush, with whom he had a wretched
relationship. ``I haven't decided in my dotage that Reagan was
right about very much and I still feel small tremors of unease at
the notion of him as leader of the free world. But next to George
Bush and Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan looks 10 feet tall,'' Germond
writes.
</P>
<P>
   His view of Bush is that ``he was the most vacuous man to occupy
the Oval office in my time in Washington. He seemed to want the
presidency so he could cap off his stunning resume.''
</P>
<P>
   Germond writes that ``Bill Clinton, by contrast, displayed all
the right instincts. He had an extraordinary grasp of the most
complex issues ... but he is the most selfish and egocentric
politician I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Germond's candor about journalistic infighting, overeating,
overdrinking and other highjinks on the road makes entertaining and
instructive reading for anyone who follows national politics. He
never set out to make the world safe for democracy. His view is
that if the political system is rotting away, as it seems to be, it
is a reporter's job to record it but not make the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   He has been true to that practical credo, and we are all the
better for it.

 &HT;    Y2K EXPERT URGES AMERICANS TO STOCK UP
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The White House's top expert on the Y2K computer
bug Thursday testified before Congress that Americans should be
stocking up on enough food, water, medicine and other supplies to
stay home safely for at least the first three days of January.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on the Year
2000 Conversion, characterized the computer software flaw as ``a
serious national challenge'' that might disrupt daily life early in
the new year. ``We do not believe the Y2K issue will create
significant problems in the United States, but no one can rule out
the possibility that there won't be temporary disruptions in some
services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While urging Americans to have ``at least a three-day supply of
food and water,'' he warned against last-minute stockpiling. ``If
everyone waits until the last moment to take even modest
precautions, supply systems could be overwhelmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen testified at a joint hearing of two House subcommittees
monitoring government operations and technology. Before adjurning
for the year, the subcommittees wanted a final report on the
software flaw that could cause many older computers to read only
the last two digits of a date. When the year changes to ``00'' on
Jan.1, the equipment may react as if the date is 1900 and
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said evidence gathered by his office shows that basic
infrastructure, such as the nation's electric power grid and
telephone systems, will not fail. But other problems could disrupt
daily routines.
</P>
<P>
   The disruptions could be widespread and aggravating. For
example, computer experts believe some grocery stores may not be
able to operate registers, gasoline pumps might malfunction,
traffic lights could fail and pharmacy computers could spew
incorrect data.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K flaw could be a ``massive problem,'' Koskinen said, but
one that will be solved within days, not weeks or months as some
have suggested. The government has ``no evidence'' that service
disruptions could be severe enough to justify buying months' worth
of supplies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Willemssen, director of the General Accounting Office, a
federal watchdog agency, testified that four government agencies
continue to be inadequately prepared for the date rollover. The
Department of Defense, Internal Revenue Service, Federal Aviation
Administration and the Health Care Financing Administration are
still struggling with Y2K bugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Willemmssen said the Y2K flaws in those systems will not
harm public safety. For example, the FAA problems will not cause
planes to fall out of the sky, but may force long flight delays as
computerized operations slow down. Likewise, the Defense Department
is not worried that nuclear weapons will be unleashed. However,
department officials still have to find and fix many bugs to
maintain record-keeping systems for employees and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still much work to do,'' he said.

`AMERICAN MOVIE': SEAT-OF-THE PANTS DIRECTOR: LIGHTS! CAMERA!
GUMPTION! 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Mark Borchardt, the funny, garrulous subject of the
not-to-be-missed documentary ``American Movie.'' He's someone you
won't soon forget. He has dedicated himself to making a no-budget
black-and-white horror film that features homemade scarecrows and
primitive acting, one that's not about to rival ``The Blair Witch
Project'' in anything but the expletive department.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't matter. The point is that Borchardt cobbles
together this project as if his life depended on it, because it
does. Insightfully and stirringly, not to mention hilariously,
``American Movie'' shows why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Dream stays with me each and every day,''
Borchardt says when he speaks of his motivation. And he likes to
drive past big, sterile new houses to illustrate what that dream
means. But as captured here so intimately by Chris Smith, Borchardt
is already living through a much darker and more authentically
American story. As hard as he works to attain what he wants, he's
struggling even harder to escape what he has.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``American Movie'' is the rare documentary that combines
a wildly charismatic subject with an elegant structure, it begins
very simply, with the lanky, long-haired Borchardt talking about
his big ambitions. (``If he is able to do even 25 percent of what
he says, that is more than most people accomplish,'' a girlfriend
later says of him.)
</P>
<P>
   Then the film starts to open, like a slow iris shot, onto the
larger landscape of his life. When it comes to obstacles, he has a
brother who announces that Borchardt would have been best suited
for a factory job. And that's just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who made the film working closely with Sarah Price,
builds a surprising amount of suspense and even shock into this
documentary's gradual revelations about its subject. By the time
Borchardt is seen doing a dead-end job at a cemetery and describing
the worst kind of work he's ever been faced with, the film has
built up an enormous amount of empathy and hope for him.
</P>
<P>
   But even those parts of ``American Movie'' that display the most
``Crumb''-like poignancy have their share of affectionate humor.
Take Uncle Bill Borchardt, the only family member who might
conceivably lend Mark any money.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Borchardt woos his uncle into the movie business by
flashing a picture of a pretty young actress and announcing, ``She
wants to be in your movie, Bill.'' Almost before Bill can exclaim,
``Oh, my gosh,'' he has been enlisted as the producer of ``Coven,''
which his nephew likes to mispronounce as KO-ven because he doesn't
want it to rhyme with oven. When he gets an idea, he tends to stick
with it all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see great cinema in this,'' he says at one point, causing
the woozy, pitifully fragile Bill to ask, ``Cinnamon?'' Smith has a
wonderful ear for moments like that and does an expert job of
extracting them from the 70 hours of film he originally shot.
</P>
<P>
   Because Borchardt had been recruiting friends and relatives for
projects like ``The Creeps,'' ``I Blow Up'' and ``The More the
Scarier III'' since he was 14, everyone here is very comfortable
with a camera rolling, and very revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Borchardt's friend Mike Schank, who seems to have wandered in
dazed from a Kevin Smith movie, tells about a near-death experience
on drugs. Then he giggles nervously and offers to tell some more.
While Borchardt struggles to overcome a history of alcoholism,
Schank goes him one better. He has an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor
who also drives him to Gamblers Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Movie'' begins with Borchardt's ambition to make an
autobiographical film called ``Northwestern,'' which is meant to be
an ambitious exploration of his upbringing in Milwaukee. Since this
soon proves to be a non-starter, he vows to raise the money for it
by completing ``Coven'' and selling 3,000 video copies.
</P>
<P>
   It is soon revealed that this won't be easy, as Borchardt lies
in the snow filming friends in black hooded capes (``Now you guys
gotta look menacing!'' he directs), bungles a scene in which a
cabinet door is supposed to break on a friend's head, and otherwise
shows why the road to a finished ``Coven'' is full of potholes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``American Movie,'' opening Friday at Film Forum,
completes its own mission, it has blossomed wonderfully into much
more than a portrait of one fiendishly determined filmmaker. For
anyone wondering where the spirit of maverick independent
filmmaking has its source, you need look no further.
</P>
<P>

German wireless company, pitting itself against France Telecom

   ATT-ADS _ AT&AMP;T has begun mounting a puzzling, but high-profile

tout a number of things that AT&AMP;T does not yet offer _ like local
phone service, high-speed Net access. MediaOne has been widely
criticized for making promises of Services To Come (Broadband!) and
thereby frustrating and annoying customers who want Services Now.
So, Why the AT&AMP;T campaign? (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

Eight years later, the roles have been reversed. Tennessee is the

   A Device That Soaks Up All the White Board Can Hold
</P>
<P>
   If the words ``white board'' conjure images of long meetings and
fingers cramped from note-taking, the Mimio might have a market.
The $499 device, by Boston-based Virtual Ink (www.mimio.com),
captures meeting notes, brainstorms and brilliant doodlings as fast
as they are rendered and saves them to a computer. The signals are
received by a 2-foot-long Mimio bar, which attaches to the average
white board and is connected to a computer. It picks up ultrasonic
and infrared signals sent by a wireless holder that slips onto a
regular dry-erase marker that is used for writing. The sketches can
be exported into programs like Word and shared with others. Imagine
what college students could do if their teachers used the Mimio?

   Free Software Sounds Alerts On Sites' Use of Personal Data
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com may have attracted 13 million shoppers, but how many
of them really know what the company plans to do with their
personal information? That is the question asked by Enonymous.com,
a new company that wants to give Web surfers a more complete
picture of exactly how sites plan to use their names, e-mail
addresses and any other information they collect.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in San Diego, is distributing a free Internet
utility called Enonymous Advisor. A computer equipped with the
Advisor, which can be downloaded from www.enonymous.com, detects
sites that request personal information. When a fill-in-the-blank
form is opened on a user's Web browser, a window pops up with
information about how the site rates on consumer privacy. The
ratings are based on Enonymous' evaluation of the site's privacy
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, Yahoo.com and Expedia.com are among about two dozen
sites receiving one star each _ the lowest rank, which means that
the site may share personal data without permission. The maximum
rating is four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Capelli, a spokesman for Amazon.com, said that the company
was not very concerned about the rating. The company's privacy
policy states that it ``does not sell, trade, or rent your personal
information to others.'' But the next sentence continues: ``We may
choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but
you can tell us not to by sending a blank e-mail message to
never(AT)amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our policy is clearly defined,'' Capelli said, ``and
that our customers are comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Enonymous.com awarded four stars to sites like Ebay.com, Aol.com
and Hotmail.com, which share users' information only with their
permission and will contact them, via e-mail or otherwise, only
with their permission.
</P>
<P>
   In the next year, the company plans to make money (instead of
simply giving away software) by creating the online equivalent of
anonymous post-office boxes for people who want to receive certain
kinds of advertisements without giving out their e-mail addresses.
But in the meantime, said David Taylor, Enonymous' president and
chief executive, ``we're trying to define some new rules.''

   FILM-STRAIGHT STORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ It must be the eve of a new millennium when David
Mamet, and now David Lynch _ the director of ``Blue Velvet'' and
``Lost Highways'' and the creator of ``Twin Peaks'' _ both make
G-rated movies in the same year. (Though Lynch's elegant and
elegiac ``Elephant Man'' was a film for the whole family.) Lynch
brings a hypnotic ease, and a leisurely oddness, to ``The Straight
Story.'' This sure exhibition of a filmmaker's joy in his craft is
the true story of Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old codger who gets it
in his head to go see his ailing brother, who lives in another
state. Alvin decides to drive the distance, hundreds of miles, on
his John Deere lawn mower. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved in

   UNDATED _ There are images in the animated feature ``Princess

are playing in a beautiful unspoiled field when a creature comes
rumbling toward them _ a mass of bloody, writhing worms eating away
at a giant boar as it gallops and moans across the countryside.
It's where master animator Hayao Miyazaki's gifts are best

<P>
   FILM-THE INSIDER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ All of director Michael Mann's movies seem to have
been fired from the barrel of a gun. And it's intriguing that Mann
decided to tell the story of ``The Insider,'' the battle between
CBS News and Big Tobacco, since plumes of cigarette smoke often
curl in the backdrop of his films, a touch of heather gray against

   FILM-JULIEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Humphrey Bogart once dismissed those who found any
worth at all in the comedy thriller ``Beat the Devil'' as
``phonies.'' ``It's a mess,'' he reportedly snarled. It came to
mind as Harmony Korine's new opus ``julien donkey-boy'' unspooled,
and viewers who were repelled by his previous film, ``Gummo'' _ one
disgusted critic likened it to ``a hairball'' _ struggled to find
something, anything, nice to say about it. But it's like looking
through the sofa cushions to dig up enough change to tip the pizza
delivery guy: a fool's errand. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story has moved

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ When a movie's ads compare it to the best entries in
its genre, it sends mixed signals. It's shorthand for ``If you
liked those movies, you'll like this one, too.'' But it's also
shorthand for ``Those movies did this first, and better,'' a sign
that the new movie is treading water. Such is the case with ``The
Bone Collector,'' whose ads compare it to ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' and ``Seven.'' By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED _ American workers are now putting in more hours
annually than even the workaholic Japanese. Major corporations are
encouraging finding relationships at the office, in their constant
effort to push production. Day-care facilities are becoming more
common in companies so parents can put in more time at the office.
Where does this all lead? Dave Arnott, a Dallas Baptist University
management professor and lecturer, sees it pushing us off the edge
_ if we aren't careful. He voices his views in his new book,
``Corporate Cults: The Insidious Lure of the All-Consuming
Organization'' (Amacom, 240 pages, $23.95). By TERESA MCUSIC. Story

   UNDATED _ Lately, New Mexico has gotten a little too
sophisticated for some folks' taste. At least that's how it seems
sometimes in chichi cities like Santa Fe and Taos. But there are
other places, smaller towns, where New Mexico's charms are
unsullied. If you're looking for a simpler, less tourist-trampled
version of New Mexico, try these: Chama, Cloudcroft or Las Vegas.

`Annie' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the passing of days, or decades: Few will
probably even blink, let alone cry blasphemy, that the latest
incarnation of ``Annie'' features an adorable moppet with red hair
utterly bereft of curls for most of tonight's ABC telefilm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Orphan Annie,'' the comic strip serving as source
material for tonight's extravaganza, has long sat unmolested in the
remainder bin of pop culture. Its iconography _ Annie and pet dog
Sandy's creepily pupil-free eyes, Sandy's ubiquitous cry of ``Arf''
and Annie's of ``Leapin' Lizards,'' Daddy Warbucks' fantasy
opulence _ is virtually forgotten or meaningless for today's
audiences. So is reviving ``Annie'' an exercise in nostalgia for
the innocence of the Depression era _ or for '70s Broadway
musicals?
</P>
<P>
   There's not a lot of point in remaking ``Annie'' in 1999, except
for the fact that the bloated 1982 movie didn't do the musical
justice _ and the simple verity that the musical boasts what
remains an impossibly infectious score. Tonight's version from
``The Wonderful World of Disney'' gets right everything that the
earlier cinematic version got wrong _ it keeps the spectacle
manageable and not overwhelming and, above all, focuses on the
songs _ ``It's a Hard-Knock Life,'' ``I Think I'm Gonna Like It
Here'' and, of course, the show-stopper ``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old newcomer Alicia Morton plays the mischievous
orphan, stranded in a life of servitude in a run-down orphanage run
(down, of course) by the harridan Miss Hannigan (Kathy Bates).
Depression-era billionaire Daddy Warbucks (Victor Garber), as a
public-relations stunt, attempts to adopt Annie, but she still
pines for her real parents, so Warbucks announces a nationwide
search for them. Hannigan's ne'er-do-well brother Rooster (Alan
Cumming) and his dizzy squeeze Lily (Kristin Chenoweth) plot to
pose as said parents to grab Warbucks' generous financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   The one misstep in all this comes when the filmmakers attempt to
give Bates, their biggest star, more to do and have her attempt the
parent-trap ruse with Rooster instead. Logically, it makes little
sense _ wouldn't a savvy kid like Annie suss out her tormentor of
the past decade in a New York minute? _ while logistically it
deprives colorful Tony-winner Chenoweth of a prime opportunity to
chew scenery.
</P>
<P>
   My young stepdaughters immediately declared this version
superior to the 1982 production starring Albert Finney (who reminds
them too much of Austin Powers' archenemy Dr. Evil _ they preferred
Garber's smoother, less gruff performance). They noted that
multiple Tony winner Audra McDonald, as Warbucks' private
secretary, has far superior pipes than Ann Reinking, who played the
role in the film, and preferred Morton's cute-but-not-(BEGIN
ITAL)too(END ITAL)-cute turn as Annie to her predecessor Aileen
Quinn's. They preferred director/choreographer Rob Marshall's
streamlined work to John Huston's heavy lifting in the earlier
film. They're actually pretty savvy little critics. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Blessed with an innate sense of what in our history is both
significant and makes for stirring drama, Ken Burns has long been
America's premier historical documentarian. His work not only
brings his topic to vivid life but also massages the usually
unwieldy subject matter into a compelling narrative with a skill
that matches Hollywood's best storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony'' examines a woefully underappreciated chapter in
our nation's chronicles _ the suffragette movement _ relating a
story that spans a century in a concise, taut fashion while
powerfully evoking the potent emotional underpinnings that propel
this saga. By the end of the four-hour film, premiering tonight and
Monday, the viewer thoroughly feels the bittersweet nature of the
victory posthumously achieved by these extraordinary women.
</P>
<P>
   As narrator Sally Kellerman explains, when these two women were
born in the early 19th century, those of their gender were, like
slaves, considered property, could own nothing of their own when
married and were scarcely allowed educations. They were born into a
classic Catch-22: The political process was the only means to
improving their lives, but since law forbade them from getting
involved in the political process, there wasn't much chance for the
laws getting changed. Would men willingly mess up the sweetheart
deal they had created for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony made for an unlikely
alliance _ Stanton was ebullient, colorfully witty and prodigiously
procreative in her marriage, while Anthony was a taciturn spinster.
Historian Ann Gordon points out, ``It's a little hard to guess how
the chemistry (between them) worked so fast,'' but suggests that
the clever homebound wife supplied the spinster who was free to
travel with the words and theories of the suffragette movement to
disseminate to others. And author Kathleen Barry notes, ``There
would be no women's history without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Incremental victories came with a cost, and losses _
particularly at the end of the Civil War, when African-American men
were accorded the rights of free white men but women were summarily
snubbed _ were frequent. Together, Stanton and Anthony helped form
the National American Woman Suffrage Association, but as Stanton
became increasingly radical in her beliefs, Anthony assumed a kind
of tunnel vision, keeping her eyes set on one goal: Women's right
to vote. Anthony's persistence of vision sometimes meant joining
forces with dubious allies _ she looked the other way as
African-American women were banned from outposts of the
organization run by religious Southern women, seriously
compromising the movement; Stanton's progressive views eventually
got her booted from the very organization she created. The
political intrigue is endlessly fascinating.

IN ARTISTS' PRINTS, WORK AND PLAY 
</HEADLINE>

 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the big destination for print lovers this
weekend is the ninth annual Print Fair, sponsored by the
International Fine Print Dealers Association, there is no shortage
of opportunities to see the fine art of the printmaker elsewhere.
Besides the fair at the Seventh Regiment Armory, a number of
galleries are mounting shows of their own that will last longer
than the three-day event on Park Avenue. Occurring uptown and down,
they range from the work of established modern masters to that of
up-and-coming artists whose names do not yet ring a bell.
</P>
<P>
   And to swell the bounty, a smaller Artists Publications and
Editions Fair, with publishers of artists' books and editions from
here and abroad participating, is being held concurrently in SoHo,
at Printed Matter, 77 Wooster St., and Brooke Alexander Editions,
59 Wooster St. Here is a selection of some of the gallery shows.
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR WESLEY DOW.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most radical American printmakers at the turn of the
century was Arthur Wesley Dow (1857-1922), who transmuted the art
of Japanese woodcuts into his own lyrical expression: unpeopled,
near-abstract landscapes of stylized forms subtly infused with
color. An influential teacher, he trained many students and also
made his mark as a painter. This show contains more than 60
woodcuts and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Dow grew up in the picturesque fishing village of Ipswich on the
Massachusetts coast. Ipswich and environs were his lifelong
subject: river, bridge, fishing shacks, foliage and even the
weather. Captivated by the work of the Japanese woodblock print
master Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), Dow abandoned Western
realism early on for the flat, simplified forms of the Japanese,
combining European elements with Japanese techniques of line, form,
color and ``notan,'' the harmonious arrangements of dark and light.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lyrical works on view at Hirschl &AMP; Adler are ``Wild
Apple Tree'' (1891-93), a narrow vertical print that puts a
new-blooming apple tree in the foreground, dominating a tight view
of a river's curves as it winds through marshes to a distant
horizon. The rhythmic, reductive color scheme _ pink, tan and deep
gray-green _ is strikingly modern.
</P>
<P>
   A later, even more abstract woodcut, ``Moonrise'' (circa 1915),
is virtually a tone poem, with the simple shapes of a brilliant
moon in a starry sky above the long, linear shape of an island, the
moon's glow given staccato reflection in a pool of still, dark
water. More of Dow's work will be presented starting on Tuesday at
the Spanierman Gallery, 45 East 58th St., containing paintings,
prints and photographs by Dow and his students, including Georgia
O'Keeffe and Max Weber.
</P>
<P>
   PICASSO.
</P>
<P>
   Your eyes may glaze at the thought of yet another Picasso show,
but the one at Marc Rosen Fine Art at the Allison Gallery is a
connoisseur's delight. An overview of the artist's intaglio prints
(a wide grouping from 1904 to 1968 that comprises works made from
inked depressions etched or engraved in the plate), it focuses on
two monumental achievements: the early Blue Period series ``Les
Saltimbanques'' and the classic ``Vollard Suite'' of 1930-36.
What's more, the works shown here are primarily from a single
collection, first assembled by Picasso's publisher and dealer
Ambroise Vollard and supplemented after Vollard's death in 1939 by
the dealer and connoisseur Henri Petiet. Most appear in the freshly
minted state in which they left the printers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``Saltimbanques,'' there is the famous etching
``Frugal Repast'' of 1904, depicting an attenuated gypsy couple
seated at a table before a symbolic still life of bread and wine.
This full-bodied proof was pulled before the plate was faced with
steel to make it more durable, and the impression is deeper and
sharper than those of the edition. A sprightlier work from the same
suite is the satirical ``Salome'' (1905), depicting the nude Salome
dancing before Herod as the head of John the Baptist lies on a
plate in the lap of a servant.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``Vollard Suite,'' Picasso's prints began to reflect
less the subjects of his paintings than they did his daydreams and
fantasies. The lusty minotaur, half-bull, half-man, enters the
picture, as in the richly printed ``Bacchanalian Scene With a
Minotaur'' (1933), showing the shaggy creature hoisting a glass as
a hirsute reveler snuggles between two zaftig nudes. Picasso's last
wife, Jacqueline Roque, whom he met in 1953, was the subject of
many later works. One of the most vibrantly printed images in the
show is ``Bust of a Woman With a Ponytail, Jacqueline'' (1955), an
aquatint produced by Picasso with the spontaneity of a brushed
drawing. Proving again that Picasso had the same wizardry with
prints as with everything else he laid his hand to, this is not a
show to skip.
</P>
<P>
   MATISSE
</P>
<P>
   In his graphic work, Matisse's focus was the model, always
female and dressed exotically or not at all. And he often turned
from painting to printmaking. Most of the 25 black-and-white
lithographs in a show at Pace Master Prints were done in the '20s,
but a group of four dated 1913 represents a peak of his vaunted
draftsmanship: faces and torsos evoked with the deceptively simple
but eloquent strokes that are the hallmark of his drawing style.
</P>
<P>
   Later, living in Nice, Matisse made more than 100 lithographs
between 1922 and 1929, working the crayon to produce subtle
gradations in tone and contrast and often using the same themes as
those in his paintings. Among the beauties here are sensual
renderings of women in Turkish costume, like ``Odalisque With a
Bowl of Fruits'' (1925), in which harem pants and a casually open
embroidered top adorn a model who sits cross-legged on a floor mat,
against a busy background of flowers and stripes. But the show's
most striking print is ``White Fox'' (1929), a high-contrast view
of a woman who regards the viewer with soulful eyes and a jaded
stare, her shoulders wrapped in a luxuriant cloud of fur. The
richly inked image combines with the whiteness of the paper to
create a work of startling intensity.
</P>
<P>
   NANCY GRAVES
</P>
<P>
   Cosmological imagery runs through the color prints of Nancy
Graves (1940-1995), a sculptor and painter who was also adept at
graphic expression. Working in a wide range of modes, from
lithography to etching, aquatint and screenprint _ sometimes all in
the same endeavor _ she made surreal fusions of motifs from sources
like the Bible, classical sculpture, mythology, solar charts and
insect, plant and animal life, combining the results with abstract
passages and visual incidents of her own invention.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Iconostasis of Water'' (1992) at Pace Prints, the heads of
ancient gods, ur-fish and lines denoting water mingle with marks of
gestural abstraction to dramatic effect, and in ``Hercules, Eve and
the Parting of Night and Day'' (1982), a huge, scaly golden carp
dominates a melange of Egyptian hieroglyphs, solar images,
transparent nematodes and tiny figures, human and animal, with lots
of white space in between. Despite the heavy title, it has an
affecting lightness of being.

`Medal of Honor'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Also inspiring but laced with far more testosterone is ``Medal
of Honor,'' one of those patriotic productions that seem to get
made more through Ted Turner than anyone else in Hollywood. Less
than 3,500 of the 50 million men who have served in the American
military have been given the Congressional Medal of Honor, which
venerates acts so heroically courageous that more than half are
awarded posthumously. This hourlong documentary examines a few
nearly impossible acts of bravery in ordinary men.
</P>
<P>
   Having been shot twice and hit with shrapnel, medic Clarence
Sasser labored seven hours under fire in an ambush in Vietnam,
rescuing fellow soldiers. Henry Erwin grabbed a fiery flare that
exploded in his plane in World War II, dragged it in his scorching
hand to a hole in the plane and threw it out, disfiguring himself
but saving the lives of the entire crew. Ron Rosser saved dozens of
fellow GIs in Korea by jumping into a trench filled with the enemy
and dispatching them after his unit had been ambushed. And James
Stockdale, best known unfortunately for his quixotic run for public
office with Ross Perot, endured seven torturous years in a
Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp without succumbing to his captors.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enactments try too hard to parrot ``Saving Private Ryan'' in
some instances and are overused in general, and the diffident,
banal narration (``War is all about risk'') doesn't come close to
capturing the heights of heroism these men achieved. The stories of
these men scarcely need production-value accessorizing _ they're
genuinely riveting in their own rights. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Shake, Rattle and Roll' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' _ a miniseries that should be
considerably more mini _ has a look and feel of a '50s teen B
flick, only filled with idiotic revisionist touches. Bonnie
Somerville _ her real name is more appropriate for this material
than her character's actual moniker _ plays Lyne Danner, a freshly
scrubbed, strong-willed woman who introduces ``race music'' to a
sleepy Midwestern town, and in particular, to dreamboat-aspiring
singer Tyler Hart (Brad Hawkins).
</P>
<P>
   Told this new music is called rock 'n' roll, Tyler inanely
replies, ``Cool music _ dumb name, though.'' Ty's bland girlfriend,
on the other hand, tries to dissuade him from playing in a band
with a line that wouldn't have passed muster in a teensploitation
movie from that era: ``It's wild music, Tyler _ it's what juvenile
delinquents listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that Tyler and Lyne hook up _ or that their
first single is a hit, or that bumps occur on the road to success.
A record label expresses interest in Tyler, belittling the rest of
the group, then molds him to its fatuous specifications. This leads
to much inner torment over selling out, a rather specious argument
for that period, generally, and for Tyler particularly, since
there's not exactly what you'd call conviction to his band's tunes.
It takes a whopping four hours to relate what was essentially the
plot of one episode of ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Atrocious dialogue explains the characters, after a fashion:
``Lyne Danner has more class in her little toe than Noreen Bixlar
has in both those Double-D headlights you love!'' ``If you're not
going to go to school, the least you can do is stay home and help
with your retarded brother.'' Thuddingly expository lines likewise
help us keep track of where we are in history: ``I just keep
thinking about Buddy Holly, Richie and Bopper going down in that
plane last week.'' ``Listen to Bob Dylan _ a hard rain's gonna
fall, and I plan to be out in it until it washes us clean!''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler and Lyne are the Forrest Gump of '50s pop, variously _
and, usually, hokily _ encountering Elvis Presley, Little Richard,
Jackie Wilson, Eddie Cochran, B.B. King, Neil Sedaka and other
musical icons. The depiction of the era's race relations is shallow
and simplistic, which might be explicable if director/co-writer
Mike Robe had simply chosen to sidestep the messiness of the issue;
instead, he blunders headlong into it, making everyone look
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' is a cliche-riddled
show-biz rise-and-fall story, padded mercilessly to miniseries
length by repeated performances of new songs in an attempt to
convince you to buy the soundtrack CD, much like Tom Hanks'
similarly plotted, '60s-themed film, ``That Thing You Do!'' In
fact, you could watch (BEGIN ITAL)both(END ITAL) ``That Thing You
Do!'' and the ``Johnny Bravo'' episode of ``The Brady Bunch,'' and
still save 90 minutes off ``Shake, Rattle and Roll's'' running
time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`The X-Files' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' returns for what will likely be its last season,
what with David Duchovny suing his bosses and creator Chris Carter
miffed that Fox yanked his new show, ``Harsh Realm,'' without
giving the show much of a chance. This series lost a little steam
in the wake of the release of its movie last year, which posed more
questions than it answered, and got fans wondering whether the
mythology could even be resolved satisfactorily after having been
expanded to such unwieldy proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Last season ended (inevitably, if you think about it) with
Mulder (Duchovny) going bonkers and Scully (Gillian Anderson)
discovering yet more of the kind of evidence of an extraterrestrial
presence on Earth that always seems to disappear before the
authorities or public can see them. The season premiere is
basically just a stopgap to a resolution that'll come a week or two
down the line, but it audaciously and portentously suggests that
the origin of human life and all that science can't explain is tied
to early alien visitors. The evidence, of course, disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny spends the entire episode in a catatonic stupor,
looking as though a particularly rabid fan had just explained all
of the series' plot convolutions to him in one sitting. The good
news, however, is that with ``Harsh Realm'' out of the way, Carter
can devote his time to ensuring that this season of ``The
X-Files,'' if it is indeed its last, will be particularly
memorable. &QL;

   LOUISE BOURGEOIS
</P>
<P>
   Although better known as a sculptor and installation artist,
Louise Bourgeois has had a long and highly productive engagement
with printmaking. At Galerie Lelong, she shows work from three
current projects inspired as always by autobiography, her own and
others'.
</P>
<P>
   One project is ``Metamorfosis,'' an artist's book conceived in
collaboration with Maria Fluxa, a writer and publisher from
Majorca. Issued in an edition of 85, this cloth-bound tome evokes
Ms. Fluxa's life from childhood to maturity with wit and
psychological insight. In photos, drawings, combinations thereof
and seven original etchings of psychologically fraught Bourgeois
themes, she relates Ms. Fluxa's life story to that of her own sense
of isolation in a male-dominated world.
</P>
<P>
   Wit and pith combine in another project, ``What Is the Shape of
This Problem?,'' a group of nine sentences excerpted from Ms.
Bourgeois' diary, each with an accompanying lithograph. ``The
telephone call from the slammer'' and ``I pick on everyone, dead or
alive'' are examples, paired with abstract imagery resembling
mazes, thumbprints, webs and whorls within whorls.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view is a series of nine drypoint etchings that probe
memories of childhood and family. Some are very simple: four
childlike houses connected by lines of string; others more
complicated, like a woman caught within the confines of a cracked
egg. Ms. Bourgeois makes no bones about her work; it's all about
herself but very much to everyone's point.
</P>
<P>
   ELLSWORTH KELLY
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Matisse! Ellsworth Kelly's spare, brilliant
black-and-white lithographs of leaf and flower forms evoke a sense
of the French master's distillation of sensual shapes with the most
minimal, most elegant of lines. Shown at Susan Sheehan Gallery are
selections from five groups of work, done in separate projects from
1973 to 1997 with two different print publishers, all conveying the
essence of plant structure in a precise visual language.
</P>
<P>
   A painter and sculptor noted for hard-edged, geometrically
shaped fields of monotonal color, Kelly uses a spirited figurative
line in the graphic work here. He maneuvers it in sure, swift
gestures on smooth, glassy lithograph transfer paper to delineate
the heart shapes and clustering of the leaves of a woodland plant,
the protuberant thrust of a daffodil blossom, the erotic cups and
voluptuous leaves of a calla lily. The play of the delicate black
line on white, the perfect balance of the image on the paper and
the downright dazzlement of the drawing make this show a quiet
sensation.
</P>

<P>
   Eric Fischl's 23 energetic monotypes and monoprints at Mary Ryan
Gallery were made during four different periods, dating back to
1986. They relate, by and large, to his paintings and sculptures.
Monotypes and monoprints, images painted on glass or metal, then
printed on paper, allow for only one impression, since most of the
ink is transferred from plate to paper at first pull. Hence their
status as ``unique'' in contrast to prints made in editions.
</P>
<P>
   The prints here, with their lush brushwork and artful deployment
of figures, have a sensuous appeal, and their minimal backgrounds
refreshingly reduce the narrative burden of Fischl's large
canvases. The biggest work in the show, a painting-sized print from
1992, for example, shows a playful group of people bathing. The
focus is on the interplay of the figures without the distraction of
background detail. Even more minimally treated are those in a group
of monoprints dated 1996, each of which captures the antics of two
people cavorting in plain white space.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnard-like nude portraits of the artist April Gornik bathing
in a tub, done in 1997, actually pre-date her appearance in
Fischl's show of painted portraits last spring at the Mary Boone
Gallery. Less fleshly and more spontaneous than the painted
version, they add luster to an appealing show.

   `WHY DRAW A LANDSCAPE?'
</P>
<P>
   Based on a new book, ``Why Draw a Landscape?'' by Kathan Brown,
director of the California publisher of etchings Crown Point Press,
Karen McCready Fine Art presents landscape prints by 11 artists,
including Ed Ruscha, Bryan Hunt, April Gornik, Joan Nelson and Jane
Freilicher. They work in styles ranging from Conceptual to realism,
and the show is full of small treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Freilicher's etching, ``Late Afternoon, Southampton,'' is a
view over autumn-tinged land to waves of mauve sky above a pinkish
line of sunset; Ruscha's ``Van Ness, Santa Monica, Vine, Melrose,''
depicts with deadpan humor a labeled grid of criss-crossing streets
in black-and-white gravure, and Ms. Nelson's ``Untitled (No. 2),''
a fairy-tale landscape with trees and rocks, could be a vignette
from a northern European Old Master.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD SERRA
</P>
<P>
   The 15 large, complex and highly textured etchings at Gemini
G.E.L. at Joni Moisant Weyl relate to two of Richard Serra's
sculpture series, the massive ``Rounds'' of forged solid steel and
the stunning ``Torqued Ellipses,'' recently shown in New York, Los
Angeles and Bilbao. All are in black and white. The ``rounds,''
named for such jazz performers as Bessie Smith and John Coltrane,
range from big, circular splotches on spattered grounds to
smooth-edged circles balanced in cleaner white fields. The
``ellipses'' take the form of stretched ovals, some linked, some
solitary, also on spattered white grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the amazing thing about these densely black images are their
almost 3-D textures, produced by a complex process that involved
squeezing molten material onto a plate laid on the floor and
pressing it through an aluminum screen, a task often performed by
the sculptor's feet. Days of chemical ``biting'' of each plate
followed. The results are forceful works that can still only hint
at the muscle of Serra's achievements in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP SHOW
</P>
<P>
   The work of six painters, sculptors and printmakers: Alison
Saar, Lesley Dill, Tony Fitzpatrick, Thomas Huck, Terri Zupanc and
John Waters, is shown at 568 Broadway by four print publishers,
Graphicstudio/USF, Riverhouse, Landfall Press and Diane Villani
Editions, who share space under the group title Quartet Editions.
The standouts include Huck's big, Expressionist-style woodcuts in
black and white, satirically devoted to carnivals of mayhem and
revelry (Landfall); Fitzpatrick's small, infinitely detailed
fantasy world in etching and aquatint whose surreal imagery fuses
life and art (Diane Villani), and Lesley Dill's contributions, a
work in photogravure and one in encaustic that convey her
preoccupations with words, the body and the metaphorical use of
thread (Graphicstudio/USF).
</P>
<P>
   STERNBERG AND HIS CIRCLE
</P>
<P>
   Assembled to celebrate the 95th birthday of the realist painter
and printmaker Harry Sternberg, a New Yorker transplanted to
California, a show at Susan Teller Gallery includes work not only
by the artist himself but also by friends, students and colleagues
at the Art Students League, where he taught from 1934 to 1966.
Several prints stand out among the mix of paintings and graphic
works that constitute the show, among them Isabel Bishop's
black-and-white etching ``Conversation'' (1931), a vignette of two
fedora-hatted toughs talking on a street corner; Rockwell Kent's
streamlined, Stygian wood engraving with linoleum tint block
``Northern Night'' (1930), a mountain-and-river landscape with a
large recumbent figure, and Sternberg's own black-and-white etching
``Subway Construction'' (1927), an artful meld of brawny men and
machinery in a sweaty dig.

   But even parents who want to use the V-chip will find the system
difficult to set up. With most televisions, the V-chip can be
programmed by pressing the menu button on the remote control. (On
some models, the chip is programmed with controls on the surface of
the television set). The parent chooses a personal identification
number, or lock code, which allows the parent to activate,
deactivate and change the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can select as few or as many of the six program ratings
in the scale that they want to allow. For example, by selecting
only programs that are rated TVY, (for children of all ages), any
program with a TVY7 rating (for children age 7 and older), up to
TV14 (for children 14 and older) and TVMA (for Mature Audience
Only), will be blocked out. Without the lock code, children cannot
change the programming selections.
</P>
<P>
   Content descriptors, which were added to the age-based ratings
in negotiations with child advocacy groups in July 1997, signify
the presence of violence (V), sexual situations (S), coarse
language (L), suggestive dialogue (D) or fantasy violence (FV),
which is defined as ``fighting presented in an exciting _ even
thrilling _ way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not indecipherable, it takes time to understand how to
use the V-chip and ratings system. When presented on the screen and
in program listings, the boxes of letters and numbers for the
rating resemble something one might have to recite in front of an
eye doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the system's complexity contributes to
consumers' ambivalence. ``The V-Chip's user interface and the
rating systems are not particularly intuitive or convenient,'' said
Jay Srivatsa, senior industry analyst at Dataquest, a research firm
in San Jose, Calif. ``If people can't figure out how to use it
within a few minutes, they might not bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the system is far from perfect, parents need to learn
how to use it, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center
for Media Education, which publishes a guide to the V-chip
(www.vchipeducation.org). ``Parents are going to have to get used
to this alphabet soup of guides telling them what's in the content
as we enter the digital age, and Internet content becomes available
on TV,'' he said. ``The V-chip is the first formal development in
what will be a heavily rated media world.''

BURNS TURNS KEEN EYE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Burns may take some heat for devoting 18{ hours to baseball
and only four to the founders of the American women's rights
movement, but let's cut him some slack. ``Not for Ourselves
Alone,'' Burns' latest documentary for PBS, is as powerful as
Elizabeth Cady Stanton's words, as impressive as Susan B. Anthony's
resolve, and just the right length for anyone who isn't pursuing a
doctorate in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Airing Sunday and Monday nights, the film by Burns and his
colleague Paul Barnes is classic Burnsiana. The slow pace ever
deliberate, the fiddle music ever melancholy, ``Not for Ourselves
Alone'' plays into the hands of critics who find Burns' work
slightly less exciting than reorganizing the sock drawer. But
anyone thirsting for knowledge and willing to back off the
attention-span gas pedal for two nights will revel in the story of
two women devoted to each other and to a cause that might still be
straining at the starting gate if it weren't for their zeal and the
happy circumstance of their being introduced to each other in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   As different as two people could be, Stanton and Anthony forged
a 50-year friendship _ one historian calls it a marriage _ that
weathered contentious disagreement and great disappointment. Their
goal was a simple one: the granting of equal rights to all women in
America. Stanton, who married and had seven children, and Anthony,
who never married and often criticized ``babymaking,'' complemented
each other in a way that made them stronger together than apart.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of a Burns film is its scholarly research, which
fosters an exquisite attention to detail and gems like this from
Stanton's personal papers: ``To have drunkards, idiots,
horse-racing, rum-selling rowdies, ignorant foreigners and silly
boys fully recognized while we are ourselves thrust out from all
the rights that belong to citizens is too grossly insulting to be
longer quietly submitted to.'' And this from Anthony: ``The old
idea that man was made for himself, and woman for him, that he is
the oak, she the vine, he the head, she the heart, he the great
conservator of wisdom, she of love, will be reverently laid aside
with other long since exploded philosophies of the ignorant past.''
</P>
<P>
   The film goes well beyond the archives of the two women to bring
their stories to glorious life in an age when women still aren't
equal. It's an achievement that is enlightening, humbling and
chastising.
</P>

`Annie' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the passing of days, or decades: Few will
probably even blink, let alone cry blasphemy, that the latest
incarnation of ``Annie'' features an adorable moppet with red hair
utterly bereft of curls for most of tonight's ABC telefilm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Orphan Annie,'' the comic strip serving as source
material for tonight's extravaganza, has long sat unmolested in the
remainder bin of pop culture. Its iconography _ Annie and pet dog
Sandy's creepily pupil-free eyes, Sandy's ubiquitous cry of ``Arf''
and Annie's of ``Leapin' Lizards,'' Daddy Warbucks' fantasy
opulence _ is virtually forgotten or meaningless for today's
audiences. So is reviving ``Annie'' an exercise in nostalgia for
the innocence of the Depression era _ or for '70s Broadway
musicals?
</P>
<P>
   There's not a lot of point in remaking ``Annie'' in 1999, except
for the fact that the bloated 1982 movie didn't do the musical
justice _ and the simple verity that the musical boasts what
remains an impossibly infectious score. Tonight's version from
``The Wonderful World of Disney'' gets right everything that the
earlier cinematic version got wrong _ it keeps the spectacle
manageable and not overwhelming and, above all, focuses on the
songs _ ``It's a Hard-Knock Life,'' ``I Think I'm Gonna Like It
Here'' and, of course, the show-stopper ``Tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old newcomer Alicia Morton plays the mischievous
orphan, stranded in a life of servitude in a run-down orphanage run
(down, of course) by the harridan Miss Hannigan (Kathy Bates).
Depression-era billionaire Daddy Warbucks (Victor Garber), as a
public-relations stunt, attempts to adopt Annie, but she still
pines for her real parents, so Warbucks announces a nationwide
search for them. Hannigan's ne'er-do-well brother Rooster (Alan
Cumming) and his dizzy squeeze Lily (Kristin Chenoweth) plot to
pose as said parents to grab Warbucks' generous financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   The one misstep in all this comes when the filmmakers attempt to
give Bates, their biggest star, more to do and have her attempt the
parent-trap ruse with Rooster instead. Logically, it makes little
sense _ wouldn't a savvy kid like Annie suss out her tormentor of
the past decade in a New York minute? _ while logistically it
deprives colorful Tony-winner Chenoweth of a prime opportunity to
chew scenery.
</P>
<P>
   My young stepdaughters immediately declared this version
superior to the 1982 production starring Albert Finney (who reminds
them too much of Austin Powers' archenemy Dr. Evil _ they preferred
Garber's smoother, less gruff performance). They noted that
multiple Tony winner Audra McDonald, as Warbucks' private
secretary, has far superior pipes than Ann Reinking, who played the
role in the film, and preferred Morton's cute-but-not-(BEGIN
ITAL)too(END ITAL)-cute turn as Annie to her predecessor Aileen
Quinn's. They preferred director/choreographer Rob Marshall's
streamlined work to John Huston's heavy lifting in the earlier
film. They're actually pretty savvy little critics. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Blessed with an innate sense of what in our history is both
significant and makes for stirring drama, Ken Burns has long been
America's premier historical documentarian. His work not only
brings his topic to vivid life but also massages the usually
unwieldy subject matter into a compelling narrative with a skill
that matches Hollywood's best storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &AMP;
Susan B. Anthony'' examines a woefully underappreciated chapter in
our nation's chronicles _ the suffragette movement _ relating a
story that spans a century in a concise, taut fashion while
powerfully evoking the potent emotional underpinnings that propel
this saga. By the end of the four-hour film, premiering tonight and
Monday, the viewer thoroughly feels the bittersweet nature of the
victory posthumously achieved by these extraordinary women.
</P>
<P>
   As narrator Sally Kellerman explains, when these two women were
born in the early 19th century, those of their gender were, like
slaves, considered property, could own nothing of their own when
married and were scarcely allowed educations. They were born into a
classic Catch-22: The political process was the only means to
improving their lives, but since law forbade them from getting
involved in the political process, there wasn't much chance for the
laws getting changed. Would men willingly mess up the sweetheart
deal they had created for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony made for an unlikely
alliance _ Stanton was ebullient, colorfully witty and prodigiously
procreative in her marriage, while Anthony was a taciturn spinster.
Historian Ann Gordon points out, ``It's a little hard to guess how
the chemistry (between them) worked so fast,'' but suggests that
the clever homebound wife supplied the spinster who was free to
travel with the words and theories of the suffragette movement to
disseminate to others. And author Kathleen Barry notes, ``There
would be no women's history without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Incremental victories came with a cost, and losses _
particularly at the end of the Civil War, when African-American men
were accorded the rights of free white men but women were summarily
snubbed _ were frequent. Together, Stanton and Anthony helped form
the National American Woman Suffrage Association, but as Stanton
became increasingly radical in her beliefs, Anthony assumed a kind
of tunnel vision, keeping her eyes set on one goal: Women's right
to vote. Anthony's persistence of vision sometimes meant joining
forces with dubious allies _ she looked the other way as
African-American women were banned from outposts of the
organization run by religious Southern women, seriously
compromising the movement; Stanton's progressive views eventually
got her booted from the very organization she created. The
political intrigue is endlessly fascinating.

<P>
   Burns employs his usual stylistic gambit _ actors expressively
reading period letters and manuscripts over close-ups of evocative,
sepia-toned antique photos adorned by simple, poignant acoustic
music. It's particularly effective here, since both Anthony and
particularly Stanton were not just articulate but even poetic in
making their case; their eloquent words compensate for the paucity
of archival live-action footage he has to work with. Burns artfully
re-creates Stanton's triumphant final speech on the issue, ``The
Solitude of Self,'' a brilliantly argued and wrenchingly emotional
personal assessment of the necessity for female self-empowerment.
``Not for Ourselves Alone'' is inspirational and insightful, a
worthy addition to Burns' canon of Americana.

`Medal of Honor' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Also inspiring but laced with far more testosterone is ``Medal
of Honor,'' one of those patriotic productions that seem to get
made more through Ted Turner than anyone else in Hollywood. Less
than 3,500 of the 50 million men who have served in the American
military have been given the Congressional Medal of Honor, which
venerates acts so heroically courageous that more than half are
awarded posthumously. This hourlong documentary examines a few
nearly impossible acts of bravery in ordinary men.
</P>
<P>
   Having been shot twice and hit with shrapnel, medic Clarence
Sasser labored seven hours under fire in an ambush in Vietnam,
rescuing fellow soldiers. Henry Erwin grabbed a fiery flare that
exploded in his plane in World War II, dragged it in his scorching
hand to a hole in the plane and threw it out, disfiguring himself
but saving the lives of the entire crew. Ron Rosser saved dozens of
fellow GIs in Korea by jumping into a trench filled with the enemy
and dispatching them after his unit had been ambushed. And James
Stockdale, best known unfortunately for his quixotic run for public
office with Ross Perot, endured seven torturous years in a
Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp without succumbing to his captors.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enactments try too hard to parrot ``Saving Private Ryan'' in
some instances and are overused in general, and the diffident,
banal narration (``War is all about risk'') doesn't come close to
capturing the heights of heroism these men achieved. The stories of
these men scarcely need production-value accessorizing _ they're
genuinely riveting in their own rights. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Shake, Rattle and Roll' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' _ a miniseries that should be
considerably more mini _ has a look and feel of a '50s teen B
flick, only filled with idiotic revisionist touches. Bonnie
Somerville _ her real name is more appropriate for this material
than her character's actual moniker _ plays Lyne Danner, a freshly
scrubbed, strong-willed woman who introduces ``race music'' to a
sleepy Midwestern town, and in particular, to dreamboat-aspiring
singer Tyler Hart (Brad Hawkins).
</P>
<P>
   Told this new music is called rock 'n' roll, Tyler inanely
replies, ``Cool music _ dumb name, though.'' Ty's bland girlfriend,
on the other hand, tries to dissuade him from playing in a band
with a line that wouldn't have passed muster in a teensploitation
movie from that era: ``It's wild music, Tyler _ it's what juvenile
delinquents listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that Tyler and Lyne hook up _ or that their
first single is a hit, or that bumps occur on the road to success.
A record label expresses interest in Tyler, belittling the rest of
the group, then molds him to its fatuous specifications. This leads
to much inner torment over selling out, a rather specious argument
for that period, generally, and for Tyler particularly, since
there's not exactly what you'd call conviction to his band's tunes.
It takes a whopping four hours to relate what was essentially the
plot of one episode of ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Atrocious dialogue explains the characters, after a fashion:
``Lyne Danner has more class in her little toe than Noreen Bixlar
has in both those Double-D headlights you love!'' ``If you're not
going to go to school, the least you can do is stay home and help
with your retarded brother.'' Thuddingly expository lines likewise
help us keep track of where we are in history: ``I just keep
thinking about Buddy Holly, Richie and Bopper going down in that
plane last week.'' ``Listen to Bob Dylan _ a hard rain's gonna
fall, and I plan to be out in it until it washes us clean!''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler and Lyne are the Forrest Gump of '50s pop, variously _
and, usually, hokily _ encountering Elvis Presley, Little Richard,
Jackie Wilson, Eddie Cochran, B.B. King, Neil Sedaka and other
musical icons. The depiction of the era's race relations is shallow
and simplistic, which might be explicable if director/co-writer
Mike Robe had simply chosen to sidestep the messiness of the issue;
instead, he blunders headlong into it, making everyone look
foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' is a cliche-riddled
show-biz rise-and-fall story, padded mercilessly to miniseries
length by repeated performances of new songs in an attempt to
convince you to buy the soundtrack CD, much like Tom Hanks'
similarly plotted, '60s-themed film, ``That Thing You Do!'' In
fact, you could watch (BEGIN ITAL)both(END ITAL) ``That Thing You
Do!'' and the ``Johnny Bravo'' episode of ``The Brady Bunch,'' and
still save 90 minutes off ``Shake, Rattle and Roll's'' running
time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`The X-Files' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' returns for what will likely be its last season,
what with David Duchovny suing his bosses and creator Chris Carter
miffed that Fox yanked his new show, ``Harsh Realm,'' without
giving the show much of a chance. This series lost a little steam
in the wake of the release of its movie last year, which posed more
questions than it answered, and got fans wondering whether the
mythology could even be resolved satisfactorily after having been
expanded to such unwieldy proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Last season ended (inevitably, if you think about it) with
Mulder (Duchovny) going bonkers and Scully (Gillian Anderson)
discovering yet more of the kind of evidence of an extraterrestrial
presence on Earth that always seems to disappear before the
authorities or public can see them. The season premiere is
basically just a stopgap to a resolution that'll come a week or two
down the line, but it audaciously and portentously suggests that
the origin of human life and all that science can't explain is tied
to early alien visitors. The evidence, of course, disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny spends the entire episode in a catatonic stupor,
looking as though a particularly rabid fan had just explained all
of the series' plot convolutions to him in one sitting. The good
news, however, is that with ``Harsh Realm'' out of the way, Carter
can devote his time to ensuring that this season of ``The
X-Files,'' if it is indeed its last, will be particularly
memorable. &QL;

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,' starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener,
Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to
the fun house: In this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a
stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a
technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder
workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.'' Cusack plays a
discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Malkovich's
mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill
after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on
and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BEST MAN,' starring Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long
and Harold Perrineau. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (R, 118 minutes).
This feel-good ensemble film turns Diggs into a spectacled but
hunky novelist en route to a friend's wedding. There he finds
temptation in the form of an old flame and a lot of genial guy talk
about the meaning of marriage. No problem here is too complicated
to be settled by a good-humored dance scene. Another demonstration
that current movies about upscale black characters have much more
solid traditional values than ones about catty white teen-agers
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,' starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia
Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly.
Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile
film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop
garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently
hellish ambience for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But
Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his ``Taxi Driver'' days,
and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more
contemplative than it looks. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance
as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a
major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DOUBLE JEOPARDY,' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a
touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington state
to the French Quarter of New Orleans, Ms. Judd plays a woman who is
free to kill her husband because she has already gone to prison for
the crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away
with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her
character becomes less of a victim. In this coed homage to ``The
Fugitive,'' Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a
knack for barking orders. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it
takes a line like ``I feel like I've grown in the last six years''
to signal the passage of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `EARTH,' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and Maia
Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes). It is 1947
and India is about to explode into ethnic violence as British
colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into two nations,
mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These momentous
changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the 8-year-old daughter
of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old friends become
deadly enemies. Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's
beautiful Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's
child's-eye view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FIGHT CLUB,' starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena
Bonham Carter. Directed by David Fincher (R, 135 minutes). The
sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of this grunge
parable means to hit raw nerves. Making a tougher but less
stomach-turning film than his earlier ``Seven,'' Fincher taps into
the nexus of computer-age malevolent fantasy and attempts to
psychoanalyze an entire culture in ways that aren't entirely clear
until the film's whammy of a denouement. A reckless but fascinating
attempt, expertly acted, to make sense of contemporary frustrations
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL,' starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs and
Peter Gallagher. Directed by William Malone (R, 115 minutes). If
the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is
truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do no
better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to the
nearest theater showing this film and strike fearlessly until its
feeble pulse beats no more. This is a sorry reincarnation of the
1950s William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire
played by Vincent Price offered five strangers $10,000 each to
spend the night in a spooky old mansion. In the new version, the
ante for survival has been raised to $1 million apiece. Even
allowing for inflation in the 40 years since the original opened,
the reward in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, according to the
Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. But some things have not
become devalued over the years _ words like junk, for example.
``Hill'' was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959. And it is
still junk (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE LIMEY,' starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the
quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome
throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Stamp, in a
stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early
career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his
daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Fonda's slick Hollywood
hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Soderbergh
resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's ``Point
Blank'' as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from
every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LUCIE AUBRAC,' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel Auteuil.
Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116 minutes).
What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance. When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and
convicted of war crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious
plan for his escape. Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically
intense as Bogey and Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman
is the one who ends up doing the thinking for both of them
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MUSIC OF THE HEART,' starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela
Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110
minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down
Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story
of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single
mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt,
no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth
performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational
enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her
proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other
violin stars. Not a bad reason for Craven to have sidelined the
claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PRINCESS MONONOKE,' with the voices of Billy Crudup, Claire
Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao
Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes). A landmark feat of Japanese
animation from the acknowledged master of the genre. This
complicated, exotically beautiful epic features gods and demons
locked in battle for the future of the forest, and its visions are
breathtakingly rendered. But it is the film's stirring use of
nature, myth and Japanese history that makes it so special. Worth
seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day
and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The
image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is
ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels
and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is
gratifyingly understated (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STORY OF US,' starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Rob Reiner (R, 90 minutes). The first unofficial Jack
Lemmon comedy for the baby boom generation. As an ode to the ups
and downs of middle-aged marriage, this arthritic suburban story is
enough to make single people want to file for divorce. Willis makes
iffy casting in the role of a sensitive father and husband, while
Ms. Pfeiffer is not well served by a role that makes her scream so
hard that her neck turns red. Together, with the help of noisy
friends and acquaintances, these two run through the long history
of a marriage with the help of a criminal set of wigs and
hairpieces. Small talk turns to matters like home repair jobs and
prostate trouble (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY,' starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy
Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least
likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Lynch
rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound
like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a
riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking,
deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall.
And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THREE KINGS,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
The prodigiously talented writer-director of ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster'' has made a much more
ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf
War film has a ``Catch-22'' absurdist edge, but it also has an
oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera
tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American
soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured
gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in
Iraq. There are many clever peripheral touches, but there's
something tamely conventional at the film's core (Maslin).

 &HT;    FORMER POWS TESTIFY ABOUT TORTURE BY ALLEGED CUBANS
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former prisoners of war Thursday recounted the
details of their torture at the hands of alleged Cuban agents
during the Vietnam War and urged a congressional panel to bring the
perpetrators to justice. Although the participation of Cuban agents
in torturing American POWs in Vietnam has never been substantiated,
Robert J. Destatte, (CQ) a senior Defense Department analyst, said
the presence of Caucasian interrogators who spoke with a Spanish
accent led several captured airmen to believe they were Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Destatte told the House Committee on International Relations
that at least one Vietnamese guard referred to the interrogators as
Cubans. Prisoners nicknamed them Fidel, Chico, Pancho and Garcia,
but their identities have never been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The agent dubbed ``Fidel,'' after Cuban President Fidel Castro,
beat U.S. Air Force Maj. Earl G. Cobeil to death at the a POW camp
in Hanoi, said retired Navy Capt. Ray Vohden, one of the prisoners
held at a North Vietnamese camp nicknamed the ``Zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing his two-and-a-half years of torture to the panel,
Vohden said ``the difference between the Vietnamese and Fidel was
that ... once the Vietnamese got what they wanted, they let up, at
least for a while. Not so with Fidel. There wasn't a day that went
by that there weren't threats and warnings to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, Rep. Ilena Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican
from Miami, has led a congressional investigation of the so-called
``Cuban program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the period of August 1967 and August 1968, 19 of our
courageous servicemen were psychologically tortured, some brutally
beaten, by interrogators assessed to be Cuban agents working under
orders from Hanoi,'' Ros-Lehtinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen, a native Cuban, has sent letters to top-ranking
American officials including President Clinton, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, FBI Director Louis Freeh and U.S. Ambassador to
Vietnam Douglas Peterson _ a former POW _ requesting information
about the Cuban program.
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen said that crimes committed by Cuban agents against
American POW's violate the Geneva Convention Act prohibiting war
crimes and the torture of prisoners of war. Ros-Lehtinen said it is
her intention that the U.S. government charge the torturers if they
can be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the CIA believed the profile of ``Fidel'' resembled
that of Luis Perez Jaen, a captain in the Cuban Ministry of
Interior. Desattee testified that when Jaen's picture was
circulated among seven former POWs, only one identified Jaen as
``Fidel.''
</P>
<P>
   Destatte added that earlier this week the Department of Defense
discovered a classified 1973 report on a man also suspected to be
``Fidel,'' listed as Fernando Vecino Alegret, the Cuban minister of
education. Desatte said the agency has not been able to confirm the
origin or reliability of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Two former POWs who had been at the Zoo told the committee they
could not identify a poster-sized photograph of Alegret as
``Fidel.''

PUERTO RICO GOVERNOR STEERS TARGET RANGE DISPUTE TO CENTER STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday Nov. 7)   (Photo on Wieck)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His calm may come from his work as a pediatric
surgeon. His determination may stem from the on-court resolve that
made him a tennis champion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the origins, Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello brings
formidable skills to the fight of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Almost single handedly, the 55-year-old Democrat has transformed
a tragic accident on the U.S. Navy's bombing range on the island of
Vieques into a controversy seizing the attention of the White
House, Congress and the Pentagon _ and rival candidates for the
presidency and Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has been campaigning for more than six months to end
target practice on Vieques after a Marine pilot mistakenly bombed
an observation post on April 19, killing Navy contract security
guard David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, and injuring four civilian
employees on the range.
</P>
<P>
   The target range has been closed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to decide before year-end whether
to reopen the Navy's range _ or grant Puerto Rico's appeal to end
58 years of bombardment on the island, where 9,300 civilians live
within 10 miles of the range.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says that it needs presidential approval by
mid-November if the Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the
aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower is to train on Vieques
before leaving for the Persian Gulf on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   How did Rossello steer such a remote issue to center stage?
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, whose majestic office in San Juan is crowded with
photos of Maga, his wife of 30 years, and the couple's three sons,
took the offensive immediately after firing range accident. Within
hours, the long-time Clinton ally wrote the president to demand a
permanent end to Navy bombing that began in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., a friend of Rossello's, said the
governor reacted with characteristic instinct: ``In cases like
this, Rossello the doctor looks at the children of Vieques and
feels first.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, the son of a psychiatrist who received his medical
training at Yale and Harvard, focused narrowly on the unifying
issue that U.S. armed forces had been dropping live ordnance near
U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vieques is easy to understand if you stick with that _ it's
abuse and arrogance at its worst,'' says Serrano, the senior Puerto
Rican native serving in Congress. ``Rossello stuck with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has not wavered, spurning all entreaties for
negotiations with the Pentagon that include resumption of live fire
training on the island target range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has to accept that ending the bombing on Vieques is
the bottom line for us,'' Rossello reiterated last week.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen appealed anew last Thursday for
direct talks with Rossello, saying: ``We need to have a dialogue on
this.'' Rossello had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Marine Gen. Richard Neal, a member of the four-member
Pentagon review panel that proposed reduced Navy bombardment and
Navy withdrawal from Vieques over five years, says Rossello has won
points with his ``low-key but committed approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Neal says that he's ``surprised and disappointed'' by
Rossello's unwillingness to compromise, adding: ``Now is the time
for discussion in an effort to find common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello underscores his stance by vowing to seek a federal
court injunction to block any resumption of bombing _ even if
ordered by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abide by what we feel is the law of the land,'' Rossello
says. ``It's a fundamental issue for us.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At a time of exploding Hispanic political influence in key
electoral states such as New York, Texas, California, Florida and
Colorado, the governor has forged a formidable coalition of
support. His allies range from Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, head
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson to the AFL-CIO and the nation's major Hispanic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also has won support within the Clinton
administration, much to the chagrin of the Navy and Marine Corps.
The president himself advised national security adviser Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger in a handwritten note dated July 26 that it would
be ``wrong'' for the Navy to resume combat training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, rivals for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination,
have voiced their support for Navy withdrawal from Vieques.
Rossello, the vice president's chief fund raiser in Puerto Rico,
had already raised at least $100,000 for Gore by last July.

   ``Many of us in this room, Mr. Chairman, have not forgotten that

`BUILDING A BRIDGE TO THE 18TH CENTURY': SANCTIMONIOUS REHASH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It's clear from his previous books that Neil Postman hates our
technology-obsessed culture. In such earlier volumes as ``Amusing
Ourselves to Death,'' ``Conscientious Objections'' and
``Technopoly,'' he has assailed television as a corrupting
influence, lamented the decline of the written word and called for
a revamping of our educational system. In his sanctimonious new
book, ``Building a Bridge to the 18th Century,'' he rehashes those
themes under the pretense of looking ``for guidance about what to
do and think in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking for a source of ``good ideas'' from the past ``that
may be revived,'' Postman rejects ancient Greece as being ``too far
from us and too strange and too insular and too unacquainted with
the power of technology'' for us to use ``as a social or
intellectual paradigm.'' He also rejects the God-centered outlook
of the Middle Ages, arguing that ``in a theocratic world, everyone
is a fundamentalist,'' and in a technological, multicultural world,
``fundamentalism is a side issue.'' And so Postman settles, rather
arbitrarily, on the Enlightenment as an archive of ``ideas that
offer a humane direction to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As Postman sees it, the world today consistently comes up short
in comparison with that of the 18th century. We suffer from
meaningless information and data smog; they reveled in knowledge _
or information with purpose and context. We are plagued by
deconstructionists who harp on the problematic relationship of
language to reality; they enjoyed philosophers who believed that
``language was capable of mapping reality.'' We treat our children
as tiny consumers, bombarding them with advertisements and sexually
explicit images; they treated childhood as ``a distinct stage of
life'' to be protected from ``the information environment of
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are these attempts to idealize the 18th century riddled
with rationalizations about child labor, slavery and the oppression
of women, but also Postman's overall argument about looking to the
Enlightenment for instruction is constructed on a series of faulty
premises, all delivered in a snide, holier-than-thou tone.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, he tends to lump the Enlightenment together with
the Romantic reaction against it, arguing that the assault on
reason and the call for more ``poetic insight and humane feeling''
made by the likes of William Blake is ``part of the gift of the
Enlightenment.'' To make matters worse, Postman seems to assume
that it's easy to turn the clock back, that the outlook of an
earlier era can simply be grafted onto a later age.
</P>
<P>
   He writes admiringly, for instance, of the Enlightenment beliefs
that there is a physical and ``moral order'' to the universe, that
``there is a tendency  &UR; as part of our nature &LR;  toward our being
`moral' _ detesting wanton killing, honoring parents, caring for
children, speaking truthfully, loving mercy, overcoming egotism.''
What we must do, he declares, is ``reaffirm the necessity'' of such
transcendent narratives, ``for without one, we can have no sense of
purpose.'' Never mind that the horrors of the 20th century have
undermined faith in such optimistic beliefs, never mind that
advances in science have made us all too aware of the randomness
and chaos in the world. We can simply live, Postman chirpily
suggests, ``as  &UR; if &LR;  there is a transcendent authority.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for someone who embraces ``the age of Reason'' so
ardently, Postman demonstrates a bizarre taste in these pages for
illogical arguments and wildly inflated generalizations. He
dismisses the existential beliefs of Nietzsche and Heidegger by
harping on their personal failings, arguing that ``Nietzsche spent
his last 10 years as a lunatic'' and ``Heidegger fell in love with
Adolf Hitler.'' At the same time, Postman is happy to cite
Rousseau's views on politics and children, even though Rousseau
sent all five of his children to an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   In another chapter, extolling the virtues of print over the
electronic media, he blithely announces that ``it is very hard to
say nothing when employing a written sentence.'' As Postman sees
it, television may have ``made the traditional process of
socializing children impossible''; and professors who endorse the
purchase of high-tech equipment by universities ``have run out of
ideas, or didn't have any to begin with, and by spending their time
talking about how their computers work, they can get by without
their deficiency being noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger statements surface in Postman's discussion of the
role that newspapers should play in the coming century. He suggests
that ``we will have `wisdom pages,''' filled with ``questions
directed at those who offer different bodies of knowledge from
those which the stories themselves confront,'' and that news will
be organized ``not according to the standard format of local,
regional, national and world news, but according to some other
organizing principle _ for example, the seven deadly sins of greed,
lust, envy and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Such flaky ideas, combined with Postman's patronizing tone and
often irrational pronouncements, undermine the few common-sensical
things he has to say in this book about the unreckoned consequences
of technology and the virtues of skeptical intelligence _ things he
has said before and said better in earlier books.

&HT;        ''FLY COMMERCIAL, SAVE MONEY'', SENSENBRENNER TELLS NASA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 Special to space.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.4 (States News Service) -- House Science
Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., sent a letter to
NASA on Thursday urging the agency to make a ``painless'' policy
change by transporting high-level staff on commercial airlines
instead of buying new business jets.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA disagreed with the idea. The agency maintains
commercial airlines would cause scheduling problems, and refuses to
give up using -- and making more of -- its own craft.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner's letter -- addressed to NASA administrator Dan
Goldin -- said NASA was ``ignoring'' a late September NASA
Inspector General report that recommended the agency stop using its
NASA-3 planes to carry personnel to meetings, conferences and
sites. The agency would save taxpayers $44 million by not replacing
three NASA-3 jets with four new ones, and upgrading another, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident the commercial aviation means used by the public
would allow NASA's management to continue doing its job - but at
significantly lower cost to the taxpayer,'' Sensenbrenner said in
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed another Inspector General finding, that NASA's use of
NASA-3 jets for its management violated an Office of Management and
Budget rule that says agencies must use commercial carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government negotiates contract fares with all of the major
airlines,'' Sensenbrenner told States News Service and Space.com.
``The NASA big shots ought to do what is required of everybody
else, including cabinet secretaries.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials contacted for this story refused to comment on
Sensenbrenner's letter until the administrator looks at it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the IG report, the agency refused to use commercial
airlines, arguing that they are not flexible enough. It also
maintained its own management planes are important for its
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The [NASA-owned] aircraft allow us to schedule and conduct
business at multiple sites, often within the course of a day or
two, something that is impossible to accomplish with commercial
airlines,'' the associate administrator for Management Services
Jeffrey Sutton, wrote in a Sept. 27 letter to the IG. ``Mission
Management Aircraft provide us the capability to meet urgent
requirements and to be prepared to meet contingencies associated
with all of NASA's missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA's mission is not to transport people,'' he said. ``I do
not like to see monies that could be used for [research and
development] frittered away on providing more convenient
transportation to people who simply don't like to march through _
airports because its beneath them.''

   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (6-1) at Miami (6-1) (Sunday Night)
</P>
<P>
   The athleticism of quarterback Steve McNair makes the Titans a
formidable offensive team. Tennessee is 7-0 when McNair has a
touchdown pass and run in the same game. The problem for McNair is
that Miami's linebackers, led by Zach Thomas in the middle, are
among the fastest in the league. They'll contain McNair, as well as
George, who has only 500 yards on the ground this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 20-17
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (2-5) at Jets (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brown gets the start for Arizona-remember him? He is the
former Giants quarterback who fans practically booed out of town.
He comes back to New York leading an offense that scored only a
field goal against New England. The Jets have a similar defensively
strong team. If it were not for the hapless Rick Mirer, the Jets
would win by three touchdowns. Instead they win by two.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore (1-6) at Cleveland (1-7)
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are right on track for where most people in the NFL
thought they would finish. Cleveland, at best, is a three-win team.
The only bright spot this year for the expansion Browns has been
the quick, and recent, development of quarterback Tim Couch. Last
week against New Orleans he had a 132.2-passer rating. In fact in
his last three games his rating has been over a 110 and he needs
only two more touchdown passes to break Bernie Kosar's club rookie
record of eight. Meanwhile Baltimore starts Tony Banks at
quarterback, who will throw two interceptions, at least, and make
this game closer than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 24-21
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (5-3) at Washington (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has experienced an offensive power drain the past month.
And no, it is not because teams have started to figure out the
eccentricities of passer Doug Flutie. The real reason is that
explosive receiver Eric Moulds has missed the last few weeks with
an injured hamstring, so Flutie has been missing his best weapon.
Meanwhile, the Redskins have scored 242 points and are on pace for
553.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 35-21
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (3-5) at Green Bay (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the biggest games of the year for Green Bay, and
that sounds strange. It is, after all, only the Bears. But Chicago
always plays the Packers tough, losing both games last year against
their division rival by a total of nine points. More importantly,
the Packers need to find their confidence after Mike Holmgren
completely undressed his old team on Monday night. The Packers will
win unless Favre's banged up thumb starts acting up.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 20-16
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (6-1) at Atlanta (2-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars are having a great season, and the scary part is
their offense is not yet clicking, despite averaging 336.4 yards a
game. What has made Jacksonville a real force is how defensive
coordinator Dom Capers took a unit that was ranked near the bottom
last season and now has them first in yards allowed at just 245.3 a
game. Atlanta's Terance Mathis may lead the conference with 47
catches, but Jacksonville will blitz and pound Chris Chandler into
the turf.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars, 28-9
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (5-2) at Indianapolis (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   The game features two of the surprise teams of the year. The
Colts have a deadly offense and the Chiefs a solid defense. In
games like this one, with two evenly matched teams, go with the one
who causes the turnovers. Kansas City has a plus-13 turnover ratio.
The team already has 13 interceptions, matching last year's total.
Quarterback Peyton Manning is due for one bad game this season and
this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 21-16
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (2-6) at Carolina (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are coming off one of the worst defeats in franchise
history, losing to the Giants in overtime off a blocked pass that
was returned for a touchdown. In the words of Giants linebacker
Jessie Armstead: ``After a loss like that, that team is done.
They're more done than burned rice.'' Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 27-10
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (6-1) at Detroit (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   The hottest team in the league cooled off for a week. St. Louis
lost last week at Tennessee and the hardest part for a team that
has been as successful as the Rams have all year is the fear of
losing two games. Then three. Then four. In other words a second
loss means the beginning of a possible losing streak. Detroit has a
soft defense made for the Rams, who are on pace for 71 touchdowns,
which would break the NFL record of 70 set by Miami in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 35-20
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (3-4) at New Orleans (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   Two good defensive teams that wish they had a quarterback, any
quarterback. The Buccaneers benched Trent Dilfer but Eric Zeier was
just as bad last week against the Lions. In New Orleans, pick your
Billy Joe, Hobert or Tolliver. They're both horrible. Since Tampa
Bay has the better defense, thanks to Warren Sapp, they squeak by.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 12-3
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (1-7) at Seattle (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blake gets the start at quarterback. It doesn't matter. The
Seahawks have them completely outmanned. The only hope for
Cincinnati is that Seattle is still so ecstatic from its win at
Green Bay that they look past the Bengals, the way someone steps
over road kill on a way to cash a check. Holmgren, a coach of the
year candidate, will not let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 31-10
</P>
<P>
   Denver (2-6) at San Diego (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   San Diego is having one of the best seasons of any defense this
decade. The team has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 26 games.
That is the longest streak in the NFL since San Diego did it over
34 games from 1993-1995. The Chargers have also allowed just 16
red-zone trips, tied for the third lowest in the conference. The
Broncos are in offensive shambles and no match for Junior Seau and
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers, 14-9
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (4-3) at San Francisco (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are having problems on offense mainly because of poor
quarterback play. The game will likely come down to the kickers.
Pittsburgh and San Francisco have the only perfect kickers in the
league. Steelers' rookie Kris Brown and San Francisco's Wade Richey
are both 11-of-11. The home team gets the slight advantage.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 16-13
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (4-3) at Minnesota (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   Someone needs to notify ``Unsolved Mysteries'' so they can do a
show on the disappearance of Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss. Last
week against Denver he was a non-factor. Still, the Vikings are a
team to watch. Signing Jeff George may turn out to be the best move
of the offseason. Since replacing Randall Cunningham over two games
ago, George has thrown seven touchdown passes in the past 10
quarters. George, meanwhile, will just keep throwing to Carter and
the Vikings will go on a nice four or five game-winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 28-21

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures near 32 degrees are possible early Friday morning
in parts of the Southeast states as far south as northern Florida,
though large metropolitan areas like Atlanta and coastal towns and
cities will not be as cold. The early-morning chill will be
fostered by an expansive, tranquil ridge of high pressure that will
loosen its grip on the Southeast during the day, paving the way for
the nighttime chill to ease Friday night across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, ocean winds orchestrated by the Southeast high
pressure system will import Atlantic moisture along much of the
east coast of Florida, setting the stage for cumulus clouds and
isolated, generally light showers. On the western flank of the
expansive high, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will move inland
into parts of southeast Texas, spawning clouds and a few showers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Gulf moisture will squirt northeastward toward the
Ohio Valley as surface winds increase from the southwest ahead of
an approaching cool front. Spotty sprinkles and some showers will
develop late Friday or at night as the front arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a milder but rather windy afternoon will prevail
across much of the Northeast as increasing winds from the
west-southwest develop ahead of a cold front approaching from the
west. Winds will average 15 to 25 mph along the Northeast seaboard
with higher gusts. Coastal seas will be rather unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   A warming trend will stay the course across much of the Great
Plains, though nights will continue to be chilly.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Strange Winds
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's storm in the East produced some baffling weather. One
intriguing aspect of the intense low pressure was its winds. A gale
from the south preceded the disturbance along the Northeast coast.
The wind gusted to 76 mph at Blue Hill Observatory in
Massachusetts. Oddly, farther east, at a more exposed location,
Nantucket Island reported only a wind gust to 35 mph. Typically,
coastal sites provide less resistance for strong winds. On Tuesday,
a thin layer of ocean-cooled air invaded southeast New England,
lifting the fierce winds a few hundred feet above the surface.

HUNGRY TO SNAP UP MODERNISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WENDY MOONAN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   November may prove to be a true test of American madness for
modernism. This month's fairs, sales and online auctions are full
of late 19th- and 20th-century decorative arts, and Americans seem
to be acquiring them as fast as they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround time for things to be collectible is getting
shorter and shorter,'' said Asha Subramaniam, creator of an
Internet Web site, Icon20, devoted to 20th-century objects that
went online on Tuesday (www.icon20.com). ``Prices are going up
dramatically, even for mass-produced pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Icon20 was meant to ``pull together everything from the
late 19th century to today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Subramaniam, a former decorative arts specialist at
Christie's and Phillips, said Icon20 was meant to be instructive,
and, in addition to being an auction site, has a calendar of
relevant gallery and museum exhibitions worldwide and an online
magazine. The objects for sale come from dealers and individual
consignors. Buyers pay no commission; sellers pay 7 percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Subramaniam said she created the site because ``with the
millennium coming, people are looking at modernism differently.''
She added, ``People can really relate to it because it's in their
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The November auctions feature modernist icons from both sides of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's London sale of 20th-century decorative arts Thursday
had several unusual pieces commissioned for a Paris apartment in
1929 from Pierre Chareau (1883-1950), one of the pivotal French
advocates of practical modern furniture. The sale also featured
furniture by Jean Prouve, Eileen Gray and Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann.
</P>
<P>
   This week 20th-century furniture and works of art were exhibited
at the Beverly Hills Art and Antique Fair, which ended Thursday.
Galerie Jacques de Vos and Galerie de Beyrie were both selling
their specialty, Art Deco, but much more surprising was the Art
Deco booth of Bernard Steinitz, a Paris dealer in top-of-the-line
18th-century French furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked doing something different,'' said Benjamin Steinitz,
Bernard's son. ``We knew we could make an environment with our pale
walnut paneling done for the Paris Salon of 1929, and we had a set
of Deco furniture to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinitz had two unusual pieces: a veneered mahogany dining room
table made in about 1930 by Paul Chambon, selling for $170,000, and
a Brancusi-like alabaster vase four-and-a-half feet tall by
Marguerite de Bayser, selling for $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Silver Fund Ltd. of London was also at the Beverly Hills
Fair. It specializes in works by Georg Jensen, the renowned Danish
silversmith (1866-1935).
</P>

   ``We have the largest collection of Jensen estate jewelry,
holloware and flatware seen in the United States since 1915, when
Randolph Hearst bought all the Jensen silver at the 1915 Panama
Pacific Exposition,'' said Michael James, a partner. ``America is
the land of Jensen; everyone recognizes it here.''
</P>
<P>
   He could be right. Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Truman, Marilyn
Monroe, Katharine Hepburn and Greta Garbo are listed as Jensen
customers in Janet Drucker's book ``Georg Jensen'' (Schiffer,
1987).
</P>
<P>
   This week James said he sold $125,000 worth of Jensen silver,
including a $20,000 dragonfly belt buckle made in 1904. He will
take more early Jensen jewelry to the modernism fair in New York,
which opens to the public next week at the Seventh Regiment Armory,
Park Avenue and 66th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The jewelry can also be previewed on the silver fund's Internet

   Christie's New York 20th-century sale is set for Wednesday. It
features several pieces of bronze furniture made by the artist
Diego Giacometti (1902-85), including a gueridon in the form of a
tree and a coffee table with birds. Each is estimated to sell for
$60,000 to $80,000. Giacometti furniture is highly sought after by
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   William Doyle Galleries' 20th-century sale is set for Nov. 17 in
New York. Highlights include a George Nelson Marshmallow sofa from
1956, estimated to sell for $16,000 to $18,000; an amoeba-shaped
Paul Frankl cork and mahogany coffee table, $2,000 to $3,000, and
three colorful four-panel screens by Piero Fornasetti, circa 1952,
each estimated at $3,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five exhibitors from the United States, England, France,
Italy and Sweden plan to be at New York's modernism fair.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Loughery of Los Angeles Modern Auctions is bringing a rare
pair of ``airline chairs'' made by the German designer K.E.M. Weber
in 1934 for Walt Disney studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the height of streamlined, modern style,'' Loughery
said.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Levitties, owner of John Alexander Furniture and
Decorative Arts of Philadelphia, specializes in high-style Arts and
Crafts furniture from Britain and the Continent, particularly of
the Cotswold School, which was established by 1895. Designers
associated with this school include Edward and Sidney Barnsley,
Ernest Gimson and Joseph Maslin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made simple but elegant, vernacular-inspired furniture,''
Levitties said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Brown of Camden, Me., said he was taking a 1935 Warren
McArthur aluminum chaise lounge with its original green chenille
fabric, a library desk and a pair of Park Avenue sofas from
1938-39.
</P>
<P>
   The New York dealers Catherine and Stephane de Beyrie are
exhibiting the architect Rene Herbst's private desk, made in Paris
in 1930. Herbst was a crusader for modernism in the 1920s; he was
one of the first French designers to use nickel-plated tubing,
earning him the nickname Man of Steel. ``This desk, featured in
many books, has never been on the market before,'' Ms. de Beyrie
said. ``It is wild cherry, and part of the base is a cylinder of
perforated sheet metal.'' And Daniel Morris of Historical Design of
New York has a rare, exquisite glass and silver vase designed by
Koloman Moser in 1902 in Vienna. Moser was a founder of the Wiener
Werkstatte.

   The 116th National Horse Show opened Thursday night in Madison
Square Garden, but not all the action is in the Garden. The Nat
Sherman cigar store on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street has decorated
its windows with horse-related memorabilia borrowed from the
National Horse Show Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged on straw bales are trophy horse blankets, old silver
show trophies, bridles, hunt caps, vintage prints, and show ribbons
in red, yellow, purple and brown. Nat Sherman sells a few
horse-related antiques: silver horsehead cigar cutters and canes
with horsehead handles. But to get a blue ribbon, you have to win
it yourself at the Garden.

49ERS BACKED INTO THEIR THIRD CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The 49ers are about to start their third
right cornerback in three games Sunday when they face the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McMillian started the first six games of the season, then
was waived after a poor performance and a petulant outburst against
Carolina on Oct. 17. The next week Craig Newsome was the starter
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Pierson Prioleau's turn, by default as much as anything
as the club continues to look for a competent cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at it as trying to get a job done on Sunday,''
Prioleau said. ``I'm not worrying about how I got the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie fourth-round draft pick from Virginia Tech received
substantial playing time Oct. 24 against the Vikings in San
Francisco's nickel defense. The coaches now want to see how he
handles a starting assignment in the base defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wishing and hoping to have an opportunity,'' Prioleau
said. ``I feel I'm not a rookie anymore. I'm sure I'll be attacked
at the corner because I am a rookie but I think I can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Prioleau, who is 5-foot-10 and 191 pounds, was primarily a
safety at Virginia Tech. His size is more suited to cornerback,
though, and to that position he brings an aggressive attitude and a
willingness to hit people. That in itself marks a change for the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gritty, competitive kid,'' defensive coordinator Jim
Mora said. ``He deserves a chance. Against Minnesota he not only
was playing at corner but because of injury he finished the game at
safety. I was yelling at him from the sidelines what to do. He made
every tackle. They were all runs but he made the tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   If Prioleau proves inadequate at right corner, the 49ers also
have the option of looking at two recently signed players, Monty
Montgomery and Ramos McDonald. But the coaches clearly want
Prioleau to excel and establish himself at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better about this group right now, with the addition of
Ramos and seeing Monty Montgomery the last couple weeks,'' Mora
said. ``We're bigger, faster and more athletic.''

SENDING A MUSICAL INTO THE WORLD

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ushers stand at the top of the stairs in their
black cardigans and white collars, armed with stacks of programs,
guarding the entrance to the still empty theater like sentries.
</P>
<P>
   They are the last line of defense. In moments, the doors will
open, and in will stream the masses, those perfect strangers who
will ultimately pass judgment on a new musical that until now has
been nurtured by people who love it already and want to see it
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first preview of ``Marie Christine,'' which
officially opens on Dec. 2. Tonight signifies not only the
beginning of performances but the end of an intensive, occasionally
trying, often triumphant six weeks during which the play has been
brought to life for a 10{-week run, including previews, at Lincoln
Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will actors be exploring their roles in front of just
the director, the composer, the musical director, the stage
managers and other members of the production team. Now that safe,
private, intimate, consuming period of discovery is over. The time
has come to surrender the work to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with trumpets. Then the first words of the first song:
</P>
<P>
   Before the morning
</P>
<P>
   You have a story to be told.
</P>
<P>
   Before the morning
</P>
<P>
   You have a story to relive.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't ours to judge you,
</P>
<P>
   Isn't ours to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 16, FIRST REHEARSAL
</P>
<P>
   The first rehearsal for ``Marie Christine'' lands on the same
day that Hurricane Floyd descends. In his remarks to the assembled
cast members and crew, Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of
Lincoln Center Theater, says the weather seems appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the first rehearsal on a day on which a hurricane
threatens seems to me tremendously auspicious and a good omen,''
Gersten says. ``Especially if you're doing `Marie Christine.'''
</P>
<P>
   The play, with words and music by Michael John LaChiusa, takes
place in the 1800s and is based on ``Medea,'' the Greek tragedy in
which Medea, a sorceress, kills her children because of her
husband's infidelity. LaChiusa and Graciela Daniele, the director
and choreographer, have been developing the play for
three-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to `Marie Christine,''' Ms. Daniele says at that first
rehearsal. ``How sweet that sound is.''
</P>
<P>
   This day is known in the theater business as the meet-and-greet.
After coffee and bagels, people go around the room introducing
themselves, from the music-copying supervisor to the finance
director to the hair designer.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater,
tells about his subway trip to the theater that morning, how a
woman across from him began singing, ``Way Back to Paradise,'' from
``Marie Christine,'' which gave him the chills. (Audra McDonald,
who plays Marie, recorded the song on her recent CD).
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Barreca, the scenic designer, describes his model of
the set _ spinning chandeliers for the ballroom scene; a slanted
platform on which Marie and Dante make love in silhouette,
bleachers from which actors will observe the play while not
performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're constantly exposed,'' Ms. Daniele tells her cast
members. ``Either as spectators, or actors in the middle of the
story, or memories as they are being culled _ there's nowhere to
hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniele, a former ballerina from Argentina who has
choreographed and directed such shows as the recent Broadway
revival of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' also tells the actors to prepare
to buckle down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need all of your help, your focus,'' she says. ``And
remember, we are not doing `Medea,' we are doing `Marie Christine.'
It's an American musical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All aboard,'' she concludes. ``Let's get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 19, FIRST READ-THROUGH
</P>
<P>
   Cast members sit on chairs in three rows of a semicircle,
scripts in hand. Many know the music already, having been part of
the play's first workshop in 1996. The music is at times sorrowful,
at times menacing, at times achingly sweet. After particularly
stirring numbers, the group applauds.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, 37, wrote ``Hello Again,'' produced in 1994,
additional music for ``Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' in 1995 and
``The Wild Party,'' being produced this season. He calls ``Marie
Christine'' his ``most personal'' work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Medea,'' LaChiusa's musical is based on a New
Orleans folk tale about Marie Laveau, the legendary voodoo queen.
The composer says there was one line in the tale that particularly
struck him, something like: ``She had a daughter, also named Marie,
who ran away north with a white man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniele, who has an expansive warmth and a Latin intensity,
calls the show a ``combination of Lorca and big opera.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, whose boyish face is hard to reconcile with the
complex mind behind ``Marie Christine,'' says, ``It's just a piece
about love.''
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER, REHEARSALS
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniele refers to the rehearsal space as ``Romper Room,'' a
safe place to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be a good mother that is helping a child to walk
without holding their hand all the time,'' she says. ``Even if a
choice is wrong, I want them to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Evans, the musical director, says that the score is
challenging, but that he has not presented it to the cast members
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached it as if this was the most natural thing you
could sing,'' he says, ``so no one felt it was impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a reason that Ms. McDonald is doing six
shows a week instead of eight, and that Sherry Boone is playing
Marie Christine at matinees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all over the place,'' Ms. McDonald says of the music.
``There's not one register that I'm not in. There are notes that
I'm singing that contraltos don't sing. I'm up in the rafters and
everywhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Although two people often alternate performances in an opera,
the practice is unusual for a musical and the ground is clearly
fertile for competition and complications. But the relationship
between the leading ladies seems to proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both Marie Christine, but both individualistic,'' Ms.
Daniele says. ``With Sherry there is a strange vulnerability about
her. Sometimes she scares you, sometimes she's as vulnerable as a
bird.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. McDonald?
</P>
<P>
   ``Audra,'' Ms. Daniele says, ``is a force of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa wrote ``Marie Christine'' for Ms. McDonald, a luminous
presence with a formidable voice, who has won three Tony Awards in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Crivello, the rugged actor with penetrating eyes who
plays Dante, is also crucial to the piece. He is the man for whom
Marie kills her children and one of her brothers, and he must be
both seductive and suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniele says she sensed immediately during auditions that
Crivello, who won a Tony for his performance in ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman,'' was her Dante.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was some kind of mystery inside of him _ I just
felt it in my bones,'' Ms. Daniele says.

 &HT;    In Pine Mountain, enjoy the ambience of a small town with lots
of Georgia flavor
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ In a few weeks, cars will begin streaming
through this picturesque town on U.S. 27 en route to Callaway
Gardens for Fantasy in Lights.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning a night out at the drive-through light
extravaganza opening Nov. 19, why not spend the afternoon doing a
little holiday shopping in the historic town that was known as
Chipley until 1958?
</P>
<P>
   It's worth the trip _ about an hour and 15 minutes from downtown
Atlanta _ even if you aren't visiting Callaway Gardens or other
nearby attractions such as Roosevelt State Park or Wild Animal
Safari.
</P>
<P>
   Several shops have opened in old storefronts within the past
year. Then there's Kimbrough's General Store, a Main Street
mainstay that has been run by four generations of the same family
since 1892. The town is brimming with gifts, antiques and
decorative items to spiff up your home or garden.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the local flavor, many shops carry works by area
artists and craftspeople. Blacksmith David Cornett, who runs the
Pine Mountain Forge, and Charles Duck, who makes walking sticks,
are represented at Mountain Creek, a gift shop that specializes in
nature-themed items. (Cornett also crafted the Chanticleer sign
marking the French country-flavored home decor shop run by his
wife, Meg Russell.) Lewis Simmons makes wood benches, wall hangings
and found-object birdhouses sold at Country Gardens, which is
filled with things for the home and garden and boasts a small
garden in the back of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Butler, who opened Heart of the South Antiques last
summer, is planning a tearoom in the front of her large shop. She
hopes to be open before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need somewhere they can come and sit and have a cup of
tea and a dessert at 4 in the afternoon,'' Butler says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been thrilled with what has happened here,'' says
Bruce Thompson, a self-described ``recovering attorney'' who owns
three Main Street businesses (Sweet Home Antiques, Chanticleer and
Country Gardens) with partner Phil Rogers. ``It's a real
renaissance. I don't think we can do anything but grow _ not in
size but in the quality of the shops and events.''
</P>
<P>
   You can park your car for one-stop shopping along Main, Commerce
and Broad streets. Give yourself four or five hours to do the town
justice. You can't help but slow down here. Not only will you be
browsing (and most likely buying), but you'll find yourself
chatting with the friendly shopkeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the expected _ quality antiques and some great junk _
you'll find some nice surprises. For starters, who'd expect a funky
place like Cool Stuff, where collectible toys, games and comic
books, action figures, Pokemon cards, '70s hand-held electronic
games, incense burners and new and vintage chess sets that date to
the 1800s to vie for attention?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want something we don't have,'' says owner April
Williams, ``we'll try our best to find it. We've gotten pretty good
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll love making discovery after discovery: A row of
wonderfully well-worn wooden sleds _ Rosebud! _ lined up in the
window of Eddie Murphy's Interiors &AMP; Antiques. Fabulously flashy
rhinestone jewelry, earbobs, brooches, chokers and bracelets in
every color of the rainbow at Heart of the South Antiques. A pair
of barely worn size 6 red leather ladies' cowboy boots at Simple
Pleasures. Folk art by the likes of the Rev. Howard Finster, R.A.
Miller, Mose Tolliver and Butch Anthony at Country Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   At Mountain Creek, which opened in mid-August, Karen Plant _ the
Lower Chattahoochee Riverkeeper until October 1998 _ has parlayed
her love of wildlife, outdoor recreation and the environment into a
business venture. The shop's gifts and crafts reflect her passion
for nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shop allows me to still talk to people about environmental
concerns and do a little environmental education _ that goes
especially for the kids,'' Plant says.
</P>
<P>
   Plant says the homey space, built as a grocery store in the
1890s, has served as a movie theater, a storefront church and ``a
hundred different antique shops'' through the years. The original
tin ceiling, stone floor and brick walls are intact. A former
tenant lined the north wall with wood from an old barn.
</P>
<P>
   At Now and Then Antiques, a former Pure Oil gas station, you'll
find _ among many other things _ a cache of gifts gathered by Clara
Belle Hall of Berea, Ky., more than three decades ago for a shop
she hoped one day to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady never got around to opening her shop,'' says
shopkeeper Charlotte Boykin. After Hall's death in 1993, Boykin
says she ``bought the entire storage unit sight unseen. It's been
like Christmas unpacking the boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the treasures are crafts handmade by Berea College
students more than 35 years ago: baskets, brooms, pottery,
weavings, woodcrafts, corn-shuck dolls and finger puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Anchoring the strip of shops along Main Street is Magdaline's
Accents, where artist Maggie Yanko runs an eclectic art gallery and
gift shop that carries everything from Southwestern art to her own
paintings. She's been at her location for four years, in business
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to say I helped Pine Mountain grow to what it is
now,'' Yanko says. ``I worked to start festivals and events to draw
people so that they wouldn't just go through it to Callaway
Gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a booster like Bruce Thompson has to acknowledge that
Pine Mountain's destiny is tied to the 14,000-acre resort down the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this builds on Callaway,'' he says, ``but I don't think
they fully appreciate what we could do for them. If people come to
Callaway and decide to spend time in Pine Mountain, they'll stay
longer. Extending the stay is the real key to what we've got
going.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Take 1-85 south to I-185 (Exit 5) and continue south to Exit 14.
Turn left onto U.S. 27 and drive 10 miles into town.

<P>
   Visual Sensations
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brooklyn Museum of Art: The headline-making exhibit
``Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection''
continues through Jan. 9. The 90 paintings, sculptures, photos and
installations by 40 of Britain's best artists includes the
depiction of the Virgin Mary that drew Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
ire. 718-638-5000; www.brooklynart
</P>
<P>
   .org.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  American Museum of Natural History: ``Tropical Butterflies
Alive in Winter,'' a butterfly conservatory with more than 300
free-flying specimens, continues through Feb. 27. ``Body Art: Marks
of Identity,'' opening Nov. 20, surveys tattoos and other body
decoration through the ages. A new permanent hall, the Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth, offers exhibits dealing with the evolution of
Earth, with specimens from all seven continents, some as large as
38 tons. Coming in a few months, a completely new Hayden
Planetarium. 212-769-5800; www.amnh.org/.

<P>
   SHOWTIME!

<P>
   New this fall:
</P>
<P>
   Telecharge: 1-800-432-7250.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster: 1-800-755-4000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Kiss Me, Kate'' (Martin Beck Theatre ). It's been years
since Cole Porter's classic musicalization of ``The Taming of the
Shrew'' had a first-rate Broadway revival. That's how this
production shapes up, featuring as it does Marin Mazzie and Brian
Stokes Mitchell of the original ``Ragtime'' cast. Opens Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Putting It Together'' (Barrymore ). The elegant _ sometimes
delightfully scathing _ wit of Stephen Sondheim is celebrated in a
new London musical revue featuring Carol Burnett (with Kathie Lee
Gifford stepping in to spell her occasionally after Dec. 7). Opens
Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Price'' (Royale ). In a tale from Arthur Miller (``Death
of a Salesman''), two brothers fight for more than their
inheritance in one of the best unsung dramas of the 1960s. Opens
Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Waiting in the Wings'' (Walter Kerr ). Call it Diva Power
unchained. Lauren Bacall and Rosemary Harris return to Broadway in
a rarely seen Noel Coward comedy. Opens Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The best long-runners:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Lion King'' (New Amsterdam ). You'll love it if you
loved the movie _ or even if you didn't. That's how thrillingly
unique Julie Taymor's production of the Elton John/Tim Rice musical
really is. Take the kids or take a date: It's great either way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rent'' (Nederlander ). Under this rockin' saga of sex, drugs
and rebellion on the Lower East Side thumps a romantic heart,
recalling ``La Boheme.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cabaret'' (Studio 54 ). It's not just about Weimar-era
Germany anymore. It's about now: club-crawling, gender-bending,
political apathy and lurking violence. All that with a classic
score.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Chicago'' (Shubert ). Like ``Cabaret,'' another vintage show
that reveals a timely edge, thanks to the ahead-of-his-time, jaded
wit of its original director, Bob Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Les Miserables'' (Imperial ). Just the show to wash away all
the cynicism of those previous two musicals. ``Les Miz'' was the
best musical of the 1980s, not least for its uplifting message.
</P>
<P>
   HO, HO, HOLIDAYS
</P>
<P>
   Before the turkey hits the table, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade will be strutting down Fifth Avenue (from 9 a.m. to noon)
before thousands of sidewalk spectators and millions watching on
TV, heralding the holiday season in New York.
</P>

   Here's a sampling of the events that make the holidays merry and

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Just for kicks: The 66th annual Radio City Christmas
Spectacular, under way since Thursday at the newly renovated art
deco landmark, features the high-kicking Rockettes, Santa Claus and
a live Nativity scene (camels and all). Call it schmaltzy and
old-fashioned, but it's a must-see if you want to say you've done
the holiday-in-New York scene. Through Jan. 2. 212-307-1000.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    In Big Easy, an arty hotel well-versed in voodoo
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ ``The voodoo priestess is here for your
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in New Orleans. That was the first call I got when my
husband and I checked into the chic International House hotel for
our first anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of the French Quarter, this year-old boutique hotel
is a new option for visitors wanting something between an upscale
chain hotel and a small inn or B&AMP;B. It pairs luxury amenities and
sophisticated decor with a major helping of local flavor.
</P>
<P>
   This place, housed in an imposing beaux arts building, is in
love with its surroundings: There are pictures of New Orleans jazz
musicians on the walls, CDs by local artists next to the bed and
coffee-table books about New Orleans strewn about the guest rooms.
Everything in the hotel, from the columns in the lobby to the bud
vases in the rooms, was crafted by local artisans. Many things,
including the books and the vases, are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But the most unusual ``amenity'' is the voodoo love ceremony the
hotel will arrange to have performed in your room. A few minutes
after the call from the front desk, a diminutive woman dressed in
white came to our penthouse suite. She'd already been to our room
before we checked in and set up an elaborate altar. It had candles,
beads and a large, folk-arty painting of a voodoo goddess in front
of which were offerings, including petit fours from a local bakery,
champagne and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Ann Glassman, who has been practicing voodoo for 20
years, explained before she got started that it is not satanic or
pagan but is a monotheistic religion that's ``nature-based and
ancestor-based.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the ritual, she drew a stylized heart on the
carpet in cornmeal _ a difficult art that is probably lost on the
housekeeping staff that has to clean it up. Then she began speaking
_ praying _ in French, and directing us to do things like kiss the
floor and turn in small circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will ensure you stay in love forever,'' she said as she
placed orris root under our tongues and ordered us to kiss.
``That's OK, right? You're not at each other's throats yet, are
you?''
</P>
<P>
   We assured her we were still smoochy after one year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with her there, the ceremony is very romantic. She made us
a ``gris-gris,'' a spell bag that looks like a sachet with feathers
on it. She instructed us to keep it forever to ensure a good
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony is as close as I've come to experiencing authentic
voodoo, as opposed to the trinket-based version found on Bourbon
Street.
</P>
<P>
   To order the 30-minute ceremony, ask the hotel for the
``Sanctuary of Love'' package, which costs $249 a night and
includes a large room and valet parking. What else the package
includes remains a bit of a mystery: We thought we were getting a
basket of bath goodies as well as special instructions on how to
perform another ceremony down by the Mississippi, but they never
arrived. When I mentioned this to the front desk, I got an apology
and a promise that one would be sent to me at home. It never was.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I had to call the hotel several times just to book the
package. It has to be arranged through the sales office, where
someone must have a very short workday, for the answering machine
was almost always on. I left several messages that weren't
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it seems to take a voodoo spell to get a
reservation, it is worth it. The room we had was spectacular _ a
penthouse with a terrace overlooking the river. The huge bed was
covered in tasteful and comfortable bedding; the bathroom had a
Jacuzzi tub, a lot of marble detailing and Aveda bath products for
the taking.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, the Loa Bar, named for voodoo spirits, is one of
the hot hangouts in town. And Lemon Grass, the restaurant off the
lobby, serves creative and delicious Vietnamese food with a
Louisiana accent. Among my favorites: the pan-seared scallops with
grilled baby eggplant, and five-spice duck breast.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the restaurant is only loosely connected to the
hotel, so you can't get room service from Lemon Grass. More
ordinary fare can be ordered up from Christino's, a restaurant
across the street. Breakfast comes from there as well and is not
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   There is a great gift shop _ again, with many locally made items
_ and a good workout room, both of which add a nice touch of
convenience to what is already a charmer of a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   HOTEL INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   International House, 221 Camp St., New Orleans, LA 70130. Call

</P>
<P>
   TO COP THAT VOODOO VIBE
</P>
<P>
   The International House is on the edge of the French Quarter,
making it steps away from dozens of bars, restaurants and shops.
Here are a few suggestions to enhance the mood of romance and
voodoo created by the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to eat:
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Grass, off the hotel lobby. 504-523-1200. Upscale
Vietnamese cuisine with a Louisiana twist. Dressy casual.
Appetizers, $5-$9.95; entrees, $14-$24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Peristyle, 1041 Dumaine St. 504-593-9535. Romantic,
out-of-the-way French-inspired restaurant. The bar will make you
feel like you're in Paris. Call ahead for reservations; it is very
popular. Dressy casual. Appetizers, $7.50-$16; entrees, $20-$24.
</P>
<P>
   Acme Oyster House, 724 Iberville St. 504-522-5973. In case you

late-afternoon snack or for lunch. Casual. Dozen oysters: $6.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Things to do:
</P>
<P>
   Take a cemetery/voodoo tour with Historic New Orleans Walking
Tours, 504-947-2120. Leaves from 334-B Royal St., in front of Cafe

</P>
<P>
   A very romantic bar is Napoleon House, 500 Chartres St.
504-524-9752. Sit by the open French doors and listen to opera

 NEW YORK: Daniele says.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCT. 12, FIRST TIME ONSTAGE
</P>
<P>
   Gathering in the theater for the first time, the cast members
ascend the few steps to the stage and tentatively explore the set,
blinking up at the lights as if they just landed on another planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stauffer, the sound designer, gives his spiel about the
individual cordless microphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moisture is the enemy,'' he says. ``If you're a heavy sweater,
let us know.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its thrust stage _ with the audience on three sides _
rather than the traditional proscenium, and because of its large
size, the Beaumont Theater is notoriously daunting to scenic
designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space is one of the most difficult spaces to work in
anywhere,'' Barreca says, ``It's a particular challenge to deal
with the vastness, but not lose the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the hurdle facing the lighting designers, Jules
Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer. ``We had to attempt to create
different spaces that were large and small within the vast space,''
Ms. Eisenhauer says. ``In Marie's brother's study, for example,
we're trying to use the lighting to contain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up onstage Ms. Daniele asks everyone in the cast to hold hands
in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to ask God to protect everybody in this house,''
she says, ``and to bless this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 20, COSTUME FITTINGS
</P>
<P>
   Toni-Leslie James, the costume designer, is holding final
fittings at the studios of Barbara Matera, a veteran Broadway
costumer. Ms. Boone, the twice-a-week Marie, is trying on her ball
gown.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone admires the beading and the puffed sleeves. ``You guys
have me looking so fine,'' she says. ``This is just gorgeous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone practices picking up the back of her heavy skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to squat,'' Ms. James corrects her. ``Just dip
and grab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I told all the girls,'' she adds, ``the ball gowns are your
friends. Don't fight the gown because the gown will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. James says she picked certain fabrics because she felt they
had a changeable quality. Marie's gold-and-maroon-striped outfit,
for example, is meant to evoke the character's different moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when the light hits it,'' Ms. James says, ``it can go from
being a playful dress to something very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. James says that with a larger budget, she would have come
closer to her wish list, namely custom-tailored tail coats for the
men. The show is being produced for $3 million, the most Lincoln
Center Theater has ever spent on a production, but an amount low
compared with most Broadway shows. Although Gersten says he
considered teaming up with another producer to help carry the
financial load, Lincoln Center Theater was just coming off
producing the musical ``Parade'' with Livent, which filed for
bankruptcy during rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would be better served by being able to do it
very much on our own,'' Gersten says. ``I don't think anybody feels
they had to sacrifice integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not integrity that Ms. James says she sacrificed; it is
those tail coats. But now she is most concerned with the remaining
details for the first dress rehearsal _ handmade flowers for the
wedding gown, pocket watches _ three days from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be there eventually,'' Ms. James says. ``But before
then, it's this frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 21, SITZPROBE
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa keeps twirling his pencils and can't seem to sit down.
Evans, the musical director, is his usual, laid-back self _
cracking jokes, looking calm _ although as the afternoon wears on
he will be sweating through the back of his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   This first sing-through with the orchestra is called a
sitzprobe, a German word coming from sitz, meaning to sit, and
probe, meaning rehearsal. It unfolds in a windowless room at
Carroll's Studios on West 41st Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big day,'' says Jonathan Tunick, the orchestrator.
``I'm a little nervous. I'm being exposed for the first time. I
hope my offerings are acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tunick, best known for his work on Stephen Sondheim's musicals,
started his orchestrations late in the game _ they won't be
finished by the first preview _ for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never known an orchestration done before rehearsals began
not to be thrown out,'' he says. ``The elements that arise in
rehearsal are so critical that they have to be taken into account.
There are things as basic as the key a song is going to be sung in
that change.''
</P>
<P>
   Tunick says the show's 16-piece orchestra, limited by the
budget, is small for such an ambitious score; the typical
production has about 25 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves me with a long list of things I can't do,'' he says.
``I can't write melody in the violins unless it's an intimate
passage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret to making a small orchestra sound big is not
everybody plays all the time,'' he continues. ``Then when two
instruments come in, it sounds like all hell broke loose _ keeping
the heavy artillery in reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The rehearsal room is crowded. The cast members sit off to one
side, standing when it is their turn to sing. Some have brought
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, behind a long table, sit Ms. Daniele, LaChiusa,
Tunick, Emily Grishman, the music copyist who transcribes Tunick's
notations and Seymour Red Press, in charge of hiring the musicians,
who everyone calls Red.
</P>
<P>
   Evans gets things started.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our wonderful band,'' he says. ``This is our wonderful
cast. You'll all get to know each other well, but this is the last
time you'll see each other.''
</P>
<P>
   To the cast he says: ``Don't push, don't oversing. Sometimes you
will have trouble hearing yourself. Just take it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first song begins, Ms. Daniele closes her eyes. When she
opens them as the number ends, they are filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magnificent,'' she says to Tunick as the sitzprobe comes
to a close three hours later. ``Thank you for this gift.''

 NEW YORK: this gift.''

<P>
   OCT. 23, FIRST DRESS REHEARSAL
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a mess on Saturday,'' Ms. McDonald predicts a few
days before the first dress rehearsal. ``But it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald's dress tears on a nail sticking out of a table
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Barreca, the scenic designer, and Ms. James, the costume
designer, evaluate the damage. The assistant stage manager, Alexis
Shorter, tapes over the nail. Ms. James renders her verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a pull,'' she says. ``You'll never see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Weitzman, the associate producer of musical theater who
calls himself the show's ``Goddaddy'' and has attended almost every
rehearsal, says, ``Costumes are totally traumatic.''
</P>
<P>
   It is late at night, and the cast has yet to finish the first
act. Nerves are wearing thin. Ms. Daniele looks drained.
</P>
<P>
   A scene is supposed to begin, but one of the actresses in it
can't be found; she is apparently backstage looking for one of her
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasn't she been gone a long time?'' Ms. James says. ``What's
she been doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald enters in her ball gown after a quick change,
looking not quite as elegant as she ought to, with her cape missing
and an earring stuck in her wig, which is slightly askew.
</P>
<P>
   An actress who plays one of the prisoners bruises her leg on the
subway grating material that surrounds the lip of the stage. Ms.
Shorter brings her ice and aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   During a fight scene, Crivello inadvertently injures the actor
who plays Marie's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   The performers who have been sitting on the bleachers complain
about being unable to see their way down the steps for their exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mess,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are your gloves?'' Ms. James asks one gloveless actress.
``The gloves don't fit,'' she answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's your jewelry?'' Ms. James asks an ensemble member.
``The necklace hangs too low,'' she answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have told me,'' Ms. James says.
</P>
<P>
   As the director begins to adjust the staging for the ballroom
scene, Ms. James takes a cigarette break outside with her assistant
to let off steam.
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 28, FIRST PREVIEW
</P>
<P>
   At about 6:30 p.m., the amaryllis plants, a traditional gift at
Lincoln Center Theater, are delivered to each dressing room. One by
one, the actors come through the stage door, scribble their
initials on the sign-in sheet, check the bulletin board for
messages and retreat to their dressing rooms to get into makeup,
wigs and costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is energized about the prospect of an audience, but
there is also a sense of reality seems to have settled over them.
This is the bottom-line test, when the art also becomes the
business: Will people like their work? Will the critics? Will it
sell tickets?
</P>
<P>
   The preview period will last five weeks, during which lines will
be cut, scenes clarified, songs adjusted. But for the moment,
Bishop, the theater's artistic director, says, ``I feel we're ready
to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, audience members start to file in. LaChiusa stands
anonymously among them before handing over his ticket to be torn
like everyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Once seated, the crowd quiets as the actors start to take their
places on the bleachers and strains from the orchestra begin to
float up from the pit. There is a blackout, then the trumpets.
</P>
<P>
   The first act goes smoothly. The actors seem focused,
invigorated. The audience appears attentive. At intermission a few
people walk out _ Gersten, the executive producer, stands outside
in the dark plaza watching them go _ but most return for the second
act.
</P>
<P>
   As the show ends and Ms. McDonald comes out for her curtain
call, several people in the audience get on their feet, leading a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, in the lobby, a few elderly people complain on their
way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these new things are a downer,'' says one man to
his companion. ``Why can't they write musicals like they used to?''
</P>
<P>
   Says another, ``It lacks salt and it lacks pepper.'' His wife
retorts, ``How about garlic?''
</P>
<P>
   But others seem to have found the play compelling, and Gersten
says he is not concerned that audiences will find it too dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took courage and hope from the fact that a very bleak
`Elektra' came to New York last season and took the town by
storm,'' Gersten says. ``New York is not just a musical-comedy
town, it's a complex town.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at O'Neal's restaurant, where Gersten and Bishop give
their postpreview dinner, cast and crew members fill their plates
with Chilean sea bass and Caesar salad from the buffet, sip wine
and enjoy the simple but significant fact that they have made it
this far.
</P>
<P>
   But though upbeat, LaChiusa doesn't seem ready to sit back and
celebrate. Already he is talking about the cuts he plans to make
the next day, how relieved he was to see most people return for the
second act.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's scared to death,'' Ms. McDonald says. ``We all are. We've
all been taking care of this baby and we're sending it out into the
world and that's a scary thing because it's precious to us. And now
we're going to find out if it's as precious to everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Preview performances of ``Marie Christine'' at the Vivian
Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, are on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m., Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and

   Here are the stories New York Times editors are planning for
Friday, Nov. 5 Page 1. The NYT frontpage advisory, with layout
description, will move by 7:30 p.m. ET. The NYT News Service Night
Supervisor is Pat Ryan. (888-346-9867).
</P>
<P>
   BANKS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The Senate on Thursday
overwhelmingly approved a sweeping law breaking down Depression-era
barriers between banks, insurance companies and investment firms.
The vote was 90-8. (Summary from wires.) By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-MERGER (Undated) _ Pfizer Inc. launched an $82.4 billion
bid for Warner-Lambert Co. on Thursday, in an attempt to break up a
$71 billion merger just announced between Warner Lambert and
American Home Products Corp. (Summary from wires.) By David J.
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   WYO-GAY-MURDER (Denver) _ The trial of a man who was convicted
of murdering Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student,
ended Thursday in Laramie, Wyo., with a deal approved by the dead
man's parents that will spare his killer execution. By Michael
Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   AIRCRASH-DIVE (Newport Naval Station) _ Now that crash
investigators have laid out a picture of a Boeing 767 on a wild
roller-coaster ride in the last few minutes of flight, people
familiar with the airplane are busy trying to concoct a scenario
that would match the data. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MURDER-RATE (New York) _ For several years, New Yorkers have
talked about crime like veterans recalling a vanquished enemy from
an old war. But in criminal justice circles and some neighborhoods
this year, the conversations have become less leisurely as the city
confronts a 9 percent rise in homicide, the first such increase in
the last eight years. By Laurie Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-U.S. (Tehran, Iran) _ Nov. 4, the 20th anniversary of the
seizure of the U.S. Embassy here, was to be a day of days, a
triumphal homecoming for the revolutionary class of '79. But
somehow, amid the strident speechmaking and the punching of the air
at Thursday's rally, there was something out of temper, something
registering unmistakably that even in Islamic Iran, the years have
marched on. For one thing, there can hardly have been more than
5,000 people at the gathering, 7,000 by the most optimistic
estimate, in a city of 12 million. For another, many in the crowd,
especially among the young, seemed to have trouble working up the
requisite animosity for the United States. By John F. Burns. 1,600
words.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PERFECT-PITCH (Undated) _ Native speakers of languages that
use tones to convey meaning may have a form of perfect pitch,
researchers have found. They said the finding suggests that many or
even most babies may be born with absolute or `perfect' pitch, but
lose the ability if they do not learn a tonal language or undergo
early musical training. By James Glanz.

 &HT;    Blowing smoke: Wigand tale lacks the inside dope
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That tick-tick-tick sound is ``60 Minutes'' man Mike Wallace,
ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is tremendously peeved with ``The Insider,'' the new
drama opening today that portrays him and his show in a
less-than-flattering light. That it's also a somewhat inaccurate
light doesn't help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is about Mike Wallace in the same way that
``Macbeth'' is about Banquo, but even supporting characters have
the right to feel they've been wronged. Michael Mann's drama is the
story of Jeffrey Wigand, a former tobacco company consultant who
turned whistle-blower when courted by a ``60 Minutes'' producer,
Lowell Bergman. But, fearful of a lawsuit, CBS caved and canceled
the ``60 Minutes'' story, only to reverse itself a few months later
and air its interview with Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Plummer plays Wallace as a well-seasoned ham, but
one who's still a gutsy and dangerously sharp journalist. It's
Bergman, portrayed as the ultimate hairy-chested alpha-journalist
by Al Pacino, who fights the good fight, and Wallace and ``60
Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt who knuckle under to the CBS
corporate lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Director and co-screenwriter Mann has not pulled an Oliver
Stone/``J.F.K'' with ``The Insider;'' it's true, by and large, to
the real story of Wigand, with the usual embellishments we expect
in a fact-based drama.
</P>
<P>
   Where it goes awry is in strongly implying that Wallace and
Hewitt could have done anything other than what they did. Wigand
had signed a confidentiality agreement with his tobacco employer,
and CBS's lawyers decided that if CBS aired the interview, the
network could be sued for billions for enticing Wigand to break his
contract. Wallace and Hewitt went along with the decision not to
air the story, but on the ``60 Minutes'' in question, Wallace made
his displeasure known.

<P>
   About the only real options Hewitt and Wallace had at that point
were to resign in protest, or, as Hewitt has joked, mount a
guerrilla attack to take over CBS's transmitters. Mann's movie
suggests they folded morally; in reality, they had no cards at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply does not reflect the truth of what happened,''
Wallace has said. In a letter to Mann, Wallace called the script's
suggestion that he compromised his ideals ``mindless and
insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   And what would such a contretemps be without a conspiracy angle?
Some inside CBS have noted that the studio releasing ``The
Insider,'' Touchstone, is owned by Disney, which also owns ABC, a
competitor of CBS. To propose that Disney would spend $68 million
on a feature film to ``get'' CBS News is beyond preposterous, but
then some people get a little loopy when they start speculating
about corporate control of the media. (It's only fair to note that
Disney is extremely unlikely to release a film about how ABC News
killed a report in 1998 alleging that lax employee standards let
convicted pedophiles find work at Disney World.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' portrays Wallace as obsessed with his legacy.
``How will I be regarded in the end, after I'm gone?'' Plummer
asks.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's Wallace's concern with his legacy that has led
him to speak out against ``The Insider.'' At the age of 81, he has
been a dominant public figure for 50 years _ maybe not beloved, but
certainly respected. Long after ``The Insider'' has been forgotten,
Wallace will be remembered as one of the giants of journalism.

 &HT;    This `Bachelor' trips down aisle
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' seems made for some untapped demographic. It's
aimed at either a) somebody who's never seen a movie, and really,
truly worries that the Guy won't get the Girl, plus the $100
million inheritance. Or, b) anyone who thinks there's something
insightful about an analysis of male-female relations described in
terms of wild mustangs and lassos. Or, c) it's for fans of Chris
O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger who believe the adorable but bland
actors have what it takes to carry a romantic comedy. They don't.
They go through their motions because the script says so, but they
have the chemistry of bread and glue.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who settles down
for three years with Anne (Zellweger). Even though she's perfect,
he manages to propose to her twice in ways that are as insincere as
they are unfunny. She declines. Then Jimmy's grandfather dies,
leaving him $100 million, on the condition that he marry within 24
hours. Problem is, Anne has (supposedly) left the country, forcing
Jimmy to woo past girlfriends. Oh, don't worry, he's not a cad; he
needs the money to save the family business and keep his loving
employees employed. (Personally, I would have liked Jimmy more if
he really did just want the money; a spark of greed might have been
what the character needs to come to life.)
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy's exes and possible brides-to-be include a cop, a clinger,
a boring chef and other types that just aren't realized wittily
enough in Steve Cohen's screenplay. The only bright spot is Brooke
Shields (yes, really), playing a bottom-line, chain-smoking ice
queen who agrees to marry Jimmy, but only if he doesn't touch her.
(Not so lucky are Ed Asner, Hal Holbrook and James Cromwell, good
actors all, given lousy material here.)
</P>
<P>
   A clumsy remake of Buster Keaton's silent classic ``Seven
Chances,'' ``Bachelor'' retains the original's surreal image of
thousands of brides chasing the groom-to-be after one of Jimmy's
pals leaks news of the $100 mil to the press. Consistent with a
matter-of-fact misogyny that runs through the flick, these
countless would-be brides leap off the screen as scary caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Trapping Jimmy in church, they demand to know what he looks for
in a woman. The less shapely among them accuse him of only liking
skinny blondes with nice breasts. It's a hard argument for the
movie to shake: Not only has it never convinced us Jimmy and Anne
are meant to be together, it's never allowed her character to be
anything but the sweet, well-built blank that are always the girls
a movie hero weds. The funny thing is, nobody who made ``The
Bachelor'' seems to notice that the script pinpoints its own
formulaic emptiness before wheezing on to its foregone happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger. Rated PG-13 for
profanity. 1 hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A proposal you should turn down.

 &HT;    `Mononoke' a multilayered marvel
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's so much going on in ``Princess Mononoke'' that it makes
Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   This animated import from Japan _ where it earned more than $150
million _ has been picked up by Miramax and re-dubbed in English by
a blue-ribbon cast. And while it's not strictly a kids' movie, it's
not exactly another example of violence-saturated anime either
(that's the sex-blood-guts brand of Japanimation that's achieved
cult status stateside).
</P>
<P>
   If anything, ``Princess Mononoke'' is oddly reminiscent of such
late Akira Kurosawa works as ``Ran'' or ``Kagemusha.'' That is,
it's an operatic epic with a complicated narrative to match its
stunning visuals. In fact, given its two-hour-plus running length,
we might've used a little less story. But director Hayao Miyazaki
is a master filmmaker, and while he may tire us out, he never bores
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``In ancient times,'' we're told, ``a land lay covered in
forests ... these were the days of gods and of demons.'' Up in the
lushly forested, sparsely populated northern region, Prince
Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) saves his village from a giant boar that's
been turned into a hate-filled demon by what appear to be
flesh-devouring bloodworms. Unfortunately, he's wounded in the
process and is now infected with the same disease that possessed
the animal. Unless he can find a cure, the wound will spread and
eventually kill him.
</P>
<P>
   So Ashitaka sets off on a journey to save himself and ends up in
a place called Iron Town, where the ruler, Lady Eboshi (Minnie
Driver), operates a giant ironworks that manufactures guns and
bullets. In doing so, she's raped the surrounding land and incurred
the wrath of various forest creatures/gods. Most dangerous is the
great wolf Moro (Gillian Anderson), whose adopted human child,
Princess Mononoke, aka San (Claire Danes), has vowed to kill
Eboshi.
</P>
<P>
   It gets more complicated from here, with boars on the march,
apes threatening cannibalism (when they're not planting trees), a
rascally monk (Billy Bob Thornton) with some kind of power over
Eboshi and rampaging samurai doing a corrupt emperor's dirty work.
While these disparate factions clash, Ashitaka pleads for harmony
between nature and civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The theme may be simple, but the characters are far from
one-dimensional. San is as vengeful as she is brave, while Lady
Eboshi, though she may be deceitful and power-hungry, also employs
society's misfits _ lepers, ex-prostitutes _ and treats them with
respect.
</P>
<P>
   The film's full-tilt fantasy can be simultaneously overwhelming
and simplistic. But the story just doesn't stop, and the animation
is astonishing _ whether it's as subtle as the limp of a wounded
elk or as eye-popping as a demon-infested boar dripping with blood
and rage.
</P>
<P>
   Boldly innovative yet eerily innocent, ``Princess Mononoke'' is
unlike anything you've seen in the theaters this year. It is, in
the best sense, something you simply have to see for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton, Claire
Danes and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Rated PG-13
for images of violence and gore. 2 hours, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This animated epic from Japan is like a Disney film
by way of Akira Kurosawa.

 &HT;    `On the Ropes' pulls no punches about sport
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen's admirable documentary
``On the Ropes,'' three young boxers pull on their gloves and step
in the ring, hoping to get ahead. They face off with other helmeted
pugilists, but what they're really fighting is their dead-end lives
in New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Santiago is a 17-year-old who'd rather be boxing than
studying, and who also has a hard time regaining his confidence any
time he loses a match. Tyrene Manson is a young woman living in
cramped quarters with her drug-dealing uncle and extended family;
despite a series of major setbacks life throws at her in the course
of the film, she looks to the future and insists, ``I'm going to
get my belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's George Walton, the gym's rising star, whose biggest
temptation seems to be his own bright future. That becomes clear
when he starts listening to a sweet-talking, sunglasses-clad boxing
manager named Mickey Marcello, who gradually undermines Walton's
relationship with his boxing trainer, Harry Keitt.
</P>
<P>
   Keitt serves as the film's connective tissue, and an exemplar of
the dangers of the neighborhood. We hear how he pulled his life
together after years of drug abuse, jail and homelessness. Now
committed to his boxers, his work is as much about saving his own
life as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Hoop Dreams,'' ``On the Ropes'' documents the hope and
sometimes heartache athletic ability offers; it's a powerful
democratic equalizer. The movie also reminds us, as we watch Manson
sidelined by a blend of bad luck and bad timing, that reality is
often much more dramatic than fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the
</P>
<P>
   Ropes''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A documentary. Unrated. Through Thursday. $2, $4 after 6 p.m.
404-651-2463. 1 hour, 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A compelling documentary about three people
fighting for better lives.

 &HT;    Well-researched biography tunes into life, piano brilliance of
Nat `King' Cole
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever a movie or TV show wants to establish that it is set in
Los Angeles, the quickie visual tour almost always includes a
passing shot of the Capitol Records headquarters, that weird '50s
building in Hollywood that looks like a towering stack of old LPs
with a giant antenna on top.
</P>
<P>
   When it was completed, it was known as ``the house that Nat
built.'' Nat, as in Nathaniel ``King'' Cole, one of the greatest
jazz pianists ever, but a musician whose legacy today, for too many
casual fans, is a handful of easy listening tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with the crooner's crisp
elocution and velvety tones on ``Mona Lisa,'' ``Sweet Lorraine,''
``Nature Boy,'' ``L-O-V-E'' and of course ``The Christmas Song''
(``Chestnuts roasting on an open fire ...''). But Cole was much
more, as Daniel Mark Epstein's splendid and definitive biography
points out. Cole was a serious jazz pianist who found he could make
far more money as a singer, and did so with very few qualms. He
also was the first African-American to have his own major TV show,
a complex player in the civil rights movement and a man who
redefined the six degrees of separation game (he knew, among many,
both W.C. Handy and Marilyn Monroe).
</P>
<P>
   Before he was ``King'' Cole, he was ``Schoolboy'' Cole, a
precocious kid in Chicago who stood his ground as a 15-year-old
against Earl ``Fatha'' Hines in a battle of the bands. Cole's
family had moved to Chicago from Alabama as part of the great black
migration after World War I, and he was born in 1919. It was a
great time for a fledgling musician to be growing up in Chicago,
with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller playing
around town.
</P>
<P>
   But Cole, like many jazzmen, needed to roll, and he moved to Los
Angeles at the age of 17 and formed the King Cole Trio. (The
precise origins of the nickname ``King'' are lost, except for the
obvious connection to the nursery rhyme Old King Cole.) With Oscar
Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass, and Cole the clear
leader on piano, the trio gained increasing respect for its tight
swing jazz.
</P>
<P>
   There was hardly ever a time when Cole did not sing (he recorded
``Sweet Lorraine'' for the first time at age 19, although the
popular version was a later one), but as early as 1946, jazz fans
and critics were accusing Cole of being a sellout, for paying more
attention to his pop recording than to his jazz licks. That was the
year he recorded Mel Torme's ``The Christmas Song,'' which reached
No. 3 on the charts, with the trio's ``I Love You for Sentimental
Reasons'' at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-rock 'n' roll era, Cole became an early precursor of
the vocalist-icon; his benevolent panther eyes, smooth charisma and
dapper dressing style didn't hurt. Women (black and white) flocked
after him, stalked him, and he dallied more than occasionally over
the course of his two marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But he was, of course, still a black man in 1950s America,
picketed by angry neighbors when he bought a home in Beverly Hills,
physically attacked onstage by white supremacists in Birmingham in
1956. When he tried to avoid controversy and refused to speak out
more forcefully, Cole was branded an ``Uncle Tom'' by Thurgood
Marshall, although Cole quietly supported the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, NBC launched ``The Nat King Cole Show.'' Despite Cole's
self-effacing manner, despite white guest stars who rallied to him,
despite support from blacks who saw the move as being the
equivalent of Jackie Robinson's integration of baseball, and
despite being a mere 15 minutes long, the show failed abysmally
because advertisers were afraid to sponsor it. ``Madison Avenue is
afraid of the dark,'' Cole quipped, and NBC, hemorrhaging money,
pulled the plug after one year.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's widow, Maria, wrote a remembrance of her husband in 1971
that's now out of print; it's astonishing that Epstein's biography
of Cole is the first major one of the singer-pianist who outsold
Sinatra during some years. Epstein's research is prodigious,
including, apparently, every back issue of the black newspaper the
Chicago Defender, which chronicled ``Schoolboy'' Cole. And Epstein,
whose previous biography was of the evangelist Aimee Semple
McPherson, writes about Cole's piano brilliance with the knowledge
of a downbeat critic.
</P>
<P>
   After his death from lung cancer in 1965 at the age of 45, Cole
was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery (another L.A. landmark) between
Gracie Allen and Alan Ladd; in the afterlife, there is no racial
division. And although his crypt is impressive, a biography like
this is the best memorial.

   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM)40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   -It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bachelor'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris O'Donnell
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell plays Jimmy, a San Francisco playboy who loses
his girl Anne (Renee Zellweger), then finds he'll inherit $100
million if he marries within 24 hours. A clumsy remake of Buster
Keaton's silent classic ``Seven Chances,'' it retains the
original's surreal image of thousands of potential brides chasing
the groom-to-be. (SM)1 hour, 41 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats'' R (profanity and intense sequences
</P>
<P>
   of bat attacks)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lou Diamond Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to have bats in your belfry to enjoy this cheesy
horror flick about genetically altered, man-eating bats. For the
record, Lou Diamond Phillips is the fearless sheriff of the Texas
town where the bats have come to roost; Dina Meyer is a
bat-ologist; Leon is her assistant; and Bob Gunton is a shady
scientist. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedrooms &AMP; Hallways'' Not rated, but contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin McKidd,
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Weaving and Jennifer Ehle.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny look at a series of revolving bedroom doors in modern
London, Rose Troche's new comedy widens her focus, from Chicago's
lesbian dating scene to a view of sexuality (gay and straight)
that's constantly in flux. Robert Farrar's satiric script concerns
an attractive bunch of young people whose love lives reflect the
title: sex experienced as a constant mix of journey and arrival at
a destination. (SM) 1 hour, 36 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man''R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Taye Diggs,
</P>
<P>
   Nia Long and Morris Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Better than ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' In Malcolm D. Lee's
often funny, sexy and prickly new comedy-drama, Taye Diggs heads a
talented ensemble cast in a glossy wedding film punctuated with
soul-stirring music (Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder, Me'Shell
Ndegeocello, Maxwell), flurries of flesh and real dramatic bite.
The ensemble cast is all good. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes.

<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Out the Dead'' R (profanity, violence and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese offers a savage, sorrowing look at a few days in
the life of a paramedic whose beat is Hell's Kitchen. As played by
Nicolas Cage, he's alcoholic, burnt-out and haunted by the spirits
of those he couldn't save. A kinda romance with Patricia Arquette
doesn't work, but there's excellent work by John Goodman, Ving
Rhames and Tom Sizemore as Cage's various partners. (ERG) 2 hours,
1 minute. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy in Alabama'' PG-13 (violence, thematic material,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith,
</P>
<P>
   David Morse and Lucas Black.
</P>
<P>
   An odd mix of civil rights drama and Southern Gothic comedy that
goes down just fine. The movie splits time between the wild
adventures of Lucille (Melanie Griffith), who breaks out of a small
Alabama town and heads west, and a graver story back home. Griffith
does her best work since ``Working Girl.'' Antonio Banderas'
direction throws off some sparks, even if it doesn't fully catch
fire. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Crazy'' PG-13 (profanity, teen alcohol
</P>
<P>
   and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adrian Grenier
</P>
<P>
   and Melissa Joan Hart.
</P>
<P>
   A '90s ``Odd Couple'' teen romance, dragged down by out-of-it
jokes and by-the-numbers plotting. Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan
Hart are pleasant enough as the leads, but the story is tired and
after the first few minutes the direction settles into a comfy
snooze. (Steve Whitty, Newhouse News Service) 1 hour, 43 minutes.

<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM)44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' R (violent antisocial behavior, sexuality
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton,
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio release, the
Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it
as liking it. Either reaction is justifiable. The film, about a
pack of guys beating each other to bloody pulps, is violent,
nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor. But it's still
one of those rare films that creates an electrifying alternate
universe onscreen. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley
</P>
<P>
   and Jean Smart.
</P>
<P>
   A college grad (Sarah Polley) moves in with a 50-ish bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made a career out of introducing
much younger women to the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But
what sounds like grist for a feminist diatribe against our
culture's wink-wink approval of such liaisons is actually a sweet,
rueful love letter. The writing and direction is sharp as a tack
and the acting is gorgeous. (ERG) 1 hour, 47 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon get ``Happy.'' This sunny crowd-pleaser stars Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn as escaped convicts who hide out in a small
town by posing as a gay couple who stage beauty pageants for little
girls. A last-minute plot device is a bad idea, but by then the
picture has built up so much good will you can't help but go along.
The cast is excellent, especially William H. Macy as the sheriff.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``House on Haunted Hill'' R (violence, gore, sexual images,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Famke Janssen and Taye Diggs.
</P>
<P>
   A redo of the 1958 Vincent Price spookfest, it's a loud assault
on the senses and a (literal) bloody mess. But as a
meat-and-potatoes (or guts-and-eyeballs) scare machine, it has its
moments. Geoffrey Rush invites five strangers to spend the night in
a haunted house to win $1 million each. Then the gore begins. (SM)
1 hour, 55 minutes C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino
</P>
<P>
   and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   More smoke than fire in this reality-based film about what
happened when former tobacco consultant Jeffrey Wigand (Russell
Crowe) agreed to tell his story on ``60 Minutes'' at the behest of
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Bergman gets the star
treatment (one senses a certain pandering to Pacino), but Wigand's
predicament is more riveting, with Crowe in an Oscar-worthy
performance. (ERG) 2 hours, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Terence Stamp
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   A Cockney ex-con (Terence Stamp) comes to L.A. to avenge the
supposedly accidental death of his daughter. He hones in on a slimy
record producer (Peter Fonda). Plotwise, this is a revenge movie,
but thematically, it's an off-beat meditation on the nature of
Hollywood, especially what's left of '60s Hollywood as it demands
attention from an increasingly disinterested '90s Hollywood. Both
stars are superb. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep
</P>
<P>
   and Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The Meryl Streep Show _ and what a show it is. Streep and
director Wes Craven (``Scream,'') have delivered a rarity: an
inspirational movie that is actually inspirational. The film
follows a single mom (Streep) who overcomes reluctant kids,
confrontational parents and an indifferent school board in her
battle to teach violin to inner-city kids. It's a glorified TV
movie, but it's got Streep and that's all it needs. (ERG) 2 hours,
3 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omega Code'' PG-13 (several scenes of shootings)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Casper Van Dien,
</P>
<P>
   Michael York, Catherine Oxenberg
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Ironside.
</P>
<P>
   Michael York and Casper Van Dien star in this overly talkative
tale reminiscent of the book of Revelation. As wealthy businessman
Stone Alexander, York steals and uses a secret biblical code to
effect a world takeover. The hammy Van Dien plays Gillen Lane, a
glam gadabout and motivational leader who uncovers York's plot and
must act to save the globe. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 39 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)

   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. Essentially,
it's a ``once upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature
and civilization. Boldly innovative (often savagely so) yet eerily
innocent, it's the sort of thing you simply have to see for
yourself. (ERG)2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A meandering mystery/drama/romance that never hits the right
groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and Kristin Scott Thomas a
congresswoman who discover their spouses, both killed in a plane
crash, were having an affair. The stars' ensuing romance never taps
beneath the surface. (SM)2 hours, 11 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:

<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 38 minutes. C+

<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth) who drove his 1966 John Deere riding mower over 300
miles to reconcile with his estranged brother (Harry Dean Stanton).
The movie is a sublime celebration of America at its most
beautiful: kind, welcoming, gloriously eccentric. A perfect
Thanksgiving movie. (ERG)1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer that doesn't bite.
As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary Katherine Gallagher,
Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of adolescent brazenness and
self-mortification. It's clear Shannon loves this character, but
she's never afraid to push the envelope of outrageousness, whether
talking baby talk to her breasts, or fantasizing that a tree is her
lover. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Man'' Not rated but there is implied violence.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Cotten
</P>
<P>
   and Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be missed. To honor its 50th anniversary, Carol Reed's
cynical, gorgeously photographed film noir has been re-released in
a spruced-up print that adds 11 minutes. In post-war Vienna, a
well-intentioned American (Joseph Cotten) tries to solve the
mysterious death of his old pal Harry Lime (Orson Welles.) Funny
and smartly acted, Reed's thriller is a bittersweet eulogy for a
long-gone idealism. (ERG)1 hour, 34 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's
stolen Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Three to Tango'' PG-13 (sex-related situations
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry,
</P>
<P>
   Neve Campbell and Dylan McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   A perfectly pleasant extended sitcom trumped up with TV stars
and begging for belly laughs. Matthew Perry (``Friends'') headlines
this mostly slapstick, throwaway love story about Oscar Novack, a
heterosexual Chicago architect who everybody thinks is gay. The
comedy is mostly a physical joke: spastic running, tripping over
coat trees, accidental pokes in the crotch and just plain barfing.
(Bob Longino)1 hour, 38 minutes. C+

   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again. (Jill

 &HT;    Stars make `Collector' watchable
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As thrillers go, ``The Bone Collector'' stalks the gorier tracks
of the horror genre. Like the victims in ``Seven'' and ``The
Silence of the Lambs,'' the movie's unfortunate prey are often left
sliced to the bone or rotting in hideous heaps of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the rats.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive after ``Bone Collector's'' victim No. 3 is
ceremoniously tied up inside a musty, abandoned slaughterhouse,
partially gutted by our faceless serial killer and left to be the
living lunch for God's furry little vermin.
</P>
<P>
   The rats come with expert precision. They creepy-crawl down
dusty wooden boards. They mass like piranha to a slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   If only this film's plot and script were this meticulous.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' ``The Bone Collector'' is, at its
core, pure pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches.
You hear cops spit lines like ``Kiddo, if you were any more wound
up, you'd be a Timex.'' You see the supporting cast's eyes shift
all whodunit style when word drops that the serial killer might be
an ex-cop.
</P>
<P>
   But amid all the gore and hokum, this movie's got two talented
stars _ Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie _ and they muster
enough electricity to make ``The Bone Collector'' a watchable
thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, a brainy New York detective,
forensics specialist and author who, after a near-fatal accident,
is confined to bed as a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Then in walks equally brainy rookie cop (and, wouldn't you know
it, former pouty-lipped model) Amelia Donaghy, played by Jolie.
After she chances upon a gruesome crime scene and demonstrates a
flair for forensics, Rhyme enlists her as his eyes, ears and legs.
Together, they hunt a nasty killer who at each death scene drops
intricate clues leading to the next victim.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a commanding force even though he spends nearly
the entire film propped up in bed (both he and supporting star
Queen Latifah, who plays Rhyme's no-nonsense nurse Thelma, met with
disabled actor Christopher Reeve to research quadriplegia).
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Jolie also ignite a potent sexual chemistry that
gives the film added weight and helps mask the weakest plot points.
When they're onscreen, ``The Bone Collector'' can be a pleasure to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   You can just duck and cover at the first sign of rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone
</P>
<P>
   Collector''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Rated R for
strong violent content including grisly images, and for profanity.1
hour, 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A by-the-pulp-book serial killer thriller stoked by
credible lead performances.

 &HT;    A whistle-blower pays the price in `The Insider'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, a
cigarette industry consultant whose career went up in smoke after
he was fired by Brown &AMP; Williamson, the third-largest tobacco
company in the country. The real sparks, however, flew at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   After Wigand was cajoled by producer Lowell Bergman into going
public with his allegations that his company's CEO had knowingly
lied to a congressional committee about the hazards of nicotine,
``60 Minutes'' decided, under pressure from CBS corporate, not to
air the segment in full. The show's resident star, journalist Mike
Wallace, initially went along with management, then recanted.
Bergman fumed and threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The segment eventually aired in its entirety. In the meantime,
however, Wigand, who'd risked his severance pay and benefits
package, saw his life go down in flames. He lost his wife, his
family and any lingering ties he might have had to his former
profession. He became more than another out-of-work exec; he was a
pariah. A whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mann's film, which already has the navel-gazing media
industry blowing editorial smoke over its implications, accuracy
and integrity, actually tells the story of two insiders. The first
and far more effective is Wigand's.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe, the hunky, hot-tempered cop from ``L.A.
Confidential,'' has considerably deglamorized himself for the role,
to the point of being virtually unrecognizable. He plays Wigand as
a paunchy, puddin'-faced paranoid who may drink too much and suffer
from authority problems, but also as someone who knows what he's
talking about when he refers to the cigarette industry as a
``nicotine delivery business.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe finds every nuance, every nook and cranny of Wigand's
anger and isolation, his self-righteousness and his self-sacrifice.
It's an astonishing, Oscar-worthy performance, haunted by a
stubborn man's self-destructive streak as well as by his unshakable
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The second ``insider'' story concerns Bergman, played with a
star's glamour and panache by Al Pacino. Bergman, who acted as a
consultant on the movie after leaving CBS, is presented as a kind
of latter-day ``All the President's Men'' Woodstein. A guy who left
a radical magazine like Ramparts and moved into the sleek corridors
of network news without selling out. As he tells one character, he
still does ``the tough stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wigand, he learns firsthand what it's like to buck the
system. To have to choose between conscience and career expediency.
However, most of Bergman's ``suffering'' takes place at a lovely
seaside cottage where he's been sent by his bosses to cool off. Or
at fancy hotels where he's already chasing another story. You can't
help but get the impression that the film is pandering to Pacino's
star status. That it would've been a riveting picture instead of an
interesting one if it had stuck with Wigand and left Bergman a
secondary character.
</P>
<P>
   But then, star quality is what fills the seats.
</P>
<P>
   That and, perhaps, the notoriety that the film has already
attracted. Wallace has been very public in his protests. Oddly, he
should've waited until he saw the movie. As played with sleek
confidence by Christopher Plummer (who somehow manages to look both
nothing like and exactly like Wallace), the ``60 Minutes'' icon
comes off rather well. His decision to go along with the higher-ups
is one measured by experience and an understandably human
investment in the program that will be his legacy. (``I don't plan
to end my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public
Radio.'') One wonders if Bergman might not have done the same thing
if he were in Wallace's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``The Insider'' true? Who knows. It's certainly the truth
according to Bergman. Is it a good story? For the most part,
especially when Crowe is onscreen. Still, the film could lose a
good 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it offers some serious food for thought on
some serious issues. When Wigand is first approached by Bergman, he
says, ``I'm just a commodity to you. Something to put on between
commercials.'' True enough. But what he should've realized was that
he'd been a commodity since the day he signed on the dotted line
with Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Directed by Michael Mann.
Rated R for profanity.2 hours, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: More smoke than fire here, but Russell Crowe gives
an Oscar-worthy performance.

 &HT;    A drive into the heart of America
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only twisted thing about ``The Straight Story'' is that this
lyrically simple little film was directed by David Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that David Lynch, the one who's given us everything from
dancing dwarfs in ``Twin Peaks'' to a whacked-out Dennis Hopper in
``Blue Velvet.'' And here's the kicker: This G-rated movie is being
presented by Walt Disney. Yes, that Walt Disney, the one who has
given us everything from Bambi to a young Annette Funicello.
</P>
<P>
   Based on actual events, ``The Straight Story'' is, quite
literally, the Straight story. The story of one Alvin Straight
(Richard Farnsworth), a senior citizen living in Iowa with his
somewhat mentally challenged daughter (a delicately balanced
portrayal by Sissy Spacek). Alvin has bad eyes, bad hips (he needs
two canes to walk) and, as we learn throughout the picture, a bad
past as hotblooded as that of any country-boy hell-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But when he hears that his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has
had a stroke, Alvin is determined to see him. Even if he lives 300
miles away in Wisconsin. Even if the two haven't spoken in 10
years. Even if Alvin no longer has a driver's licence. Instead, he
hitches up a 1966 John Deere riding mower to a handmade rig filled
with the essentials (wieners, two folding chairs) and embarks on
his own personal quest.
</P>
<P>
   As quests go, this one's about as quixotic as they get. Alvin
never tilts at windmills, but he has plenty of strange encounters
along the way. A pregnant teenage runaway. Bickering twin
mechanics. An animal-loving hysteric whose Sisyphean fate is to run
into a deer every time she drives down the same stretch of highway.
</P>
<P>
   Much like such fabled wandering predecessors as Michael Landon's
angel or David Janssen's fugitive, Alvin leaves trickles of
good-hearted wisdom wherever he goes. However, in this movie, he
gets as much as he gives. The kindness of strangers greets him at
almost every turn. Traveling through the heartland at 5 mph, he
finds the heart of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother looking for a severed ear in someone's well-tended
yard or any of the usual Lynch extremes. He isn't the least bit
glib or ironic about Alvin's journey. Rather, his movie is a
leisurely yet sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful
_ kind, welcoming and yet gloriously individualistic. True, the
filmmaker may be a little too bicoastally enamored of the
just-folksiness of plain ol' Middle Americans. Still, his rapture
and sense of appreciative discovery is infectious. As is the
twinkle in Farnsworth's bluer-than-Newman eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With its harvest-home imagery and simple gift of God's grace as
manifested in the good will of others, ``The Straight Story'' is
really the perfect Thanksgiving movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a kind of American benediction. David Lynch style, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek. Directed by David
Lynch. Rated G. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrical miracle of
a film about a man and his John Deere riding mower.

 &HT;    Essays informal invitation into writer's mind
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all literary forms, the one that makes me feel most at home
is the essay. I mean as a reader, of course; no one who must write
for a living is ever completely comfortable with his own inadequate
stabs at saying what is on his mind, if indeed anything is. But in
the leisure of hearing what is on another's mind, I freely waive
the obligation of making sense and let myself be engaged by the
writer who's already gone to the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals of the essay are often its armchair informality and
its companionable voice, but even more its flexibility. H.L.
Mencken used the form less to establish company with the reader
than to subject some deserving pretender _ William Jennings Bryan,
for one _ to withering satire. His closest modern descendant, Hal
Crowther, has eviscerated the likes of Jesse Helms, Kitty Kelley
and sundry others with the same galvanizing wit and passion.
Essayists don't come standard-issue, one pretty much the same as
another.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Johnson's famous definition of two centuries ago strikes
me as wide of the mark by more than a few degrees. An essay, he put
down in the first dictionary of the English language, was ``a loose
sally of the mind; an irregular and undigested piece; not a regular
and orderly composition.''
</P>
<P>
   `Dessert for the mind'
</P>
<P>
   One who has let fly a few loose sallies of his own might not be
in the best position to know, but I've always thought the essay
anything but disorderly. It wears formality lightly, when it wears
it at all, and more often seeks the intimacy of friends talking in
the late hours. As models of the form, those collected annually in
``Best American Essays,'' a Houghton-Mifflin series begun in 1986
by Robert Atwan, show how easily the essay adapts to different
bents of mind, from the polemical to the ruminative to the
analytical.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, other essay anthologies have come forth, among them
``The Oxford Book of Essays,'' edited by John Gross, and ``The Art
of the Personal Essay,'' edited by Philip Lopate. In addition,
Lopate edits an annual collection, published by Anchor books,
titled ``The Art of the Essay.''
</P>
<P>
   In these and other collections, certain regulars can be counted
on _ Joseph Epstein, Samuel Pickering, Cynthia Ozick, Joan Didion,
Edward Hoagland. And many of these same writers publish, every few
years, collections of their own work.
</P>
<P>
   The essay, you'd think, is in its golden age. It is showing up,
Hoagland writes in his introduction to ``Best American Essays
1999,'' in unexpected places, ``in National Geographic as well as
The New Yorker, and on the airwaves and in newspapers, as
corrective colloquy or amusing `occasionals.' Paralleling the flood
of memoirs that are coming out, the essay form is in revival.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet it lives, in Philip Lopate's words, a double life. It is
a ``dessert for the mind,'' but also a reminder of compositions in
elementary school and, more recently, of high school competency
tests. To read an essay might bring pleasure; to write one brings
pain and inhibition. A D on an algebra test is never as
discouraging as a D on one's effort to express oneself. In his
introduction to the 1999 edition to ``The Art of the Essay,''
Lopate notes with amusement and chagrin the Educational Testing
Service's robot for grading college students' essays. The more
times you use transition words such as ``therefore,'' ``since'' and
``while,'' the higher your score. The same with semicolons and
parentheses, which tell the machine you possess a more
sophisticated syntax and thus a more complex mind.
</P>
<P>
   Content is the life blood
</P>
<P>
   As to content, the machine is deaf and dumb. It hasn't a clue.
Yet the essay stripped of its content is a cadaver. The content is
an essay's life blood, and its manner of expression can be as
various as the human personality. As Lopate writes, the essay ``is
an inherently conversational medium, both in its tonal contract
with the reader and in its tendency to respond to talking points
from earlier essayists. Friendship, antipathy, manners, city versus
country, infirmity, spectatorship, skepticism and belief:
historically, these and a half-dozen other subjects have been the
bread and butter of the essay form.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the virtues of the essay, perhaps the supreme
virtue, that it allows the writer room to connect past with
present, and the life of one person with the lives of many. It
attempts something more than merely conveying information. It
attempts, in its companionable way, to put writer and reader on
equal footing. The reader knows he won't be cornered by an
editorialist or bored by an academic. He will be invited in, as it
were, while the writer sets things straight in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The reader might disagree one and a half times out of three, but
more often than not he will find that things are straighter in his
own mind as well.

 &HT;    Contemporary home furnishings find a soft heart
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Remember when ``contemporary'' furnishings meant cold
chrome and glass tables, dark leather upholstered chairs and bold,
hard lines?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so cutting edge it looked sharp enough to cut yourself
on,'' said Mayer Rus, editor of Interior Design magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Today, contemporary can mean anything from funky retro to
traditional Mission with a twist, from vintage modern to mainstream
Pottery Barn.
</P>
<P>
   But what was turning heads at Thursday's opening of the Chicago
Design Show, the nation's largest fair for contemporary furnishings
from around the world, is a soft look that blends with other
furniture styles. It's defined by light maple and ash, metals in
soft matte finishes, natural textured fabrics and gentle contoured
lines.
</P>
<P>
   And fueled by mainstream retailers such as Crate &AMP; Barrel, it's
invading tradition-steeped Atlanta, where newcomers from around the
country and young buyers starved for something ``different'' are
creating quite a market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming here and finding they're not in Tara anymore,''
a once-sought venue for antebellum homes and fine antiques, said
Pat Bennett of Southern Design Source, a contemporary furnishings
showroom at the Atlanta Decorative Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   Young buyers, armed with disposable incomes, are exposed to more
new designs than ever through travel, magazines and the Internet.
That demand has prompted the Chicago Design Show _ in its third
year _ to expand its exhibit space in the gargantuan Merchandise
Mart by 50 percent to accommodate nearly 300 manufacturers and to
add a fourth day (Thursday and today are open to retail buyers and
interior designers only; Saturday and Sunday the public is
invited). Among the leading designers represented are Dakota
Jackson, Holly Hunt Ltd., Niedermaier and Brueton Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the inclusion of Italian designers, who make up some
40 percent of the exhibitors and represent the world's leaders in
contemporary furniture production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increasing interest in contemporary design is an outgrowth
of attitudes,'' Rus said. ``In thriving economic times, people look
forward rather than backward. It's about tomorrow vs. today, about
optimism and taking risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Furniture at this show ranges from pieces that seem to float,
such as Penta's Planet table lamp resembling a space-age crystal
ball, to ones that look and feel as warm and snuggly as your dad's
favorite chair. American designer Dennis Miller is showing its
T-shirt lounge chair and ottoman by Clodaugh, fully upholstered
down- and foam-filled pieces with stained maple legs.
</P>
<P>
   Light woods are the rage, such as Maxine Snider's Paris series
that includes a settee and various tables available in cherry and
blond finishes with faux ivory and leather accents.
</P>
<P>
   And Florian Furniture is emphasizing maple and birch in its
1940s modern pieces upholstered in champagne colored wool boucle
and leather _ ones that can blend with contemporary or traditional
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny because our buyer is the early 30s affluent
professional as well as the empty-nester who loves the modern they
grew up with,'' said designer John Florian Koncar.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a soft contemporary look that meshes easily with other
styles _ a mix not only palatable but intriguing in traditional
markets like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, it has to have rounded lines, textured fabrics and a
little more touchy-feely finishes,'' said Charles Gandy, an Atlanta
interior designer. ``Occasionally, we'll put a signature antique
piece with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing styles is becoming the norm, said Julia-Carr Bayler,
shopping the show for her year-old Atlanta showroom, Belvedere,
which sells vintage modern furnishings. ``People are not falling
into the trap of living in a space that's all one look,'' she said.
``I think Atlanta is finally catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   Daylon Lutzenberger, who just bought a Midtown condo, has
watched his tastes slowly evolve from formal traditional to more
casual contemporary, emphasizing natural materials. Because he
travels all week in his job for Ernst &AMP; Young, he relishes
returning home on weekends to a warm inviting atmosphere of soft,
earthy leathers, light maples and wheat colors. ``It's so
comfortable, it's almost therapeutic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larger scale pieces, ideal with today's vaulted ceilings, have
become must-haves for him and other young consumers. ``We're
becoming a more permanent society so people want more substantial
pieces, things that no one else has,'' said Atlanta designer
Herbert Brito.
</P>
<P>
   For Faye Seligson, manager of the Midtown furnishings store
Innovations, the growing market for contemporary has proved
exciting, yet not surprising considered the new softer direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home is definitely where people are putting their money.
They'll spend $5,000 on their home vs. $5,000 on a vacation,'' she
said. ``We all work really hard these days, and when we get home we
just want to be comfortable.''

 &HT;    There's smoke, but not enough fire, in `The Insider'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For much of Michael Mann's ``The Insider,'' men
speak with great concern on telephones and ride around in large
cars. Sometimes they do both at the same time. There is a cameo by
a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   It breaks down like so: Al Pacino takes the prize for best phone
talker _ apoplectic, spittle flying, those piano-key teeth gnashing
_ while Russell Crowe looks best riding in a car.
</P>
<P>
   As tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand, Crowe is a
man besieged by conscience, and his duty to it has left his life
and family riven. He has taken on a pasty, ragged, joyless sheen.
Staring out the car window, he looks like a corpse. Very
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Less impressive is the dramatic oomph of this true story, which
depicts Wigand's role as a key witness in state lawsuits against
Big Tobacco and the failure of ``60 Minutes'' to air its interview
with him because of legal pressure, despite the heroic efforts of
Pacino's producer. The screenplay by Mann and Eric Roth is based on
Marie Brenner's Vanity Fair article ``The Man Who Knew Too Much.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann likes his movies to leak well past the two-hour mark, and
``The Insider,'' though it moves briskly, is too long by 30
minutes. There's a big story to be told here, yes, but it's not one
best suited to the visual medium, despite Mann's surpassing
technical chops. With all the back-door dealings and internal moral
battles, you end up with lots of guys frothing exposition into
phones and sulking in cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the President's Men'' showed that there are ways around
this, if your story demands it. ``All the President's Men'' bore
the weight of a nation's cracking history and featured a to-die-for
cast of heroes and scoundrels. Mann plumbs the psychic wrangling of
an obscure scientist and how the world's most respected news show
caved in to corporate cowardice. The stakes don't exactly arouse
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Mann scours familiar man-in-crises terrain, where ordinary
fellas define their lives by fighting extraordinary odds with
honor, sacrifice and self-styled moral probity. His heroes are
Wigand (a rigidly self-conscious Crowe, gray and tubby) and hotshot
reporter-producer at ``60 Minutes,'' Lowell Bergman, played by
Pacino with fiery, wily resolve and a steel-wool grumble.
</P>
<P>
   When Wigand is fired from his job as the top scientist at the
No. 3 tobacco company, he decides to break a confidentiality oath
by disclosing that Big Tobacco spikes its cigarettes with
``impact-boosting'' nicotine. Public interest drives him, though
Mann methodically shows that Wigand's young daughter suffers
chronic asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman squeezes Wigand to be interviewed on the air by bulldog
newsman Mike Wallace (a convincingly crusty Christopher Plummer,
whose face looks shellacked for the part). Wigand agrees,
incriminating the tobacco companies on the record. CBS, warned of
potentially devastating legal fallout, kills the segment. The film
shows even notoriously feisty Wallace caving in _ something the
real newsman denies he did.
</P>
<P>
   As polished and finely paced as it is, the movie doesn't earn
its epic length. The squabbling at CBS between journalists and
brass is fascinating but too neatly distilled. And the depiction of
Wigand's swelling paranoia, spurred by death threats and
harassment, is strictly formula (an unspent bullet in his family
mailbox, nocturnal rustling in his back yard). The real Wigand
recently admitted that the film's dumbest bit, in which a
mysterious man ominously shadows him as he plays golf, is pure
fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Mann believes he needs all the drama he can muster
here, true or not. He operates with profound care, deftly erecting
the story with clarity. But he does so at the cost of dynamism:
There are few mounting crescendoes, and no crashing release.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is a master stylist incapable of making an ugly movie. The
sterile surfaces and exacting compositions are visual counterpoint
to his gritty operas of male struggle (``Thief,'' ``The Last of the
Mohicans,'' ``Heat''). ``The Insider'' is chock-full of arresting
imagery. Tableaux are splashed in cool blues and sea greens and
bear a pressed-shirt crispness. But for a movie that needs all the
heat it can get, Mann's icy stylings throw a glacial pall over
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is a good movie, gripping and alive with tough
performances (note that the 34-year-old Crowe is playing a
53-year-old). It's just not as necessary as it wants us to believe.

 &HT;    Stylish dressers know no size: top designers and retailers
expand options for tall and large men
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you saw a big man _ who wasn't a
celebrity or professional ball player _ dressed so sharp you had to
do a double take?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing comes to mind, it's probably because fashionable
clothes for big and tall men have been hard to come by, unless the
garments were tailor-made or purchased from an exclusive store.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I had to go to New York or San Francisco
because there weren't any high-end retailers for big men,'' says
Rodney Strong, 45, an Atlanta attorney who is 6-foot-5, weighs 340
pounds and wears a size 60 XL jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But top designers increasingly recognize that big and tall men
follow fashion trends, too. And they're offering more styles cut to
the proportions of tall guys who wear sizes XLT to 4XLT and big men
with 44 to 60 inch waists, who wear sizes 1X to 6X sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh McDonald, manager of Dillard's at North Point Mall, says
``the great success in women's large sizes prompted a lot of the
men's designers to take a look at that market.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Rochester Big &AMP; Tall in Buckhead was among the few
stores in metro Atlanta that carried designer clothes for
hard-to-fit men. It currently stocks such prestigious brands as
Versace, DKNY, Jhane Barnes and Tallia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the Saks (Fifth Avenue) for big and tall men,'' says
manager Krishna Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for big and tall clothes is definitely there.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all U.S. adults are overweight. NPD
Projections in Long Island, N.Y., estimates that 15 percent of
adult males are big and tall. The men's big and tall market is a
$5.5 billion industry, according to NPD, and it's growing at a rate
of 11 percent per year as more retailers and designers get into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dillard's just opened big and tall shops at its
North Point and Mall of Georgia stores early last month. REPP
Premier Big and Tall recently opened a store in Duluth (Ga.). And
brands such as Nautica, Polo Ralph Lauren, Polo Jeans, Tommy
Hilfiger, Tommy Jeans and Perry Ellis debuted lines of big and tall
clothing this fall. William Mitchell, 38, of Atlanta, can tell the
plus-size market for men has expanded when he shops for clothes to
fit his 5-foot-9, 235-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely has improved,'' says Mitchell, account director
for MTV Networks. ``Five years ago you could only find polyester
pants and solid shirts. But now there are a lot more options and a
lot more fashionable alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Shirley, 51, a local investor who is 6-foot-9 and 240
pounds, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When tall men's stores first came out, they had a
preponderance of big sizes and only a small selection of clothes
that would fit me. It's not as difficult now.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with a wider array of top quality clothes to choose
from, hard-to-fit men have to make their selections carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with a good suit. I like the style of Tallia because
they generally fit me off the rack,'' says Strong, who buys most of
his business clothes from Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   For jeans and casual wear he shops Sears, JCPenney and Stein
Mart. His athletic clothes often come from Casual Male.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his height, Shirley says he doesn't wear stripes
because they lengthen his torso and he tends to wear subtle colors.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell likes to wear pants with cuffs and a front pleat to
give his stocky frame a more elongated look. He also makes a
smaller knot on his ties to draw attention away from his neck and
to give the tie enough length to hang below the belt buckle. And
Mitchell says he never buys double-breasted suits or garments with
horizontal patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring attention to the midsection,'' he says with a
laugh.

 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the National Gallery of Art in Washington held its 1995
exhibition of works by 17th-century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer,
Arthur K. Wheelock Jr., the curator of Northern Baroque paintings,
wanted to include ``The Art of Painting.'' One of Vermeer's seminal
works, it is in the permanent collection of the Kunsthistoriches
Museum in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   But conservators in Washington and Vienna decided that the
painting was too delicate to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after what Wheelock called a gentle restoration, ``The Art
of Painting'' has been deemed safe to travel, and is heading for
Washington, where it will be on view from Nov. 24 through Feb. 6.
The painting will hang in the West Building, with the four Vermeer
paintings in the permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Painting'' is unusually large _ 47\ inches by 39]
inches _ and Vermeer kept it throughout his life. After his death
in 1675, his widow, Catharina Bolnes, transferred ownership to her
mother, Maria Thins, to keep it out of creditors' hands.
</P>
<P>
   It is an allegorical painting in which a large curtain is drawn
back to reveal an artist painting a young model. She wears a wreath
(the symbol of honor) and holds a large book (representing history)
in one hand and a trumpet (the symbol of glory) in the other. These
symbols identify the model as Clio, the Greek muse of history. The
artist, seated with his back to the viewer, has started to paint
the wreath.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between art and history is underscored by a
large wall map of the Netherlands. In the center of the room hangs
a chandelier with an abstracted image of a double-headed eagle, the
imperial symbol of the Hapsburg dynasty, which held jurisdiction
over the Netherlands in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great statement about what it is to be an artist,''
Wheelock said. ``This painting is one of those great icons of art
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer has always been a popular painter. Only 35 of his
paintings are known to exist today, and the National Gallery's
exhibition showed 21 of them, drawing 327,551 visitors. On the
show's last day, people waited up to 14 hours to see the painter's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Painting'' may not get the same crowds, but it is
sure to be popular. ``As a single painting,'' Wheelock said, ``it
is enormously powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Versace's Picassos
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five Picassos _ five oil paintings and 20 works on paper
_ from the collection of Gianni Versace will be sold at Sotheby's
in London on Dec. 7. Versace, the Italian fashion designer, was
fatally shot in Miami in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While many fashion designers are avid art collectors, they do
not always choose paintings that scholars would consider the best
examples of an artist's work. The Versace paintings are decorative
and have vivid colors, very much like his clothes, and four depict
women. The 25 works are expected to sell for more than $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting and sophisticated group,'' said Melanie
Clore, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Europe and head of Sotheby's
Impressionist and modern art department in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority came from the artist's estate, so they have never
been at auction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Picassos will be on view at Sotheby's York Avenue
headquarters in Manhattan from Nov. 13 until noon on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Colasuonno, a spokesman for the Versace family, said most of
the art for sale was being offered by Versace's company. The rest
belongs to family members, but he declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only a small portion of Gianni's art collection,''
Colasuonno said. ``It seemed like a good time to sell. The market
is robust, and there's a lot of interest in Picasso right now.
London has a good track record, and this sale will be a nice
complement to the sales in New York.'' Sotheby's is selling 24
Picassos in its night sales next week in New York, and Christie's
is offering nine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of Versace's paintings is a three-quarter-length
portrait of Dora Maar, one of Picasso's mistresses, that dates from
1938. It is estimated to sell for $6.5 million to $9.8 million.
Also from 1938 is ``Young Girl With Boat (Maya),'' which shows
Picasso's eldest daughter dressed in a sailor suit and holding a
model of a boat. It is expected to sell for $3.3 million to $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Versace's company is also selling his house in South Beach where
he was killed. Sotheby's International Realty is handling the sale.
The asking price is $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Gets Richters
</P>
<P>
   As director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, John R.
Lane was known for acquiring outstanding works. Now, as director of
the Dallas Museum of Art since February, he is beginning to do the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas museum announced this week that it had acquired the
complete editioned works of influential German painter Gerhard
Richter. He is known for a range of abstract and representational
styles that often involve photographs or other means of mechanical
reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   The 91 works, from 1965 to 1999, include paintings, prints,
sculpture and books. The sale was made through the London dealer
Anthony d'Offay and is said to have totaled $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's editioned works frequently blur the line between a
unique object and an editioned artwork.
</P>
<P>
   They include objects or prints produced in multiples and small
paintings produced en masse and then divided into what the artist
calls editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been looking for something that would offer a signal that
this museum and its collectors are serious about modern and
contemporary art,'' Lane said. ``There are 20 works by him in
private collections here, some of which are his most important
paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is planning a February show of his work, ``Gerhard
Richter in Dallas Collections.''  &QL;

   NORMAN-ROCKWELL-ART (Undated) _ Who was the most popular
American artist of the century? Norman Rockwell, obviously. The
Saturday Evening Post already had a circulation of two million
readers a week when Rockwell first walked through its doors in
1916. You might say that the magazine was akin to what television
became in terms of general appeal, and Rockwell quickly rose to be
its premier draftsman, doing 322 covers during the next 47 years. A
couple of years before he died in 1978, at 84, 10,000 people turned
out for a Rockwell parade in tiny Stockbridge, Mass. Saturday the
High Museum in Atlanta began a national tour of works by Rockwell
that ends up in 2001 at the Guggenheim in Manhattan. By Michael

   FITZCARRALDO-VIDEO (Undated) _ ``I want my opera house,''
screams Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, known as Fitzcarraldo, from the
top of the bell tower in the Peruvian Amazon town of Iquitos.
Toasted as a ``conquistador of the useless,'' the rabidly
enthusiatic and mostly failed entrepreneur, portrayed with mad
nonstop ardor by the wild-eyed, spike-haired Klaus Kinski, has
heard Enrico Caruso perform in Brazil and is determined to erect a
building grand enough to lure the singer for a gala evening deep in
the bush. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-LENS-FILM (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ For 18 months a
self-styled Odd Squad, seven beat cops hardened by years of service
on Vancouver's drug and disease-infested Downtown Eastside _ have
been compiling a documentary film, ``Through a Blue Lens,'' which
will have its premiere in Vancouver Nov. 20 and will be making the
rounds of the film festivals next year. By Murray Whyte. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MY-BEST-FRIEND-FILM (New York) _ ``My Best Fiend,'' at the Film
Forum in Manhattan through Nov. 16, is the German director Werner
Herzog's documentary about his tumultuous, love-hate relationship
with Klaus Kinski, the actor who starred in five of Herzog's
feature films. When Kinski published his autobiography, ``Kinski: I
Need Love'' (``Kinski Uncut'' in the English translation) just
before his death in 1991, he wrote disparagingly of Herzog: ``I've
never in my life met anybody so dull, humorless, up-tight,
inhibited, mindless, depressing, boring, and swaggering.'' Now,
with ``My Best Fiend,'' Herzog has a chance to set the record
straight, or at least tell his side of the story. By Gilberto
Perez. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ROSETTA-FILM (Undated) _ Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, brothers
who dazzled critics everywhere with ``La Promesse'' three years
ago, have come back with an even better film and a tougher one.
``Rosetta,'' which opened on Friday, had its American premiere last
month at the New York Film Festival. Discussing the movie with the
audience afterward, Luc Dardenne used battle language to describe
its heroine, played by Emilie Dequenne, a newcomer. ``She's at war
with the world that won't let her in,'' he said. ``To her, it's a
fortress she's trying to storm. But she becomes a fortress in the
process, and it nearly kills her.'' By Karen Durbin. (Moved).

<P>
   OFF-BROADWAY-INTERVIEWS (New York) _ Thoughts about Off Broadway
and Off Off Broadway in its early years from five people who were
present (and active) at the creation in the 1950s and '60s, and a
look at working there today by four members of the younger
theatrical generation. By Andrea Stevens. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   PEARL-THEATER (New York) _ Shepard Sobel has some truly radical
notions about the theater, and if they start getting around,
there's going to be trouble. ``I think the most interesting take on
Chekhov is Chekhov's take,'' he says. ``I'm not going to improve on
that. My basic thing is, trust the playwright and the text.'' Sobel
not only preaches this wild heresy, he also practices it in his own
little hotbed of classicism, the Pearl Theater Company. By Peter
Marks. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-THEATER (New York) _ For one brief, shining moment, and
it really wasn't much more than that, there flourished on the
island of Manhattan a bold and glittering realm of theaters, or so
legend has it. It was called Broadway, in reference to the arterial
avenue that ran through it. And those who are old enough to
remember swear that there was a time when this neighborhood
comprising 40 square blocks held up the most scintillating of all
cultural mirrors to the urgency, energy and impudence that was New
York. That moment was a matter of two mere decades, give or take a
few years _ that period between world wars when the mind of a new
country was finally catching up with its overgrown body. By Ben
Brantley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTIC-THEATER (New York) _ How does a nonprofit off Broadway
company measure its success? In the case of the Atlantic Theater
Company, the answer may go back to the Stoics. ``We measure what we
do against our larger guiding principles,'' says the group's
artistic director, Neil Pepe. While most theater troupes have the
vaguest of mission statements, the Atlantic Theater has what its
members refer to, without irony, as a philosophy. This credo _
mixing the Greeks and the myth-based writings of Joseph Campbell
with Konstantin Stanislavsky's principles on acting _ was handed
down in 1985 by one of the company's founders, David Mamet. By
Steven Drukman. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-BROADWAY-THEATER (New York) _ This month is an anniversary
of sorts: the beginning of the seventh year I have been covering
theater as a regular beat. Not the least of the discoveries for a
man who had been made numb after decades of total immersion in
films: that Off Broadway (including Off Off Broadway) is not just
an alternative New York theater, but virtually the entire New York
theater. Broadway continues to exist, but mostly as a glitzy, very
dear sideshow for attractions of greater scope and grander
aspirations in other neighborhoods. By Vincent Canby. (Moved).

   GARTH-FAGAN-DANCE (Rochester, N.Y.) _ On a recent morning, the
12 members of Garth Fagan Dance arrived at company headquarters in
downtown Rochester excited that they would be learning a new Fagan
work later in the day. The piece, ``Woza,'' which means ``Come'' in
Zulu, set to a commissioned score by the South African composer
Lebo M, will have its world premiere during the company's two-week
engagement at the Joyce Theater, beginning on Tuesday. By Valerie
Gladstone. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KING-ROGER-OPERA (Undated) _ Karol Szymanowski's ``King Roger''
is a beautiful opera with qualities that work against its survival.
At 80 minutes, it is too short for a full evening, and finding a
suitable partner for a double bill is not easy. ``King Roger,'' if
the composer's elaborate directions are followed, is complicated to
stage, this coupled with the fact that in terms of theater, very
little happens in it. A debate between the Apollonian and Dionysian
spirits is rich food for contemplation, but grand opera craves
direction and movement, something more on the lines of Mimi and
Rodolfo. But the opera has had uncharacteristic exposure recently.
The latest being a recording on EMI Classics by Simon Rattle and
the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. By Bernard Holland.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MASUR-MILLENNIUM-MUSIC (New York) _ Kurt Masur's idealism
pervades his talk about music. He professes to believe that music
can contribute to a dialogue about life and liberty. So with the
approach of the year 2000, he decided to ask six composers from
around the world to write works expressing their visions for the
new millennium. As music director of the New York Philharmonic,
Masur would conduct the pieces in a full evening's program to be
called ``Messages for the Millennium.'' By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SAARIAHO-MUSIC (Paris) _ in the quiet corner of the trendy Third
Arrondissement where the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho makes her
home, her thoughts drift toward snow, the sea and lofty ideas:
natural, perhaps, for a daughter of the Nordic lands. ``The seven
short movements speak of departure, love, tides, time, memory,
death and arrival,'' Ms. Saariaho said of ``Oltra Mar,'' a
16-minute work for orchestra and chorus commissioned by the New
York Philharmonic as part of its ``Messages for the Millennium.''
The orchestra will give the work's premiere on Thursday, the night
after the avant-garde Sonic Boom Festival presents the United
States premiere of Ms. Saariaho's ``Neiges,'' a 1998 work for cello
octet, at Cooper Union in New York City. By Cori Ellison. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-FESTIVAL (Paris) _ The Festival d'Automne a Paris, in its
first year, 1972, lasted four weeks; now it starts in late
September each year and continues for three months. Its founder,
Michel Guy, was concerned less with creating a festival than with
filling holes in the Paris cultural scene. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOZART-MITRIDATE-OPERA (Undated) _ In March 1770, when the
governor general of Lombardy, an Italian province then under
Austrian control, announced that the 14-year-old Mozart had been
invited to compose an opera for one of the country's most renowned
opera houses, the Teatro Regio Ducale in Milan, there was an uproar
among the personnel and patrons of the theater. That opera,
``Mitridate, Re di Ponto,'' Mozart's third, but the first written
for a major company, is little known today. So a fine new recording
of the work, with Christophe Rousset conducting the
period-instrument orchestra Les Talens Lyriques (Decca 460 772-2;
three CDs), is a valuable addition to the Mozart discography. By
Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WARHOL-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ Mention Andy Warhol's relationship
to pop music, and the first name to crop up will be that of the
Velvet Underground, the band Warhol championed in the mid-'60s. In
fact, Warhol's art and ideas didn't find musical expression until
the Velvet Underground was long defunct. The arts don't evolve in
temporal lock step, and it wasn't until the mid-'80s, largely
because of advances in technology, that pop music began to explore
the territory Warhol had opened up long before. By Tony Scherman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FIONA-APPLE-ALBUMS (New York) _ Ms. Fiona Apple, 22, started
working on her first album, ``Tidal,'' when she was 17. Its songs,
including the 1996 hit single ``Criminal,'' pondered the desires
and choices that arrive with adolescence. When the album appeared,
Ms. Apple was praised for frankness and mocked for self-absorption.
By the time she was old enough to vote, it had sold two million
copies. In the songs on her two albums _ her second one is due for
release on Tuesday _ she ricochets from anger to self-laceration,
from bitter memories to tentative promises. By Jon Pareles.

</P>
<P>
   SUBURBAN-WAR-GHOST (Undated) _ Some shows stick in the mind. For
example, ``World War II and the American Dream,'' an exhibition
presented in 1994 at the National Building Museum in Washington,
strongly influenced my view of suburban development. The show
documented in detail how wartime industry was retooled to create
the economic infrastructure of the post-war consumer society. Talk
about the ghost in the machine! Beneath the malls, the lawns, the
garages lay this subterranean realm of bombers, explosives and
tanks. I thought about the show earlier this year on reading news
reports of violence at suburban high schools. Could it be that this
militaristic past had come back to haunt the American dreamland
superimposed atop it? By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KINKADE-ART (San Jose, Calif.) _ Thomas Kinkade's
100,000-square-foot headquarters here is hardly a typical artist's
atelier. But then Kinkade, arguably the most commercially
successful painter of the 1990s, is hardly a typical artist. For
most high-art aficionados, Kinkade's light-dappled renderings of
frothing oceans, fantastical cottages and feverishly colorful
gardens, bearing titles like ``The Blessings of Spring'' and
``Hometown Evening,'' may be impossible to see as anything but
slickly commercial kitsch. But in view of Kinkade's popularity _
his official Web site calls him America's most collected living

   BRANDT-BLACKSMITH-ART (New York) _ Edgar Brandt, the French Art
Deco blacksmith, rarely seems to have forged an iron rod into
anything but spirals, judging from the decorative and architectural
metalwork he produced from 1901 to 1942. And currently there is
much to see of his spiral-embellished work that once sold widely in
the United States, especially in New York. The spirals and a great
deal more are visible in ``Edgar Brandt: Art Deco Ironwork and
Photographs from the Atelier,'' an exhibition at the Moderne
Gallery in Philadelphia, through Dec. 24. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

contemplate life without Kathie Lee Gifford? In addition to
starring in his hit morning show, ``Live With Regis and Kathie
Lee,'' Philbin is the host of the biggest hit in television this
year, ABC's game show ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'' It was
shown tournament-style for two weeks in August, ending its run with
a whopping 31 million viewers. Sunday night, it begins again every
night for the next two weeks just in time for sweeps (including two
nights in combination with ABC's ``Monday Night Football'').

 &HT;    SOY FOODS ARE COMING _ WITH PRAISE AND WARNINGS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 7.
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Get ready for a rush of good news from the soybean
industry _ and read it carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is gearing up for new sales, buoyed by favorable
regulatory decisions and preliminary scientific suggestions that
soy and its ingredients may avert or mitigate some of America's
most dreaded diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers attending an international symposium on the role
of soy in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases last
week warned repeatedly that their findings are preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   And some went even further: their preliminary findings suggest
that normal soy diets can even be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   A Hawaii study, for example, turned up a statistically
significant relationship between three servings of tofu a week to
``accelerated brain aging'' and even an association with
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 90 percent of what's left when oil is pressed out of
the beans for use in a variety of food and nonfood industries is
sold as soybean meal, primarily for livestock feed.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 10 percent goes into tofu, vegetarian burgers, soy
milk and other products that have until now occupied a somewhat
obscure niche in supermarket aisles.
</P>
<P>
   With soybeans bringing farmers around $4.25 a bushel last week,
the lowest price in more than 25 years, the thought of shifting big
blocks of the crop into the higher-priced human food market has
excited the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Oct. 26 announced that it
would allow soy-based food manufacturers to label their products
with the claim that they may reduce heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the decision, issued in response to a petition
by Protein Technologies International, a DuPont subsidiary that
manufacturers soy protein, was based on its conclusion that soy
protein may lower blood cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ``functional food'' market that the FDA ruling will
help open for soy protein, extracts from the humble beans are
making their way into the largely unregulated food supplements
industry in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Isoflavones, plant chemicals found in high concentrations in
soybeans and in practically no other plant, are being touted by the
practically unregulated food supplements industry as ``natural''
cures for breast cancer, osteoporosis, prostate cancer, heart
disease, menopausal ``hot flashes'' and other chronic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When several hundred scientists from around the world gathered
in Washington for the fourth symposium on health benefits of soy _
a gathering underwritten by giant soybean growing and processing
firms such as Archer Daniels Midland and DuPont _ they were clearly
uneasy about the rapid transfer of their preliminary results into
marketplace claims.
</P>
<P>
   Although soy isoflavones such as the phytoestrogens genistein
and daidzein seem to bind to estrogen receptors, a biochemical
process that could be significant to diseases such as heart
disease, breast cancer and osteoporosis, speaker after speaker
warned that the research is practically infantile. Some said no one
knows yet whether the effect is beneficial or harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am myself frightened a little bit by all of this,'' said
Herman Adlercreutz, a Finnish scientist whose pioneering studies
two decades ago led to the explosion of interest among scientists
in soy and its components. ``There is so much we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Adlercreutz's initial interest in soy grew out of his
observation that breast cancer and colon cancer were far less
common in Japan than in Finland. Suspecting a dietary link, he
investigated and was led to soy, long a staple of Asian diets.
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced that more dietary soy would improve the health
of Americans, Finns and residents of other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lon White is not.
</P>
<P>
   White, a scientist at the Pacific Health Research Institute in
Honolulu, described a study of the dietary habits and health of
several thousand Japanese-American men between 1965 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons of their dietary habits and their performance on
cognitive function brought out a significant link between
consumption of tofu during mid-life and loss of mental ability, and
even loss of brain weight.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the rigorously analyzed data showed a
dose-response relationship, indicating that men who ate more tofu
were more apt to have brain impairment.
</P>
<P>
   White speculated that soy isoflavones may inhibit critical
enzymes, or even estrogen-related mechanisms, necessary to the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   In a different paper, Maurice Bennink, a Michigan State
University researcher, described an experiment in which he fed
small amounts of soy protein to persons who had been diagnosed with
colon cancer or precancerous polyps for one year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, he said, persons on the soy diet had
less cancer or polyp recurrence than patients whose diets did not
contain soy.
</P>
<P>
   And Harvard University researchers described animal experiments
in which human prostate cancers were transplanted into mice and the
animals fed diets containing soy extracts. Metastasis of the tumors
appeared to be significantly reduced, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, conferees said more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not possible as yet to draw any conclusions about
soy consumption and cancer prevention, but further research is
certainly warranted,'' said soy foods expert Mark Messina, a former
researcher with the Diet and Cancer Branch of the National Cancer
Institute.

MAKING MEETINGS A BIT LESS PAINFUL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you're in business, you attend meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are you regard most of them as time wasted. But they
are inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make meetings more productive. But following
the rules usually means more work for the guy running it. Business
writers keep harping on the subject, simply because more productive
time is wasted in meetings than any other facet of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   So here it is again _ this time from the November issue of the
Management Communication Letter from Harvard Business School. While
there's nothing really new here, it bears repetition.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are only three reasons for a meeting _ communicating
planned action or the results of an action taken; or deciding among
alternative actions. If you're at a meeting with some other
purpose, you're wasting time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch the clock. No meeting should run over the time allotted.
If you get bogged down on a point, postpone it for further
information. If the meeting must conclude by taking an action, then
schedule it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Praise should be public, criticism private. Public criticism
should be squelched by the person running the meeting. Remember
that if you are working for the same employer, you're on the same
team. Sure, corporate politics are ever present, and often vicious.
But that doesn't mean we should use meetings to practice them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DON'T MAKE ISSUES PERSONAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Except when there's no other possible time, no meeting
should ever be held outside normal business hours. People who
schedule meetings for evenings and weekends are merely advertising
the embarrassing fact that they have no personal life and are using
yours as a substitute. That kind of person should not be allowed to
run anything. They lack the basic humanity to do a good job. Those
without a personal life can't possibly understand the world they're
in or see around the next business corner.
</P>
<P>
   _ One of the most dangerous misuses of meetings is to use peer
pressure to get employees to do something collectively they would
not do individually. Yet some people do just that to get people to
stray from the rules, to set the quotas too high, or any one of a
thousand deviations from your corporation's values. And if your
corporation doesn't have good values, look for another job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disagreement is vital to a meeting. If everyone agreed on a
course of action, you wouldn't need to meet. Just don't make it
personal. It's not just wrong, it's unwise. Using a meeting to hurt
another person's career will come back to haunt you. The reality is
you're going to see those people again. If not at your present job,
in your next one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
USE TIME TOGETHER WISELY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Democracy, not dictatorship, is the best model for a meeting.
Brute force is not the appropriate mode for meetings, though
jujitsu sometimes is. If the person leading the meeting knows
exactly what he wants and has the power to force his particular
views on the company, then he has two choices. Call the meeting and
attempt to persuade those it is the right thing to do. Or simply
issue an order. You don't need a meeting to announce a new policy
or procedure that is not up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meetings are business, not social. A certain amount of
socializing provides a lubricant necessary in all human
interactions. Too much socializing between friends, however, can
lead to resentment from those excluded. Besides, if all your
friends are business ones, you need to re-examine your life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always prepare a clear agenda and circulate it before the
meeting. That's just efficient business. It allows everyone to
prepare for the meeting and come in ready to take action _ not be
laboriously brought up to date on a multitude of minutiae. And err
on the side of overestimation of the time needed to prepare for a
meeting. The more notice the better.
</P>
<P>
   _ All companies have regularly scheduled meetings. Few ever ask
why they are called. Every regular meeting should have a built-in
agenda item titled, ``Is this meeting still necessary?'' It's just
one way to trim the corporate bureaucracy. Think of that item as
the equivalent of the Y2K program. Most companies had to go back
and redo their computer systems as a result of their existing
software programs not being able to recognize the date in the year
2000 and beyond. The smart ones used that review to look at all the
computerized reports generated and ask people if they really used
them. As you might expect, many reports were scrapped because of
that simple question. It's the same with meetings.

 &HT;    Rockwell moves beyond entertainment in stimulating show at the
High
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Rockwell does it again.
</P>
<P>
   America's most beloved artist, whose popularity has weathered
changing times, critical disdain and the pre-eminence of irony,
overcomes a shapeless exhibition to serve up a fascinating
experience for the public and the art elite alike.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the thematic organization of ``Norman Rockwell:
Pictures for the American People'' falls apart into a jumble of
stuff. Never mind that its curators push a little too hard,
imputing achievements to the artist that are hard to support. The
largest Rockwell show to date, which opens at the High Museum of
Art on Saturday, will certainly please those who already love him.
It ought to convince doubters about his abilities as a painter.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``provocative'' is not a word normally applied to
Rockwell's art, this show should also engage art mavens as a
commentary on art and mass culture or even the nature of art
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Rockwell's golly-gee persona masked his erudition, there
is more to his art than entertainment. The popularity of those
famous Saturday Evening Post covers results from the intersection
of the artist's impeccable realism, his understanding of what
subject matter spoke to the country's psyche and the power and
demands of mass communication.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know Rockwell through reproduction. The quality of
the 71 large paintings is the big surprise of the show. Although
they were made to be reproduced, they hold their own as works of
art. His handling of paint is as crisp as the air of the
Berkshires, where he lived for 25 years. The rigor and variety of
their compositions are impressive. The level of detail _ down to
the real safety pin affixed to ``Babysitter With Screaming Infant''
_ is remarkable, especially in view of what would be visible in the
smaller scale of the magazine covers or illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's subject may have been American life, but in his
working method, compositional devices and many allusions, he was a
veritable melting pot of European art. Using the traditional
beaux-arts method, he did an immense amount of preparation, making
sketches, studies and full-scale drawings of details and the whole.
The highly finished study for ``The Art Critic'' attests to the
strength of his draftsmanship and to art as a labor of love. He
wittily transformed the muscular prophet Isaiah into Rosie the
Riveter, the wartime hero doing ``a man's job.'' He absorbed the
lessons of baroque art _ which was intended to be ``read'' much
like his Post covers _ pushing figures into our space to draw us
in, exaggerating expressions and gestures to convey the story and
using diagonals to give compositions a dynamic edge.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell applied these lessons to vignettes that are as familiar
as losing a tooth, always dramatizing them in a way to make the
ordinary momentous.
</P>
<P>
   He was also capable of making the momentous ordinary, as in his
tableau of American GIs peeling potatoes or even in the homespun
scenes in his famous ``Four Freedoms.'' But that doesn't mean, as
maintained in the show, that Rockwell helped viewers come to terms
with changes in American life. He mostly depicted changes we
embraced, like television and automobile culture, and ignored the
conditions, like the Depression or the changing face of America,
that were troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Although his values were largely congruent with the mainstream,
this stance was also a requirement of his job. Unlike fine artists,
or the idealized version of them, Rockwell was always keenly aware
of, and felt that he worked for, his audience. He made images to
please or to sell products to middle America.
</P>
<P>
   That narrowed the pool of acceptable subject matter
considerably. If it's sports, it's baseball, not golf. If it's a
movie star, it's Gary Cooper, not James Dean. Definitely no sex,
and no passion of any kind. Rockwell eschewed the highs and lows of
life, concentrating on the comfortable, resolutely small-town
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Like a down-home, intimately scaled Busby Berkeley, Rockwell
organized tableaux not to muckrake but to distract people from
their troubles. The story inside the Saturday Evening Post may be
about Stalin, but the cover depicts a gardener discovering the
first bloom. The Brady Bunch had more problems than the world that
emerges from the little events that he depicts.
</P>
<P>
   Even his departure from this mode occurred through an
assignment: illustrations for civil rights stories in Look magazine
during the '60s. In ``The Problem We All Live With,'' in which
little Ruby Bridges is escorted to school by faceless marshals, and
in the powerful, Goyaesque and atypically unspecific ``Southern
Justice (Murder in Mississippi),'' he moves effectively from genre
to history painting.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, it may be difficult to see why the art world
turned its back on him from the 1950s on. Perhaps it was the
absence of profundity and passion, though one could level that
charge at the impressionists as well. More likely, it was the dogma
of abstraction that rendered his realism such anathema. Then, too,
fine art wanted to maintain its distance; if something was too easy
to understand, it wasn't any good.
</P>
<P>
   As the pendulum swings _ an apt subtitle for this art-world soap
opera _ the line between high and low is pretty much gone.
Figurative art is acceptable. The critics coming from all over to
see this exhibit are more likely to praise Rockwell than bury him.
Hopefully, they won't push the pendulum unrealistically far in the
other direction. He didn't invent American mythology, as this
exhibition claims, though he gave it an articulate voice. And he's
not, to cite one phrase flying about, ``America's Vermeer. ''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at ``Fruit of the Vine,'' the ad for Sun-Maid raisins,
which is an homage to the master. Vermeer was preoccupied with
light, and its companion, transcendence. In contrast, Rockwell's
painting stays at the kitchen table, a comfortable quotidian
moment. Not, to quote Seinfeld, that there's anything wrong with
that. Rather than puff up Rockwell into something he isn't, why not
credit him for what he did so well?

`IN HONOR OF DUKE': A RECORD WITH ITS OWN LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARCUS ROBERTS: ``In Honor of Duke'' (Columbia/Sony). First of
all: despite the pious title, it's not an album of Ellington music.
Roberts, on piano, emphasizes in his liner notes that the record is
not a tribute: ``A tribute,'' he declares, ``implies that the value
of what you're paying tribute to has little current or future
relevance.'' Strong words, but he's right. It's not Ellington or
Armstrong or Parker that makes people treat jazz condescendingly;
it's the insistence of record and concert producers on hollowly
honoring them with repertory rather than with something deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be swayed by the reputation for parched classicism that
continues to stick with Roberts. This is a record with its own very
peculiar language. Instead of wheeling out more gold-framed
versions of ``Caravan'' and ``Mood Indigo,'' Roberts takes some of
the root elements Ellington worked with _ blues and swing and Latin
rhythms and gospel _ and puts his dryly percussive (and somewhat
Ellington-inspired) touch to advancing his piano-trio concept
through his own music.
</P>
<P>
   The record is organized with recurring melodic and rhythmic
themes. Pieces are written as semi-concertos for drums, bass, and
piano, though you may not remember melodies from it; there's a lot
of riff and groove-based collective improvising, and loads of solo
breaks are structured into the music, sometimes as round-robin
games. Jason Marsalis' drums and Roland Guerin's bass drawl and
move ahead in staggered New Orleans rhythmic phrases, and the band
members take turns establishing themes.
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of Ellington's own trio recordings from the 1950s,
there's a great deal of soft playing on the album. But it's not
background music. Even at the softest volume, it's radical with
tempo. Members of the band experiment with subtle accelerations and
decelerations; they want to make the music warp. But through these
self-conscious experiments with rhythm, the music (and this may be
the crux of whether the album appeals to you) is extremely clean.
This rhythm section burns the residual bebop elements _ hot,
hurtling, dense _ off modern jazz as if they've soaked it in
turpentine; the swing remains, as well as Afro-Latin polyrhythms,
without clutter.

   Bernardo Bertolucci's film doesn't resort to labels or
psychobabble to explain the relations between Shandurai (Thandie
Newton), a refugee from an oppressive African regime, and Jason
Kinsky (David Thewlis), an expatriate English pianist and composer
living in Rome. After her husband is jailed, Sandurai turns up as a
straight-A medical student and a housekeeper who polishes Kinsky's
floors and dusts his artwork.
</P>
<P>
   One day he confesses that he has fallen in love with her but
apologizes when he learns she is married. Later he becomes infected
with the African pop she plays on the stereo, a far cry from his
classical leanings. Then she observes him meeting with an African
clergyman, and he mysteriously begins to sell off his possessions,
including his treasured piano.
</P>
<P>
   While all of this can seem affected and evasive at times,
Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ``you applaud its
creation of two grown-up people who don't have to be explained by a
list of character traits or fit a personality profile.'' &QL;

<P>
   The year is 1972 and, deciding to seek enlightenment, Julia
(Kate Winslet) gathers up her two young daughters, Bea (Bella Riza)
and Lucy (Carrie Mullan), and takes off from London to Morocco
without much thought to how they will support themselves. With no
goal other than to visit the Algerian temple of an esteemed Sufi,
she begins her hippie odyssey in Marrakesh and starts a passionate
affair with a street acrobat (Said Taghmaoui) who is as indigent as
she is.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some kind of stability, Bea, the elder daughter,
begins to yearn for a school uniform to wear and textbooks to carry
in Gilles MacKinnon's film, which could well have rested on its
strikingly atmospheric and sensual sights and sounds. Instead, the
performances ``are so credible and earnest that the family's story
never recedes into its mesmerizing background'' (Janet Maslin). &QL;

   There's no twisty concept here: Julia Roberts browses in a

William, the owner of the kind of establishment where she might go

pair who explore the possibilities of an unlikely liaison between
fame and obscurity. That means she has to meet and endure his
family and friends and he must learn to abide the mercurial and
often elusive ways of the famous.
</P>
<P>
   If there's little chemistry between the two, the film abounds

   Benigni's Film, In Two Versions &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days movies seem to move from theaters to video more
quickly _ except, of course, when it's more slowly. Roberto
Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' will be released on Tuesday, not
exactly a swift passage for a film that opened in theaters in
October 1998. Most movies take about six months. ``Shouldn't have
been delayed! Fans want sub not dub!'' reads the comment in The
Movie Monitor, a tip sheet that advises video retailers about
releases.
</P>
<P>
   The video was to have been released last summer, but then came a
postponement while a dubbed version of the film finished a run in
theaters. ``That's detrimental to what it will do on video,'' said
Rich Thorward, an industry consultant and publisher with The
Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The film, about a father's wildly innovative attempts to shield
his young son in a Nazi prison camp, should be highly popular. But
``you wait too long and it isn't as attractive,'' Thorward said.
</P>
<P>
   On video, the film, which is in Italian, will be issued in
subtitled and dubbed versions.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled films usually appeal to narrow audiences, but because
this one was so successful at the box office, its distributor,
Miramax, decided that it might succeed with a wider range of
viewers. The dubbing, in fact, was done for the video release.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain markets that makes sense, but in New York and other
metropolitan areas, the dubbed version won't do anything,''
Thorward said.
</P>
<P>
   On the fast track at the moment are movies like ``Arlington
Road,'' the Jeff Bridges-Tim Robbins thriller, which opened in
theaters in New York on July 9 and was released on video last week.
That's scarcely more than three months. The animated film ``Iron
Giant'' opened on the big screen on Aug. 4 and is scheduled for the
small one on Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen more quickly now because the studios realize the
advertising spillover helps,'' Thorward said.
</P>
<P>
   From their viewpoint, theater operators worry about films'
leaving too quickly and moviegoers' getting the idea that if
theater runs are so short, why not wait for movies on tape? Then
again, if a movie has clearly expended itself at the box office,
why wait to release it on video? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Jakob,' Twice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In September there was Robin Williams in ``Jacob the Liar,'' and
on tape and DVD there is now Frank Beyer's original ``Jacob the
Liar'' (1974), which, like ``Life Is Beautiful,'' is set in a Nazi
prison camp. The video is the first release from Ice Storm
International, a distributor in Northampton, Mass., that has the
video rights for many films from the DEFA Film Studios in the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a professor's interest in East German film, rights to
much of the DEFA library went to the University of Massachusetts
after German unification in 1990. In coming months Ice Storm plans
to issue many DEFA titles on video, including a series of fairy
tales and three Westerns. Information: info(AT)icestorm-video.com. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bass Samuel Ramey comes from Colby, Kan., a farm
town of 5,000. The population was 5,000 when Ramey was born there
57 years ago. The population is still 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colby never changes,'' Ramey said recently, relaxing in the
apartment he sublets near Lincoln Center. ``It's wheat country. The
population has been the same every year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-town jokes aside, Colby clearly had its influence on its
only native son to become an internationally renowned opera singer.
Six feet tall, trim and square-shouldered, Ramey is an easygoing,
plain-spoken Midwesterner through and through. During his fledgling
days with the New York City Opera in the 1970s, he was a dependable
slugger on the company's softball team. He is your classic solid
guy.
</P>
<P>
   So it's paradoxical that Ramey has made something of a specialty
of portraying various operatic manifestations of the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm practicing the occult,'' he said when asked
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Among his most familiar roles are Mephistopheles in Gounod's
``Faust'' and in Berlioz's ``Damnation of Faust,'' Nick Shadow in
Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress'' and the four villains, each a
Devil incarnate, in Offenbach's ``Tales of Hoffmann.'' The operatic
Devil he has portrayed most often is the title character of Arrigo
Boito's ``Mefistofele,'' which he will sing in a series of
performances at the Metropolitan Opera beginning Friday. The Met
has not presented the opera for 75 years. And Ramey has been the
most effective champion of this intriguing and neglected work.
</P>
<P>
   The production, new to the Met, was initially conceived as a
vehicle for Ramey and a creative team including the director Robert
Carsen and the set and costume designer Michael Levine. It was
first presented in Geneva in 1988, then at the San Francisco Opera
and the Lyric Opera of Chicago, which jointly own the production.
Since then it has become a sort of Samuel Ramey touring show, with
additional stops at the Houston Grand Opera and the Washington
Opera and return bookings in San Francisco, Chicago and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given some 75 performances of the role in this
production,'' Ramey said. ``And before that probably 40 or 50 in
the old Tito Capobianco production that used to be at City Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ramey has turned his intimacy with Beelzebub into
an entertaining concert program he often presents as a guest with
orchestras and opera companies. Called ``A Date With the Devil,''
the program offers Ramey in excerpts from all of his Luciferian
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey's repertory is extensive, ranging from Baroque operas like
Handel's ``Rinaldo,'' his Met debut in 1984, to 20th-century works
like Bartok's ``Bluebeard's Castle,'' which he will sing with the
Met Orchestra in a concert conducted by James Levine at Carnegie
Hall this spring. His management company, Vincent &AMP; Farrell
Associates, asserts that Ramey is the most recorded bass in
history, a hard claim to verify. But it may be true; his
discography includes more than 50 complete opera recordings, some
two dozen additional recordings of songs and sacred works, and even
a few musicals.
</P>
<P>
   What is it in the singing and persona of this aw-shucks American
that suits these Satanic roles?
</P>
<P>
   Low male voices have always been associated with menacing
villains and dour patriarchs, and Ramey's voice is especially
deep-set and resonant. Even in a comic role like Mozart's Figaro,
he can draw on this vocal quality to instill the love-sick valet
with heartiness and virility. When he lets his full voice fly, he
can sound chillingly demonic. This quality sometimes slips out when
he doesn't intend it to _ for example, in his Sony recording of
Gershwin's song ``They All Laughed'' on a disc of American songs,
``Every Time We Say Goodbye.'' When Ramey sings the line ``But ho,
ho, ho, who's got the last laugh now?,'' those powerful ``ho-hos''
are rather terrifying. ``Yikes!'' one thinks. ``You've got the last
laugh, you do, you do. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramey's natural basso resonance is complemented by his elegant
sense of lyricism, honed during early years of singing Mozart and
Rossini. The lyrical quality enhances his portrayals of the various
Devils, making Mephisto sound like a smooth operator, which of
course he is.
</P>
<P>
   And onstage, in the right production, Ramey is an athletic,
thick-maned, compelling figure. Carsen, the director, speaking
after a rehearsal for ``Mefistofele'' the other day, talked about
Ramey's suitability for the title role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that unique timbre in his voice,'' Carsen said. ``He
is also a wonderful-looking devil: handsome, sexy but in a
threatening way. Boito's devil is not just a person, but a whole
force. The way Sam uses his energy, he is a force field.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramey's levelheadedness has probably enabled him to have his
long career. But sometimes that very quality inhibits his
characterizations. Some critics felt that way about his portrayal
of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov in the Met's 1997-98 season. His
Boris was impressively vocalized and daringly physical, including a
fall down a staircase during his death scene that looked dangerous.
But Boris is a psychological wreck. To reach the throne, he
murdered the young son of the previous czar. Now he is obsessed
with guilt and delusional. More than illness, inner demons bring
about his death. Some critics felt that Ramey's Boris was, well,
not sufficiently neurotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I didn't go crazy enough,'' Ramey said. He was
concerned with his singing, he explained. ``My voice is probably
not ideal for Boris. I don't have that Slavic sound and color. I
put off doing Boris for a long time. My teacher, Armen Boyajian,
said that some of his students who tried Boris too soon were not
the same afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to sing the role at the Met with a primarily
Russian cast, conducted by Valery Gergiev, was too good to resist,
Ramey said. ``It was intimidating,'' he added. ``But the singers
told me my Russian was very good. It was a fabulous experience.
But, maybe I could be more neurotic.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he is fully engrossed by ``Mefistofele''; he believes
deeply in Boito's opera. Boito, born in Padua in 1842, became a
composer, librettist and critic. Though an erudite and literate
writer, he lacked technical skill and refinement as a composer. His
artistic conception of an opera based on Goethe's ``Faust'' was
grand. Too grand. At its premiere at La Scala in 1868, the opera
lasted nearly six hours and was booed vociferously.
</P>
<P>
   Despondent, Boito destroyed whole segments of the score and
vowed never to compose again. But he could not resist trying to get
the opera right. A trimmed-down, thoroughly rewritten version, the
opera we know today, was presented in Bologna in 1875. This time it
was a rousing success. Even so, Boito still forswore composing in
favor of writing librettos. His two most famous are ``Otello'' and
``Falstaff,'' which he wrote for Verdi in the last years of the
master's life.
</P>
<P>
   The best assessment of ``Mefistofele'' was written in 1889 by
George Bernard Shaw in his role as sacred-cow-skewering music
critic: ``The whole work is a curious example of what can be done
in opera by an accomplished literary man without original musical
gifts, but with 10 times the taste and culture of a musician of
only ordinary extraordinariness.''
</P>
<P>
   Carsen respects the opera tremendously. Of all the composers who
wrote opera based on ``Faust,'' including Gounod, Berlioz and
Busoni, Boito was the most faithful to Goethe's concept, Carsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are heavy doses of irony, comedy, tragedy, epic theater,
grotesque theater,'' he explained. ``It's significant that in
revising the work Boito kept the prologue where the Devil visits
God in heaven. God says he needs the Devil in order for people to
believe in him. God and the Devil acknowledge each other. It's
fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramey knows that to some musicians the score may seem ``a little
coarse'' or ``not sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the opera always has a powerful effect in the theater,''
he said. ``It's a great challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   That Ramey finds himself a respected senior figure in opera is
still sometimes surprising to him, for as a young man he never
conceived of an operatic career. His musical gift most likely came
from his mother, who had a pleasant singing voice. His father, a
meat cutter, did not know what to make of his son's interest in
music but was reassured when the young man went off to a local
college with the idea of becoming a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey's voice teacher at the time advised him to study Figaro's
aria ``Non piu andrai,'' so he bought a recording of Ezio Pinza
singing opera arias, including that one. He was intrigued. A few
years later, a friend told him about the summer festival program at
Central City Opera in Colorado. On a lark, Ramey went to a radio
studio, made a tape and enclosed it with his application.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lo and behold, they accepted me,'' he said. ``I went to
Colorado. I had never seen an opera before I was involved in one
that summer, `Don Giovanni,' with Norman Treigle in the title role,
who influenced me tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramey transferred to Wichita State University in Kansas, which
had a strong music program. After graduation he moved to New York,
took a job in a book publishing company writing advertising copy,
and kept auditioning for agents and opera companies. After four or
five auditions with the City Opera, he was hired. He made his debut
as the officer Zuniga in ``Carmen'' in 1972. By the next year, he
was one of the company's main draws.
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent immersion in the bel canto repertory, which
demands evenness of line and agility of execution, did good things
for his voice in those critical early years. Today his technique is
still flexible and his sound, though darker, robust. More Verdi is
in his future, but probably not Wagner, though he has been offered
Wotan many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell everyone that by the time I learn Wotan and feel
confident, I'll be too old to sing it,'' he said. The German
repertory has never held that much appeal for him as a singer,
Ramey says. But when he hears it, he gets ``blown away.'' He added:
``I'm tempted. Maybe by `The Flying Dutchman.' I'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 5,000 residents of Colby can at least hear
Ramey's Mefistofele on the radio when the opera is broadcast live
from the Met on Feb. 19. When he was growing up there, the local
radio station was not hooked into the Met's radio network for the
Saturday afternoon broadcasts. Now it is, which delights Ramey.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Colby some things change.

 &HT;    Mind-blowing `Malkovich' a wildly original ride that goes
nowhere
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Being John Malkovich'' is a deadpan promenade
through fashionable weirdness that you wish were more
exhilaratingly kooky than it is. The first half of this queer,
often brilliant film, in which people actually enter John
Malkovich's brain, is a Tilt-o-Whirl of bounding ideas. Its raw
promise induces giddy anticipation for something special. By the
flat ending, you're wondering what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malkovich,'' which indeed features a game John Malkovich in a
self-ribbing role as himself, peaks early and never delivers a
cumulative punch. The ride is fresh and fun but dimly unsatisfying.
What's left when it's over are scraps of what-shoulda-been: a bunch
of neat ideas, some bracing laughs, and biting performances from a
cast led by the endearingly befuddled John Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Jonze, the hot rock-video auteur last seen playing goofy
Pvt. Conrad Vig in ``Three Kings,'' should be thanked for not
stretching Charlie Kaufman's witty script into some kind of
visionary fantasia or cloying quirk-fest. Amid a visual palette
that's strikingly modest, Jonze forges a mindful sense of mood that
allows the bizarro story to unfurl with matter-of-fact ease. A
surreal sublimity courses quietly below the film's dry, calm
surface. Surprises pop up all over, most of which I won't divulge.
</P>
<P>
   Do take the title literally. At his new filing-clerk job on the
sliver-sized 7 1/2 floor of a Manhattan office building _ a
hilarious visual joke that the stooped characters are only vaguely
ruffled by _ Cusack's Craig Schwartz chances upon a Munchkin-ready
door behind a cabinet; beyond the tiny door is a muddy gullet _ a
constricted wormhole that leads, for no reason ever explained,
flush into Malkovich's head.
</P>
<P>
   When someone enters the portal, there's a sucking slurp, and
suddenly they're looking through the eyes of the respected actor of
stage and screen. After 15 minutes as John Malkovich, doing
whatever it is John Malkovich does (he showers, he reads, he takes
a cab, he rehearses a play), a traveler is abruptly dumped from the
sky into the brush on the New Jersey Turnpike. Wound-up and
breathless, he or she then stumbles home.
</P>
<P>
   When Schwartz shares his find with office temptress Maxine
(played by Catherine Keener with the hard lewdness of an undercover
cop on a hooker sting), the duo schemes to sell tickets to ``be''
John Malkovich _ $200 for a 15-minute, wholly nonvirtual trip.
This, when he discovers the mass violation of his cranium, is a wee
problem for Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite a household name, Malkovich is known for his
impressive light-bulb dome, spacey effeminate voice, thespian
gravity and a cross-eyed quietude that can explode into psychotic
violence. Here he refracts this offbeat image through the prism of
parody _ he lolls on his sofa reading aloud Chekhov's ``The Cherry
Orchard,'' cloaked at all times in Zen remove _ doing so with only
the slightest wink. We surely aren't seeing the real Malkovich; the
actor plays himself with the studied blankness of a cipher, as if
he is indeed a vessel for the other characters' desires, an empty
canoe for a 15-minute paddle around his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Several beautifully filmed scenes of freaky humanlike
marionettes enacting elaborate dramas give us the movie's operative
metaphor: the enticing proposition of being someone else, living
(sexual or professional) fantasies through another body, escape
from the self. ``Consciousness is a terrible curse,'' says Cusack's
woebegone Schwartz, who, besides a skilled file clerk, is a master
puppeteer. One of Schwartz's supple creations bears his own face
and nappy long hair. It's creepy, and sad.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz has found the imperfect cure. Malkovich finally becomes
another of his puppets, and for a while it's the answer to his
soul-searching and peculiar marital problems (Cameron Diaz, almost
unrecognizably frowzy, plays his sexually confused wife). Despite
some laughs, this last third of the movie isn't particularly
interesting and leads to a deflating conclusion. Right when the
film should be making an adrenaline sprint to the finish, it gasps
and stumbles. It's already burned up its ideas and begins to wheeze
on the fumes.
</P>
<P>
   A gentle fable about a slew of modern-culture bugbears, from
virtual reality to our urge to identify with celebrities and need
for illusions, ``Being John Malkovich'' delivers the didacticism of
good science fiction. But Jonze's novel comic vision make it much
more _ a dizzily transporting tumble down the rabbit hole, and
possibly the freshest thing on screen this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It looks increasingly unlikely that Broadway
audiences will be seeing the play ``Scent of the Roses'' any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The play's producer, Arthur Cantor, confirmed this week that
plans for a Dec. 12 opening at the Belasco Theater would have to be
pushed back at least a week. But an official with the Shubert
Organization, which owns the Belasco, said the play was not
expected to make it to New York this year at all, and that several
critical deadlines for set building had already passed. The
production's general manager also recently left the show.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by Lisette Lecat Ross, is at the Helen Hayes Theater
in Nyack, N.Y., through Nov. 21. It stars Julie Harris, a five-time
Tony winner, as an elderly South African woman guarding a
mysterious family heirloom. Biff Liff, who represents Ms. Ross and
Ms. Harris, said that positive reaction from audiences there had
inspired hope of a future Broadway production, but that a 1999
production looked impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The likely delay of ``Roses'' leaves ``Wrong Mountain,'' a
surreal sendup of the theater world by David Hirson (``La Bete''),
as the sole new play expected on Broadway before the end of the
year. The play, which stars Ron Rifkin (``Cabaret''), opened in San
Francisco on Oct. 27 to mixed reviews. It is opening at the Eugene
O'Neill Theater on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Broadway audiences have not been exactly friendly to new
work. Only two original plays have opened this season: ``Voices in
the Dark,'' John Pielmeier's thriller, which folded after two
months at the Longacre, and ``Epic Proportions,'' which has
struggled at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Life in `The Dead'
</P>
<P>
   With a caution that mirrors the prose that inspired it, ``James
Joyce's `The Dead''' looks to be creeping toward Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened on Oct. 28 at Playwrights Horizons to a bundle
of strong reviews. Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley said
``The Dead'' was ``a quiet revolutionary'' and praised the actors'
work, but faulted the second half of the piece. Clive Barnes of The
New York Post said the piece had ``a knowing, quietly savage
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviews have encouraged the show's producers. Gregory
Mosher, one of them, said that talks were going well with the
Shuberts for a Broadway theater, perhaps the Belasco; that the
cast, including the stars Christopher Walken and Blair Brown, would
apparently be available for a limited run, and that the Broadway
financing was in place. ``We're moving as quickly as we can,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the holdup? In part, it's simply logistics, Mosher
said, adding that Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey, the show's
director and composer, respectively, wanted to rework several
elements in the event of a move.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of caution may be the technical and artistic
challenge of re-creating the show's intimate environment in a
1,000-seat Broadway house. ``The Dead'' tells the story of a family
gathering on a snowy Irish evening through song and remembrances.
While critics said that intense familial feel was evident in the
141-seat Playwrights theater, will that feeling translate to a
larger house? Mosher says yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's a feeling of intimacy, that's a question,''
he said. ``But I think audiences create intimacy, and I think
they're doing it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Reincarnation
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of classic musicals, rejoice. The Encores musicals in
concert series at City Center is gearing up for another season.
This year's schedule has a decidedly '50s and '60s feel.
</P>
<P>
   First up in February will be ``On a Clear Day You Can See
Forever,'' the 1965 romantic comedy with music by Burton Lane and
book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner. The show, which ran for nine
months at the Mark Hellinger Theater, follows the story of Daisy
Gamble, a young woman whose previous lives turn out to be romantic
catnip for her therapist. The role proved to be a boon for a
Barbara and a Barbra: the Broadway version starred Ms. Harris, and
the film, Ms. Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   In March the series will feature ``Tenderloin,'' a 1960 comedy
about a minister's attempts to clean up the Tenderloin district.
Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick did the songs, with a book by Jerome
Weidman and George Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The final offering, in May, is ``Wonderful Town,'' the 1953
effort by the composer Leonard Bernstein and the lyricists Betty
Comden and Adolph Green, the same team that conspired in 1944 on
another city-minded musical, ``On the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   Homage to a Listener
</P>
<P>
   He may be pulling your leg, but N. Richard Nash says he isn't
quite sure exactly how old he is. ``I think I just may be in the
neighborhood of 85,'' he said with a laugh, ``though I don't sound
that old.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his age, what is certain is that this jocular wiseacre
has had quite a ride over the course of the last 50 years. Since
his Broadway playwriting debut in 1946, ``The Second Best Bed,'' he
has seen his work get good reviews (``The Young and the Fair'' in
1948), bad reviews (``Echoes'' in 1973) and no reviews at all
(``The Loss of D Natural'' in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   But his most durable creation remains ``The Rainmaker,'' a 1954
romantic fable about a Kansas farm girl who falls for the promises
of a fast-talking charmer. A staple of regional and community
theaters worldwide, the play has been translated in 40 languages,
including (no kidding) an unwritten African language in which
performers learn the part by rote. The Broadway revival opens on
Thursday night at the Brooks Atkinson. ``I'll be the one in the
dark suit,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wrote the play for his sister Mae, who died in 1987.
(He thinks; he's bad with dates.) He described her as ``one of the
left-out people,'' the woman who coached him out of a childhood
stutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mae got me in a corner and would say to me, `Talk,''' Nash
recalled, imitating his stammer. ``She would say: `I'm here, I'll
stay here, I won't rush you, and I won't leave you. Now, talk.'''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and said: ``Her willingness to listen is what saved my
life. And this is what this play is about.''

 &HT;    Elderly pay most as drug costs rise; companies profit
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like many Palm Beach County seniors,
Harriet Dorfman was in insurance heaven this year because
Foundation Health paid the entire tab for her prescription drugs.
Then the Medicare HMO announced it would stop covering drugs
because of rising health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   That's a cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for drugs used routinely by the elderly has accelerated
twice as fast as inflation since 1994 and four times as fast in
just the last year, a study released Wednesday shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more seniors are finding the cost of these drugs
unaffordable,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families
USA, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored the study of the 50
most commonly prescribed medicines for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which wants the federal government to pay for
prescription drugs through its Medicare program, said the median
profit reported in 1998 by the companies making these drugs was 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that there's very little competition, drug companies
feel like they can charge whatever price they like,'' Pollack said,
explaining the price increases. ``As a result, they have become the
most profitable industry in America.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, wholesale prices for the 50 prescriptions rose by 6.6
percent even though the overall inflation rate that year was just
1.6 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the University of Minnesota, found that
in the five-year period between January 1994 and January 1999,
prices for the same prescriptions rose 25.2 percent, nearly double
general inflation, which was 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the trade group for brand-name drug makers, the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said higher
drug spending was mainly due to increased use, not higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the industry plows 21 percent of its revenues into
research to find new cures and treatments, said the group, which
doesn't represent makers of generic drugs. The group's statement
also contended that the study is skewed by a few drugs that have
seen unusually big markups in recent years, including some made by
generic drug companies whose pricing policies are under
investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Among prescriptions for which the study found prices rose the
most was Lanoxin, widely used for congestive heart disease. The
wholesale price of a year's supply of tablets rose from $39 in 1994
to $74 in 1999, a 90 percent markup.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a year's supply of some other drugs grew in cost,
according to the study, during the same period:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pepcid, for ulcers, rose from $524 to $622.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prilosec, for heartburn, from $1,353 to $1,412.
</P>
<P>
   _ Premarin, estrogen replacement tablets, from $135 to $186.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zocor, a cholesterol drug, from $657 to $796.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fosamax, an osteoporosis drug, rose from $609 when it came on
the market in 1996 to $696.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may pay less than the drug prices quoted in the
study because of bulk discounts negotiated by insurance companies,
but many pay more because of retail markups by pharmacies. Older
people tend to need drugs more often but at the same time are among
the most likely to be without insurance coverage for them.
Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for the elderly,
does not pay for prescriptions, and about 14 million retirees have
no private drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, which has the nation's largest concentration of
elderly, Medicaid spent $447 million on drugs last year for
recipients 55 and older, a 17 percent increase over 1997, the state
Agency for Health Care Administration said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for the poor and
disabled, spent $83 million last year to reimburse recipients for
drugs in the study's top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman, 76, signed with another Medicare HMO on Wednesday and
estimated she will have to pay nearly $500 a month next year for
prescription drugs because her new plan caps its coverage at
$1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Her new expenses would wipe out most of her Social Security
check, forcing her to use her savings to pay her other living
expenses. So she's considering taking cheaper over-the-counter
drugs or not taking some of them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the government is going to do something about
this,'' said Dorfman, a former accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers said the Families USA study shows why
Congress must act soon to add drug benefits to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have said Congress will have to consider the
idea carefully next year. If unresolved, it is expected to become a
major campaign issue in the 2000 elections.

BARAK DEFIES SECURITY AGENTS AT RALLY HONORING RABIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Defying his own secret service agents, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak made a surprise last-minute appearance at a
mass rally in Tel Aviv Thursday night to commemorate the fourth
anniversary of the assassination of his mentor, Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the rally, Barak climbed onto the very stage
where Rabin, the former prime minister, had presided over a peace
rally immediately before he was gunned down by an Israeli
extremist. A wild cheer arose from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Flinging out his arms, Barak proclaimed, ``We are not afraid, we
are not afraid.'' Beside him stood the security agents who had
forbidden him to take the stage, fearing they could not protect
him, and his wife, Nava, who earlier this week admitted she worried
about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Israelis whistled and applauded. Some
chanted back, ``We are not afraid.'' From the stage, the crowd
looked like a forest of blue-and-white national flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to say to him, `Yitzhak, your way has won,'''
Barak said, his hoarse voice rising. ``And we came here to say to
anyone who might think that we could be moved off that way, we came
here to say, `We are not afraid, we are not afraid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, Mrs. Barak smiled broadly, looking across the stage
to Leah Rabin, the widow, who nodded and smiled back.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is not given to dramatic flourishes, and earlier Thursday
a close adviser said it was inconceivable that he would ignore the
secret service restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has not openly chafed at the ring of bodyguards that
surrounds him, as did his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. But
other government officials and journalists have questioned the
thick layer of protection that often stands between the prime
minister and his people.
</P>
<P>
   The secret service had said that Barak had not given them the
two weeks' notice they needed to secure the site. But it was widely
believed that they felt the moment was laden with echoes and too
risky. It took place not only at the site of Rabin's last peace
speech, but right after Barak had returned from a peacemaking
mission to Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Security agents originally told Barak that he could speak from
the stage if he did so within a bullet-proof plastic bubble. But
Barak told associates, ``I am not the pope.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the secret service, some 1,100 police officers
filled the square, renamed Rabin Square after the assassination,
next to the Tel Aviv City Hall. The City Hall building is
undergoing a restoration project to preserve some of the original
graffiti, particularly the large, spray-painted, ``Sorry,'' that
was applied just after the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of the rally, Barak seemed to be obeying
the advice of his security advisers: He remained inside a ``sterile
zone,'' a large box that had been constructed, chillingly, on the
very site where Rabin was gunned down. From there, Barak's image
and initial remarks were beamed to giant screens facing the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television reporters, accustomed to politicians who
stage their events for the evening news, signed off for the night
declaring that Barak had submitted to the secret service demands.
But after the spotlight of the news cameras had turned off, Barak
made his climb to the stage.

20 YEARS LATER, IRAN'S ANTI-AMERICA PROTESTS LACKING IN FERVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ For Islamic revolutionaries, it's a red-letter
day, a day to raise old banners, shout old slogans, burn a few
flags, renew the old fervor, savor the days when Iran, in its
dealings with America, had the sense that it, at last, was calling
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   It's Nov. 4, the day in 1979 when militant students clambered
into the U.S. embassy compound, seized more than 50 diplomats, and
launched the 444-day hostage crisis that has poisoned ties between
Iran and the United States ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 20th anniversary, was to be a day of days, a
triumphal homecoming for the revolutionary class of '79. Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, the Muslim cleric who leads the country now, had
called on ``followers of the Imam's line'' _ Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the revolution's original leader, the man who called the
United States the ``Great Satan'' _ to show that time had not
exhausted the passions that drove Iranians to drive out the shah,
and with him the ``tyrant'', America, that was his principal
backer.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, amid the strident speechmaking and the punching of
the air that accompanied Thursday's rally, there was something out
of temper, something registering unmistakably that even in Islamic
Iran, the years have marched on. For one thing, there can hardly
have been more than 5,000 people at the gathering, 7,000 by the
most optimistic estimate, in a city, Tehran, that has a population
of 12-million.
</P>
<P>
   For another, many in the crowd, especially among the young,
seemed to have trouble working up the requisite animosity for the
United States. One 21-year-old woman, assigned to the rally by her
college photography tutor, looked out bemused from beneath the
scarf required by Islamic dress codes. What did she think of the
protest? ``It's a joke,'' she said, nodding towards a group of
young women with western dress poking out from beneath their black
cloaks. ``How can you shout `Death to America!' when you're wearing
blue jeans?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she favored re-establishing Iran's ties with the United
States, she scoffed. ``Where have you been, asleep?'' she said.
``In every sense that really matters to me, we've had relations
with America for years. All this is just a big show.''
</P>
<P>
   What she meant, apparently, was that the Iran of 1999 _ an Iran
of Internet cafes, of up-to-date Hollywood movies in video
rental-stores, of American boat-shoes and designer clothes in fancy
boutiques, of Coca-Cola served from sidewalk stalls, of prosperous
Iranian-Americans commuting between Tehran and new homes in New
York and Dallas and Los Angeles _ is a country with rich ties to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing are the diplomatic links that were severed the
moment the embassy was seized, and even they may not be many years
away, in view of feelers put out by both governments in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   On the podium set up close to the gates of the old embassy on
Taleqani Street, one of those who participated in the embassy
takeover, Mohsen Rezaie, former commander of the Revolutionary
Guards, had trouble holding the crowd with a speech that was mostly
a walk down memory lane, with references to the ``den of spies,''
as Khomeini called the embassy, to American ``arrogance,'' and to
the hostage-takers' ``compassion'' in releasing women and
African-Americans before the diplomatic deal that sent the others
safely home on Jan. 20, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there was no repeat of an awkward moment at the 1998
rally, when an indecorous student reminded Rezaie that his son had
recently fled to the United States and sought refugee status there,
a fact prominently reported in Tehran newspapers that support a
democratic reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   The student suggested, to laughter from the crowd, that the
former hostage-taker might want to ``bring your son home'' before
lecturing other Iranians about maintaining the correct degree of
revolutionary vigilance towards America.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was nothing quite so cheeky on Thursday, there was
plenty to suggest that many young Iranians are exhausted by enmity
for the United States. There was an array of baseball caps, bearing
logos for the Yankees, the Lakers, the Redskins, and other American
teams.
</P>
<P>
   There were students, and others, who turned up with posters
bearing the image of President Mohammed Khatami, the cleric who has
galvanized the reform movement and outraged conservative clerics
with a vision of an Iran that curbs the excesses of clerical rule
with democratic institutions and an enhanced regard for human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Khatami images were vastly outnumbered by posters for
Khomeini and his successor, Ayatollah Khamenei, who refuted
Khatami's calls for a ``dialogue'' with the United States in a
speech on Wednesday in which he said that only ``simpletons and
traitors'' could seek a rapprochement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One young man who unfolded a homemade Khatami poster had it
snatched away and scrumpled up by a rough-hewn man in his 40s who
identified himself as a ``hezbollahi,'' a follower of the Party of
God, one of the most militant and vengeful Islamic groups in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The poster-snatcher, in all likelihood, was one of the veterans
of 1979 for whom the embassy seizure, and the militancy that
engendered it, have a sacred quality not to be tampered with by
revisionists.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more ironic twists to Iran's revolutionary story,
many of the most influential advisers to Khatami were militants
once themselves, some of them men who helped seize the embassy, and
watched as the bewildered diplomats were led blindfolded into the
embassy compound to be displayed as trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Thursday's crowd, those who have remained
unwaveringly loyal to the memories of 1979 are mainly those for
whom the Islamic revolution offered an opportunity for
self-aggrandizement, or relief from lives of penury and
powerlessness.
</P>
<P>
   There were greying men with red headbands and bandilleros,
factory workers, clerks and janitors, widows and orphans of
``martyrs'' from the Iran-Iraq war, rural dwellers for whom the
revolution brought government jobs and educational opportunities
and pensions, Muslim clerics who emerged as powers in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Many sported the several-day stubble and the collarless cleric's
shirts that became the revolutionary uniform. They shouted ``Death
to America'' and ``Death to Israel!''
</P>
<P>
   Harking back to a tradition that had fallen out of favor last
year, they burned flags, clambering atop scaffolding opposite the
old embassy compound to drape the Stars and Stripes, the
blue-and-white flag of Israel, and Britain's Union Jack, then set
them alight. One banner denounced ``the Great Satan,'' a phrase
little heard since Khomeini died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the irreverent counterpoints that lent a special
character to the day. A 17-year-old student, Hassan, said that from
what he had heard, America wasn't so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister is in America, and she says it's a nice place, so I
don't see why I should shout `Death to America','' he said.
``Besides, many Iranians live in the United States, so wouldn't it
make sense if we were good friends?'' Ardeshir, also 17, thought
the moment called for something ironic. ``Oh, America, my love!''
he said, in English, spreading his arms, grinning broadly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a dispute about the flag-burning had broken out, with a
glowering, stubble-faced member of the basiji, revolutionary
volunteers who have often acted as vigilantes, remonstrating with
Samim, an 18-year-old, for expressing doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in flag-burning, it's disrespectful,'' Samim
rejoined. ``How would you feel if somebody burned the Iranian
flag?'' As smuts from the flags floated down like chaff, a
14-year-old boy chipped in, ``We shouldn't burn the American flag
because we love the American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hubbub, there was one point on which even those most
genially disposed towards the United States seemed to concur, that
Washington should stop setting conditions for Iran to meet before
the American policy of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation
is dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said Iran must disavow the
development of nuclear weapons, end its support for ``terrorists,''
including the militant Hamas and Hezbollah groups that have
attacked Israelis civilians from bases in Lebanon and the Gaza
Strip, and stop opposing the Middle East peace process between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on the eve of the rally, Khamenei said the
American demands amounted to asking Iran to ``submit'' to the
United States as it had under the shah. In this, at least, the
religious leader appeared to have almost universal support.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas Dasht, a 35-year-old lawyer who joined the hostage-takers
as a teen-age volunteer, said the United States had learned nothing
from the hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message was that Iran wanted to be independent, and to
have that independence respected,'' he said. ``So there cannot be
any question of setting conditions for us now.''

IS $2 BILLION FAIR PAYMENT FOR A FIANCEE LEFT AT THE ALTAR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when people sued for ``alienation of affection?'' The
idea was that if someone came in and stole the love of your
erstwhile sweetheart, he should be forced to pay for the pain he
inflicted on you.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear much about such suits in matters of the heart
these days. The prevailing idea is that people have the right to
choose their own partners _ and the right to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept lives on for really important things _ such as
megamergers. With the blessing of the Delaware courts, which are
the arbiters of such things because most major companies are
incorporated there, the payments have become standard in corporate
marriage contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a jilted suitor should be compensated for the
trouble and expense required to put together the marriage plan.
That sounds quite reasonable _ lawyers and investment bankers don't
come cheap these days _ but there should be limits. Perhaps $2
billion is a bit high.
</P>
<P>
   That is the price that American Home Products has negotiated to
get if its planned marriage to Warner-Lambert does not make it to
the altar. To be sure, it's not hard to understand why American
Home Products felt a need to negotiate such a fee, given that it
loses fiances faster than Elizabeth Taylor used to shed husbands.
Deals with SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto collapsed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to this union comes from Pfizer, which wants to buy
Warner-Lambert and is willing to pay more than American Home is
offering. But the offer Pfizer unveiled Thursday is contingent on
the termination fee going away. Pfizer is suing in Delaware to have
the fee ruled illegal, and it could be an interesting fight.
</P>
<P>
   The controlling case in Delaware stems from a shareholder
challenge to the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger in 1997, which featured
an until-then unheard of termination fee of $550 million. The
Delaware Supreme Court said the fee, which equaled 2 percent of the
market value of Bell Atlantic, ``was a reasonable forecast of
damages'' if the deal collapsed and was ``neither coercive nor
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   That ruling opened the floodgates. Thomson Financial Securities
Data, which tracks such things, reports that the record fee leaped
to $1.8 billion last year in the GTE-Bell Atlantic agreement. This
fee _ about 2.7 percent of the market value of American Home _
breaks the record.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of such agreements, of course, is to head off
competing bids. If this provision stands, Pfizer would have to pay
about $2.50 a share more than American Home would have to pay to
have a comparable bid. The breakup fee also has the interesting
twist that it appears to be designed to assure that Pfizer could
not use favorable pooling accounting _ as American Home plans to do
_ if the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   This deal is tangled because Pfizer contends that Warner-Lambert
knew Pfizer was willing to pay more than American Home was offering
even before the deal was signed. Under those circumstances,
agreeing to a huge termination fee smacks of an effort to ward off
an unwelcome suitor, rather than a necessary part of a deal that is
designed to benefit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   American Home and Warner-Lambert will no doubt point to
expectations of great long-range benefits for shareholders if their
merger is completed. Maybe they will be persuasive. But the courts
should make sure that the final arbiters of which deal is better
are the shareholders of Warner-Lambert. After all, they do own the
company.

   PARIS _ ``Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or
close the wall up with our English dead.'' (Shakespeare).
</P>
<P>
   ``Once more into the beef, dear friends, once more, or close the
supermarket trolley up with our English apples.'' (Tesco).
</P>
<P>
   Watching the escalation of the beef war from the other side of
the Channel, it has been difficult to know whether to laugh or to
despair.
</P>
<P>
   The British were once prized, on the French side of the water,
for their phlegm; their calm; their sense of fair play. No more.
The hype and hysteria surrounding the French ban on British beef
has been utterly disproportionate to the crime (and a minor
political crime in Paris there certainly was).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of propaganda and vilification in the tabloid press
_ and not just the tabloid press _ has been reminiscent of the
prelude to a real war, not a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this is not a government propaganda campaign but a
propaganda campaign generated almost entirely by the British press
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since when did the highly urban, British tabloid newspapers and
their mostly urban readers care a stuffed turnip for the genuine
problems of British farmers?
</P>
<P>
   Do we really feel outraged that the French prefer not to eat our
beef? Or have we all fallen victim to a part-cynical,
part-unthinking agenda which loves to feel outraged by foreigners,
especially the Europeans and mostly the French?
</P>
<P>
   Enough. Ca suffit. Please calm down, everybody. Can we just
return to a few simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   The French are in the wrong. It was foolish of them to break an
EU concensus and try to impose an absolute safety standard on
British beef.
</P>
<P>
   There are complex, emotive French political reasons why this
happened. But, in the end, France, as a great food-exporting
nation, has the most to lose from such wildcat applications of an
impossible 100 percent safety barrier for trade in food.
</P>
<P>
   But please let us remember what we are quarrelling about. We are
arguing about the resumption of British beef exports to France,
which British officials say would probably reach no more than 20
tons in the first year, in other words roughly one truck load.
</P>
<P>
   We are hurling insults across the Channel in a horribly
technical dispute in which the scientific arguments are not
completely understood by more than one in every 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   BSE has declined sharply in the UK in the last three years _
more rapidly than the French admit _ but the disease is still
infinitely more rife in Britain than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The French scientific community has a right to be concerned; so
should we be. But the French have not produced convincing new
evidence that the limited British beef approved for export is
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   To turn this mind-bendingly complex quarrel into some kind of
national crusade in which the froggies are hypocritical,
protectionists whose cows eat dung (they don't); and we are
obviously right, just because we are British, is absurd; puerile;
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the hypocritical French farmers DO feed their cows
sewage, don't they? The European Commission said so.
</P>
<P>
   No it did not. It said that some French manufacturers of animal
feed had illegally placed processed sewage sludge into the mix with
cereals and a score of other ingredients. In other words, there
were minuscule traces of treated sewage in some animal feeds,
mostly used for pigs and chickens, not cows.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is horrible and disgusting enough. It caused
consternation in France when it was revealed months ago. It is a
long way from what you can still read daily in tabloid and
broadsheet British newspapers and the mouths of Conservative
politicians: that French farmers willingly feed their cows dung.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of fault on the French side of the Channel.
French farmers, always game for a bit of tractor-borne aggro, are
threatening to block British trucks. A trial run by a few farmers
last Tuesday received an escort of French gendarmes as it trundled
through the Pas de Calais.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts strangely with the pompous and high-handed
reaction of French police to a dotty little demonstration by
British Euro MP's on the Champs Elysees and a British roast beef
lunch organized in Amiens by FRENCH farmers last week, sympathetic
to the British case.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't have in France _ do we have to reach the
depressing conclusion that it is a more grown up country? _ are the
mindless insults and foreigner-baiting which are rife in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   There are real issues here but they are not truly issues of
Britain versus France, or British farmers versus French farmers, or
British consumers versus French consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They are issues of food safety in a world in which some farmers
no longer know what they are feeding to their animals; they are
issues of agri-industry versus traditional farming.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues which cross national boundaries because food
crosses national boundaries, in huge quantities.
</P>
<P>
   They are not issues which can be solved by waving flags and
screaming insults in the name of half-understood science.
</P>
<P>
   Let the politicians and the lawyers and the scientists sort it
out. Let's, everyone, take a deep breath. It is time for common
sense, and a sense of proportion, to break out, on both sides of
the Channel. &QL;

 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE INDEPENDENT  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horror of the situation in Chechnya speaks for itself. Large
numbers of civilians have been killed. A third of the population
have fled their homes; many are trapped inside Chechnya, unable to
escape. And still the onslaught continues.
</P>
<P>
   This is the terrible reality of the Russian war, a reality that
is daily ignored by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's war on Chechnya damages not just Chechnya but Russia
itself. It is sad that Moscow fails to understand this point. It is
equally depressing that Western politicians fail to understand the
importance of what is happening in Chechnya today.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian artillery pounds Chechen towns, it is of course
civilians who bear the brunt _ killed, maimed and orphaned. The
Islamic radicals are safely holed up in the hills; pinpoint bombing
is not a concept that the Russian military are familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   The near-silence on this subject from Western politicians is
both shameful and familiar. During President Boris Yeltsin's first
war against Chechnya in 1995, Western leaders insisted that this
was Russia's ``internal affair''; a similar logic applied in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians finally understood that looking away merely
encouraged Serbia's ethnic-cleansing president, Slobodan Milosevic,
to behave even worse than before. It is tragic that this lesson has
not been learned in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have done everything possible to prevent
independent journalists from working in Chechnya. But the picture
is clear. The Russian army believes that it has a license to kill.
</P>
<P>
   This war is driven, above all, by Russian politics; the fate of
Chechnya and the Chechens is almost incidental. President Yeltsin's
government hopes to gain Brownie points with the voters by alleged
attacks on the Islamic terrorists who have caused such mayhem in
Moscow. But that tactic can only work in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   As became clear in Chechnya in 1995, short-term military victory
is much easier to achieve than successful long-term occupation.
Soon, large numbers of young Russian conscripts will start to
return home in body bags. Then the voters will no longer be so
happy with the progress of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, every bomb dropped on Chechnya is petrol on the fire
of Islamic radicalism. There will be no shortage of recruits for
bombings in Russian cities in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya currently occupies a diplomatic no man's land. But all
of Russia's current actions mean that full Chechen independence is
coming closer _ which, in turn, will lead to yet further
fragmentation. When that happens, Moscow will have no one to blame
but itself.
</P>
<P>
   It need not have been like this. The Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov, is no lover of the Islamic radicals who have
destabilized his country. Yet, when he sought to talk to Moscow, he
was repeatedly rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian assault took place without any discussions with
Maskhadov. That refusal to talk has made it impossible for him to
play a moderating role. Moscow's loss is the terrorists' gain.
</P>
<P>
   And still the West does nothing. In Oslo this week U.S.
President Bill Clinton ``expressed concern,'' diplo-speak for doing
as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This do-nothing policy is lethal. Here, unlike the situation in
Kosovo, military intervention is neither necessary nor practicable.
Tough diplomacy and economic threats are, however, essential if the
lunacy is to be reversed. &QL;

<P>
   The horror of the situation in Chechnya speaks for itself. Large
numbers of civilians have been killed. A third of the population
have fled their homes; many are trapped inside Chechnya, unable to
escape. And still the onslaught continues.
</P>
<P>
   This is the terrible reality of the Russian war, a reality that
is daily ignored by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's war on Chechnya damages not just Chechnya but Russia
itself. It is sad that Moscow fails to understand this point. It is
equally depressing that Western politicians fail to understand the
importance of what is happening in Chechnya today.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian artillery pounds Chechen towns, it is of course
civilians who bear the brunt _ killed, maimed and orphaned. The
Islamic radicals are safely holed up in the hills; pinpoint bombing
is not a concept that the Russian military are familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   The near-silence on this subject from Western politicians is
both shameful and familiar. During President Boris Yeltsin's first
war against Chechnya in 1995, Western leaders insisted that this
was Russia's ``internal affair''; a similar logic applied in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians finally understood that looking away merely
encouraged Serbia's ethnic-cleansing president, Slobodan Milosevic,
to behave even worse than before. It is tragic that this lesson has
not been learned in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have done everything possible to prevent
independent journalists from working in Chechnya. But the picture
is clear. The Russian army believes that it has a license to kill.
</P>
<P>
   This war is driven, above all, by Russian politics; the fate of
Chechnya and the Chechens is almost incidental. President Yeltsin's
government hopes to gain Brownie points with the voters by alleged
attacks on the Islamic terrorists who have caused such mayhem in
Moscow. But that tactic can only work in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   As became clear in Chechnya in 1995, short-term military victory
is much easier to achieve than successful long-term occupation.
Soon, large numbers of young Russian conscripts will start to
return home in body bags. Then the voters will no longer be so
happy with the progress of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, every bomb dropped on Chechnya is petrol on the fire
of Islamic radicalism. There will be no shortage of recruits for
bombings in Russian cities in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya currently occupies a diplomatic no man's land. But all
of Russia's current actions mean that full Chechen independence is
coming closer _ which, in turn, will lead to yet further
fragmentation. When that happens, Moscow will have no one to blame
but itself.
</P>
<P>
   It need not have been like this. The Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov, is no lover of the Islamic radicals who have
destabilized his country. Yet, when he sought to talk to Moscow, he
was repeatedly rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian assault took place without any discussions with
Maskhadov. That refusal to talk has made it impossible for him to
play a moderating role. Moscow's loss is the terrorists' gain.
</P>
<P>
   And still the West does nothing. In Oslo this week U.S.
President Bill Clinton ``expressed concern,'' diplo-speak for doing
as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This do-nothing policy is lethal. Here, unlike the situation in
Kosovo, military intervention is neither necessary nor practicable.
Tough diplomacy and economic threats are, however, essential if the
lunacy is to be reversed. &QL;

GORE LASHES OUT AT GOP LEADERS IN WAKE OF WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of two more workplace shootings in
Honolulu and Seattle, Vice President Al Gore on Thursday accused
congressional Republicans of bottling up anti-gun legislation
because of pressure from the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's attack comes as House Republicans, led by Majority Whip
Tom DeLay of Texas, have launched a fund-raising appeal, warning of
assaults on gun rights and soliciting contributions to help elect
``pro-gun members.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest political maneuvering underscored how both parties
believe they can use the gun issue to motivate voters in next
year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the leading Democratic presidential contender, went to
Capitol Hill to make the case for tougher gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Democratic senators and House members, Gore berated
the GOP leadership for not moving ahead with negotiations to iron
out differences on gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of the majority party, the Republican Party in
the Congress today, is frustrating the will of the American people
by refusing to take up legislation that the American people
support,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats charged that the GOP leadership is
holding up legislation because of pressure from the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the NRA that important to them when we have these
horrific instances of gun violence practically every week,'' Gore
asked.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., fired back that he has been trying to forge a
compromise but that Democrats appeared more interested in playing
politics than passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've turned what should have been serious negotiations into
a public relations exercise,'' Hyde said. ``I'm increasingly
disappointed as they seem to want the issue and not legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, following the high school shootings in Colorado and
Georgia, the Senate approved a juvenile justice bill that included
tougher gun-control legislation that required background checks at
gun shows, child-safety trigger locks, and a ban on high-capacity
ammunition clips. But the House defeated similar gun-control
measures when it took up the juvenile justice bill.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are now trying to work out a deal
on the youth crime bill that will include some of the gun-control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that he has floated compromises that include a waiting
period of 24 hours so that law enforcement officials can check
backgrounds of those who purchase firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   If the buyer has an unresolved arrest or some other offense
officials would have up to three business days to continue their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have been demanding a three-day background check
for gun-show purchases while conservatives have insisted on instant
checks.
</P>
<P>
   While Hyde may be trying to seek a middle ground solution to the
issue, others in his party such as DeLay are undercutting those
efforts by trying to galvanize gun-control opponents.
</P>
<P>
   An Oct. 29 fund-raising letter from the National Republican
Congressional Committee and signed by DeLay asks for $25 donations
to ``prevent restrictive gun legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a leading member of Congress I am determined to stop
passing unnecessary laws that restrict your freedom to protect your
family,'' DeLay wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to say that the money will allow Republicans
``to get our message out to thousands of voters in key districts
and states and elect pro-gun members to the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter is a toned down version of an Oct. 6 fund-raising
appeal by DeLay that says that ``(President) Clinton and the
anti-gun lobby are using the tragedies at Columbine High School and
Georgia to stop you from exercising your right to own a gun and
protect your family''
</P>
<P>
   Both letters were follow-ups to phone solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spokeswoman Emily Miller said that while the congressman
had supported some compromises on gun control, he was tapped to
send out the fund-raising letter because he ``is well known as
being this big Second Amendment rights guy.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that a number of prominent Democrats, such as Sen.
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, also used the gun issue to raise
money from gun-control proponents.
</P>
<P>
   And Jill Schroeder, a spokeswoman for the NRCC, said the
fund-raising appeal was based on the premise that ``people who
favor gun ownership are an important constituency in the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Republicans believe the gun issue will help them with
their conservative voters, Gore and the Democrats believe that by
pushing gun control they can strengthen their support among key
constituencies, particularly women and suburbanites, in the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a national issue all over the United
States,'' said Gore, who frequently raises the issue on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans, led by their presidential front-runner
George W. Bush, have argued that the problem is not the lack of gun
measures but poor enforcement of current laws. The Texas governor
repeatedly tells audiences on the campaign trail that he would beef
up enforcement of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded that the Clinton administration favors
enforcement of current gun laws. But he added, ``the Republican
Congress has passed loopholes that made it more difficult for the
government to proceed efficiently to the enforcement of the
existing laws.'' Gore did not elaborate on what those loopholes are
that have hindered enforcement.

AUSTRALIA APPEARS RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP ON BRITISH MONARCHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sydney Journal) 
(rk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ God save the Queen! Here it is, the end of
the 20th century, and a mature, developed nation appears to be on
the verge of voting this weekend to retain a foreign monarch as its
figurehead rather than to become a republic.
</P>
<P>
   As polls and analysts have converged in predicting that
Australia will pledge its continued troth to Queen Elizabeth II of
Britain, many public figures have been seized by something called
``cultural cringe.'' They are raising the cry, ``What will the
world think of us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go into the new millennium as part of a
monarchy _ it's another to go in with a vote to stay in a
monarchy,'' said Christopher Brown, who heads the Tourism Task
Force, an industry lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 50 years, all of our Asian and Pacific neighbors
have thrown off the shackles of colonialism,'' he said. ``The way
things are going, England could kick out the Windsors before
Australia does.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum on Saturday would amend the country's 98-year-old
constitution to remove the British sovereign as head of state in
Australia's parliamentary democracy. In her place, this nation of
19 million people would install a nonexecutive president endorsed
by a two-thirds vote in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Or as a quiz-show hostess, Julie McCrossin, put it, Australia
would finally get what it deserves: ``a full ridgy-didge Aussie
bloke.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing, given the broad electoral opposition, is that
only a minority of the 12.3 million voters are monarchists. But in
a country where politicians are widely mistrusted, surveys show
that a large majority object to letting Parliament choose their
leader. They are holding out for direct, popular elections.
</P>
<P>
   The poisoned campaign slogan is, ``Vote `No' to the politician's
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a century of British sway, the paradox is that it
is not the distant foreign queen who is reviled but the democratic
representatives who have been elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
   A survey four years ago illustrated the point: 91 percent agreed
that ``federal politicians twist the truth to suit their own
arguments'' and 79 percent agreed that ``federal politicians can't
be trusted to keep election promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the tide were flowing the other way, Australia's
Constitution is deliberately difficult to change. Amendments
require a majority vote nationwide as well as individual majorities
in four out of Australia's six territories, giving any three
territories veto power.
</P>
<P>
   The latest surveys show that the ``Yes'' vote is losing in every
state except Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   Given these hurdles, only eight such referendums have succeeded
out of 44 that have been held, and all have been on noncontentious
issues. None have succeeded when they have been opposed, as this
one is, by the prime minister _ in this case, John Howard.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign focusing on Australia's own politicians, the
queen seems already to have been relegated to irrelevance, whatever
the outcome. Her name has hardly been mentioned by either side in
the campaign; she arouses few passions either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hates or disses the queen because nobody cares enough
to do so,'' said Robert Hughes, an art critic who is the author of
a history of Australia called ``The Fatal Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign speech on Wednesday, he said, ``People ask what we
republicans want. I'll say it in a nutshell. We want to enter the
20th century a bit less than two months before it ends. We want
Australia to be done with an obsolete, ornamental, post-colonial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Little by little over the years, Australia has already been
weaning itself from the mother country, no matter what its
constitution says. For 60 years its citizens have not carried
British passports; for 15 years they have not sang Rule Brittania;
for 33 years they have used the Australian dollar rather than the
pounds, shillings and pence of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Once, years ago, former Prime Minsiter Sir Robert Menzies
glimpsed the queen and was moved to rhyme: ``I did but see her
passing by and yet I love her till I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, people talk like Penny Andrews, a public relations
officer. ``I've never been to England; the queen doesn't mean
anything to me,'' she said. Over the years, visits from members of
the royal family _ except of course Princess Diana _ have drawn
smaller and smaller crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's duties in Australia are minimal. Essentially, she is
a rubber-stamp monarch who signs off on the prime minister's
selection of her representative here, the governor general, who
himself has little to do besides cut ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Even her ceremonial duties have withered away. When the Olympic
Games are held here next summer, the government has agreed, in a
change of tradition, that the prime minister will open them, not
the queen.
</P>
<P>
   The strangeness of her role was brought home to many people in
1996 when President Clinton, on a visit here, followed protocol and
raised a toast to ``The Queen of Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were mutterings all around the room,'' said Gerard
Henderson, executive director of the Sydney Institute, a policy
forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain has a British head of state, the United States has an
American head of state but Australia has got a British head of
state,'' he said. ``Now neither Britain nor the United States would
think of having an Australian as head of state.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Australia is far from alone. The queen is head of state
in 16 of the 54 nations that make up the Commonwealth, former Prime
Minister Gough Whitlam pointed out. Five others hold another
monarch as head of state. The other 33 are republics.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of the United States in trade and military
relations since World War II and a half century of non-British
immigration that has thinned the country's British roots have
weakened the ties between the mother country and what was once its
little colony of convict exiles and fortune seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Australia calls itself ``the lucky country'' and people here are
mostly pleased with their lot. They resist the newfangled.
</P>
<P>
   Peter D. Kelly, taking part in an intense debate that has
clogged the pages of newspapers, knows about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown up, we are no longer beholden to Britain,'' he
wrote in a letter to The Sydney Morning Herald. ``But does this
mean in becoming a republic we must forsake her? Do we forsake or
reject our mother when we marry and leave home? And paddle our own
canoe? And become a republic? No!''

MIT SEEKS $1.5B TO REVAMP CURRICULUM, CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Setting its most ambitious development goal yet, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology plans to raise $1.5 billion
to pay for everything from new biotechnology programs and dorms to
better aid packages for graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year campaign, scheduled to be announced Friday, is
also meant to add about $600 million to the school's current
endowment of $4.3 billion, the 8th-largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Charles M. Vest, MIT's president, said the funds will help drive
new research efforts in neurosciences and computer technology,
industries whose growth will lead to changes in higher education as
significant as the creation of major research universities fifty
years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Funding the new programs will present what Vest called ``a
calculated risk'' for the school, that of ``predicting the next
generation of intellectual revolutions, and putting our chips down
early.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT's efforts come as the Cambridge university emerges at the
center of New England's booming high-tech economy, with its
graduates and faculty helping create hundreds of companies involved
in the Internet and the health and materials sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The school's role was highlighted Thursday at a conference
hosted by MIT's alumni magazine, Technology Review, to honor young
scientists and enterpreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the meeting at the University Park Hotel, MIT
chairman Alex d'Arbeloff, described the forthcoming campaign as
``key to the (MIT) community's future'' and said it would help
attract top faculty and students through increased salaries and
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities steal people from each other all the time,''
d'Arbeloff said after his speech. ``As a businessman maybe it
shouldn't surprise me...but we need to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   The planned campaign won't make MIT richer than its rival up
Massachusetts Avenue, Harvard University, which raked in $2.35
billion during its own just-completed fundraising effort and now
boasts an endowment of $14.4 billion. That trails only the
Vatican's wealth among nonprofit institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But MIT's goal is more ambitious in other ways, since with
90,000 alumni it has only about a third as many potential donors
and will have to tap each for $16,667, compared to the $8,800 the
average Crimson graduate coughed up.
</P>
<P>
   Vest noted MIT has also had much success drawing from major
corporations and individuals inspired by MIT's research. ``This is
a stretch goal we have, but we believe it's doable,'' he said.
``We're moving into a much larger magnitude of gifts than MIT has
received in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT's previous formal fundraising campaign ran from 1987 to 1992
and raised about $710 million. The size of MIT's new campaign isn't
unusual for a research institution, said Bruce Flessner, of the
Bentz Whaley Flessner &AMP; Assoc. consulting firm in Minneapolis. But
MIT might have an easier time than some meeting its target, he
said, because ``the kind of wealth created by (MIT's) alumni and
faculty is astronomical.''
</P>
<P>
   By MIT's reckoning its latest campaign has already begun,
including $643 million raised from or pledged by more than 44,000
alumni and institutions since July of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Major gifts so far include $25 million given by Ray Stata,
founder of Analog Devices, and his wife, to be used for the
construction of a new computer-sciences center partly designed by
Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry. The project has also received
$20 million from the foundation of Microsoft chief executive Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Another $20 million was given by a Greek-American couple,
Thanassis and Marina Martinos of Athens, and will be used to fund a
new biomedical imaging center.
</P>
<P>
   MIT has about 10,000 students and 923 full-time faculty; last
year its operating budget was about $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the current campaign, of the $900 million MIT doesn't plan
to allocate to its endowment, it will spend about $300 million to
build six or seven new buildings including a new $40 million dorm
to house about 350 undergraduates planned for a site along Vassar
Street, slated to open in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The new dorm is partly meant to address concerns about a lack of
discipline of the university's 4,500 undergraduates, currently
dispersed through wide swaths of Cambridge and the Back Bay. A
graduate dorm is also envisioned, as is a new building for MIT's
Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $600 million will be spent to support ongoing
operations, although he doesn't expect to increase the school's
faculty significantly. Instead, Vest said he hopes to allocate
about $200 million meant for increased support for the school's
5,500 graduate students, and to build new laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Vest also said the funds would help the school continue to
reduce its reliance on government support. He said he hopes private
companies will increase their sponsorships to pay for about 25
percent of the university's research, up from 20 percent today. The
figure is still four times the rate of private funding received by
research universities nationally.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Male circumcision reduces the risk of
HIV-infection by at least 50 percent and may explain the vast
discrepancies in the prevalence of the AIDS virus from one region
to another across Africa, according to new assessments of nearly 40
individual studies in Africa over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   That should be good news on a continent where more than 2
million people die each year from AIDS. In Africa, the disease is
largely spread by heterosexual contact and tranmission from mother
to child.
</P>
<P>
   But African governments remain skeptical about high-cost
interventions like anti-retroviral drugs. From country to country,
between 20 percent and 80 percent of African men are not
circumcised. The procedure represents one of the most promising,
low-cost ways of reducing the swift rate by which the epidemic is
moving across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   International organizations and health workers have been
reluctant to push the procedure partly out of cultural
sensitivities, though that reticence may be unfounded. While those
ethnic groups that do circumcise males often attach deep
significance to the practice, experts say, the same does not apply
to those that do not circumcise their men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is not 100 percent consistent, but more and more
studies are out, and they show that men who are not circumcised are
at least two times more at risk of infection than men who are
circumcised,'' said Stephen Moses at the University of Manitoba in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistent spread of HIV in Africa has confounded experts
for years. In the early 1990s more than 30 percent of pregnant
women attending prenatal clinics in Uganda were HIV-positive, while
the national infection rate in Senegal has never gone above 3
percent. HIV has moved much more swiftly through South Africa's
Kwa-Zulu/Natal Province than most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of the answer to this riddle may be male
circumcision. Last month, UNAIDS, the joint program of the United
Nations addressing the AIDS epidemic worldwide, released a
comparative study of four cities in Africa. Two cities, Cotonou,
Benin, and Yaounde, Cameroon, had low HIV infection rates of 3
percent and 4 percent, respectively, among men aged 15-49. The
other two sites, Kisumu, Kenya, and Ndola, Zambia, had infection
rates of 20 percent and 23 percent, respectively, for the same
population group.
</P>
<P>
   In Cotonou and Yaounde, nearly all the men in the study reported
being circumcised. Only 10 percent of the men in Ndola and less
than 30 percent of the men in Kisumu, meanwhile, had undergone the
procedure. Furthermore, the study found, ``HIV prevalence was below
8 percent in men circumcised before their sexual debut and 25
percent in uncircumcised men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move carefully, but the time has come to stop
holding meetings,'' said UNAIDS epidemiologist Michel Carael.
``This information should be given to the countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The first study on the increased risk of HIV infection among
uncircumcised men was published a decade ago. Since then, another
37 scientific inquires have been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Among those, according to Robert Bailey, an epidemiologist at
the University of Illinois at Chicago who has just completed a
comparative analysis of existing studies, 27 papers from 8
countries found a significant link between HIV infection and lack
of male circumcision. Five others found a trend toward such a link.
In a separate review of 28 papers, Richard Hayes of the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine observed a consensus
finding that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this mass of evidence, Bailey said, research supporting
an association between HIV infection and male circumcision has been
met with resistance or silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to be first to come out with a statement in
support of male circumcision,'' Bailey said. ``In the US and Europe
there are big anti-circumcision movements now, so people don't want
to promote something in Africa that is discouraged here. But when
you have a 35 percent HIV prevalence rate'' _ as is the case in
parts of southern Africa _ ``you have a very different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The physiology is fairly simple. The foreskin is susceptible to
tearing and bleeding during sexual contact, and also traps fluids
and discharges that are potentially harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty lies in promoting male circumcision as an
intervention against HIV in Africa. Resources and training are
needed to make circumcision safe and more widely available at
clinics. Ways must be found to make the procedure appealing to
cultures that do not practice it.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural obstacle looms largest. But the issue may not be as
sensitive among non-circumcising ethnic groups as might be thought.
In a new study yet to be published, Bailey and his Kenyan
colleagues assessed the feasibility of making circumcision more
widely available to Luos, the predominant ethnic group in Kisumu.
Luos do not circumcise their men, and have traditionally viewed
their status as an identifying characteristic distinguishing
themselves from other Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
   In 32 focus groups divided evenly among women and men, rural and
urban dwellers, the majority of participants in all but one group
favored promoting the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Making male circumcision more widely available through local
clinics raises two immediate concerns. One is cost. The average
price for the procedure with a general practitioner in South Africa
is about $30, according to an assessment by the Progressus Research
and Development Consultancy in Johannesburg. Bailey estimates it is
possible to lower the cost per circumcision to about $4.50. But
even that may be too high for most rural Africans. Health workers
in Namibia recently estimated that most citizens of that country
would not be able to afford HIV testing and counseling if it cost
more than $1.60.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is the risk of creating a perception of false
security. ``If you promote male circumcision as a mechanism to
decrease the risk of HIV, men think they can just go for it _ they
may act as if they have a natural condom,'' Bailey said. ``It
cannot be a stand-alone intervention.''

CLINTON URGES SPORTS FIGURES TO USE WEALTH TO HELP POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ President Clinton kicked off his second anti-poverty
tour here by challenging professional sports teams across America
to ``go beyond making appearances for good causes'' and use some of
their wealth to improve communities bypassed by the nation's
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by New Jersey Nets basketball players and other
leading figures from the sports world, Clinton applauded the good
deeds of many professional athletes and team owners. But he said
more of them need to step forward and give others the opportunities
they have been given.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go beyond making appearances for good causes to change the
cause for everyone in your community,'' Clinton told an assembly of
athletes, students and dignataries gathered in the gymnasium at
Malcolm X Shabazz High School. ``Make investment in your commmunity
second only in your priorities to bringing home the championship
trophy. That way, every single sports team in America can be a true
champion for the children and the future of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   His visit to this economically struggling city was the first
stop of a two-day swing to four cities to spotlight areas that have
not benefited from the roaring economy and to promote his ``New
Markets'' initiative, which seeks to spur $15 billion in new
investment in poor communities through tax credits and loan
guarantees. The initiative also would set up America's Private
Investment Companies to leverage the same type of domestic
investment that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation
generates for emerging markets in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Clinton's first anti-poverty tour three months ago
that took him to Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and a South
Dakota Indian reservation, among other areas, this trip intends to
show how communities and corporations can turn an untapped
potential into sustainable partnerships that help rebuild
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports teams everywhere can make a difference,'' Clinton said.
``They can site their stadiums in urban areas as part of a
comprehensive community economic development plan. They can set up
mentoring partnerships with their suppliers to help small and
minority-owned businesses get in the game of doing business. They
can reach out to young people and lead them on a path to college
and a better life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newark, where the poverty rate stands at 30.5 percent and the
unemployment rate of 9.9 percent is more than twice the national
average, the president lauded local economic progress that has been
spurred by various public and private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out the majority owners of the Nets _ Lewis Katz and
Ray Chambers, who have put 38 percent of their profits into a trust
fund that provides scholarships, mentoring and other educational
programs for youth in New Jersey's largest cities. The owners also
hope to build a new sports arena in downtown Newark _ providing
two-thirds of the financing themselves _ to create jobs in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the team announced Thursday that it would adopt the
Malcolm X Shabazz High School, an effort that will include
providing new band uniforms. Nets star Jayson Williams told the
crowd he would host a party at his home in Clinton, N.J., for the
top 200 students who fulfill the community service requirements of
the Nets educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the team's efforts an example of the sports world
sharing ``the rewards of their popular support with the communities
in which they live. This is an astonishing thing that they have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League,
who joined Clinton on stage, announced that the NFL would provide
$1.5 million in grants to build or restore football fields in 18
cities, while a representative of major league baseball said teams
would participate in a program that seeks minority vendors for
services at ballparks, including food, merchandise, office
supplies, and landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, surveying the stage full of basketball players from the
Nets, said: ``There are a lot of guys this tall that aren't playing
basketball. They got a chance, and they made the most of it. And
that's what we ought to offer every child, and to every adult, and
to every community and every neighborhood in this entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Newark, Clinton flew to Harftord, Conn., where he
toured a thriving indoor marketplace in the distressed downtown
area around Trinty College. The Latino small business corridor now
produces more revenue than the rest of Hartford's neighborhoods
combined. He later met with local merchants to hear how
private-public partnerships have helped them revitalize their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good business as well as good social policy,'' Clinton
told a gathering at the Artist's Collective, a community training
center for the arts in Hartford's North End.

SENATE TO HOLD HEARINGS ON MOSELEY-BRAUN NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.C., Calif., Okla.)  (th) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once during a committee meeting, Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected to the Senate, leaned
toward a colleague and whispered, ``I am stunned about how often
and how much race comes up in conversation and debate in this
general assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, with an Illinois re-election defeat behind her,
Moseley-Braun will return to a Senate committee room Friday, this
time as a private citizen and potential ambassador to New Zealand,
to find that little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one theme zig-zagging through the course of her
nomination, it is race, beginning with her 1993 public dressing
down of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the much feared chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, over the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the issue of race is likely to surface again, as she
sits down to face the Foreign Relations Committee (but not Helms,
who will be attending to other business) for her confirmation
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a series of documents that Helms requested from the White
House regarding the alleged financial irregularities that have
dogged Moseley-Braun for years and contributed to her election loss
last year, is a memorandum from an Internal Revenue Service agent
that is tinged with ``racial bias,'' said a Democrat staff aide
familiar with the documents.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo to the Justice Department, the Chicago agent, who
sought to persuade the department to prosecute the case, used the
term ``they,'' referring to African-Americans, in a derogatory
fashion, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is potential material in there that, while it doesn't
speak to the substance, does speak to the state of mind of the IRS
investigator in Chicago who was writing to Justice,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, overall, are not expected to have a negative
effect on the nomination. But the sentence is likely to give the
former senator's supporters on the Hill fodder to portray the
investigation as a personal vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, Moseley-Braun's supporters, most of them House
members who were outraged by Helms' decision to delay the hearing
until the documents were received, have said, ``if she were a white
male former senator, I don't think there would be a problem getting
her confirmed before the Senate recess,'' as Delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton, a Democrat, put it. Such blunt criticisms have made
Senate Republicans both cringe and roll their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The House members wondered aloud, at least once under the camera
lights right in front of Helms' office, why the courtesies that
senators often extend to each other in similar situations did not
extend to her.
</P>
<P>
   It is a thought that also crossed her mind, said Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, a California Democrat who sits on the foreign relations
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a tradition of conviviality when it came
to former senators who are up for appointments,'' said Feinstein, a
friend of Moseley-Braun's. ``I have had an opportunity to express
my thoughts to the chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein added that most senators would vote for confirmation
without hesitation. ``I think she would be overwhelmingly approved
by the Senate,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans, though, are loath to view her
confirmation to the New Zealand post, a perk for presidential
friends, as the cake-walk Democrats are hoping for because of her
senatorial ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very serious ethical charges that have been
made,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, the majority whip from Oklahoma.
``Personal use of campaign funds for a lot of dollars. That happens
to be illegal. Questions need to be asked. People can go to jail
for some of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing whatsoever to do with race,'' Nickles added.
``Anybody who has implied that, that's offensive to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, 52, has spent the good part of her career, and
the last few years, fending off accusations and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports last year disclosed that the IRS twice asked
the Justice Department in 1995 to open a grand jury inquiry into
whether the senator and her then fiance, Kgosie Matthews, had used
more than $200,000 from the 1992 campaign to buy personal luxury
items without reporting the income and paying taxes on it. The
Justice Department refused each time, citing a lack of credible
information.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Election Commission audit in 1996 found sloppy
accounting practices in Moseley-Braun's campaign organization, but
the commission levied no fines. The case was dropped in 1997, with
the commission saying it did not have the time or resources to
finish the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   And she came under fire, even from black leaders and members of
her own party, for a series of get-togethers in 1996 with Gen. Sani
Abacha, the former Nigerian dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be remembered that Carol was the first and only
African-American senator and woman in the United States Senate,''
Feinstein said. ``There were a lot of pressures upon her. I don't
know the details of the allegations, but she has been defeated in
her quest for re-election. That is somewhat of a sanction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her friends say Moseley-Braun, who has been lecturing and doing
consulting work for the Department of Education, is really looking
forward to the pastoral tranquillity in Wellington, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   But first she must clear the Senate, and more imposingly, Helms,
who even in absentia can exert his power as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It has become common knowledge that, just after the 1993
contretemps over Helms' measure to renew a patent for an emblem
that included the Stars and Bars, the first national flag of the
Confederacy, the two found themselves in an elevator together.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun had just risen to give an emotional speech about
slavery and the demeaning symbolism of the flag. And Helms had
warned on the floor, ``I hope the senator from Illinois has not
embarked upon an inflammatory political gambit.'' This, he said,
``is bound to create bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the elevator, Helms began whistling Dixie. ``I'm going
to sing Dixie until she cries,'' Helms was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Helms,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of
congressional relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research group, ``carefully guards his prerogatives.''

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ A three-month-old cease-fire in Congo has
grown increasingly fragile in recent days, possibly threatening the
agreement to end a war that has drawn in half a dozen African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main rebel groups that has sought to topple the
government of President Laurent Kabila accused him Thursday of
violating the cease-fire by sending airplanes to bomb a town in
northwestern Congo, a few days after doing the same in another town
in the region. At the same time, the other main rebel movement said
it had interpreted recent statements by Kabila's government as a
declaration of war.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing claims, made by Jean-Pierre Bemba, the leader of the
Uganda-backed Movement for the Liberation of the Congo, could not
be independently verified. But they came after
government-controlled television in the capital declared Monday
that Kabila's army had been rebuilt and was now ``prepared'' to
fulfill its ``mission to liberate'' the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not begin the next century under rebel occupation,''
Abdoulaye Yerodia, Kabila's foreign minister, said at a news
conference a day later. Newspapers in the capital, Kinshasa,
interpreted his words as ``a resumption of war,'' as one
publication put it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it was ``deeply
concerned by reports of military preparations, including the
movement of troops and materiel by forces on both sides.'' On
Thursday, another main rebel organization, the Rwanda-backed
Congolese Rally for Democracy, said Yerodia's comments amounted to
``a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The various sides in Congo's 15-month-old conflict have
repeatedly accused one another of violating the cease-fire since it
was signed in August. Few accusations can be verified, chiefly
because of the absence of independent observers throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace plan, an international peacekeeping force would
eventually be sent to Congo, a nation the size of the United States
east of the Mississippi that is currently occupied by troops from
five foreign countries, two main rebel organizations and countless
militias.
</P>
<P>
   But a small U.N. survey team that arrived in Kinshasa in
mid-October, as a precursor to a larger group of observers and a
peacekeeping force, has been unable to travel outside the capital.
The Kabila government said it would not allow the U.N. team to
visit some key cities, including the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi.
What is more, the U.N. officials are dissatisfied with guarantees
on safety and travel that they have received from the Kabila
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities and the population regard the potential
deployment of U.N. troops with great suspicion,'' said an official
with an international aid group in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   The Congo government believes that the United Nations, led by
the United States, sides with the rebellion, the official said.
Uganda and Rwanda, the main rebel sponsors, are considered to be
close allies of Washington in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When the current war erupted in August 1998, Rwanda and Uganda
at first denied that they were supporting the movement against
Kabila. A year earlier, the countries had plucked Kabila out of
obscurity to launch a successful rebellion that ended the 31-year
reign of Mobutu Sese Seko. But Kabila's close ties with his
sponsors made him unpopular at home, and he eventually severed them
for his own political survival.
</P>
<P>
   Three neighboring countries with their own specific interests in
the Congo _ Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia _ rescued Kabila from
certain defeat last year and have been supporting his government.

RAIDERS QB LOOKS TO KEEP EVERY RECEIVER HAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Wonder what NFL teams do during bye weeks?
Wonder no more. At Raiders headquarters Wednesday, quarterback Rich
Gannon used the down time to pull aside wide receiver James Jett so
the two could try and solve the Mystery of Why Tim Brown Gets All
the Catches.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't studied your Raiders stat sheet before going to
bed every night, know this: Brown has 53 catches to lead the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Jett is second on the Raiders with 19 catches. That's a
disparity of large proportions, and it might not be good for the
Raiders as they look forward to a second half full of Brown being
covered by, like, 11 defenders on every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to James Jett (Wednesday) about what we can do to get
him more involved and to get him more catches,'' Gannon said.
``Because he's a dangerous weapon that we need to get more involved
... we have to be more aware of the fact that other defenses are
going to come in here and start to try and do some things that take
(Brown) out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only Jett who starves while Brown feasts. Third
receiver Terry Mickens has just 10 catches in eight games and tight
end Ricky Dudley has just 13 catches. Remember, coach Jon Gruden
has installed a 49ers-style offense, meaning tight ends and third
receivers on balance do better than an average of just over one
catch per game.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a case of Brown being the only reliable pair of
hands on the team, or Gannon's relying on Brown too much, or
Brown's being one of the only receivers who understands how to
break off a route when Gannon scrambles _ all plausible theories _
the Raiders said they want to use the bye week to address the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gruden said he is giving practice work this week to
heretofore unused receiver Horace Copeland, who has a chance to
impress the coaching staff and shake up the receiving rotation.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's always the Charles Woodson issue, a
four-star topic around the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easier said then done,'' Gruden said, though Woodson
practiced at receiver on Wednesday. ``To get a guy programmed to
handle all the audibles, all the situations, and realistically work
on all the routes and adjustments, it's a process we think he can
handle in time. We will have the ability at some point to use him
if we feel it's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another answer would be to have receivers other than Brown work
better with Gannon's scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   When Gannon breaks out of his programmed receiver progression
and leaves the pocket _ which is often for the mobile quarterback _
the Raiders have shown an inability to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvisations have hurt the team: when Gannon threw a
slant pass intended for Mickens on Sunday, Mickens had broken off
the route because Gannon hadn't thrown it early, as he usually
does. The attempted improv resulted in an interception, and set up
a touchdown for Miami, the game's only paydirt.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Brown's 53 catches have come when he creates a route
after a Gannon scramble. It's a natural quality, something that
makes Brown a seven-time Pro Bowler and the leading receiver in the
NFL right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like our offense is directed at Tim Brown, or that I
like Tim more than other guys, it's that he really has a knack for
being tenacious and getting open,'' Gannon said. ``He catches a lot
of balls as a result of moving after the original play has broken
down. He's very good at understanding angles and coming back to the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Solutions? Gannon says he needs to practice the so-called
``scramble drill'' more with receivers other than Brown, Gruden
says the team needs to ``distribute the ball more evenly'' and
Mickens says, well, they've just got to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to step it up, the rest of the guys on the team,''
Mickens said. ``I have to be honest with you, the receivers have
to, got to, pick it up. Don't get me wrong, it's good (that Brown
has 53 catches), because he's the leader and he's the guy who can
make things happen, but everybody else has to rally around.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's the other theory: Brown is so damn good, why
not let him catch as many balls as possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why everybody's complaining,'' Gruden said,
pointing out his offense has made more first downs than any in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have a perfect world where everybody catches it
64 times ... but Tim Brown is hot right now. And I feel good about
going home after the ballgame knowing that he had every chance to
impact our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, he's been able to do that at an extremely high
level.''

 &HT;    Bears in the air: Pandas en route to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ High above the Pacific Ocean, two special passengers
from China are making their way to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two giant-panda cubs left Beijing at 5:23 p.m. EST Thursday, on
a specially equipped United Parcel Service jet for a 17-hour flight
to Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang, accompanied by a Zoo Atlanta
veterinarian, a Chinese vet and a Chinese panda keeper, were
scheduled to arrive at Hartsfield International Airport at 9:30
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pandas are doing extremely well,'' the Zoo Atlanta vet,
Rita McManamon, reported from Beijing. ``They've both been eating,
and they're doing just great. They look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The UPS B767-300 cargo plane was to stop at Anchorage, Alaska,
for refueling and a crew change. The final leg to Atlanta was to be
flown by longtime UPS pilot Bob Peterson, a retired Air Force
colonel who spent years based in Washington, ferrying officials
such as Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Henry Kissinger and the late
Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said before he left for Anchorage that he was anxious
to catch a glimpse of the rare bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our top priority is transporting them smoothly and
comfortably,'' he said. ``We're real excited to be a part of
transporting these magnificent animals.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS has painted a logo, ``The Panda Express,'' on the plane, and
on the brown UPS trucks that will carry the pandas from the airport
to the zoo. So will the uniforms of UPS employees who'll handle the
cages.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the pandas arrive, they will be tired, confused and
suffering from jet lag. So the 200 reporters and photographers
expected to be on hand won't be allowed near the young bears, said
UPS spokesman Dan McMackin.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the 300 guests, who will include Wu Zurong, China's
Houston-based consul general, whose territory includes Georgia, and
three other senior members of the Houston consulate. But they'll be
entertained for an hour before the plane's scheduled Hartsfield
touchdown. Schoolchildren from Atlanta's Asian community will
entertain the crowd with Asian string music. They'll also perform
what Zoo Atlanta described as a ``traditional panda dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Speeches are planned, as well as a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   A small army of security guards will try to prevent anyone from
sneaking a peek of the plane's precious cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police will be all over the place because of the international
significance of this event,'' McMackin said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta Director Terry Maple said the bears are so
emotionally sensitive that he can't take a chance on letting anyone
see them, other than the few UPS employees involved.
</P>
<P>
   Maple said even he probably won't see the pandas until after the
UPS trucks spirit them to the zoo, where they'll immediately be
placed in quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   Maple, who's worked for years to bring the pandas to Atlanta,
will be at the hangar early with his family, wife Addie and
daughters Molly, 19; Emily, 17; and Sara, 13, and many zoo
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Until Nov. 20, the day the zoo expects to open the panda exhibit
to the public, the cubs will be watched by zoo scientists. Then the
floodgates will open to panda lovers, who're expected to converge
on Zoo Atlanta from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   A few people may get an early look. Parties for zoo donors are
planned Nov. 15 and 16, and reporters will visit Nov. 18. Even
then, if the pandas are being shy, the guests and reporters will
see them only on closed-circuit TV monitors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEDYARD, Conn. _ Vinny Pazienza is 8 years older than Dana
Rosenblatt and a past participant in far more wars, fistic and
otherwise. He is nearing the end of a distinguished career in
boxing while Rosenblatt should be in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the two square off for the second time Friday night at
Foxwoods, Pazienza will hold a significant advantage because
Pazienza is fighting only one man in the Bingo Hall. Dana
Rosenblatt is fighting two.
</P>
<P>
   In their first confrontation three years ago in Atlantic City,
Rosenblatt easily won the first three rounds, knocking Pazienza
down once, bloodying his nose and beginning to close his eye with a
persistent right jab.
</P>
<P>
   To the untutored eye it did not look good for Pazienza at that
moment but he remained true to what he has always been in the ring
and in life. He remained persistent, resilient, and aggressive, and
soon enough he did what he had come to do.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked Rosenblatt out.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time world champion did it with one looping right to the
side of the face in the fourth round, landing a punch that
introduced a then cocky kid to boxing's dark room. It is an
introduction that is not easy to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this fight comes down to the mental,'' says Teddy
Atlas, the veteran fight trainer who will be a ringside commentator
on ESPN2's broadcast of the 12-round rematch. ``In Rosenblatt you
have a kid who wasn't ever great but who was fairly accomplished at
one level. He was never as good as his record before he got knocked
out and never as bad as they said he was after.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fairly good technically, but before the Pazienza fight
he was confident and that allowed him to beat guys. Then he goes in
and he's fighting the right fight against Vinny. He's pot-shoting
him when he rushed in and stopping him with his jab and all of a
sudden he gets caught with one of those looping punches, many of
which missed before, and he's out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that night the confidence left him like air from a
punctured balloon. We've done two or three of his fights since and
two or three of Pazienza's and I don't think Dana ever got it all
back. He's a kid who never fully regained that confidence he once
had in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately I've seen him struggle with guys he wouldn't have had a
problem with before. Mentally I don't think he ever got it back.
Since that loss people have taken the easy way with Rosenblatt and
said he was never that good (as his then- unblemished record would
indicate). That's not fair to say. He was what he was but now he's
missing one thing. Confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he fights now, it's like he's waiting for something bad
to happen. He's thinking, `When will the roof cave in on me?'
That's a problem when he gets in there with the guy who took it all
away from him. It's going to be difficult for him not to go in
there (Friday night) with a fatalistic attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a different situation than Pazienza. Pazienza has his
confidence back. The first fight he was coming off a devastating
knockout (from Roy Jones, who dropped Pazienza six times) himself
and he hadn't fought in 14 months. He was the one who didn't know.
Now Rosenblatt has to deal with two enemies. Pazienza and a memory.
A haunting memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny knows that and he's exploited it. He says things to get
deeper into the mind of Rosenblatt. He knows he's in with a kid
with shaky confidence, a kid who's different from what he was
before they fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny knows the psychological part of the game as well as
anybody. He's dealt with it himself better than most guys. So the
biggest problem for Rosenblatt (Friday night) isn't Pazienza. It's
a memory.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a memory Pazienza (47-7, 29 KO) has worked feverishly to
rekindle. He has taunted and targeted Rosenblatt at every turn,
once calling him on a friend's cell phone when the friend spotted
Rosenblatt at a local bank and telling him to make all the deposits
he could now because his last one was coming Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   At a prefight press conference he threatened Rosenblatt,
castigated him for being disrespectful and condescending and
promising he would end both his misery and his career this time.
</P>
<P>
   He told an ESPN interviewer two weeks before the fight that he
would ``rather die than lose to that kid,'' and he told a friend
that Wednesday that if he loses ``hire a hit man and shoot me.''
Few people who know him doubt his sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Pazienza is a master showman who knows how to sell tickets but
he also is a Rhode Island kid who knows how to get a powerful hate
on when necessary and that is the case with Rosenblatt, a young
fighter Pazienza truly dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's scared of me and he should be,'' Pazienza growled this
week from his home. ``He has to be hoping it won't happen again and
that has to wear on him a lot. If he thinks he can peck away at me
again with that jab he's delusional.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's so much smarter than everyone else because he's
got some community college degree so I looked up a word for him in
the dictionary. He thinks I'm a clown. Well, I think he's
delusional. Before the first fight he told millions of people on TV
that ``haphazardly he'll run into something.'' He's delusional.
That's my big word for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a guy who looks in the mirror and sees something
that isn't there. He said after the last fight he was beating me
from pillar to post. But he couldn't say that crap until they woke
him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's back because his friends talked him into it but
there's a big difference between us. He's in this for redemption.
I'm in it for hatred. He's in this for money. I'm in it for blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident the first fight. I'm more confident this
fight. He can't hurt me. He ain't so confident now because he knows
one thing. He knows I can hurt him . . . because I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he did, knocking Rosenblatt senseless with one punch
and then delivering a piledriving flurry after his opponent was out
on his feet, his hands having fallen to his side and his head
slumped to his shoulder in semi-consciousness. He was trapped in
the corner and helpless but Pazienza was without mercy, drilling
him even after referee Tony Orlando stopped the fight.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sudden, savage destruction you don't easily erase from
your mind. Like seeing your house suddenly destroyed by a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt (35-1, 23 KOs) has won a half-dozen fights since
then, beating two-time world champion Terry Norris and one-time
contender Glenwood Brown along the way. He has survived two broken
hands and an odd battle with dehydration that caused him to
mysteriously fade badly at the end of several fights after the
Pazienza defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he will tell you this night is not personal. It is not what
Pazienza wants it to be. It is a business meeting at Foxwoods to
Rosenblatt, not Fright Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first fight, due to my inexperience, he was able to land a
punch,'' Rosenblatt said. ``I got caught up in things and got
impatient. Anyone who watches the first three rounds, the only
thing you can take from that is I was dominate unless you're seeing
it through Vinny's visors. I'm a smarter fighter now. Pazienza is
very emotional. That's helped him, so he plays on it. With myself,
it's more of a scientific approach. I do best when I'm calm and
collected.''
</P>
<P>
   But can he stay that way once the long walk begins from his
locker room to face a man and a memory? Perhaps so. Many fighters
have made that walk and come back victors. But, as Teddy Atlas
knows, many others have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he was punching holes in Vinny the first fight and
he'll do it again, but he was punching with a confident demeanor
then,'' Atlas said. ``He may not be able to do that this time.
Pazienza got an infusion of confidence from that fight and
Rosenblatt got the opposite. Vinny knows he can knock this guy out.
Whether he does or not, he knows he can. That's a tremendous asset.
And the other guy knows what happened, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy knows no matter how far ahead he was it wasn't
enough. I'm sure his people are reminding him of the first three
rounds and what he did but he has to be thinking, `Yeah, but no
matter what I did he knocked me out. So now what?' He's lying to
himself if he says it isn't on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the whole fight could be determined by the first time Dana
finds himself in the same situation that got him in trouble _
standing up straight and right in front of Pazienza. What does he
do then?''
</P>
<P>
   Learning the answer is why people watch, but Atlas's highly
trained eye has reminded him of two other fighters who faced
similar circumstances in matches he broadcast recently. One was an
old warhorse named Davey Hilton, a former world champion like
Pazienza who was being poleaxed by a young kid named Stephane
Ouellet almost a year ago in a fight for the Canadian middleweight
title. Although Ouellet was well in control, Atlas told viewers
Hilton was wearing Ouellet down and he might put him down soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the final round he did, knocking Ouellet cold in a remarkable
comeback from certain defeat. When they fought again a few months
later, Atlas was at ringside again, believing the rematch would not
be as stirring as the first, even though Ouellet was saying all the
right things about redemption and business and having been well
ahead and gotten careless.
</P>
<P>
   The second fight was over in a blink of an eye; Hilton needed
only a few rounds to knock Ouellet cold. When Teddy Atlas looked at
Pazienza-Rosenblatt, that's what came to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ouellet couldn't box much better the second fight and Hilton
went right through him,'' Atlas said. ``Hilton had broken him down.
The kid wasn't the same. He was a nice kid, like Dana. But this is
a business that destroys nice kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night we'll all learn if it has again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several years, New Yorkers have talked about
crime like veterans recalling a vanquished enemy from an old war.
</P>
<P>
   But in criminal justice circles and some neighborhoods this
year, the conversations have become less leisurely as the city
confronts a 9 percent rise in homicides, the first increase in any
major crime category in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the murder rate remains a shadow of its former self and
overall crime remains down, the death toll on two recent weekends _
when five and six people were slain in short stretches _ rekindled
memories of a grim era, not so long ago, when the murder count
crested above 2,000 and Central Park was a late-night punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 31 of this year, only 569 homicides have been
recorded, but the puzzling rebound in the murder rate, even as
every other category of violent crime continues to decline, has
spawned speculation into its causes, debates over its significance
and occasional requests for a heightened police presence.
</P>
<P>
   In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the neighborhood with the most
murders, a local legislator is trying to secure additional foot
patrols.
</P>
<P>
   At a crime seminar in Manhattan last month, a deputy police
commissioner blamed the news media for the murder increase,
suggesting that negative coverage had demoralized the police force.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, a special task force set up by the district
attorney to look into the homicide problem meets weekly to pore
over killings and track patterns.
</P>
<P>
   And among criminologists, the debate grows over whether this odd
increase in murders is a bellwether or simply a statistical curio,
the crime-fighting equivalent of a bearish stretch in a bull
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experts are discussing it, no doubt about it,'' said
Thomas A. Reppetto, the president of the Citizens Crime Commission,
a private organization, ``but most people think it is a temporary
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The theories advanced to explain the increase abound: A rash of
murders by spouses. A rise in gang activity. A decline in police
aggressiveness after the withering criticism precipitated by the
police shooting of Amadou Diallo. But the evidence indicates that
each argument is flawed or falls short of a full explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes happen from year to year, and no one can explain
year-to-year changes,'' said James Q. Wilson, a retired professor
at the University of California at Los Angeles who has written
extensively on crime and public policy. ``You will find experts
claiming to know the reason, but in reality, no one knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic nature of the increase is most apparent in the
Bronx, where there would appear to be strong pressures for a higher
murder rate. Nowhere was the criticism spawned by the Diallo
incident felt more acutely than in that borough, where four
officers stand criminally charged with murdering an unarmed man.
Nowhere have gun arrests fallen more precipitously, leading to
speculation that more weapons are on the street. Indeed, shootings
are up 6 percent in the borough.
</P>
<P>
   But, for some reason, the Bronx is the only borough where the
homicide rate is down this year, and by a steep 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, in Queens the murder rate has increased by 15
percent. In the southern half of the borough, shooting incidents
are on the rise and murders are up 40 percent. In the northern
half, shooting incidents are also on the rise, but murder has
declined a confounding 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really figure out why Queens South is up and Queens
North is down,'' said John M. Ryan, the borough's chief assistant
district attorney. ``We don't have an answer, but we are trying to
figure it out by going through them, one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   To Police Commissioner Howard Safir, the rise in murders is a
mild fluctuation that should not obscure the fact that New York
remains one of the safest cities in America. Even with the
additional 50 homicides so far this year, he said in an interview,
the murder rate is still down 65 percent from six years ago, and
overall crime is down 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, assaults are down 10 percent, rapes are down 17
percent and the number of shootings is just as low as last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why more people who got shot died, I can't tell you,'' Safir
said. ``Or why more people who got stabbed died, I can't tell you.
But the violence is at the lowest level, and continuing to go down,
of any time in 37 years.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the real threat to the sense of safety is the
penchant of news organizations for seizing upon any rise in the
murder rate to suggest that crime is about to run rampant again.
``People know this is a safe place,'' Safir said. ``The only people
who are tying to give the impression that it is not are you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Safir said the Police Department had made a few
adjustments, including requiring narcotics units to work more
weekends because murders are often drug-related. ``But this is all
a continuation of what I believe are effective tactics we have been
using right along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a high level of public interest in the
murder rate, even though the odds of being slain in New York, even
in the ``bad old days,'' were infinitesimal. For many people, some
of whom have only the haziest notion of what grand larceny is, the
murder rate serves as the barometer of personal safety. The level
of concern can vary widely by neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   On the Upper East Side of Manhattan, for example, where there
have been only two murders this year, the 60 percent decline in the
homicide rate has gone largely unnoticed. But feelings are
different in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where 27 people have died this
year as the homicide rate has grown by 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am meeting in the next 10 days or so with the precinct
commanders'' said Annette M. Robinson, the city councilwoman who
represents the neighborhood, ``to see if we can get more foot
patrols that might have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney's office was alarmed enough by
the 15 percent increase in murders in the borough to create a
special task force several months ago to study its homicide
problem. ``The importance of it is to continue the process of
identifying the causes to see if we can put a lid on it,'' said
District Attorney Charles Hynes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, the Police Department is being victimized
by its own success. The plummeting crime rate raised expectations
and created statistical lows that will serve to highlight any
future increases. For example, in 1990, when there were a record
2,245 murders, an additional 50 homicides, as is the case this
year, would barely have registered as an increase. By comparison,
the city is on pace to reach 686 murders this year, Safir said.

TENNESSEE EXECUTIVE NAMED STRIDE RITE CHAIRMAN, CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four months after its previous top executive abruptly resigned,
Stride Rite Corp. has hired a turnaround specialist to re-energize
the Lexington, Mass.footwear company.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Chamberlain, 56, will take over as Stride Rite's
chairman and chief executive on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting opportunity,'' Chamberlain said. ``This is
a wonderful company with a wonderful history.''
</P>
<P>
   In his previous job at Genesco Co., a Tennessee-based footwear
maker and retailer, Chamberlain was credited with restoring an
ailing company to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to reinvigorate sleepy brands,'' said Steven
Marotta, a Wasserstein Perella Securities analyst who follows both
Stride Rite and Genesco. ``David Chamberlain orchestrated a
turnaround at Genesco that was nothing short of remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Though profitable, Stride Rite could benefit from such skills.
In recent months, a company with a portfolio of such brands as
Keds, Sperry Top-Sider, and a namesake line of children's shoes has
endured an uneasy period of soft sales and a restructuring that cut
costs and shed 125 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Stride Rite's previous chief executive, James A.
Eskridge, resigned after less than a year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge left in an apparent dispute with the Stride Rite board
of directors over the future direction of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stride Rite will be led by Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a positive addition,'' said Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull
analyst Steven A. Richter, who added, ``The key for Stride Rite is
to regain growth in the context of a tough footwear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite has had some up-and-down years. In 1998, the company
earned $21.05 million on sales of $539.4 million, only slightly
more than its 1994 sales of $523.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under Eskridge, it was believed Stride Rite would expand through
aggressive acquisitions and organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about acquisitions, Chamberlain replied: ``That's
certainly something we're going to consider because we have a
strong balance sheet. But it's only one piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain noted similarities between Stride Rite and Genesco.
Both make shoes under their own brand names and under licensing
agreements with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite, for instance, makes shoes under the Tommy Hilfiger
name, and Genesco under the Nautica and Dockers names.
</P>
<P>
   Both also sell shoes through retail outlets, though Genesco,
with its Journeys chain, is far more of a retailer than Stride
Rite, Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are about the same size _ Genesco's revenues last
year were just under $550 million.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston &AMP; Murphy, one Genesco brand, was known ``as your
father's dress shoes,'' Chamberlain said. ``We repositioned it by
giving it a more contemporary look, and Johnston &AMP; Murphy had a
great resurgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Keds, which is often a slave to fashion cycles, could use a
resurgence. After a strong performance in 1998, its sales slumped
in Stride Rite's most recent quarter. Overall Stride Rite sales
dipped 7.5 percent for the quarter ended Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of opportunity here,'' Chamberlain said in
appraising Stride Rite's outlook.
</P>
<P>
   After Eskridge's surprise resignation, board member Myles J.
Slosberg came out of retirement to take over as Stride Rite's
interim chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our board believes that the combination of David (Chamberlain)
and Diane Sullivan, our recently appointed president and chief
operating officer, will form an effective team to lead Stride Rite
in fiscal 2000 and beyond,'' said Slosberg in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Slosberg led the search for a permanent chairman and chief
executive along with fellow director Joanna M. Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain served as president, chief executive, and chairman
of Genesco from 1994 to 1996. He held the title of chairman until
Thursday, Stride Rite said.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's resume includes stints at Shaklee Corp. and Quaker
Oats Co., and Nabisco Brands Inc. He has an MBA from Harvard
Business School.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Stride Rite rose 3/4
to close at 7 5/8.

 NEW YORK: this year.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But from one politician's perspective, it is not a great year
for any increase in crime, however minor. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
seems ready to embark on a United States Senate campaign in which
his success in crime reduction is likely to be promoted as a signal
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``An increase plays against the mayor in two ways,'' said
Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New
York University. ``First, it makes it hard to run ads about crime
if it is going up. Secondly, there will be people who will say,
`How can we afford to let him go to Washington with the crime rate
going up?'''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Deputy Commissioner Edward T. Norris, who oversees
the city's crime-fighting strategies, suggested that news
organizations played a role in the murder increase because, he
said, their criticism of officers after the Diallo shooting had
produced a less aggressive police force, one less willing to make
bold efforts to seize illegal guns. Gun arrests citywide are down
16 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Safir said he agreed that productivity declined for a
time, he said morale had since improved. Certainly, the situation
in the Bronx, where shootings are up but not murders, would seem to
indicate that a greater prevalence of guns did not completely
explain the rise in slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The police have also pointed to increased gang activity as a
partial cause. The number of gang-related homicides this year has
risen from 42 to 87, according to police statistics. But Safir said
much of the increase reflected an improvement in identifying
gang-related murders, because of enhanced intelligence efforts, not
a dramatic growth in gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory offered has been a rise in domestic disputes that
ended in death. Officials in both Brooklyn and Queens report large
increases in that type of crime. But citywide, the number of
domestic violence murders is the same as last year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the boroughs with the largest increases in murder are
Manhattan, where there has been a 28 percent increase, and Staten
Island, where murders have risen 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The largest increase in murders in terms of raw numbers has been
in Brooklyn, where killings have risen to 229 from 198 last year.
Brooklyn is now the site of 40 percent of all murders in the city
and has five of the 10 precincts with the highest homicide totals.
But it was clear from a meeting last week of the district
attorney's homicide task force, where the debate over causes of the
murder increase went unresolved, that investigators have yet to
arrive at an overarching explanation for the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The task force has arrived, however, at some preliminary
conclusions. Guns, it found, were involved in 63 percent of all
homicides in the borough. Half of those arrested for murder had no
prior record, and 55 percent were men younger than 21.
</P>
<P>
   New York City succeeded in reducing murder, said Alfred
Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon
University, by targeting young men who were involved in drug sales
and carried guns as a tool of the trade. But as drug sales waned
and moved indoors, Blumstein said, it has become harder for the
police to match those sharp declines.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, he predicted, there will be a core set of murders
that will be difficult to combat simply with street patrols.
``There is not a lot they can do about private disputes that
escalate into homicides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the police deserved the bulk of the credit for the
previous drops in crime and would accept the blame if crime went
up. But he said, ``When you measure not succeeding, you ought to
measure it against the standard of what failure is _ like 2,200
homicides _ and not a difference between 686 and 633.''

EDUCATION BOARD APPROVES PHONICS REVISION IN FIRST-GRADE TEXTBOOKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The State Board of Education gave tentative
approval Thursday to a last-minute revision in first-grade reading
textbooks, ordering publishers to place heavier emphasis on phonics
in books destined for classrooms next school year.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-3 vote came after more than 3 1/2 hours of debate in
which one board member _ who voted against the change _ essentially
invited publishers to sue the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``To require publishers to make these changes this late in the
game is really like holding a gun to their head,'' said Joe Bill
Watkins, an Austin attorney who represents the Association of
American Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers who refuse to make the changes would find their
textbooks placed on the list of ``non-conforming'' books, and
``that's like the kiss of death,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a change order in November,'' Watkins said. ``I don't
think that's right, and I don't think that's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   He said publishers already have invested millions of dollars in
developing the textbooks, using the 51 percent guideline that the
Texas Education Agency staff defined for publishers two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirement means publishers will have to raise the
percentage of ``decodable'' words in the books from 51 percent to
80 percent. Decodable words are those easy enough for pupils to
read by sounding out a letter or combinations of letters.
</P>
<P>
   The rules change affects five publishers whose books conformed
to all state specifications under the 51 percent rule. They will
have to develop additional story books that contain enough
decodable words to bring all their first-grade books to an average
80 percent decodability. Education Commissioner James Nelson is to
report to the board in January on whether the publishers have
complied with the 80 percent rule.
</P>
<P>
   The board-ordered revisions also could spark a court fight
between the board and publishers, who contend the change amounts to
a breach of contract. If that happens, education officials said,
Gov. George W. Bush's much-touted reading initiative would be
damaged and the state would not have new texts in classrooms by the
start of school in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards declined to comment on the
fairness of the board's 11th-hour changes, but she said the
governor ``is pleased that the outcome is that we're going to have
phonics-based books that are much higher quality than what we have
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Will Davis, D-Austin, told the board it was acting
``like a blind mule in a China shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the board's action violates state law prohibiting the
board from meddling in textbook content just because individuals
disagree with the content and sets a dangerous precedent for future
last-minute revisions in textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a contract with the state and they are entitled to
enforce it. ... You are imposing an arbitrary standard that you are
deciding at the very last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the publishers had the courage they could go into court and
get an injunction and stop the process,'' Davis added.
</P>
<P>
   He said after the meeting that he doubts any publisher has that
courage, but said his comments amounted to an invitation to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Education has a history of battling over
textbooks, but most of the battles in recent years have been over
issues like sex education, creation vs. evolution and historical
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   But this battle turns on one word _ ``most'' _ in one
parenthetical passage in a 45-page document, Texas Essential
Knowledge and Skills, that details 111 academic lessons
first-graders must learn in reading. That passage states that
students must be able to ``use letter-sound knowledge to read
decodable texts (engaging and coherent texts in which most of the
words are comprised of an accumulating sequence of letter-sound
correspondences being taught).''
</P>
<P>
   But last month, when member Geraldine Miller, R-Dallas, learned
that publishers had used TEA interpretation to define ``most'' as
51 percent, she garnered the support from fellow board members to
force the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never came into this wanting to kick out or eliminate any
publishers,'' said Miller, a 15-year veteran of the board and a
long-time proponent of phonics-based reading programs. ``We came
into this wanting the very best books for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the opponents said they are not opposed to phonics but
object to last-minute changes that were unfair to publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discussion in not about whether the board supports
phonics,'' said member Grace Shore, R-Longview. ``Every one on this
board supports phonics.
</P>
<P>
   She said the real issue was mistakes made by the board when it
did not specify in the TEKS what it meant by ``most'' and mistakes
by TEA staff when it interpreted the TEKS without seeking
clarification from the board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Davis and Shore, Democrat Rene Nunez of El Paso
also voted against the revisions. Democrat Alma Allen of Houston
was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the board discussion, though, amounted to dueling
experts, with those in favor of the changes quoting from books and
academic papers about the need for strong phonics. Opponents cited
experts who cautioned the board against trying to establish a
specific percentage of decodable words and noted there are several
different ways to analyze books for decodability.
</P>
<P>
   The board is scheduled to take a final vote on the matter
Friday. It remained unclear late Thursday whether publishers would
have to eat the additional costs of making the revisions or whether
they could charge the state more. Publishers have estimated it will
cost each of them between $1 million and $5 million to make the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably not an unreasonable interpretation'' that
publishers will not get any additional money, Nelson, the education
commissioner, said after the meeting. That's because the state
already has committed nearly its entire textbook allotment for next
year.``
</P>
<P>
   The first-grade reading and language arts books will cost $33.7
million, part of $296 million Texas will spend on new texts next
school year.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who has been on the job only about a month, said his
concern with the debate ``was whether we were changing the rules at
the end of the game. ... We've got to make sure we don't get in
this position again.''

By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Cumming has been a big-time Broadway musical star, having
won a Tony a couple of years ago for playing the Emcee in the very
adult revival of ``Cabaret,'' but somehow he never saw _ or heard
much about _ ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits that if he had, he might have refused to play oily
con-artist Rooster Hannigan in the new Disney remake, which
premieres Sunday night on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what `Annie' was at all,'' said Cumming, a
34-year-old native of Scotland who divides his time between homes
in London and New York. ``I knew it was about a little girl with a
dog and that she's an orphan. I thought I'd better read it, and
then I saw there was a film of it, so I went and got that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought, `Oh please, all these annoying children,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics believe the 1982 John Huston screen version _ with
Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan and
Aileen Quinn as Annie _ might be the most irritating production of
the Depression-era musical based on Harold Gray's 75-year-old
``Little Orphan Annie'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   But Cumming said script revisions, Rob Marshall's direction and
the cast, led by 12-year-old Alicia Morton, redeemed this remake.
The TV movie tries harder to capture the dark, hopeless feel of the
Depression, and Annie herself has had her overt cuteness exorcised.
Her hair is in Shirley Temple ringlets for only one scene, and she
says her trademark exclamation _ ``Leapin' lizards!'' _ just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a darling, you know,'' Cumming said of Morton, who
played young Cosette in Broadway's ``Les Miserables'' for three
years. ``I thought she was great in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little apprehensive about going into a thing with so
many singing children. I thought I was going to have to stop myself
from slapping children,'' he said with a laugh. ``But they were all
lovely kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie'' tells of a girl who dreams of a reunion with the
parents who left her at a New York City orphanage because they
could not afford to care for her. By chance Annie is chosen to be
the Christmas guest of billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Victor Garber),
whose edginess is worn down by the lovable little redhead until he
decides to adopt her. But orphanage matron Miss Hannigan (Kathy
Bates) and her conniving brother Rooster come up with a scheme to
pose as Annie's real parents and claim a $50,000 reward _ if they
can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known number from the show is ``Tomorrow,'' the overly
optimistic solo sung by Annie and slaughtered by most little girls
who audition for the part. (Our apologies to anyone who, having
read that title, will have the song stuck in his head for the next
several hours.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cumming and Bates get to bump and grind through one of the
show-stoppers, ``Easy Street.'' Bates has claimed several awards
for her dramatic film and stage work, including an Oscar for
``Misery'' and an Obie for ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de
Lune,'' but she had not done a musical professionally until
``Annie.'' She was nervous about the role, but Cumming helped to
make her more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been in a musical, everyone assumes you're just
super confident about your singing and dancing, and that you've
done it for years and you're fabulous,'' he said. ``I didn't feel
that at all _ I still don't _ so I let her know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not American, and here I'm doing one of these famous
American musicals, singing in a way I've never sung before, playing
a character way far away from anything I'd done before. You just
have to let people know you feel as scared as they do, and then you
can have a laugh. And we really did laugh a lot when we did this.
Kathy's hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I had to say to Kathy something like, `We're going to
fool Warbucks and get those 50 G's,' and during one take I said,
`We're going to fool Starbucks and get those 50 G's,' and she went,
`Yeah, and all the coffee they have.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cumming predicts the show will make a celebrity of Morton, who
has worked mainly on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be bonkers for her when this comes out, and she
has no understanding of what that's like,'' he said. ``It's kind of
exciting and scary at the same time. When America likes you, it's
quite overwhelming. I imagine they're going to love her and every
little girl in America's going to want to be her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumming knows firsthand about public recognition, having
appeared in such films as ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and ``Circle of
Friends'' in addition to his 393 performances in ``Cabaret.'' He
says Americans are far more fascinated with the famous than the
British are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge media country. What people have in common is what
they learn from television and newspapers. Celebrity is much more
vaunted here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won the Olivier Award in London, which is the equivalent of
the Tony, and the next day nobody stopped me on the street and said
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I won the Tony, every person on the street _ the man
who was selling me the newspaper, the man who was in the dairy _
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumming is a multifaceted artist: singer, actor, dancer,
director, screenwriter and, these days, novelist. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service has another way to describe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a green card, there are various sections you can
come in on, various kinds of cards,'' Cumming said. ``The kind I
got was one that said, `He's so unusual a person that there's no
one like him in America, so that's why we have to have him.' It
says `alien of extraordinary ability.'''

 &HT;    BellSouth may increase stake in German company
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth is mulling a multibillion boost to its
investment in a German wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move by the Atlanta-based telecom company could stymie a
bid by one big European player and set up BellSouth as de facto
ally to another.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth must soon decide whether to try heading off a bid by
France Telecom for E Plus Mobilfunk GmbH, a move widely seen as a
challenge to wireless business of Germany-based Deutsche Telekom,
Europe's largest phone company. Blocking France Telecom would
presumably please the German company, which is widely seen as
seeking U.S. allies _ or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth already owns 22.5 percent of E Plus, German's third
largest wireless phone company. Vodaphone AirTouch owns about 17
percent and has agreed to sell it to France Telecom for $1.9
billion. France Telecom is also bidding to buy the 60 percent of E
Plus that is owned by two German utilities.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has right of first refusal and 30 days to decide once
France Telecom formally makes its offer. No decision has been made,
said BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher. ``We are very happy with
the arrangement we have with E Plus. We are evaluating all of our
options currently.''
</P>
<P>
   The consideration comes a month after BellSouth fell short in
its dramatic bid to buy Sprint, fueling speculation that the
company is vulnerable to ever-larger rivals. But BellSouth
officials maintain that the company remains master of its destiny,
and sometimes the deal not made can be as telling as the one that
is.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, BellSouth this week voted with other Qwest
Communications shareholders to support a pending merger with US
West. Some analysts had speculated that BellSouth, which holds 10
percent of Qwest, would make a bid for the whole company _ whose
high-speed network it covets _ before that vote. Now, any tie to
Qwest automatically involves US West, a company BellSouth has
generally disdained as the sovereign of a sparsely populated region
and the holder of a tarnished reputation.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has several options. The company could make its own
bid for the rest of E Plus, make a deal in which it sits on its
hands or even look to sell its own stake.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping deeper into Germany makes some sense. After all,
international _ along with local service in the Southeast and U.S.
wireless _ is one-third of BellSouth's strategy. Moreover, Germany
is a vibrant market and U.S.-German calls last year accounted for
about 1.2 billion minutes _ the fifth-most used route between two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   E-Plus has more than 3 million customers, representing about 16
percent of the German wireless business. The company has not yet
been profitable, yet it is predicting that its $1 billion in annual
revenue will double within a year.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has looked south in recent years when expanding. The
company has investments in 10 Latin American nations, compared to
three elsewhere: Denmark, Germany and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth should not feel pressured, said analyst Mark Bacurin
of JC Bradford &AMP; Co. ``I don't think BellSouth has to make a
blockbuster deal.''
</P>
<P>
   More important than the increasing heft of competitors is
BellSouth's continued inability to provide long-distance as it
waits for regulatory approval, he said. ``I am not sure that size
is as critical as breadth of service. Although one reason to bulk
up is because you are afraid of being acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, with $24 billion in annual revenue and a market value
of about $87 billion, would make a target only for the most
muscular of telecom companies. Included in that steroid-set are
Bell Atlantic with a market value of $97 billion, Deutsche Telekom,
worth about $115 billion and SBC Communications, valued at a
whopping $176 billion.

 &HT;    CCE drops 9% amid cost increase
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises' stock fell nearly 9 percent
Thursday after analysts predicted, and the company later
acknowledged, it will cost more to make soft drinks next year.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. is expected to charge CCE and other bottlers
higher prices for concentrate, the basic ingredient of its brands.
In turn, the bottlers are expected to charge retailers more for the
final product. It will be up to retailers whether they charge
consumers more.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
projects Coca-Cola will raise its concentrate prices as much as 6
percent in the United States. William Pecoriello, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., says the boost will be about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategic change for Coke,'' Conway told The Wall
Street Journal. ``It's a real attempt to increase the profit pool
and will help Coke reinforce its premium brand and inherent brand
value.'' Coca-Cola's profit fell 11 percent in the third quarter,
the fourth consecutive decline in quarterly income.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokeswoman Polly Howes said Thursday the company does
not discuss specifics about concentrate pricing for competitive
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement, John Alm, CCE's chief operating officer,
confirmed that Coca-Cola Co. and CCE ``expect that concentrate will
need to increase at a midsingle-digit rate in year 2000.'' He
called it an ``appropriate increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Alm said both companies have developed multiyear strategies to
increase their brands through marketing initiatives that will
benefit the Coke system and retailers. ``This value must be shared
equitably between retail customers and the Coca-Cola system,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether retailers pass along the price boosts remains to be
seen. Raising prices in the highly competitive soft drink industry
is risky. The concentrate price increase would follow higher prices
the bottlers themselves tacked on to Coke products this year to
boost profits. CCE's case sales dropped 2 percent in the third
quarter, largely because it raised prices by 4 percent. But the
price rise more than compensated for the sales decline, boosting
CCE's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Conway has said in the past that consumers are adjusting to
higher soft drink prices, although investors still want to see
``more recovery'' in North American case sales before driving up
CCE's stock.
</P>
<P>
   CCE shares closed down $2.18 3/4 at $23.37 1/2 in trading that
was double the average volume. Shares of Charlotte-based Coca-Cola
Bottling, the second-largest Coke bottler in the United States
after CCE, closed at $51, down $1, or 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. analyst Roy Burry told Dow Jones
News Service: ``Bottlers have very thin profit margins. An increase
in a significant raw material cost like concentrate can cost them a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's stock closed at $56.68 3/4, down 18 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   CCE's main bottling rival didn't escape a falloff. Pepsi
Bottling Group, which also has raised drink prices this year, lost
nearly 10 percent of its value Thursday, closing at $16.68 3/4,
down $1.81 1/4. Analyst Pecoriello expects the bottler to pay 4
percent more for concentrate next year.

BOND PRICES RISE AGAIN ON INTEREST RATE HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices gained for the third consecutive
session Thursday on optimism that the Federal Reserve might not
raise short-term interest rates again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32, to 100 12/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, fell to 6.10 percent from 6.13 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence seems to suggest that inflation is not accelerating
enough to set off alarms, so there is less concern by investors of
a rate increase by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market may be setting itself up for a big
disappointment if the latest employment figures, scheduled for
release Friday morning, is stronger than expected. The consensus is
that the economy added about 300,000 jobs last month, with the
unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed
income at the J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla., saw
Thursday as more follow-through buying from the previous day along
with some short covering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think people are comfortable with rates as they
are,'' Pugliese said. ``The market was oversold, and prices have
come back nicely. There are those in the market who are looking
past Friday's employment report and are assuming the Fed will only
tighten once more this year. From my view, the market is
technically and fundamentally in good shape at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rupert, an economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a San
Francisco-based market research and analysis firm said, ``The Fed
policy outlook has been clouded greatly, indeed whipsawed, by a
combination of data and Fedspeak.
</P>
<P>
   ``One major factor behind this has been lack of consistency in
the Fed's management of expectations,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Consumer Price Index, Ms. Rupert said that
``after embarking on a preemptive policy approach last spring
following the surge in the CPI, and setting out to remove the
easings of 1998, the Fed appears to have turned soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rupert thinks that even Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman,
has backed off a bit after another attempt to prick the stock
market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' she said, ``the cost of a move is still
minimal. Unambiguous strength in the payroll report would likely
spur a tightening, but a tame report would leave the policy outlook
wide open and the market on tenterhooks.''

NASDAQ ADVANCES AGAIN, BUT STOCKS OVERALL RECEDE FROM EARLY GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The technology-dominated NASDAQ market pushed further
into record territory Thursday but stocks generally pulled back
from sizable early-session gains as Wall Street braced for the
Labor Department's report Friday morning on October's job market.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite finished with its sixth straight gain,
advancing 27.44 points, or 0.91 percent. At 3,055.95, the index is
up 9 percent in the past week and 39 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday's gain had been nearly twice as big early in the
session and the Dow Jones industrials finished at 10,639.57, up
just 30.51 points, or 0.29 percent, after sporting a midmorning
gain of more than 102 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 advanced
7.71 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,362.64.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lost their nerve worrying about what the payroll number
was going to do tomorrow,'' said Hank Herrmann, chief investment
officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed. The jobs number is one of the most
closely watched indicators of the economy and a rise of more than
an expected 300,000 or so would revive fears in the stock market
that the Federal Reserve will raise its interest-rate target when
it meets Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has receded substantially of late but could
return, said Herrmann, himself skeptical of scattered evidence that
the economy is slowing down on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Many financial stocks, which are widely but perhaps erroneously
regarded as vulnerable to rising rates, posted big gains Thursday,
with J.P. Morgan up 4 3/8 to 133 1/2 to account for more than
two-thirds of the rise in the Dow blue chips. Citicorp rose 1 3/4
to 54 3/4 while Republic New York jumped 3 11/16 to 68 3/8 on
expectations that HSBC Holdings would proceed with its planned
purchase of Republic.
</P>
<P>
   And drug stocks climbed again as Pfizer sought to acquire
Warner-Lambert, which on Wednesday announced a merger with American
Home Products. After a trading halt, Warner-Lambert jumped 6 3/16
to 90 while shares of its two suitors eased. Lilly and
Schering-Plough each gained more than 4 as investors mulled the
industry's consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 was paced by gains of 2 3/16 to 67 3/4 for Lucent
and 1 3/16 to 81 9/16 for Intel. America Online surged 6 to 145,
aided by a Donaldson, Lufkin analyst who reiterated his ``top
pick'' designation for the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Of the index components, winners outnumbered losers 248 to 229,
evidence of the improved market breadth that has emerged of late.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus was the projection by Abby Joseph Cohen, the
venerable Goldman Sachs strategist, that the profits of S&AMP;P
companies would grow another 8 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hoffman, senior portfolio manager at Value Line Asset
Management, also expressed optimism about the market outlook while
warning that year-end computer problems could prove disruptive,
especially the impact of foreign failures on multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth and benign inflationary pressures are
supporting investor confidence but there are still some nagging
year-2000 questions out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took in stride Thursday's increase in European
interest rates, which reflected economic recovery there. Stocks
advanced 1.34 percent in Frankfurt, Germany, and eight-tenths of 1
percent in London. Gains in the Far East were stronger _ 2.97
percent in Hong Kong and 1.98 percent in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume swelled to 981.7 million
shares traded from 914.4 million Wednesday as 1,605 stocks
advanced, 1,466 declined, 91 made new 52-week highs and 94 fell to
new lows.

EXPERTS DOUBT RADAR PROJECTION OF FLIGHT 990'S FINAL MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Taking advantage of a break in the weather,
high-tech search and recovery ships sailed for the waters off
Nantucket Thursday night, where recording devices that may unlock
mysteries of EgyptAir Flight 990's final moments lay 270 feet
beneath cold, storm-tossed seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My number one concern here . . . is the safety of these young
men and women who are going to be out on scene conducting this
incredibly dangerous event,'' said Navy Rear Adm. William G.
Sutton. ``We do not want to increase this tragedy any more than it
already is.''
</P>
<P>
   The USS Grapple, carrying skilled Navy divers, and the USNS
Mohawk, an ocean-going tug outfitted with advanced sonar equipment,
weighed anchor, to be joined by the NOAA Whiting which set sail a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, pored over maintenance logs and
rechecked radar records, still struggling to isolate factors that
doomed the Boeing 767-300ER jetliner and its 217 passengers 30
minutes after the Cairo-bound flight left New York.
</P>
<P>
   As mourners comforted each other with ancient words from
scripture, aeronautics specialists questioned Digital Age data that
showed the Boeing 767 jetliners plunged precipitously, then climbed
for more than a mile before falling again and shattering in the
Atlantic Ocean early Halloween morning.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of Flight 990's wild final minute has left seasoned
aviation investigators in disbelief and pilots who fly the aircraft
speechless, and government officials wondering if they put too much
faith in Air Force data that was preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I believe that data,'' one high-ranking federal
investigator said Thursday. ``Those kind of (gravity) forces on
that plane could pull the tail off.''
</P>
<P>
   One official said those records are better used to project a
flight path than to accurately track it.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial airline pilot who flies the 767 said, ``I cannot
think of any one mechanical failure that would lead to that type of
dive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the plane plunged from 33,000 feet to 16,700 feet in 40
seconds, its transponder _ on-board equipment that provides flight
information and identification to air-traffic control radar _
stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   Using Air Force radar from two different sites, an NTSB
preliminary analysis showed that the plane then climbed to 24,000
before diving yet again and breaking up before smashing into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the plane was in that extreme dive and the crew got
control of the aircraft and was pulling back on the yoke to reverse
the descent, it would over-g the aircraft causing it to come
apart,'' said the pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics at MIT, said the
apparent climb at the time of the loss of the transponder signal
may be more than a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   If the plane was diving from some sort of errant command from a
flight control system failure, Hansman said, once the transponder
went out _ a sign that power throughout the airplane had failed _
it is possible that the command stopped, too. If that is the case,
the plane would naturally begin to climb.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple arrived here Tuesday from its home port at the
Little Creek Amphibious Base in Norfolk, Va., and swiftly began
began loading equipment and a Deep Drone Remotely-Operated Vehicle
_ essentially an underwater robot. But the ship had remained in
port at the Newport Naval Complex since then, idled by a storm and
20-foot swells on the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple provided similar assistance to the NTSB for the
recovery victims and wreckage from the TWA Flight 800 crash off the
coast of Long Island in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forecast throughout the week had been very bad but we had
a window of opportunity since the waves subsided a lot,'' said
David Sanders, a Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple was accompanied out to sea Thursday by the Mohawk, a
US Maritime Service merchant marine vessel which carries equipment
that can detect and differentiate between natural and manmade
objects.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mohawk which pinpointed the location of the black
boxes on Tuesday, roughly in the middle of the aircraft's
ocean-floor debris field.
</P>
<P>
   The ships were expected to travel most of the night to reach the
area, said Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FBI was reviewing reports from a Newport
lobsterman who reportedly said he heard two thunderous roars, then
the sounds of aluminum crashing to the sea and ripping apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the plane blew up at 33,000 feet, I didn't hear it,''
Christopher D. Lutyens, captain of the Hedy Brenna, told the New
York Times. ``But I don't think that's what happened. I think it
hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials would not comment
on the Hedy Brenna's role in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Grapple set sail, crew members tested the remote
control vehicle officials are hoping will retrieve the aircraft's
so-called black boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder monitors dozens of the plane's
flight and performance. Its cockpit voice recorder captures all
communication on the flight deck. Authorities said signals from
both have been detected in water up to 270 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, a spokesman said most of the of the 33 Egyptian
military officers on the plane were in the United States to train
or to meet US defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said nothing about the
officers suggests they were targets of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   And at a briefing here late Thursday, officials said the plane
carried no hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities try to piece together what destroyed the
airplane, the medical examiner's office here took tentative steps
toward identifying remains already retrieved. Relatives are
supplying dental records and other information that could help
identify loved ones, such as birth marks or recognizable jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen family members of crash victims attended a
memorial service in Cranston Thursday morning at St. Mary and St.
Mena Coptic Christian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Father Marcos Girgis asked God to grant eternal peace to their
loved ones, to ``sustain them in a green pasture, by the water of
rest, in the paradise of joy, the place from which grief, sorrow
and groaning have fled away in the light of your saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, religious leaders of all faiths announced Thursday an
interfaith memorial service for families to be held Sunday.
Officials have not decided where the service will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goodbye. It's a hello for new life,'' said the Rev. H.
Daehler Hayes, conference minister for the Rhode Island Conference
of the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Although many relatives of crash victims have said they'll stay
in Newport as long as they have to, some are making plans to leave
after the memorial services, said Nihad Awad, executive director of
the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Many families came to Newport with unrealistic expectations
about the speed of the recovery and the conditions of the plane,
said Awad, who is serving as a counselor for Islamic families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that the whole plane just went in one piece in the
water,'' he said. ``Many believed the bodies would have their
clothes on.''

AMMIANO, BROWN WILL LIKELY SQUARE OFF IN DECEMBER RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Adds late election results; Ammiano likely 2nd place)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE, RACHEL GORDON and CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano's
write-in bid for mayor won the support of one of four San
Franciscans who voted and likely earned him the right to face Mayor
Willie Brown in a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano pulled ahead of former Mayor Frank Jordan late Thursday,
winning 44,567 votes to Jordan's 29,987 votes. Although some votes
remain to be counted, Ammiano appeared to have secured second place
in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results showed Brown leading the overall vote count
with 38.7 percent, trailed by Ammiano with 25.4 percent. Jordan had
17.1 percent, with political consultant Clint Reilly winning 12.5
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The returns reflect the votes of 143,388 San Franciscans.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day after the election, Brown seemed in good
spirits, although admitting, ``I don't feel good'' about being in a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped to win it all and get it over with,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if Ammiano hadn't entered the race at the last
minute, he would have won more than 50 percent of the vote, and
there would be no runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it made no difference to him whether he faced a
candidate from the right, Jordan, or from the left, Ammiano. He
said he wouldn't tailor his campaign to his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to simply deliver the message of who I am and who the
people running against me might be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ammiano remained mostly out of sight Wednesday and
declined to comment on the race. His spokeswoman said he was
handling the suspense well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being very calm and laid back and funny in his usual
way,'' said Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters before the final election results
were tallied, Jordan said that whether it was he or Ammiano in a
one-on-one showdown against the better-financed Brown, the result
would be the same: ``This is a David vs. Goliath race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also spoke with reporters, surprising many by saying that
if he didn't get into the runoff, he'd consider endorsing Ammiano.
``The one person I will not endorse is Willie Brown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Jordan endorsement of Ammiano would be a strange political
alliance indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a career cop and former police chief, has his political
base among the city's more moderate and conservative voters.
Ammiano, by far the city's most liberal elected official with his
roots in gay activism, finds his strongest support with
left-of-center constituents, among them tenant activists, homeless
advocates, rank-and-file labor and a faction of the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not agree with everything he does,'' Jordan said of
Ammiano, ``but his heart is in the right place.''

KILLER OF SHEPARD SENTENCED TO 2 LIFE TERMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial of a man convicted of murdering Matthew Shepard, a gay
University of Wyoming student, ended Thursday in Laramie, Wyo.,
with a deal approved by Shepard's parents that will spare his
killer the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from the court-appointed lawyers for the
defendant, Aaron McKinney, prosecutors agreed to give him two
consecutive life sentences if he relinquished his right to appeal.
After the agreement was concluded, Shepard's father, Dennis
Shepard, made a long, impassioned statement to the court about his
son, whom he called ``my hero'' for his courage in enduring slights
and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his address, he turned toward McKinney and
with obvious emotion said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like nothing better than to see you die, McKinney.
However, this is the time to begin the healing process, to show
mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``McKinney, I am going to grant you life, as hard as
it is for me to do so, because of Matthew. Every time you celebrate
Christmas, a birthday or the Fourth of July, remember that Matthew
isn't. Every time you wake up in that prison cell, remember that
you had the opportunity and the ability to stop your actions that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard concluded his remarks by saying, ``You robbed me of
something very precious, and I will never forgive you for that. May
you live a long life and may you thank Matthew every day for it.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Judy Shepard, did not address the court.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven men and five women in Wyoming District Court
convicted McKinney on Wednesday of second-degree murder, robbery
and kidnapping _ a combination of charges that made him eligible
for execution, which is by lethal injection in Wyoming. Thursday he
told the court, ``I really don't know what to say other than I'm
truly sorry to the entire Shepard family.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement came as something of a surprise on the first
day the jury was expected to consider punishment for McKinney, a
22-year-old former roofer, who, with a friend, had lured Shepard
out of a bar on Oct. 6, 1998, robbed him of $20, beat him with the
butt of a pistol and left him for dead on a prairie fence at the
edge of Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, who was 21 years old, was found unconscious the
following morning and taken to a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo.,
where he died five days later.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Russell Henderson, 22, accepted virtually the same
deal last spring that McKinney received.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian rights groups praised the plea agreement as fair
and benevolent. ``Gay and lesbian Americans can now have renewed
faith in our justice system,'' said David M. Smith, a spokesman for
the Human Rights Campaign, an activist group. ``We can only hope a
strong message was sent, that in America hate crimes will not be
tolerated and that there are severe consequences for violent,
hateful actions.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by President Clinton, who said in a
statement, ``We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our
society who lash out at those who are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Rerucha, the Albany County prosecutor, said he had not been
in favor of offering McKinney a deal. But Smith said it largely
came about at the insistence of Mrs. Shepard, who has spent months
campaigning for more states and the federal government to pass laws
that include a victim's sexual orientation as a basis for
designating the crime as a hate crime. So far, only 21 states have
such provisions; a federal proposal died in conference this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the court, Shepard conceded that to some
people, his son had become ``a symbol, some say a martyr, putting a
boy-next-door face on hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his family opposed an earlier deal for
McKinney because they believed that McKinney was their son's
principal antagonist, which McKinney's confession to police
confirmed, and they wanted a full public airing of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial was necessary,'' Shepard said, ``to show that this was
a hate crime and not just a robbery gone bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But that did not mean he, his wife or their son philosophically
opposed capital punishment, Shepard told the court. He recalled a
conversation with his son in which they agreed that some killers,
like those convicted of murdering James Byrd Jr. of Jasper, Tex.,
by dragging him to his death, deserved to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did we know,'' he said, ``that the same response would
come about involving Matt.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As brutal as the murder of Shepard was, the trial of McKinney
was more noteworthy for an evidentiary ruling by Judge Barton
Voigt, that McKinney's lawyers could not engage in a so-called
gay-panic defense. They had planned to present evidence showing
that McKinney had suffered from homosexual abuse as a child and
that in attacking Shepard, their client acted out of sheer
revulsion from a sexual advance they claimed Shepard had made
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   But Voigt ruled that Wyoming law does not provide for such a
defense as a basis for seeking conviction on a lesser charge, and
that decision was hailed by gay rights groups as a victory against
future attackers seeking to escape more severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, McKinney's lawyers tried to convince the jury that
drugs and alcohol played a role in McKinney's violent actions.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the court, Shepard thanked Judge Voigt for the
ruling. ``By doing so,'' he said, ``you have emphasized that
Matthew was a human being with all the rights and responsibilities
and protections of any citizen of Wyoming.''

 &HT;    Wife wants Breeder's Cup win, but name recognition not an issue
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Maybe John Ward should have an oversized
lapel button for special days. ``I'm the trainer's husband,'' it
could read. He could wear it Saturday at Gulfstream Park, where his
name is in the program as the trainer of Beautiful Pleasure in the
Breeders' Cup Distaff and Darling My Darling in the Juvenile
Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   The actual trainer of both fillies is Donna Ward, his wife for
28 years, a licensed trainer for 15.
</P>
<P>
   Donna and John make it clear she is in charge of their Breeders'
Cup horses.
</P>
<P>
   She is not the assistant trainer.
</P>
<P>
   She is not the co-trainer.
</P>
<P>
   She is the trainer of Beautiful Pleasure and Darling My Darling.
She trained the team's 1995 Kentucky Oaks champion, Gal In A
Ruckus. She trained their 1995 Flamingo Stakes winner, Pyramid
Peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brag about her, but they (the thoroughbred racing press)
don't want to listen,'' John T. Ward Jr. said. ``That's quite a
chauvinistic bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The title trainer does not mean that much to John Ward's wife.
``When John wins, I win,'' she said. ``When I win, he wins.''
</P>
<P>
   John Ward carries the stopwatch. He answers the questions from
reporters, usually while his wife is busy somewhere else, often on
a horse she rides on the training track. The racing operation is
named John T. Ward Stables.
</P>
<P>
   But Donna Ward lays out the practice schedules for Beautiful
Pleasure and Darling My Darling. She oversees their veterinary
requirements. She picks the jockeys and talks to them about
approach and strategy. As their exercise rider, she knows the
strengths and weaknesses of the two oversized fillies, their likes
and dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   John trains nearly all of the horses in the stable that carries
his name, 30 in Kentucky this week, four in New York. But Beautiful
Pleasure and Darling My Darling are his wife's projects, fillies
that required special attention from the start of their time in
training. She took them to work out the kinks; they became hers to
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I end up with the horses that need me most,'' she said.
Possession is ten-tenths of the law at Ward Stables.
</P>
<P>
   The Ward employees know which horses are trained by Donna. They
go to her for instructions. ``A little bit his way, a little bit my
way, that would never work, we decided that years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just put Donna's name in the program as trainer?
</P>
<P>
   ``My ego doesn't require that,'' she said. ``This is not a
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some jurisdictions won't allow it, horses in two trainers'
names from the same stable,'' her husband said. ``It would be
impractical in some ways, insurance and other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't change my life in any way,'' she said. ``We
discussed it before the Oaks (with Gal In A Ruckus), made our
decision and it has not been discussed since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain horses, I don't have to ask for them. They will work
their way to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A long-established Kentucky racing operation, the Wards have no
Breeders' Cup history. In their one race, Beautiful Pleasure got an
outside post position (No. 13) at Hollywood Park in the 1997
Breeders' Cup and was beaten from the start. At 7-1 odds, she
finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   But their second time around is different.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they are mangled in the post position draw again, it
would not take an earthquake for the Wards to win the first two
races of the 1999 Breeders' Cup. Beautiful Pleasure is the No. 2
betting choice in the Distaff, Darling My Darling the No. 3 pick in
the Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Two winners would turn heads.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 years of Breeders' Cup championship races, four trainers
have won twice on the same day. They are Pat Byrne, Wayne Lukas,
Richard Mandella and Shug McGaughey. That's a choice group.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ward horses win Saturday, would the Breeders' Cup feel it
appropriate to put an asterisk in the record book? In 15 years only
one woman, Jenine Sahadi, first in the Sprint in 1996 and again in
1997, has trained a Breeders' Cup winner. No trainer has won two
straight Breeders' Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it more than life itself,'' Donna Ward said.

`DINNER WITH FRIENDS': A MENU FEATURING DIVORCE AND FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A marriage crumbles in ``Dinner With Friends,'' but
it would be difficult to forge a more harmonious union of cast,
director and script than the one created at the Variety Arts
Theater, where Daniel Sullivan's unflinching production of Donald
Margulies' rueful play opened Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Margulies, author of ``The Model Apartment'' and ``The Loman
Family Picnic,'' has fashioned a deceptively straightforward
suburban comedy. He has chosen the most shopworn of subjects,
marital infidelity, and picked as his setting a comfortably banal
Connecticut outpost of Sub-Zero refrigerators, one-acre zoning and
two-car garages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his take on the denizens of this world is so forthright and
clear-eyed that the normal array of yuppie hang-ups as chronicled
on television and in the movies are made rawer here, more
disturbing. What initially seems a rather conventional glimpse at
the perils of breaking up becomes an original examination of the
terrors of staying together.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which has been given a gorgeous, shelter
magazine sheen by the set designer Neil Patel, is as satisfyingly
professional as they come, the sort of cozy and expertly acted play
that was once a staple of Broadway, the kind that was as dependable
as the Oldsmobile in your father's driveway. ``Dinner With
Friends'' may not be scathingly hilarious or blazingly intense, but
it has other fine qualities.
</P>
<P>
   It is wry and keenly observed and bathed in the unspoken sorrow
that can sneak up on you in middle age. It is about the
vulnerability everyone experiences as the shadow of time grows
longer and the limits of one's choices are more clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
   The package Margulies wraps this in has its funny side, too. The
story intertwines the lives of Gabe and Karen, (Matthew Arkin and
Lisa Emery), world-traveling food writers with a kitchen out of the
Martha Stewart handbook, and their close friends Tom (Kevin
Kilner), a lawyer, and his wife, Beth (Julie White), whose 12-year
marriage is in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Over a dinner to die for at Gabe and Karen's, Beth unburdens
herself, though she still can ooh and ah over the lemon almond
polenta cake. Margulies' characters practice what one might term
culinary couples' therapy: they let a tuile be their umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   This comedy-drama is extremely smart about marriage. When Arkin
and Ms. Emery unconsciously fold a bedspread in unison in their
cottage on Martha's Vineyard, it is more than the fulfillment of a
household obligation; it is a warm commentary on domestic ritual _
the ``little things you do together,'' in Stephen Sondheim's
musical phrase _ and on the subliminal teamwork that a good
marriage develops. Gabe and Karen are like an Olympic rowing pair,
dependent on synchronized strokes. When one's rhythm falters,
they're both off their game.
</P>
<P>
   What seriously throws them is the news of the breakup. Beth
explains that Tom has found another woman; when in a subsequent
scene Tom discovers that Beth has spilled the beans without him
present, he rushes over to Gabe and Karen's with his side of the
story (and with a hankering for a piece of that polenta cake).
</P>
<P>
   It's no different from Beth's version, really, except that Tom
declares himself the injured party _ Beth will no longer touch him
in casually intimate ways, he complains _ and admits he never had
much interest in the rigors of marriage, the ferrying of the
children, the never-ending mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   These, of course, are nearly universal expressions of the
misgivings of middle age; Margulies is concerned with the effect
Tom and Beth's opting out has on Gabe and Karen's sense of
well-being. In a terrific pair of scenes in Act II, a complex
tangle of expectations and self-delusions are laid bare to help
demonstrate how tenuous the friendship between the couples really
is.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, Beth announces she has found another man, and Karen
registers her disapproval, which infuriates Beth: ``You needed me
to be a mess,'' she says. Over drinks, Tom extols the wonders of
his new life with a travel agent named Nancy, and it is Gabe who
feels betrayed. ``We were supposed to grow old and fat together,
the four of us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan reveals once again how astute and precise he can be
with actors; there is not a false moment all evening, and Rui
Rita's lighting and Michael Roth's music intensify the
bittersweetness the director seeks to bring out.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin and Ms. Emery are simply superb in their rendering of a
man and woman both settled and unsettled by the strictures of
long-term commitment. The imperfections in the marriage are
tantalizingly brought close to the surface: Ms. Emery's brittle
skittishness nicely masks some unknowable residual anger, and Arkin
beautifully conjures a man with sensitive antennae for his wife's
strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White and Kilner have the slightly less interesting couple
to play, and both still do extremely well. The actress handles
Beth's transformation from basket case to woman in love with grace
and ease, and Kilner is particularly strong in the flashback scene
in which Tom first sets eyes on Beth _ you watch those eyes and get
an education in the mating habits of a ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   If some people can feel lonely in their own marriage, ``Dinner
With Friends'' asks the question if investing too deeply in someone
else's marriage can ultimately make you even lonelier. How fitting
that the play ends with a pair of shaken souls clinging to each
other in the dark.

STUDY SUGGESTS MANY ARE BORN WITH PERFECT PITCH, BUT LOSE IT

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most native speakers of languages that use tones to convey
meaning may have a form of perfect pitch, according to new research
that suggests that many or even most babies may be born with
perfect pitch, but lose it if they do not learn a tonal language or
undergo early musical training.
</P>
<P>
   The brain processes acoustic tones in certain regions of the
temporal lobes. Neural cells at different points in those regions
are sensitive to different tones.
</P>
<P>
   But while most people find it easy to perceive and sing musical
tones relative to one another, an ability called relative pitch,
the ability to place them on an absolute scale is much less common.
Absolute or perfect pitch turns up in no more than one person out
of ten thousand in Western countries, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The languages studied in the new research were Vietnamese and
Mandarin Chinese, two major languages in which different rising and
falling tones can impart different meanings to the same combination
of vowels and consonants. For example, the Mandarin word ``ma'' can
mean mother, hemp, reproach or horse depending on whether the
spoken tone is flat, rising, falling, or falling and then rising.
</P>
<P>
   While the differences in meaning are conveyed largely by
relative rather than absolute pitch, the researchers, led by Dr.
Diana Deutsch, a psychologist at the University of California in
San Diego, found that speakers retain an absolute tonal standard.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, which Dr. Deutsch described Thursday at a meeting
of the Acoustical Society of America, the researchers recorded
Vietnamese and Mandarin speakers as they read lists of words that
covered a wide range of tones, and then repeated the exercise days
later.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of the recordings showed that individual
speakers uttered the same words at the same absolute pitches to
within fractions of a semitone _ the musical step from one key on a
piano to an adjacent one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really sounds as though the person is sitting there
immediately repeating the sound,'' Dr. Deutsch said. ``Which is
really, to my mind, amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the new findings have surprised many scientists, some said
that more research needs to be done to show that the ability
displayed by Vietnamese and Mandarin speakers is identical to
perfect pitch as it is understood in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still possible that the subjects may not actually see or
realize a connection between tone as they use it in language, and
pitch as a musical concept,'' said Dr. Donald Hall, a physicist at
California State University in Sacramento who studies musical
acoustics and is a church organist with perfect pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has shown that the prevalence of perfect pitch is
higher in Japan, where the language is not tonal, but where many
young children receive Suzuki music training. Perfect pitch is also
more common among professional musicians, but studies so far have
not established whether the talent arises from youthful practice or
led the musicians to their vocation in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some scientists said the new findings suggest that most
babies are born with perfect pitch but retain it only by learning a
tonal language or undergoing some sort of early musical training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a much higher incidence of absolute-pitch
musicians out there if all of us were exposed to music much
earlier,'' said Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, a neurologist at the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who has studied how
structures in the brain are related to absolute pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that most people, even in Western countries, do
retain an almost perfect ``pitch memory'' but simply lack a means
of giving names to each pitch and putting the ability into
practice, as speakers of tonal languages can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means to me is that people have a very accurate memory
for musical pitch,'' said Dr. Daniel Levitin, a cognitive
psychologist at McGill University in Montreal who has studied
perfect pitch. ``You and I don't have the ability to attach these
labels to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conceivable explanation for the results could lie in
innate differences between Western and Asian populations, but Dr.
Deutsch dismissed that possibility as ``extraordinarily unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   For the study, Dr. Deutsch, a psychologist, collaborated with
Trevor Henthorn, an audio engineer at the Center for Research in
Computing and the Arts of the University of California, San Diego,
and Dr. Mark Dolson, a specialist in audio signal processing at the
Creative Advanced Technology Center of the company Creative
Technology Limited in Scotts Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In one series of measurements, the team asked seven native
speakers of Vietnamese to read a list of words that spanned the
range of tones in that language. Days later, the task was repeated,
and recordings of each word were broken up into five-millisecond
intervals on a computer and analyzed for their average tonal
content.
</P>
<P>
   The differences of pitch between the two repetitions of a word
by a particular speaker were all less than 1.1 semitone, and four
of the seven speakers displayed pitch differences of less than half
a semitone.
</P>
<P>
   The results for 15 Mandarin speakers were perhaps even more
striking, with nearly all of the speakers showing differences of
fractions of a semitone from session to session.
</P>
<P>
   How many of the speakers displayed what is usually called
perfect pitch? ``You could argue that they all did,'' Dr. Deutsch
said. ``If people show it, give or take a semitone, they'll claim
perfect pitch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected results, Dr. Deutsch said, raises the question of
why perfect pitch seems to be so rare in the West. One possible
explanation, she said, is that most babies are capable of acquiring
perfect pitch, just as they can learn to speak any language without
an accent.
</P>
<P>
   But as some window of time begins to close _ earlier for some
children, later for others _ they can no longer acquire perfect
pitch or speak a new language without an accent.
</P>
<P>
   But that remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe up to a certain age you're going to be able to learn and
memorize absolute representations of these pitches,'' said Schlaug
of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, ``but after a certain
age it's not possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There remains the question, which Dr. Deutsch is attempting to
answer with new research, of the precise connection between perfect
pitch in music and tonal speech.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Perry Link, who teaches Chinese language and literature at
Princeton University, says that he doubts the connection is direct.
Native Chinese speakers, he says, are often unable to identify the
tones they are correctly using, just as English speakers may use
the language properly but be unable to parse their sentences
grammatically. Absolute-pitch musicians, however, can explicitly
name each tone they hear.
</P>
<P>
   But Levitin of McGill University says the results are
reminiscent of studies demonstrating that even English speakers can
usually sing extremely familiar tunes in key without accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative conclusion, he said, is that most people have
excellent ``pitch memory,'' but can accurately express that memory
only using deeply ingrained associations between particular tones
and spoken language.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fond hopes of parents, however, the new findings do
not indicate that every baby carries the seeds of a Mozart inside,
waiting to sprout. ``Mozart had absolute pitch, and he was a
composing genius,'' Levitin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we all composing geniuses? No,'' he said. ``But do more of
us have absolute pitch than we thought? Yes, absolutely.''

LATE-WORKING STUDENTS REQUIRE FOURTH MEAL, COLLEGES FIND

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ As it has been for more than three centuries,
dinner is served every evening in the heavy wood paneled dining
halls of Harvard's stories residences, their names _ Cabot, Eliot,
Winthrop _ as solid as a square meal.
</P>
<P>
   But the real evening meal for many Harvard students comes
sometime around midnight at the distinctly less baronial, more
linoleum environs of Tommy's House of Pizza, Pinnochio's, or
Skewers.
</P>
<P>
   It's around that hour that students are finishing their routine
of club meetings, community service projects, athletic practices,
and study groups. They'll get a quick jolt of sustenance before
heading home for a few more hours of studying before bed.
</P>
<P>
   The overprogrammed children, raised in a blur of soccer
practice, piano lessons, art classes and French tutoring, have
arrived at college, and they are hungry. And now Harvard is looking
for a way to keep up with their appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next year, the nation's oldest college will
begin offering undergraduates a fourth meal, serving it around
midnight. In doing so, it joins schools across the country adding
the same second dinner of sorts, trying to make sure overprogrammed
doesn't mean undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   Undergraduates have always stayed up late, college officials
say. But late is becoming far later. And the way to students'
brains is surely through their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifestyle of today's student is such that the clock is not
the governor,'' said Frank Gladu, director of food services at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville. ``Sitting down to breakfast,
lunch and dinner is about as antiquated as you can get in terms of
providing food service to today's students. We're trying to think
of how we can provide service at the times students really want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick survey taken around a few lunchtables reveals an average
bedtime of about 3 a.m. That includes midnight for a couple of
athletes, 6 a.m. for one intense studier, 2 a.m. for a social
butterfly with ``engagements'' to keep, and 4 a.m. for one student
who feels he does his best work on his creative thesis in poetry
after 1 am.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the culture here,'' says Chiwen Bao, sitting around
the lunch table in Eliot House. ``If I want to do well, I have to
strive, I have to stay up late, I have to sacrifice sleep, or else
I'm not maxing out my opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual, students say, to walk out at 2 a.m. and see
about 40 percent of lights on in the student residences along the
Charles River. Like other administrators and professors, associate
dean Tom Dingman says he began noticing the later hours a few years
ago, as e-mail began to dominate campus communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to work in the morning, my e-mail is backed up with
messages dated 3, 4 in the morning,'' he says. ``Nobody says, `I'm
pulling an all-nighter.' This is routine business.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a fourth meal came from students during final exams
last year. Cafeteria workers put out late night bagels, coffee
cake, and cereal to help sustain studiers. Students asked why the
college couldn't simply do that year-round, since they are staying
up just as late.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Dingman said, is that classes have been
gradually pushed to later and later hours in the morning. Classes
used to start at 8, now it's usually more like 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of our classes are now between 10 (a.m.) and 1
(p.m.). And there are some people for whom ten is stretching it,''
he said. ``There's more of a luxury in being able to stay up
later.''
</P>
<P>
   With tuitions rising prohibitively, more students are also on
financial aid, which requires them to work between 10 and 12 hours
a week. About 43 percent of students at the college last year did
some kind of community service project, and 70 percent do a similar
project before they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there are the problem sets, the papers, the
reading, the midterms. Many students are working so intensely in
activities that they try to cram five courses instead of the usual
four into one semester, so they can take three another.
</P>
<P>
   To keep themselves going, students hoard bags of raisin bread,
cups of cereal, sandwiches, and even hard-boiled eggs in their
rooms. And many spend a small fortune on fast food in Harvard
Square. Students describe the current dining hours, which end at
7:15 p.m., as ``factory hours.'' What they have in mind, they say,
is something a little more like a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Harvard wants to be a diverse school, it has to have
diverse meals,'' says Charles Zerner, a junior. ``Eating late is
just a natural response to being up later. It's ridiculous if
you're staying up 'til 2 (a.m.) to eat at 5 (p.m.). That's nine
hours without food.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Harvard house masters will meet to decide what the
fourth meal will look like. Part of the problem is how to extend
hours without adding to the expense of room and board. At other
schools, later meals have meant simply keeping dining halls open
later, or allowing students to use their meal ``points'' to buy
food in campus student centers which stay open later. Northeastern
University recently opened a new food court-style commons with some
stalls open until 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard dining services officials say they imagine the fourth
meal will be more a snack of sorts, something like what they put
out at exam time, but fresher and maybe warmer. But another problem
is trying to satisfy all students. Some want the meal at 11 p.m.
Others want it at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone thinks later meals are a great idea.
Resident assistants say they already worry that students are trying
to do too much with their time. Dingman also suggests that one way
to cut back on later hours is to return to earlier classes.
</P>
<P>
   But to others, later hours are simply here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge is expanding, there's only going to be more to
learn, more to know, more to do,'' said Pam Mosher, a resident
assistant in Eliot House.. ``I'm always concerned about what's
going to give for students, it's so hard to get them to stop to do
anything. I guess it'll be sleep. But they have to eat.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing on the mass shootings in Seattle and
Honolulu this week, Vice President Al Gore angrily challenged the
Republican-controlled Congress on Thursday to approve far-reaching
gun control legislation before lawmakers adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many tragedies does it take before the members of the
Republican leadership bottling up this legislation get the
message?'' Gore said at a Capitol Hill news conference, flanked by
Democratic legislators and women who work in shelters for victims
of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to make gun control a staple of his presidential
campaign, Gore accused Republican leaders of kowtowing to the
National Rifle Association, which opposes tighter regulations on
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gore cast a rare tie-breaking vote in the
Senate that enabled a Democratic gun control amendment to prevail
over a less restrictive Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   Later, House Democrats, who were unable to broaden a measure
backed by Republican leaders, helped to defeat a package of
restrictions that were significantly weaker than what the Senate
had approved. In the negotiations between the two chambers, gun
show regulations have become the main sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of Gore's claim, Democrats on Thursday made public
an e-mail message that the rifle association's top lobbyist, James
Jay Baker, sent to several congressional allies on Oct. 28, urging
them to reject even a Republican proposal to allow vendors up to
three days to conduct mandatory background checks on customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun shows are temporary events lasting only two or three days,
and the system needs to recognize that fact rather than delay gun
purchases by law-abiding individuals based on flawed information,''
Baker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Charlton Heston, who is president of the rifle
association, on Thursday accused the administration of not
enforcing existing gun laws. ``This administration, as a policy, is
putting gun-toting felons on the streets in record numbers,''
Heston told the House Government Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and critics are increasingly casting gun control
as an election-year issue, implicitly acknowledging the measure's
bleak prospects for passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   Top Senate Republican aides said on Thursday that senators were
hopelessly deadlocked on the gun show provision, and privately
declared the bill dead for the year. Republican gun control
critics, however, refused to give the measure a public burial,
saying they did not want to hand supporters any more grist for an
issue that enjoys broad public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fragile to get something that can pass the House and
Senate right now,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
assistant Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
called on Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, to convene House and Senate negotiators
immediately to broker an agreement on the gun provisions. In the
Senate, those provisions are included in a youth crime bill, but a
companion crime bill in the House has no gun provisions.
</P>
<P>
   But even Gephardt acknowledged that the gun control measures
backed by many House Democrats would not have covered the handguns
used in this week's slayings. ``I've never said that passing this
legislation is going to stop all of the incidents,'' he said. ``But
it would cut down on the number of guns that are out in
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who has bucked many of his party leaders by advocating
curbs on firearms, said that Democrats were trying to sabotage an
agreement by adding new demands, and warned Gephardt in a written
reply, ``Please do not let a desire to exploit a political issue
undermine this unique opportunity to protect America's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also released a draft proposal that he and Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the Judiciary Committee, are circulating,
and that the rifle association says goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   The draft includes a provision giving vendors 24 hours to
conduct mandatory background checks, unless the check turns up a
disqualifying arrest or felony conviction. In those cases, the
vendors would have three days to perform the checks.
</P>
<P>
   But gun control supporters object to the Republicans' definition
of a gun show as having at least five vendors. Under this
definition, they say, four vendors selling thousands of guns would
be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The draft would also give the authorities up to 24 hours to
destroy the records of background checks of lawful purchases. The
rifle association favors immediate destruction of the records,
fearing that keeping records any longer ``serves no purpose except
to establish a framework for national gun registration.''

CLINTON URGES SPORTS TEAMS TO AID IN ECONOMIC REVIVAL

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Dwarfed as he stood beside towering New Jersey
Nets basketball players, President Clinton on Thursday challenged
all professional sports teams to contribute to the economic revival
of the communities they represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the obligations owed to the people in your city.
Go beyond making appearances for good causes to change the cause
for everyone in your community. Make investment in your community
second only in your priorities to bringing home the championship
trophy,'' Clinton said to cheers from students at the Malcolm X
Shabazz High School.
</P>
<P>
   Newark was the first of four stops on a presidential tour of
areas in the nation that have been bypassed by the current economic
boom. In a previous tour, Clinton in July visited seven cities from
Appalachia to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to Watts to
underscore the need for creating new economic markets in regions
historically impoverished. On this tour he will highlight long-term
partnerships between businesses and communities.
</P>
<P>
   The tours stem from Clinton's effort to promote his $15 billion
New Markets initiative that combines loan guarantees and tax
credits to encourage business development in poor areas. He said
the country's current prosperity provides a ``magic moment'' to
address the nation's longstanding poverty problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to New Jersey to highlight the work of Nets owners
Lewis Katz and Ray Chambers, both area natives who bought a part of
the team last year. Katz and Chambers dedicated 40 percent of the
Nets' profits to the community and a nonprofit Community Youth
Organization they created.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has invested $2 million in student scholarships
and plans to create a 2,000-member youth basketball league for New
Jersey teens. The owners raised money for an inner-city movie
theater and plan to build a new downtown stadium that includes a
learning center. The players personally repainted and repaired an
inner-city park.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of major league football, baseball and
basketball also spoke to the students, recounting their efforts to
work with their communities.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue pledged
$1.5 million to refurbish inner-city athletic fields for youths.
Major League Baseball agreed to search for ballpark vendors
operated by women and minorities. And the National Basketball
Association plans to have all 29 franchises and players engage
2,000 youths in community service projects by the end of the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nets center Jayson Williams also told students the team would be
adopting the school. Team owners plan to buy the band new uniforms
and new instruments and 23 new computers.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy but injured 6-foot 10-inch star generated screams
when he said the 200 students who performed the most community
services hours would be invited to his sprawling suburban home.
Williams was joined on stage by several team members, including 7-7
center Gheorghe Muresan and 6-10 forward Keith Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The president praised Katz and Chambers as ``visionaries ... who
have seen that a sports team can not only thrill people while the
game is going on, but actually share the rewards of their popular
support with the communities in which they live. This is an
astonishing thing that they have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said if every franchise would follow their lead, they
could change America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports teams everywhere can make a difference. They can site
their stadiums in urban areas as part of a comprehensive community
economic development plan. They can set up mentoring partnerships
with their suppliers to help small and minority-owned businesses
get in the game of doing business. They can reach out to young
people and lead them on a path to college and a better life,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston sports representatives were generally receptive to
Clinton's call for contributing to urban redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't agree more that sports teams have a responsibility
to give back to the community,'' said Angela Blakeney, director of
business communications for the NBA's Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeney noted that the Rockets gave nearly $5 million in the
last six years toward programs such as urban housing redevelopment
and scholarships for needy students.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about the possibility of Rockets owner Les
Alexander following the Nets' lead in giving 40 percent of profits
back to the community, Blakeney was non-committal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our community giving is substantial,'' she said. ``Our
player expenses are also substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros baseball team also believes in giving back to
the community, said Rob Matwick, the baseball club's vice president
of community relations. ``Our number one goal is to be a
champion,'' Matwick said. ``Our number two goal is to make a
difference in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Matwick noted that construction of the club's new baseball
stadium, Enron Field, will itself be a move toward urban
redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also run a number of education and baseball training
programs for poor kids, among other charity functions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newark, after decades of decline, is experiencing a revival. Its
jobless rate stood at 9.9 percent in 1998, down from the 15.2
percent rate in 1993. Still, the percentage of unemployed here is
twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Shabazz students who are members of Project
GRAD, a program sponsored by Lucent Technologies and the Ford
Foundation. The organizations provide $6,000 scholarships to
students.
</P>
<P>
   The president also flew to Hartford, Conn., to tour El Mercado,
a prospering indoor marketplace in a depressed section of town. A
coalition of Hartford corporations pledged $177.5 million in
investments to revitalize downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the most impressive commitments in any city,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will begin Friday in his homestate of Arkansas to visit
the small town of Hermitage. The trek ends at Englewood, Ill.

 &HT;    Success continues to mount for Bailey
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``The Sheiks,'' as the horse-racing
brothers from Dubai's ruling family are known around the world's
thoroughbred tracks, know a good investment when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   According to some estimates, Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum and his
brother, Sheik Maktoum al Maktoum, have spent billions during the
past 20 years collecting, breeding and racing the finest horses.
</P>
<P>
   So for America's richest race, Saturday's $4 million Breeders'
Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park, the royals are putting their
4-year-old colt Almutawakel (Arabic for ``In the Hands of the
Gods'') in the hands of a 42-year-old recovering alcoholic who once
shoveled manure for a living and relaxes today watching The Weather
Channel and coaching Little League.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Almutawakel _ winner of the prestigious 1999 Dubai
World Cup _ will be guided by a 5-foot-5 college dropout who
listens to Elton John, watches ``The Sting'' over and over and
likes to curl up with a John Grisham novel.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey is all of that. And on racetracks from Saratoga to
Hollywood Park, he is ... well, something else. With uncanny
instincts and a meticulous preparation regimen, he is perhaps the
hottest jockey in horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, his $15.2million in earnings this year led all
jockeys. He has won four of the past eight Breeders' Cup Classics,
the Kentucky Derby twice, the two initial runnings of the Dubai
World Cup, and the Preakness and the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Around tracks, Bailey is synonymous with Cigar, whom he guided
to a modern record-tying 16 straight victories.
</P>
<P>
   Owners line up to get Bailey _ 1995 Racing Hall of Fame inductee
and the winner of three straight Eclipse Awards as the nation's top
jockey. Who could blame them?
</P>
<P>
   ``For these big races, he's the one people go to. He's Michael
Jordan with 10 seconds on the clock,'' said trainer James Bond, who
has known Bailey for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has guided Skip Away, Sea Hero and Black Tie Affair in
rides that have been described as works of art.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for delivering flawless rides, but not just because
he does his homework _ studying everything from the Daily Racing
Form to the idiosyncrasies of fellow jockeys to the way a track is
running on a given day. No, trainers and owners will tell you,
there is something more to Jerry Bailey than just talent and luck,
even though they can't quite put it into words.
</P>
<P>
   Take the 1993 Breeders' Cup Classic. Just two weeks before the
big race, Bailey picked up a horse called Arcangues. He walked into
the paddock without having met the trainer, then patiently listened
to instructions given in French by two assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand a word,'' Bailey recalled. But he did
understand the tote board, which listed the horse's odds _ 133-1 _
and that was all Bailey needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   So he mounted Arcangues, guided the horse through traffic to the
inside and hugged the rail all the way to the biggest long-shot
victory in Breeders' Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can consciously ride like Jerry does. You
just have to have a sixth sense,'' said trainer Carl Nafzger, who
has known Bailey since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works at it,'' said trainer Bill Mott, one of Bailey's
closest friends. ``He trains like every other professional athlete.
He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. And he studies the game.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Jerry. What's your secret? And his answer shoots out of the
gate ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Just fast horses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd like to think I helped on a couple of them,'' he
allows, ``but a lot of time it's just the fact that you don't make
a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother going to the whip to coax Bailey to say something
good about himself.
</P>
<P>
   `THE NO. 1 JOCKEY'
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while guiding his son Justin, who turns 7 this month,
through the tunnels at Yankee Stadium before Game 3 of the World
Series, fans were saying, ``There's the No. 1 jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's wife, Suzee, mentioned it to Jerry, who replied, ``Oh,
nobody knows who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner does. (Bailey has ridden horses owned by the
Yankees owner.) So does Don Zimmer. (Bailey plans to golf this
month with the Yankees coach.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. Jerry Bailey is a Yankees fan. But the son of a New
Mexico dentist grew up with dreams of another dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a Green Bay Packer,'' he said. ``Bart Starr was
my idol.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey was a skinny little kid who grew to a whopping 112
pounds. His interest turned to horses when his father started
buying claiming horses to run at Sunland Park, not far from the
family's home. Bailey said he was 6 when he had his first mount _ a
pony, in the family's back yard.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 17 and a senior at El Paso's Coronado High
School, he was riding thoroughbreds at Sunland and Ruidoso Downs in
New Mexico. He ran his first race in November 1974 on Fetch. Bailey
won.
</P>
<P>
   He worked tracks in Arkansas, New Jersey and Florida, gradually
getting noticed that by 1982 he moved to New York to be closer to
Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the early 1990s that Bailey underwent a series
of changes that helped shape his life personally and
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, he was like a lot of 18- and 20-year-olds,'' Mott
said. ``He did like to party. These guys go from making no money to
making a lot of money at a young age. But Jerry realized he
couldn't keep this up if he was going to be real successful.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bailey tells it, he simply matured. And he credits that
maturity with his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Suzee Chulik, an aspiring model and actress, was a reporter for
SportsChannel assigned to do a story on show horses. She didn't
know who Jerry Bailey was when she approached him for an interview
in Hialeah.
</P>
<P>
   Two follow-up interviews later, Bailey asked her out. They were
married in December 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big thing,'' Bailey said. ``I was pretty wild and
running early in my career. When I settled down personally, then my
business side came into focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Other obstacles were waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey life can be grueling. It's a year-round sport with a
nomadic existence pressurized by high stakes and wicked
competition. The battle with weight control is fought with
laxatives and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some turn to narcotics and alcohol for relief. Bailey wasn't a
party drinker, but he drank enough at home that friends noticed and
pressed him into seeking help.
</P>
<P>
   He quit drinking on Jan. 1, 1989. After that, Bailey said, his
focus improved even more. ``Not only in my performances from gate
to wire but also the whole attitude with the people you deal with
day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   `LIKE OZZIE AND HARRIET'
</P>
<P>
   The change was almost immediate. In 1991, he rode Black Tie
Affair to his first Breeders' Cup Classic victory. Bailey was 34,
and it marked his breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   He and Suzee then focused their energies on another goal, and
with help from a Florida fertility specialist, Suzee became
pregnant with their son.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Baileys have homes in Florida and New York. It is
common to see Jerry finish at the wire, then scramble to get back
to New York in time for Justin's soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of like Ozzie and Harriet,'' Suzee Bailey said.
``He really tries to be the normal dad, even though he doesn't lead
the normal life.'' But even in his Pollyanna personal world, Bailey
is all business, so focused he never really leaves the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're driving with him in the car, it's hilarious,''
Suzee says. ``He sees things other people don't notice. He knows
the quickest way to the track. I'll be, `Hey, Jerry, I think I
found a faster route.' He'll say, `Been there.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bailey's future, it has been suggested he would make a
fine racing official, just as he has been an exemplary president of
the Jockeys Guild. But Bailey's sights are set only on Saturday's
Classic, at the wire, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's 42,'' said former jockey Anthony Schweiker, a friend.
``But he's got a lot more years left.''

ORGANIZATION FOR BLIND FILES SUIT AGAINST AMERICA ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (lh) 
 By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arguing that virtual spaces must be as accessible to people with
disabilities as are physical spaces, a major organization
representing the blind filed suit against America Online Thursday,
saying the online service is almost impossible for blind people to
use.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which accuses AOL of violating the Americans With
Disabilities Act, was filed in U.S. District Court in Boston by the
National Federation of the Blind, the organization's Massachusetts
chapter and nine people who are blind.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to increase access to the Internet as
information, commerce, education and other vital services move into
cyberspace, Marc Maurer, the president of the federation, said in a
telephone interview. The nonprofit group, based in Baltimore, has
50,000 members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a way for everybody to be able to use this
growing body of digital information,'' Maurer said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that America Online's services are often
incompatible with screen access programs that convert text into
synthesized speech or Braille and are heavily used by the blind.
The graphics and icons that are the pathways to information on AOL
have no text that can be read by such software.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you get is, `This is a graphic, 938 pixels,''' said Daniel
F. Goldstein, one of the lawyers for the federation.
</P>
<P>
   Including text descriptors that the software could interpret
would be neither technically difficult nor expensive, Goldstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, the suit says, is that America Online's screen
commands can often be activated only through clicks with a mouse,
not with the keyboard commands commonly used by blind people.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer said he had received ``hundreds of complaints'' from
members of his organization about problems with America Online,
which, with more than 19 million subscribers, is the world's
largest Internet service provider. The organization has complained
to the company, he said, but received little response.
</P>
<P>
   Rich D'Amato, a spokesman for America Online, said the company
had been working to improve access to the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry that the NFB has filed the lawsuit, because we are
absolutely committed to working with groups representing people
with disabilities,'' D'Amato said. The company has not yet decided
how it will respond to the lawsuit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said America Online was already planning changes that
would address some of the federation's concerns, including adding
support for text-reading products and offering more ways to use the
keyboard instead of a mouse. ``Making AOL more accessible is a
major priority'' for the company's software developers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit argues that America Online qualifies as a ``public
accommodation'' under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990
because it offers entertainment, sales, recreation, education and
other features. The law requires businesses and other organizations
to make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said he was unaware of any court cases regarding the
Internet and access under the act.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia D. Waddell, disability access coordinator for the city
of San Jose, Calif., who monitors legal developments in the
disability field, said there had been several disputes over
Internet access for disabled people that did not result in legal
action, and others in which suits were filed but, as far as she was
aware, were settled out of court.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Jan. 6, 1987, when The New York Times printed my
first column, the headline I had written was: ``Please Read This
Column!'' It was not just one journalist's message of the day, but
every writer's prayer _ come know me.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I wanted to use it again. But I was smitten by
seizures of modesty and decided twice might be a bit showy. Now I
have the personal and journalistic excuse to set it down one more
time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the last column I will write for The Times and my last
working day on the paper. I have no intention of stopping writing,
journalistically or otherwise. And I am buoyed by the knowledge
that I will be starting over.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, who could work his entire journalistic career _ so far _
for one paper and not leave with sadnesses, particularly when the
paper is The Times? Our beloved, proud New York Times _ ours, not
mine or theirs, or yours, but ours, created by the talents and
endeavor of its staff, the faithfulness of the publishing family
and, as much as anything else, by the ethics and standards of its
readers and their hunger for ever more information, of a range
without limit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arrive in a foreign capital for the first time, call a
government minister and give just your name. Ensues iciness. But
add ``of The New York Times,'' and you expect to be invited right
over and usually are; nice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proud New York Times'' _ sounds arrogant and is a little,
why not? But the pride is individual as well as institutional. For
members of the staff, news and business, the pride is in being
important to the world's best paper _ you hear? _ and being able to
stretch its creative reach. And there is pride knowing that even if
we are not always honest enough with ourselves to achieve fairness,
that is what we promise the readers, and the standard to which they
must hold us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I used to tell new reporters: The Times is far more flexible in
writing styles than you might think, so don't button up your vest
and go all stiff on us. But when it comes to the foundation _
fairness _ don't fool around with it, or we will come down on you.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Journalists often have to hurt people, just by reporting the
facts. But they do not have to cause unnecessary cruelty, to run
their rings across anybody's face for the pleasure of it _ and that
goes for critics, too.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you finish a story, I would say, read it, substitute your
name for the subject's. If you say, well, it would make me
miserable, make my wife cry, but it has no innuendo, no
unattributed pejorative remarks, no slap in the face for joy of
slapping, it is news, not gutter gossip, and as a reporter I know
the writer was fair, then give it to the copy desk. If not, try
again _ we don't want to be your cop.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I have a nightmare that on a certain Wednesday _ why
Wednesday I don't know _ The Times disappeared forever. I wake
trembling; I know this paper could never be recreated. I will never
tremble for the loss of any publication that has no enforced ethic
of fairness.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting fresh _ the idea frightened me. Then I realized I was
not going alone. I would take my brain and decades of newspapering
with me. And I understood many of us had done that on the paper _
moving from one career to another.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   First I was a stringer from City College, my most important
career move. It got me inside a real paper and paid real money.
Twelve dollars a week, at a time when City's free tuition was more
than I could afford.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My second career was as a reporter in New York, with a police
press pass, which cops were forever telling me to shove in my ear.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I got a two-week assignment at the brand-new United Nations, and
stayed eight years, until I got what I lusted for _ a foreign
post. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I served The Times in Communist Poland, for the first time
encountering the suffocating intellectual blanket that is
Communism's great weapon. In due time I was thrown out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But mostly it was Asia. The four years in India excited me then
and forever. Rosenthal, King of the Khyber Pass!  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After nine years as a foreign correspondent, somebody decided I
was too happy in Tokyo and nagged me into going home to be an
editor. At first I did not like it, but I came to enjoy editing _
once I became the top editor. Rosenthal, King of the Hill! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped down from that job, I started all over again as a
Times Op-Ed columnist, paid to express my own opinions. If I had
done that as a reporter or editor dealing with the news, I would
have broken readers' trust that the news would be written and
played straight.
</P>
<P>
   Straight does not mean dull. It means straight. If you don't
know what that means, you don't belong on this paper. Clear?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a columnist, I discovered that there were passions in me I
had not been aware of, lying under the smatterings of knowledge
about everything that I had to collect as executive editor _
including hockey and debentures, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the passions had to do with human rights, violations of _
like African women having their genitals mutilated to keep them
virgin, and Chinese and Tibetan political prisoners screaming their
throats raw.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote, with anger, at drug legitimizers and rationalizers,
helping make criminals and destroying young minds, all the while
with nauseating sanctimony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a correspondent, it was the Arab states, not Israel, that I
wanted to cover. But they did not welcome resident Jewish
correspondents. As a columnist, I felt fear for the whittling away
of Israeli strength by the Israelis, and still do.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wrote about the persecution of Christians in China. When
people, in astonishment, asked why, I replied, in astonishment,
because it is happening, because the world, including American and
European Christians and Jews, pays almost no attention, and that
plain disgusts me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lassitude about Chinese Communist brutalities is part of the
most nasty American reality of this past half-century. Never before
have the U.S. government, business and public been willing, eager
really, to praise and enrich tyranny, to crawl before it, to
endanger our martial technology _ and all for the hope (vain) of
trade profit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America is going through plump times. But economic strength is
making us weaker in head and soul. We accept back without penalty a
president who demeaned himself and us. We rain money on a Politburo
that must rule by terror lest it lose its collective head.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I cannot promise to change all that. But I can say that I will
keep trying and that I thank God for (a) making me an American
citizen, (b) giving me that college-boy job on The Times, and (c)
handing me the opportunity to make other columnists kick themselves
when they see what I am writing, in this fresh start of my life.

 &HT;    U2 singer lobbies to relieve debt of Third World countries
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The gaggle of 20-somethings stood nervously outside
the door to Sen. Paul Coverdell's office in the ornate Russell
Office Building. One combed her hair smooth behind her ear and
another straightened out his tie.
</P>
<P>
   Would he come out, they wondered. Would he allow them to take a
photograph posing with them?
</P>
<P>
   The ``he'' was someone you would not expect to find in
Coverdell's office _ Bono, the lead singer of the Irish rock group
U2.
</P>
<P>
   Bono, who goes by only one name, came to Capitol Hill to lobby
members of both parties to relieve the $1.6 billion debt Third
World countries owe the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bono wanted to talk to Coverdell because of his work on the
International Relations Committee and his job as secretary of the
Senate Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to achieve some kind of bipartisan support to help
the poorest of the poor,'' said Bono, cutting quite a figure in all
black against the tweeds and pinstripes of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bono is part of an international coalition called Jubilee 2000
that is trying to convince countries such as the United States to
eliminate the spiraling debt of Third World countries so that they
can focus on spending money on education, schools and roads.
</P>
<P>
   Bono, who was escorted around Capitol Hill by House Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio), said that many countries
in the sub-Saharan African region have no hope of paying back their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, countries are spending half of their budgets on
debt service, meaning less money for building hospitals, schools
and sanitation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell did not know of Bono's rock star status. But as
director of the Peace Corps under President Bush, Coverdell knows
first-hand the state of less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bono ``was extremely knowledgeable about this project and
committed to efforts aimed at providing relief to some of the
world's neediest countries,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he thought that Congress should review prospects
for forgiving debt ``in a way that holds governments accountable
while strengthening the conditions on foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Barr blasted debt relief legislation approved by the House
Banking and Financial Services Committee late Thursday night that
would move toward forgiving the foreign debt Bono is so concerned
about.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three dozen foreign countries owe the U.S. government a
total of $1.6 billion and Barr thinks they ought to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is now moving to squander federal tax dollars on a
gargantuan gift to foreign countries,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American should be outraged to see the taxes they work
so hard to pay being used to subsidize the wasteful economic habits
of other nations,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of engaging in ``this ridiculous charade'' of making
loans and then forgiving them, Barr said the loans ought to be
called what they are: ``huge gifts of American tax dollars to
foreign nations.''

EXPERTS DOUBT RADAR PROJECTION OF FLIGHT 990'S FINAL MOMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Taking advantage of a break in the weather,
high-tech search and recovery ships sailed for the waters off
Nantucket Thursday night, where recording devices that may unlock
mysteries of EgyptAir Flight 990's final moments lay 270 feet
beneath cold, storm-tossed seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My number one concern here . . . is the safety of these young
men and women who are going to be out on scene conducting this
incredibly dangerous event,'' said Navy Rear Adm. William G.
Sutton. ``We do not want to increase this tragedy any more than it
already is.''
</P>
<P>
   The USS Grapple, carrying skilled Navy divers, and the USNS
Mohawk, an ocean-going tug outfitted with advanced sonar equipment,
weighed anchor, to be joined by the NOAA Whiting which set sail a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, pored over maintenance logs and
rechecked radar records, still struggling to isolate factors that
doomed the Boeing 767-300ER jetliner and its 217 passengers 30
minutes after the Cairo-bound flight left New York.
</P>
<P>
   As mourners comforted each other with ancient words from
scripture, aeronautics specialists questioned Digital Age data that
showed the Boeing 767 jetliners plunged precipitously, then climbed
for more than a mile before falling again and shattering in the
Atlantic Ocean early Halloween morning.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of Flight 990's wild final minute has left seasoned
aviation investigators in disbelief and pilots who fly the aircraft
speechless, and government officials wondering if they put too much
faith in Air Force data that was preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I believe that data,'' one high-ranking federal
investigator said Thursday. ``Those kind of (gravity) forces on
that plane could pull the tail off.''
</P>
<P>
   One official said those records are better used to project a
flight path than to accurately track it.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial airline pilot who flies the 767 said, ``I cannot
think of any one mechanical failure that would lead to that type of
dive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the plane plunged from 33,000 feet to 16,700 feet in 40
seconds, its transponder _ on-board equipment that provides flight
information and identification to air-traffic control radar _
stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   Using Air Force radar from two different sites, an NTSB
preliminary analysis showed that the plane then climbed to 24,000
before diving yet again and breaking up before smashing into the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the plane was in that extreme dive and the crew got
control of the aircraft and was pulling back on the yoke to reverse
the descent, it would over-g the aircraft causing it to come
apart,'' said the pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics at MIT, said the
apparent climb at the time of the loss of the transponder signal
may be more than a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   If the plane was diving from some sort of errant command from a
flight control system failure, Hansman said, once the transponder
went out _ a sign that power throughout the airplane had failed _
it is possible that the command stopped, too. If that is the case,
the plane would naturally begin to climb.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple arrived here Tuesday from its home port at the
Little Creek Amphibious Base in Norfolk, Va., and swiftly began
began loading equipment and a Deep Drone Remotely-Operated Vehicle
_ essentially an underwater robot. But the ship had remained in
port at the Newport Naval Complex since then, idled by a storm and
20-foot swells on the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple provided similar assistance to the NTSB for the
recovery victims and wreckage from the TWA Flight 800 crash off the
coast of Long Island in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forecast throughout the week had been very bad but we had
a window of opportunity since the waves subsided a lot,'' said
David Sanders, a Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Grapple was accompanied out to sea Thursday by the Mohawk, a
US Maritime Service merchant marine vessel which carries equipment
that can detect and differentiate between natural and manmade
objects.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mohawk which pinpointed the location of the black
boxes on Tuesday, roughly in the middle of the aircraft's
ocean-floor debris field.
</P>
<P>
   The ships were expected to travel most of the night to reach the
area, said Navy officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the FBI was reviewing reports from a Newport
lobsterman who reportedly said he heard two thunderous roars, then
the sounds of aluminum crashing to the sea and ripping apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the plane blew up at 33,000 feet, I didn't hear it,''
Christopher D. Lutyens, captain of the Hedy Brenna, told the New
York Times. ``But I don't think that's what happened. I think it
hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials would not comment
on the Hedy Brenna's role in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Grapple set sail, crew members tested the remote
control vehicle officials are hoping will retrieve the aircraft's
so-called black boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's flight data recorder monitors dozens of the plane's
flight and performance. Its cockpit voice recorder captures all
communication on the flight deck. Authorities said signals from
both have been detected in water up to 270 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, a spokesman said most of the of the 33 Egyptian
military officers on the plane were in the United States to train
or to meet US defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said nothing about the
officers suggests they were targets of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   And at a briefing here late Thursday, officials said the plane
carried no hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities try to piece together what destroyed the
airplane, the medical examiner's office here took tentative steps
toward identifying remains already retrieved. Relatives are
supplying dental records and other information that could help
identify loved ones, such as birth marks or recognizable jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen family members of crash victims attended a
memorial service in Cranston Thursday morning at St. Mary and St.
Mena Coptic Christian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Father Marcos Girgis asked God to grant eternal peace to their
loved ones, to ``sustain them in a green pasture, by the water of
rest, in the paradise of joy, the place from which grief, sorrow
and groaning have fled away in the light of your saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, religious leaders of all faiths announced Thursday an
interfaith memorial service for families to be held Sunday.
Officials have not decided where the service will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goodbye. It's a hello for new life,'' said the Rev. H.
Daehler Hayes, conference minister for the Rhode Island Conference
of the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Although many relatives of crash victims have said they'll stay
in Newport as long as they have to, some are making plans to leave
after the memorial services, said Nihad Awad, executive director of
the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Many families came to Newport with unrealistic expectations
about the speed of the recovery and the conditions of the plane,
said Awad, who is serving as a counselor for Islamic families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that the whole plane just went in one piece in the
water,'' he said. ``Many believed the bodies would have their
clothes on.''

SUIT SEEKS INTERNET ACCESS FOR THE BLIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nine blind citizens of Massachusetts went to court
Thursday against America Online Inc. (AOL), in a lawsuit that could
force the redesign of thousands of Internet sites. The citizens
joined with the National Federation for the Blind to argue that
federal law requires that AOL design its Internet service so that
blind people can use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind people have the same rights as everybody else to take
part in the information age,'' said federation president Marc
Maurer at a press conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If the suit is successful, AOL would be forced to make its
software compatible with a variety of computer products that let
blind people ``read'' a computer screen. In addition, Maurer hopes
the suit will force similar changes at every Internet retailer,
from the smallest electronic storefront to the largest on-line
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The case against AOL, filed in US District Court in Boston,
rests on the federation's reading of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, a law passed in 1990 that aims to give disabled
people access to equal opportunities in employment and public
services.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the law requires ``public accommodations,'' such as
businesses, to make reasonable efforts to make their services
available to disabled people. The federation hopes to convince a
court that AOL and other Internet-based businesses are public
accommodations under the law, and must be made accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are legal precedents concerning the need for
businesses to make facilities and services available to people with
a variety of handicaps, lawyers for the federation said they knew
of no case involving the Internet ever going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato refused to discuss details of the
lawsuit, but said AOL is committed to working with disabled people
to make their software easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team of people that are working on these issues and
it's a top priority for us,'' D'Amato said. He added that the next
version of AOL software, due for release next year will be
compatible with screen reading software for blind people.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about access to the Internet are understandable, given
its burgeoning importance to the economy and society. Forty percent
of all Americans communicate via the Internet, according to Neilsen
NetRatings. Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., predicts
Americans will spend $20 billion at on-line retail stores this
year, and $184 billion five years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Isaacson, executive director of the Association for
Interactive Media, a trade group that represents 400 Internet firms
including AOL, Disney and Yahoo, is worried that the lawsuit could
lead to government interference with business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web sites shouldn't have to comply with any government
regulatory interest but should be doing self-regulatory programs,''
said Isaacson. He said his organization has no plans to become
involved in the case, but added that he would be willing to contact
members and urge them to do more to accomodate disabled Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry will do anything,'' Isaacson said. ``They will
bend over backward for additional market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer, the federation president, said blind Americans must not
be shut out. ``I'm determined that we will have access,'' he said.
``We insist on access to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goldberg, director of the National Center for Accessible
Media, based at public television station WGBH in Boston, said his
group has recently begun working with AOL to make the Internet
company's software accessible to blind people. ``AOL approached us
four to six months ago, and having recognized that they had a
problem, asked if we could help them,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hitchcock, who designs software for disabled people at the
Center for Applied Special Technology in Peabody, Mass., expressed
doubt that a court would stretch the disabilities act to include
the Internet. ``I hope they do,'' he said, ``but I'd be quite
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard law professor Elizabeth Bartholet said, ``it makes
some sense in that the ADA is an extraordinarly broad act.''
Bartholet said the law specifically requires telephone companies to
provide services for disabled people; applying it to the Internet
may simply be the next logical step. ``It's not a frivolous
issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the world's largest Internet service provider with 20
million users. The service prides itself on its custom-made
software which many people find much easier to use than other kinds
of Internet software. The AOL software also gives its customers
access to a variety of services not available on the rest of the
Internet, including discussion groups, chat rooms and on-line
shopping areas.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's software lacks features that would make it possible
for blind or visually-impaired people to use the service with
screen reader software that can read pages aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Screen-reader programs are compatible with many computer
programs, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and
Apple Computer Corp.'s Macintosh operating system. The standard
Internet browsers from Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp.,
now owned by AOL, also work with screen readers.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL software also forces people to use a mouse to go from
feature to feature on the screen. Blind people generally can't use
computer mice and must rely on the keyboard. Many programs make it
possible to use the keyboard instead of the mouse to maneuver
through the program. But many features of the AOL software can only
be activated with the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   AOL isn't the only company with problems. Larry Goldberg said
that only ``a small handful'' of the Internet's major sites are
accessible to blind people, even though solutions to the problem
are well understood. The World Wide Web Consortium in Cambridge,
the organization that sets standards for Web site design worldwide,
has created guidelines for Web site designers to help them make
their sites accessible to blind people. But most Web sites simply
ignore these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's problem is more complicated, because its software is not
based on Internet standards. AOL uses a custom-made program that
relies on the use of graphic images that are meaningless to screen
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Rose, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, is a student
at Bristol Community College. She said she wanted to use AOL as an
aid to her studies, but only got as far as the opening screen. ``I
got that far and the screen reader stopped reading,'' Rose said.
``So I gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Jeraldi says she wanted to use AOL's chat rooms to stay
in touch with her grandchildren. ``But I was told by other blind
people. . .not to even bother with it because it was so
inaccessible to the blind.'' Both Rose and Jeraldi have signed on
to other Internet services.

SUIT SEEKS INTERNET ACCESS FOR THE BLIND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Nine blind citizens of Massachusetts went to court
Thursday against America Online Inc. (AOL), in a lawsuit that could
force the redesign of thousands of Internet sites. The citizens
joined with the National Federation for the Blind to argue that
federal law requires that AOL design its Internet service so that
blind people can use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind people have the same rights as everybody else to take
part in the information age,'' said federation president Marc
Maurer at a press conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   If the suit is successful, AOL would be forced to make its
software compatible with a variety of computer products that let
blind people ``read'' a computer screen. In addition, Maurer hopes
the suit will force similar changes at every Internet retailer,
from the smallest electronic storefront to the largest on-line
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The case against AOL, filed in US District Court in Boston,
rests on the federation's reading of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, a law passed in 1990 that aims to give disabled
people access to equal opportunities in employment and public
services.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the law requires ``public accommodations,'' such as
businesses, to make reasonable efforts to make their services
available to disabled people. The federation hopes to convince a
court that AOL and other Internet-based businesses are public
accommodations under the law, and must be made accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are legal precedents concerning the need for
businesses to make facilities and services available to people with
a variety of handicaps, lawyers for the federation said they knew
of no case involving the Internet ever going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato refused to discuss details of the
lawsuit, but said AOL is committed to working with disabled people
to make their software easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a team of people that are working on these issues and
it's a top priority for us,'' D'Amato said. He added that the next
version of AOL software, due for release next year will be
compatible with screen reading software for blind people.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about access to the Internet are understandable, given
its burgeoning importance to the economy and society. Forty percent
of all Americans communicate via the Internet, according to Neilsen
NetRatings. Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., predicts
Americans will spend $20 billion at on-line retail stores this
year, and $184 billion five years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Isaacson, executive director of the Association for
Interactive Media, a trade group that represents 400 Internet firms
including AOL, Disney and Yahoo, is worried that the lawsuit could
lead to government interference with business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web sites shouldn't have to comply with any government
regulatory interest but should be doing self-regulatory programs,''
said Isaacson. He said his organization has no plans to become
involved in the case, but added that he would be willing to contact
members and urge them to do more to accomodate disabled Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry will do anything,'' Isaacson said. ``They will
bend over backward for additional market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer, the federation president, said blind Americans must not
be shut out. ``I'm determined that we will have access,'' he said.
``We insist on access to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goldberg, director of the National Center for Accessible
Media, based at public television station WGBH in Boston, said his
group has recently begun working with AOL to make the Internet
company's software accessible to blind people. ``AOL approached us
four to six months ago, and having recognized that they had a
problem, asked if we could help them,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hitchcock, who designs software for disabled people at the
Center for Applied Special Technology in Peabody, Mass., expressed
doubt that a court would stretch the disabilities act to include
the Internet. ``I hope they do,'' he said, ``but I'd be quite
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard law professor Elizabeth Bartholet said, ``it makes
some sense in that the ADA is an extraordinarly broad act.''
Bartholet said the law specifically requires telephone companies to
provide services for disabled people; applying it to the Internet
may simply be the next logical step. ``It's not a frivolous
issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the world's largest Internet service provider with 20
million users. The service prides itself on its custom-made
software which many people find much easier to use than other kinds
of Internet software. The AOL software also gives its customers
access to a variety of services not available on the rest of the
Internet, including discussion groups, chat rooms and on-line
shopping areas.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL's software lacks features that would make it possible
for blind or visually-impaired people to use the service with
screen reader software that can read pages aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Screen-reader programs are compatible with many computer
programs, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and
Apple Computer Corp.'s Macintosh operating system. The standard
Internet browsers from Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp.,
now owned by AOL, also work with screen readers.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL software also forces people to use a mouse to go from
feature to feature on the screen. Blind people generally can't use
computer mice and must rely on the keyboard. Many programs make it
possible to use the keyboard instead of the mouse to maneuver
through the program. But many features of the AOL software can only
be activated with the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   AOL isn't the only company with problems. Larry Goldberg said
that only ``a small handful'' of the Internet's major sites are
accessible to blind people, even though solutions to the problem
are well understood. The World Wide Web Consortium in Cambridge,
the organization that sets standards for Web site design worldwide,
has created guidelines for Web site designers to help them make
their sites accessible to blind people. But most Web sites simply
ignore these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's problem is more complicated, because its software is not
based on Internet standards. AOL uses a custom-made program that
relies on the use of graphic images that are meaningless to screen
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Rose, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, is a student
at Bristol Community College. She said she wanted to use AOL as an
aid to her studies, but only got as far as the opening screen. ``I
got that far and the screen reader stopped reading,'' Rose said.
``So I gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Jeraldi says she wanted to use AOL's chat rooms to stay
in touch with her grandchildren. ``But I was told by other blind
people. . .not to even bother with it because it was so
inaccessible to the blind.'' Both Rose and Jeraldi have signed on
to other Internet services.

 &HT;    Efforts to snuff out smoking hit plateau
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Success in persuading Americans not to smoke has
stalled, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to national surveys, there were as many adult smokers
in 1997 as there were in 1990. A rise in smoking among young adults
is partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the CDC said, the percentage of college-age
Americans (18- to 24-year-olds) who smoke matches the percent of
adult (age 25 to 44) smokers. Previously, older smokers have always
outnumbered younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 48 million Americans age 18 and older still smoke,
though one-third of them quit for at least one day last year, the
health agency said. Their smoking contributes to almost 430,000
deaths each year from cancer, heart disease and other ailments _
one out of every five deaths in the United States, the CDC added.
</P>
<P>
   The figures published Thursday are the latest examples of two
trends that public health experts find discouraging:
</P>
<P>
   _ While reducing tobacco use is considered one of the great
public health successes of the century, the percentage of adults
who abstain has hit a plateau. Tobacco use declined steadily from
1964, when the first Surgeon General's Report on smoking linked
cigarettes to lung and laryngeal cancer, to 1990. But from 1990 to
1997, the percentage of American adults who smoke remained the
same, roughly 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ As adult use of tobacco has leveled off, the percentage of
young people smoking, dipping or chewing has increased every year
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Among 12th-grade high school students, about 40 percent of
whites, 25 percent of Latinos and 15 percent of African-Americans
smoked at least once in the 30 days before they were surveyed, the
CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco control is one of the success stories of the 20th
century,'' said Dr. Michael Eriksen, director of the CDC's Office
on Smoking and Health. ``The year before the first Surgeon
General's Report, 42 percent of adults smoked, and that has been
nearly cut in half. Literally millions of lives have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the 1990s will be looked back on a time of
failure,'' he added. ``We have made absolutely no progress in
adults, and rates among teens have increased during that time
period as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC also found sharp differences in race and economic class
among adult smokers:
</P>
<P>
   _ On average, one out of every three Americans living below the
poverty line smokes, compared with one in four above it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Americans who have not graduated from high school are three
times more likely to smoke than those who completed college.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among men, smoking is most common among Native Americans and
least common among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences point to long-lasting problems in public
health. Out of every 100,000 Americans, 80 black men and 53 white
men die from smoking-related cancers, and 53 black men and 26 white
men die from smoking-related strokes.

RETAIL SALES FIGURES HINT AT HOLIDAY-SEASON SLOWDOWN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six months of robust increases, the growth in retail sales
eased in October, indicating a potential slowdown in consumer
buying as the all-important holiday shopping season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in stores open at least year, a key comparison in the
industry, rose 4.1 percent last month, according to the Goldman,
Sachs retail composite index. That was the smallest increase in six
months, leading many analysts and economists to predict a possible
drop-off in consumer buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are probably beginning a deceleration in real
consumer spending growth,'' said George Strachan, a retail analyst
at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The slackening of retail sales growth took on added significance
because it came amid other signs of economic softening. Consumer
confidence has weakened slightly over the last four months as
interest rates have risen and real-wage growth has declined. In
addition, car sales fell at the Big Three automakers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone saw cause for worry in the retail data. ``These
numbers are very diverse,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at
Lehman Brothers. ``I don't believe we have enough points of
reference to validate whether the consumer spending is slowing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it is real and sustained, the slowdown in consumer
enthusiasm could affect holiday sales, the most important season
for retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth quarter in terms of consumer spending growth is
probably going to be the slowest one in two years,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. Looking at the overall
economic picture, he added: ``But it should be kept in perspective.
It is still growing 3 percent. That's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants not at the top of their game will feel the effect
pretty quickly if consumers cut back, making it harder to rack up
sales growth numbers, Steinberg said. ``It is going to be harder to
do great, going forward,'' he said. ``The best in the class are
going to do fine, the guys who are trailing nowhere are going to be
creamed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the gap between the performance of discount retailers
and speciality stores on one hand and department stores on the
other, which had narrowed during months of overall stellar growth,
re-emerged with a vengeance in October. While the discounters' and
specialty retailers' sales expanded 5.5 percent, department store
sales grew an anemic 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores, the stalwart that is the world's largest
merchant, led the discounters with a sales rise of 6.2 percent.
Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., had an increase of 5.4
percent. And Costco, a discount price membership club, logged
another month of impressive increases, with sales rising 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty retailers, The Limited Inc., whose sales
across its divisions grew 8 percent from a year ago, and Ann
Taylor, whose sales rose 11.2 percent, both seem to be cementing
comebacks as shoppers' favorites for quick fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to the good news in this category came from Gap
Inc., which has been sagging under the weight of its lackluster Gap
stores division. Sales at Gap rose 1 percent while sales at the Gap
stores division, which account for roughly 50 percent of the
company's revenue, declined 4 percent to 7 percent from last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Because Robert Fisher, the president of the Gap division,
stepped down last week, signaling a shake-up, stock analysts were
less worried about that news than the fact that sales grew only 4
percent to 7 percent at Old Navy, the division that offers
less-expensive merchandise. Previously, Old Navy had been
experiencing double-digit expansion, which had helped lift Gap
shares over the year. ``Everyone is looking at Old Navy and
wondering is that the beginning of something,'' said John Morris, a
retail analyst at Gerard Klauer &AMP; Mattison.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores had weak numbers. Despite the strong
performance of Target, Dayton Hudson reported growth of only 2.9
percent because its other divisions had unexpectedly big declines
in sales. Sales at Dayton Hudson stores dropped 1.4 percent and the
bottom fell out at Mervyn's, with sales dropping 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Eich, director of public relations at Dayton Hudson,
attributed the numbers to unusually warm weather in the West that
caused consumers to postpone buying sweaters and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney also continued a run of disappointing sales,
declining 5.7 percent, but the embattled retailer was not blaming
the temperature. ``We are going through a lot of changes trying to
find the right mix for us,'' said Duncan Muir, a spokesman. ``We
are not blaming it all on weather. We know we have other
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. had a surprisingly good month,
with sales increasing 4.7 percent, a couple of points above
analysts' expectations. The company credited strong interest in
kitchen and home appliances.

HEATING BILLS COULD RISE 50 PERCENT IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New England households face increases of as much as 50
percent in their heating oil bills during the coming winter,
according to federal government forecasts released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders, who pay more for heat than any region of the
country, got a reprieve from high energy costs last year due to
plunging global energy prices and unseasonably mild weather, which
combined to drive down heating bills.
</P>
<P>
   But oil prices have risen sharply this year amid economic
recovery in Asia and a cutback in production by oil-producing
nations. Energy experts also said it is unlikely that the region
will benefit from another mild winter this year, with the result
that oil consumption could increase substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in the winter of 1998-99 ``were blessed with
relatively low heating costs,'' said David Costello, economist for
Energy Information Administration, an agency within US Department
of Energy. ``Some consumers may very well be a little surprised at
the relative change'' this winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agency forecasts, New England residents who use
oil to heat their homes can expect about a 50 percent jump in their
bills if there are sustained colder temperatures. A jump in oil
prices could also prompt increases in natural gas prices of as much
as 20 percent, according to the forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2.5 million households in Massachusetts, approximately 1
million have oil heating systems.
</P>
<P>
   On average, New Englanders pay $707 a year to heat their homes.
By contrast, residents of the eastern central states, the region
with the second highest home heating costs, pay $562 a year. The
national average is $425 annually.
</P>
<P>
   For those who use home heating oil, prices last year were at
their lowest levels in a decade, and experts noted that a rise in
oil costs would actually represent a return to prices that had been
in effect for the most the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy prices are high but they're just back to normal,'' said
Roy Willis, president of the Propane Education and Research Council
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If New England experiences a cold winter, heating oil prices are
expected to rise to about $1.20 a gallon, from 80 cents last year,
a 50 percent increase, according to the Energy Information
Administration's forecast. The agency said if the region has a mild
winter oil prices would rise to about 98 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Connor, spokesman for Citizens Energy, a non-profit
organization that sells low-cost heating oil to the poor, said the
poor and elderly on fixed incomes, who devote a much higher
percentage of their incomes to heatings costs, are extremely
vulnerable to this year's spike in heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   A person on a fixed income of about $1,000 a month would use
1/12th of that income, or about $83, for heat, he said. To keep
costs down, ``There are households where people seal off rooms
because they can't afford to heat them,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The government predicted heating bills for natural gas are
expected to rise between 15 percent and 20 percent. About 8 percent
is attributed to increases in natural gas prices since last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year natural gas prices were relatively low due to a
combination of mild weather and excess supply. This year natural
gas prices for New Englanders are forecast to jump from about $8.18
per thousand cubic feet to about $8.83 this winter. New Englanders
pay nearly two dollars more per cubic foot of natural gas than does
the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts natural gas distributors disagreed with the
government's forecasts, saying customers' bills won't rise.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth Gas said the unit price for gas to customers for
natural gas is virtually flat compared with last year's prices.
ComGas, however, did not provide forecast of how colder weather
could impact demand, a factor that government officials said could
drive heating costs much higher this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather is everything,'' the government's Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   The prices consumers pay to heat their homes depend on a range
of factors, from the terms of gas-purchase contracts held by
utilities to state regulations. Mike Connors, spokesman for Boston
Gas, said a merger of the utility with Essex Gas and Commonwealth
Gas has led to renegotiations of gas-buying contracts that have
reduced customers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   The typical residential bill for a Boston gas customer will be
4.7 percent below last year, he said. ``We've set the rates for the
winter. Those rates aren't going to change,'' he said.

APPEALS COURT FOCUSES ON TRANSCRIPT BATTLE IN JASPER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Three appeals court judges are considering
whether a CBS television producer should be sent to jail if she
refuses to turn over a transcript of a Dan Rather interview of a
white man accused of the dragging death of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said defendant Shawn Berry, 24, told a different
story about the June 7, 1998, slaying of James Byrd Jr. when
interviewed for ``60 Minutes II'' than he did in seven written
statements given to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers argued the transcript issue Thursday before the
9th Court of Appeals in Beaumont, other lawyers in Jasper were
picking the last of 50 prospective jurors in Berry's capital murder
trial. The pool includes 11 blacks. Lawyers are expected to pick
the final 12 jurors and two alternates Friday. Testimony is set to
begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden has twice ordered producer
Mary Mapes to jail unless she gives up either a transcript of the
almost three-hour interview or tapes of parts of the interview that
were not aired. Only about 18 minutes of the interview were
broadcast, prosecutors said, and much of that was Rather
paraphrasing Berry's story.
</P>
<P>
   Mapes' attorney, Charles Babcock of Dallas, told the appeals
judges that his client is being used to get to the tapes, and the
tapes are in New York and not in her possession. ``Putting her in
jail makes her a hostage and we should not countenance that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said making Mapes hand over the transcript violates her
ability to gather the news. A New York state court has scheduled a
hearing Friday to determine if Rather also will be ordered to
appear in court in Jasper with the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Don Burgess noted that the transcripts are not protected
under Texas law. ``If Texas says these transcripts are not
privileged, we don't give a tinker's darn about New York law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutor Sue Koriath said Mapes became a witness when
she observed Berry during the interview. ``She has no right not to
be a fact witness because she is a member of the press,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Ronald Walker asked Babcock, ``Do you see a
distinction between gathering news and creating evidence in a
capital murder case _ making the news?''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said Mapes didn't witness a crime, she only saw a
defendant being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hourlong hearing involved wrangling over just what
issues were being considered. Babcock asked the judges also to
consider his appeal of Golden's order for Mapes to produce the
tapes, but the justices said they would only consider the
transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston, who is assisting
Jasper County in prosecuting Berry, said the transcripts would ``at
least let us know if we want to continue to fight for the tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices also questioned if their court was the proper place
to appeal Golden's order. They said the issue might belong in the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Berry acknowledges he picked up Byrd the night
of the murder, but said it was his two companions, John William
King, 25, and Russell Brewer, 32, who beat Byrd in a remote forest
clearing east of Jasper, wrapped the end of a 24-foot-long logging
chain to his ankles and dragged him behind Berry's pickup for three
miles down back country roads. Along the way Byrd's head, right
shoulder and arm were ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   Juries have already found King and Brewer guilty of capital
murder and sentenced them to death.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray contends Berry
also took part in the murder and said the CBS interview may help
convince jurors that Berry is lying when he claims he didn't
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evidence, and it's good evidence,'' Gray said. He said,
however, that he doesn't think the battle with CBS will cause a
delay of Berry's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I get started with something, I kind of want to keep
going on with it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since he began his bid for the Republican
presidential nomination, John McCain has built his candidacy around
his character, presenting himself as a battling maverick whose
inner strength was forged during his five and a half years as a
prisoner of war in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign uses McCain's gripping life story to appeal to
conservatives who might not warm to some of his more independent
positions on issues, and to set him apart in courage and conviction
from either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, neither of whom served
in combat during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain rises ever higher in the polls in New Hampshire,
however, and is no longer seen as such a long-shot, he is coming
under more intense scrutiny on the very questions of character
around which he has based his campaign. And his detractors are
trying to paint a picture not of a fighting maverick but of a
hot-head who, despite his past, is a more conventional politician
than he appears.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCain is seeking to turn anger into an asset. Thursday he
recalled how he and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts
Democrat, once had a confrontation on the Senate floor, then
laughed about it when the Kennedy family honored McCain for his
attempts to overhaul the campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both passionate people,'' McCain said in an interview.
``I'm very comfortable that I feel strongly about issues of right
and wrong an have passion about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' he said: ``I have gotten
angry at people. And I will continue probably to get angry when I
see an injustice done. I feel that, as I say, people who aren't
represented and people who are not well treated, particularly in
the legislative process, deserve that kind of attention and I'll
continue to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's temperament began to be debated after Arizona Gov. Jane
Dee Hull, other politicians and The Arizona Republic all portrayed
the senator as someone prone to fly off the handle.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans, smarting from the senator's push to change
the campaign finance system, have quietly tried to suggest
hypocrisy, pointing reporters toward McCain's own presidential
fund-raising, which his been heavily dependent on his role as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The committee oversees
everything from sports to telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Until now McCain had skillfully used pre-emptive candor to
defuse possible personal shortcomings and present himself as an
unconventional, truth-telling politician, or as he describes it, a
man with a ``life characterized by flaws, imperfections, but an
attempt to adhere to principles.''
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates dodge and weave over questions about
their personal life, McCain and his wife, Cindy, recently appeared
together on television and talked about her one-time addiction to
painkillers after a back operation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign video that McCain mailed out across New Hampshire
acknowledged the breakup of his first marriage. The senator headed
off questions about his own fund-raising by saying that the current
system corrupts everyone, even him, and that he will persist with
efforts to clean it up.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain initially seemed caught off guard by the question of
temper, even though in his recent memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,''
he spoke of his ''outsized temper'' as an infant: ``When I got
angry I held my breath until I blacked out.'' A doctor, he said,
told his parents to drop him into a bathtub of cold water.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, McCain rocked on his heels as a
reporter took a long time to ask about the Arizona governor's
descriptions of him. ``I think that it's pretty obvious that as
we've closed in the polls,'' he said, ``that the memo came out from
the Bush campaign to start attacking John McCain.'' (The Bush
campaign denied it was behind the comments of the governor, who has
endorsed the Texan over her home state senator.)
</P>
<P>
   But McCain quickly adjusted and moved to use the accounts of his
anger to bolster his image as a fighter. In last week's debate in
New Hampshire, the senator said, ``People say that perhaps John
McCain gets angry. My friends, I get angry when we spend $350
million on a carrier the Navy doesn't want or need, $500-and-some
million dollars on an airplane, a C-130, that the Air Force has
said for years they don't need. And meanwhile, my dear friends, we
have 12,000 enlisted families on food stamps. That's a disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, McCain's communications director, has gone even
further and tied McCain's temperament back to the story of his
perseverance as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different aspects of John McCain's life story reinforce
each other,'' Schnur said. ``When people hear about a senator that
he gets angry because of pork barrel spending, they know this is a
man who gets angry fighting for causes he believes in,'' he said.
``When people hear about his time in Vietnam, it reminds them that
he's still fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the talk of temper is just a passing
storm. McCain has made a number of Republican enemies in the Senate
with either his curtness or his advocacy of some positions that his
party considers anathema. Some of them are quite willing to
describe him as temperamental as long as they are not identified.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the matter does not seem to be hurting him, although
he acknowledges that voters do occasionally ask about the issue. In
fact, polls show he has narrowed the gap with Bush even further in
New Hampshire, pulling into striking distance in the past few days
as he continues to barnstorm the state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Most Americans do not expect their presidents to be Caspar
Milquetoasts,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster unaffiliated
with any presidential campaign. ``They also don't want him flying
off the handle at inopportune times. And whether or not this
matters depends on the example that Senator McCain offers to the
American people. Thus far I haven't seen anything that would even
approach a crippling problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of McCain's supporters have also tried to turn the talk of
temper back on Bush, who was described as ''the Roman candle of the
family'' in Richard Ben Cramer's campaign book ``What It Takes.''
The book described Bush's anger when he and his wife were not
seated in his father's box at a Houston Astros game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard Bush has a temper, too, by the way,'' said Vin
Weber, a former congressman. And Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said,
``George W.'s had to contend with this. There's several stories
about him blowing up and all of that, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the challenge now was for McCain, Thompson laughed
and said, ``Not to lose his temper.''

SON OF ZAMBIA'S FORMER PRESIDENT KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The 47-year-old son of Kenneth
Kaunda, the former president of Zambia, was fatally shot Wednesday
night in the driveway of his home in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
   The son, Wezi Kaunda, a retired army major who was a rising
figure in his father's opposition United National Independence
Party, had been the target of death threats but chose to remain in
the country his father led to independence from Britain in 1964,
the party's spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kaunda, who was expected to assume a top post in the opposition
party at a congress next month, was returning home with his wife
and had pulled into their driveway when he was accosted by four
gunmen, who forced him out his car, the spokesman, Muhabi Lungu,
said Thursday in a telephone interview from Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the gunmen wanted his car, Kaunda pushed his wife
out of the car and told them to take it, Lungu said. But the men
opened fire on Kaunda, who was shot several times and died early
Thursday morning at a Lusaka hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The police, who have arrested one suspect, said in news reports
from Lusaka that they were treating the shooting as an attempted
carjacking. But the spokesman for the United National Independence
Party said the history of threats against Kaunda and the way the
shooting played out suggested an assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently they said, `We know who you are,''' Lungu said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Kaunda, who was his party's district chairman for
Lusaka, could prove a significant setback to the party as it
prepares for national elections scheduled for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under the elder Kaunda's leadership, the party dominated Zambian
politics until 1991, when rising opposition forced President Kaunda
to legalize other political parties, which had been banned for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the multiparty election that year, Frederick Chiluba of the
Movement for Multiparty Democracy won the presidency in a
landslide, setting the stage for the hostility that persists
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Wezi Kaunda, his father and other party leaders have repeatedly
been detained, jailed and charged with treason over the past few
years. Earlier this year, members of the governing party tried to
revoke the elder Kaunda's Zambian citizenship. And in April, shots
were fired at the former president's car, days after he was warned
of a threat against him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, Wezi Kaunda did not have a bodyguard, the
party's security chief said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a life of constant fear, most of former President
Kaunda's children had chosen exile abroad, leaving only Wezi and
another son in Zambia, relatives and party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had very strong convictions about what needed to be done in
the country,'' Lungu said. ``Like his father, he wanted to be part
of the process of reform and putting things right, and he wouldn't
be intimidated into leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kaunda, who was president for 27 years, was out of the
country when his son was killed and was en route back to Zambia
Thursday evening.

TEEN ACCUSED OF KILLING MOTHER, WOUNDING BROTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A 16-year-old boy is accused of killing his
mother with a butcher knife Thursday morning, then slashing two
younger brothers responding to her screams, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager was apparently angry because he had been grounded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The youth ran from the house in the 10700 block of Old Granbury
Road in Crowley, a Fort Worth suburb, police said. He was captured
about three hours later when a sheriff's deputy tackled him in
thorny scrub land near Rocky Creek Marina, about three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the teen was covered with blood and admitted
stabbing his mother. A butcher knife believed to have been used in
the stabbings was recovered from a pond where the teen said he had
thrown it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen remained in custody Thursday night. He faces a
delinquent conduct/murder charge in the death of Rosalie Cornett
Menard, 36, said Capt. Herb Chambers, a Tarrant County Sheriff's
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Capt. John Dalton said that it was not known why the
Crowley High School sophomore had been grounded, but that ``he
obviously was upset with his mother. He was very angry because of
restrictions placed upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those restrictions, officials said, was not being allowed
to see his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very angry kid who decided he was going to do
something about it,'' Dalton said. ``He'd been thinking about this
all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Menard was attacked about 7 a.m. in a back
bedroom, stabbed multiple times in the torso and back. She also had
arm cuts indicating that she tried to ward off her knife-wielding
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Her two younger sons, 13 and 14, were outside waiting for a bus
to H.F. Stevens Middle School when they heard her screams, dropped
their backpacks and raced back into the house, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, the 16-year-old told investigators that he
believed his brothers had already left for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they heard their mother's screams, they ran back in the
house, and that is when they apparently were injured,'' Chambers
said. ``The 14-year-old was the first one in the house and received
the most severe injury.''
</P>
<P>
   David Menard, 14, was stabbed several times in the abdomen and
was in critical condition Thursday night after surgery at Harris
Methodist Fort Worth hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old, whose identity was not released, suffered
gashes on his back and a head injury and was released after
treatment at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded brothers fled the house after the stabbings and ran
in opposite directions on Old Granbury Road.
</P>
<P>
   An Alvardo nurse on her way to work encountered David Menard as
he trudged along the roadway holding his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped, and after talking with him briefly, she drove the
wounded boy to the home of Mike Brinlee, about two miles north of
the Menard residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just poured a cup of coffee and there was a knock on the
door,'' said Brinlee, 46. ``This woman asked me to call 911 and
said she had a boy in her car that had been stabbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinlee said the severely injured youth told them that his older
brother had stabbed him and that his younger brother was still at
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Brinlee said he called 911 and drove to the Menard home to check
on the younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door was open. Nobody answered,'' Brinlee said. ``I
identified myself as I walked in the house, and there was no sound
but the dog barking. Then I saw the woman laying in a pool of
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old, meanwhile, had run 1.3 miles to a convenience
store/cafe where he asked the owner to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in about 7 a.m., and we were here waiting for the
school bus,'' said owner Mike Pope, 36, referring to his three
sons, 11, 13 and 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young boy that my son knows from school came in and said his
brother was going crazy and stabbing people. ... He was scared. Any
kid that age would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope said he called 911 while his wife, Cindy, comforted the
injured boy and then accompanied him to Huguley Memorial Medical
Center in Fort Worth, where he was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded boys' father, Allen Menard, works as an installer
for a Southwestern Bell subcontractor and was working at the time
of the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately returned home but wasn't allowed past the crime
scene tape. Somber and apparently shocked, Menard asked deputies to
retrieve the family dog, Cocoa. Deputies then escorted the father
to the Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley High School Principal Bill Johnson described the
16-year-old suspect as ``a thoughtful young man who was never in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From all indications in talking with teachers, he was a
student who didn't get into trouble and was rather quiet in
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance records show that the teen had been absent from
school only once this year, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an average kid. He makes average grades. There was no
indication of trouble.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Lawmaker pushes for second set of King papers
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said Thursday that if
Congress is going to buy the personal papers of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., then it ought to consider acquiring a companion
collection of papers also stored at the King Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The House is considering whether to purchase the papers from the
slain civil rights leader's family for $20 million. The papers in
question came originally from King's private home, and include
documents from his work at the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The SCLC donated a second set of papers to the King Center in
1977 that includes material from King's work as head of the SCLC
during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the collection of King papers that Congress wants to buy did
not arrive at the King Center until years after the SCLC donation.
As a result, they were archived as a separate collection even
though most scholars say they should be considered as one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the national interest that all of these papers be
brought together as one collection,'' said Lewis, who worked
closely with King to remove the legal barriers separating blacks
and whites during the 1960s. ``I would be supportive of buying the
whole thing for the sake of researchers, scholars and children in
the years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the second set of documents would have to
be purchased at additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars see the two collections as inseparable. To sell one
without the other, they argue, would undermine their historical
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially important that the SCLC papers and the King
papers are acquired together, because they are inherently
inseparable materials,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory
University and a noted King biographer.
</P>
<P>
   Garrow would like to see the papers now stored at the King
Center moved to the Library of Congress because of ``the explicit
disinterest that the King family has expressed in continuing to run
the (King) archives.''
</P>
<P>
   If Congress decides to acquire both collections, Garrow said it
would open the question of whether the King family had the right to
profit from material that the SCLC has jurisdiction over.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to purchase the papers is stalled because lawmakers
are concerned about the King family wanting to retain copyright
control of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The King family has remained silent about the negotiations and
did not answer questions for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), chief sponsor of the legislation,
said that he is dismayed that the bill has not come to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect if we don't break the logjam before the end of the
session, then the Library of Congress won't get the papers,''
Clyburn said. ``It would be a shame if we lost that window.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Luker, a civil rights activist, said that he would hate to
see any of the papers leave Atlanta. He is concerned that Congress
does not realize the family already has received federal money to
archive the collection at the King Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a large amount of money going to a family that has
already received a lot of money for the care, archiving and
publication of the same papers they are buying,'' Luker said.

SENATE APPROVES SWEEPING NEW BANKING LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved landmark legislation on
Thursday that opens the door for a new era on Wall Street in which
commercial banks, securities houses and insurers will find it
easier and cheaper to enter one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, considered by many the most important banking
legislation in 66 years, was adopted by a vote of 90-8. The House
took up the measure immediately and was expected to approve it.
Once that is done, the bill will be sent to the president's desk,
where aides say it will be signed and become one of the most
significant achievements this year by the White House and the
Republicans leading the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 provoked
dire warnings from a handful of dissenters that the deregulation of
Wall Street would someday wreak havoc on the nation's financial
system. It followed a rich congressional debate on Thursday about
the history of finance in America in this century, the causes of
the banking crisis of the 1930s, the globalization of banking and
the future of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and many Republicans and Democrats said
the measure would save consumers billions of dollars and was
necessary to keep up with trends in both domestic and international
banking. Some institutions, like Citigroup, already have banking,
insurance and securities arms but could have been forced to divest
their insurance underwriting under existing law. Foreign banks in
many industrial countries already enjoy the ability to enter the
securities and insurance industries without the same restrictions
imposed on American institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world changes, and we have to change with it,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, who wrote the law that will bear his name
along with the two other main Republican sponsors, Rep. James Leach
of Iowa and Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr. of Virginia. ``We have a new
century coming, and we have an opportunity to dominate that century
the same way we dominated this century. Glass-Steagall, in the
midst of the Great Depression, came at a time when the thinking was
that the government was the answer. In this era of economic
prosperity, we have decided that freedom is the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and civil rights advocates criticized the
legislation for being a sop to the nation's biggest financial
institutions. They say that it fails to protect the privacy
interests of consumers and community lending standards for the
disadvantaged and that it will create more problems than it solves.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the measure gloomily predicted that by
unshackling banks and enabling them to move more freely into new
kinds of financial activities, the new law could lead to an
economic crisis down the road when the marketplace is no longer
growing briskly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we should
not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the
past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``I wasn't around during the 1930s
or the debate over Glass-Steagall. But I was here in the early
1980s when it was decided to allow the expansion of savings and
loans. We have now decided in the name of modernization to forget
the lessons of the past, of safety and of soundness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said that Congress had ``seemed
determined to unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scores of banks failed in the Great Depression as a result of
unsound banking practices, and their failure only deepened the
crisis,'' Wellstone said. ``Glass-Steagall was intended to protect
our financial system by insulating commercial banking from other
forms of risk. It was one of several stabilizers designed to keep a
similar tragedy from recurring. Now Congress is about to repeal
that economic stabalizer without putting any comparable safeguard
in its place.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation rejected those arguments. They
responded that historians and economists have concluded that the
Glass-Steagall Act was not the correct response to the banking
crisis because it was the failure of the Federal Reserve in
carrying out monetary policy, not speculation in the stock market,
that caused the collapse of 11,000 banks during the depths of the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the supporters said, the new law will give
financial companies the ability to diversify and therefore reduce
their risks. The new law, they said, will also give regulators new
tools to supervise shaky institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns that we will have a meltdown like 1929 are
dramatically overblown,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the legislation was essential for the future
leadership of the American banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't pass this bill, we could find London or Frankfurt
or years down the road Shanghai becoming the financial capital of
the world,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``There are many
reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that
U.S. financial firms remain competitive. Like their international
competitors now, U.S. firms will be able to offer financial
services to complement their business models.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many experts predict that, even though the legislation has been
trailing market trends that have begun to see the cross-ownership
of banks, securities firms and insurers, the new law is certain to
lead to a wave of large financial mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has estimated the legislation could
wind up saving consumers as much as $18 billion a year as new
financial conglomerates gain economies of scale and wring out
excessive costs.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts have disputed those estimates as overly
optimistic, and that the bulk of any profits seen from the
de-regulation of financial services would be returned not to the
customers of banks, but to their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the key provisions of the legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _Banks will be able to affiliate with insurance companies and
securities concerns with far fewer restrictions than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _The legislation preserves the regulatory structure in
Washington and gives the Federal Reserve and the Office of
Comptroller of the Currency roles in regulating new financial
conglomerates. The Securities and Exchange Commission will oversee
securities operations at any bank, and the states will continue to
regulate insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _It will be more difficult for industrial companies to control a
bank. The measure closes a loophole that had permitted a number of
commercial enterprises to open savings associations known as
unitary thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican senator, Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted against
the legislation. He was joined by seven Democrats: Barbara Boxer of
California, Richard Bryan of Nevada, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin,
Tom Harkin of Iowa, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Dorgan and
Wellstone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also tucked away in the legislation is a provision that some
experts on Thursday warned could cost insurance policyholders as
much as $50 billion. The provision would allow mutual insurance
companies to move to other states to avoid compensating
policyholders as they reorganize their corporate structure. Present
law in many states does not allow such relocations without the
consent of the insurer's domicile state. But the legislation before
Congress would pre-empt the states.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and the Prudential Life
Insurance Co. are in the midst of reorganizing into stock-based
corporations that are requiring them to pay billions of dollars to
policyholders from years of accumulated surplus. In exchange, the
policyholders give up their ownership in the mutual insurance
company.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would permit any mutual insurance company to
avoid making surplus payments to policyholders by simply moving to
states with more permissive laws and setting up a hybrid corporate
structure known as a mutual holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was inserted by Bliley at the urging of a trade
association. It was supported by other insurance groups, and
attracted little opposition because it was attached to a provision
that forbids insurers from discriminating against women who are
victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Congress this week, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said that the provision ``could allow insurance
companies to avoid state law protecting policyholders, enriching
insiders at the expense of consumers.''

FORGET THE MUSIC, HEF'S THE HORSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Among the runners in Saturday's Breeders' Cup
races are a 3-year-old sprinter named Stravinsky and a 2-year-old
colt named Brahms. A 2-year-old colt named Bach didn't make the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, but the horses named for classical composers aren't piquing
quite the same curiosity as a 2-year-old colt called Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a horse that's 30-1 (on the Juvenile morning line),
there's been a lot of attention,'' said trainer Marty Jones, who,
as a single man of 28, understands.
</P>
<P>
   The horse was named for the Playboy founder by breeder-owner Ed
Nahem, a former art and antiques dealer who's a Playboy Mansion
party-goer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked to name horses for him for 30 years, and he said
no,'' Nahem said. ``But I wrote him a letter and told him this
horse had the potential to be exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner ran away with a Santa Anita stakes for
California-breds after finishing a well-beaten fourth against
better horses at Del Mar. Corey Nakatani will ride him here.
</P>
<P>
   No, neither the horse nor the jockey will wear pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about Hef the horse.
</P>
<P>
   Hef himself is expected at Gulfstream for the race _ ``and they
say he's got entourage,'' Jones said Thursday morning with a gleam
in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to dress my groom up like a Playboy bunny,'' Jones
said. ``He didn't think much of the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stakes victory, Nahem and Jones were invited to
Hefner's Halloween party. But Jones didn't get to meet Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was busy,'' Jones said. ``He had his hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about him: Gary Stevens is pleasantly surprised to
have six Breeders' Cup mounts, three for Saudi Prince Ahmed
Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., for which he rides under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which brought Stevens back from England this
summer, has cut into his business with other clients, notably Bob
Baffert's barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's something I took into consideration before I
signed,'' Stevens said. ``The tradeoff's been well worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract gives Stevens security, a future in Thoroughbred
Corp. management, and the satisfaction of helping to develop
2-year-olds like Anees (Juvenile) and Spain (Juvenile Fillies).
</P>
<P>
   Kid stuff: Owner Trudy McCaffery (Free House, Bien Bien) of
Bradbury doesn't have a horse in the Breeders' Cup. She's at
Gulfstream to chaperone four kids _ ages 9 to 16 _ whose trips to
the event are sponsored by racing associations and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Kids to the Cup'' program grew this summer out of various
racing fan clubs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's very important. They're our (sport's) future,''
McCaffery said. ``We don't want to lose these kids to NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Information: horsesetc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the year?: Alex Solis has ridden in 27 Breeders' Cup
races and never won, although he finished second aboard Bertrando
(against Arazi in the 1991 Juvenile), La Spia (jumping shadows in
the 1991 Juvenile Fillies) and three other horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in (jinxes),'' Solis said. ``You've got to see
things the way I do. I come from a tiny town in Panama with 2,000
people. I see how far I've come, and I have nothing but
gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis' mounts Saturday include Ecton Park (Classic), Dixie Union
(Juvenile) and Kona Gold (Sprint).
</P>
<P>
   Leave your hat on: The television audience might see jockeys and
trainers wearing caps advertising Youbet.com, the internet wagering
concern, in postrace interviews Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They're paid as much as four figures for national shows like the
Breeders' Cup.

 &HT;    Louisiana residents want oil giant to buy out homes
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ People living in the shadow of a Louisiana oil
refinery told the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday they
want the owner to relocate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm in my yard, I can smell it and it gives me
palpitations,'' said Hazel Davis, 70, who has lived for nearly 30
years next to the Shell refinery _ now called the Motiva Norco
Refinery/Shell Chemical Plant''They need to get us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Motiva/Shell has two facilities that surround Norco, a small
community 40 miles northwest of New Orleans. About a dozen
residents made their case to the EPA's National Advisory Council
for Environmental Policy and Technology in a public hearing here.
</P>
<P>
   Motiva/Shell was named one of the worst polluters in the nation
in a recent report from the Environmental Defense Fund. It releases
more cancer-causing toxins than any other refinery in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery has a bad record on accidents and spills. Although
most incidents are small, two stand out in the memory of residents.
In 1973, a pipeline erupted and killed two residents, and in 1989,
an explosion killed seven workers and injured nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
   Residents closest to the refinery _ mostly blacks who have lived
there for decades _ report a wide range of health problems ranging
from asthma to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The citizens of Norco want out,'' said Anne Rolfes, who is
coordinating a grass-roots effort, called the Bucket Brigade, in
which residents test air quality around the plant. ''On an average
day, there are nine harmful chemicals in the air. They are at low
levels which Shell says won't hurt anyone, but we say, over years,
they've got to have an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA cannot force the refinery to relocate residents, but it
can step up its oversight, something normally handled primarily by
the state Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA recently
conducted extensive tests at the facility. The results have not yet
been published.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and DEQ have sponsored a pilot program with Motiva/Shell
to help the company improve its relationship with the community.
Thursday's public comment session was part of that program.
</P>
<P>
   Shell has a policy of buying out anyone who lives along the
fence line of its facilities at ''fair market price,'' said T.
Allen Kirkley, the refinery manager. But Norco residents say the
market price of a home sitting across from a refinery wouldn't
cover the cost of a comparable home elsewhere. They want the
company to relocate the community as a group and give them homes in
exchange for their Norco homes. There are about 75 families who
want relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkley said that's out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have more residents that want to stay than want to leave,''
he said at a news conference held immediately after the Norco
citizens talked to reporters. He said his company has taken surveys
and most of the 4,000 residents like having Motiva/Shell for the
jobs it brings. In fact, a new subdivision is being developed on
one side of the refinery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkley also denied that Motiva/Shell is one of the worst
polluters in the nation _ or even in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Environmental Defense Fund misrepresented us,'' he said.
''We are not the worst. We are not the best, but our numbers show
us as being a midrange refinery in terms of toxic emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not deny that the refinery releases chemicals into the
air, but he said those emissions were at safe levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Norco is a very safe place to live, in my opinion,'' said
Kirkley, who lives in a New Orleans suburb about 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Norco sits on the Mississippi River in a region between New
Orleans and Baton Rouge dubbed ``Cancer Alley'' by
environmentalists because of the number of petrochemical companies
there.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Norco residents complaining about the Motiva/Shell
refinery live with 20 feet of the fence line.

CONGRESS PASSES FOURTH STOPGAP SPENDING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress was forced Thursday to pass another
temporary spending measure to keep the government operating as
President Clinton and Republican leaders continued their standoff
over Year 2000 budget matters.
</P>
<P>
   The stopgap spending bill, the fourth passed since the start of
the current fiscal year Oct. 1, will run through Wednesday, giving
White House and GOP budget negotiators more time to work out their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that the extra time might not resolve
anything, since Clinton and Republican leaders are still far apart
on a number issues, including money to pay overdue U.S. obligations
to the United Nations, and for hiring 100,000 new teachers and
50,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the Republicans show some willingness to give ground on
those priorities, we could be looking at a government shutdown next
week,'' said one Democratic House member. ``I don't think Clinton
wants to sign another (temporary spending bill) unless he sees a
deal in the works. And right now, we're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite remaining differences, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said he was hopeful that negotiators would strike a
deal by Friday on foreign aid spending, which has prevented
progress on other controversial budget items, such as money for
more teachers and police.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have finally agreed to include $1.8 billion in the
2000 foreign operations bill to help keep the Wye River peace
accords on tract between Israel and the Palestinians. But there are
still disagreements over Clinton's plea for $300 million in debt
forgiveness to Third World countries and nearly $1 billion to pay
overdue U.N. obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democrats are also upset that Republicans, just
within the last two days, chose to delete money for a number of
environmental, human rights and other international initiatives in
Africa and Asia after the administration conceded to several GOP
demands.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to close a deal, Republicans offered Thursday to
add another $761 million to the $12.7 billion foreign aid package,
with $123 million of it earmarked for debt relief. They also
restored some deleted funding for the Peace Corps and other
initiatives. White House officials said last night Clinton was
studying the offer, and they described it as ``good faith''
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that some negotiated compromise can be agreed
to,'' Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed concern
that Republicans are trying to undermine foreign policy priorities
by withholding full funding for some programs in an effort to score
points in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cynical political ploy aimed at dividing those who
believe in a strong foreign policy. We cannot ignore our other
responsibilities around the globe,'' Albright said. ``We will
insist on adequate funding for our leadership, and we will not stop
fighting until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has insisted on resolving the disagreements over foreign
policy before striking deals on other spending issues. If an
agreement can be reached, the House and Senate will likely approve
it Friday. But if not, Republicans threatened to send Clinton the
same foreign aid bill he vetoed Oct. 18 _ with the Wye River
funding included this time. Though the administration called the
inclusion of the Wye River money ``a positive step,'' Albright said
the bill would be vetoed again if the other issues aren't resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved all 13 appropriations bills needed to fund
the government, but Clinton has vetoed the four that account for
more than half of the 2000 budget, which totals about $618 billion.
A shutdown would end up disrupting operations at the Departments of
State, Justice, Commerce, Interior, Labor, Education, and Health
and Human Services, as well as dozens of government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republican leaders have said that there will be no
repeat this year of the 1995-96 government shutdowns, for which the
GOP was generally blamed. But the sides have made little, if any
progress, since they began their compromise talks on 2000 spending
matters in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Republicans, led by House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, have insisted on passing bills knowing that Clinton
would veto them because they do not address his main priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have described the process as a waste of time and an
affront to the American people, while DeLay and other Republican
leaders have defended their tactics as an effort to hold the line
on government spending without dipping into the Social Security
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument, however, has come under attack from the
Congressional Budget Office, which contends that their 2000 budget
not only breaks the 1997 spending limits agreed to with Clinton,
but could end up spending about $17 billion of Social Security
money if accepted by the president.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders have set Wednesday as a tentative
adjournment date for the year. But if final spending disagreements
are not resolved, another temporary spending measure would have to
be passed to keep federal departments and agencies functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are eager to settle their differences because Clinton
is scheduled to leave next Thursday on a weeklong foreign trip, and
dozens of House and Senate members have scheduled taxpayer-paid
trips abroad as well for the latter part of November.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats warned their Republican colleagues that
Clinton would probably postpone his trip rather than sign another
temporary funding bill if no significant progress is made by next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to go home, I suggest you act like it,'' Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., told GOP members.

   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Kosovo Albanians have become increasingly
aggressive in their attacks not only against Serbs in this battered
province, but also against Gypsies and members of other ethnic
minorities, according to foreign officials charged with restoring
peaceful administration in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A joint report issued here Wednesday by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees described ``a climate of violence and impunity'' in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks by the ethnic Albanians against the dwindling Serbian
population and the Gypsies are continuing unabated, officials of
the OSCE said, and, in a new development, Muslim Slavs in the
Prizren area in southern Kosovo are now suffering intense
intimidation and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said there is growing evidence that the Kosovo
Albanian leadership is behind some of the activity, and is
encouraging the formation of an intolerant, monoethnic state.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Albanians who have spoken out against what is happening
have been subjected to threats. Meanwhile Kosovo's minorities,
confused and frightened, are retreating behind a wall of silence,
as they lose faith in the international organizations charged with
protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors of the OSCE, the institution entrusted with the program
of democratization of Kosovo and preparations for multiparty
elections next year, have expressed especially strong alarm at the
ugly atmosphere spreading across the province.
</P>
<P>
   Prizren and its surroundings have become a source of particular
concern, according to Benedicte Giaever, the head of the regional
OSCE mission here.
</P>
<P>
   A center of culture and learning, the ancient town of Prizren
was always perceived as an example of tolerance and multiethnic
harmony in Kosovo. The minarets of its mosques mingle with the
solid proportions of the Orthodox churches and monasteries, and
Turkish is the common language, spoken alike by the Albanian, Serb,
Turkish and Gypsy communities.
</P>
<P>
   The townspeople largely escaped the wave of ethnic purges that
ravaged the province earlier this year, yet they have not avoided
the purging of Serbs and other minorities since.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-year-old Vojislav Stankovic, a retired government clerk,
was one of the few Serbs still living in his own house. That was
until last weekend when local youths broke into his house and
struck him in the face with a stone. The next day they returned,
tied him up, and threatened him with a knife. They told him they
wanted his house and he should leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they would slaughter me,'' he recounted, sitting on
a bed in the Serbian Orthodox seminary in Prizren where he had
sought refuge. ``I asked them why, what have I done, and they said
if you do not leave by 10 tomorrow we will cut you into pieces and
throw you into the river.'' His tone was deadpan, his face and eye
a bruised mess where the stone had hit him. Beside him was a
plastic bag of clothes, the only belongings he had taken with him.
</P>
<P>
   Stankovic is just the latest Serb to be attacked in Prizren.
Some 160 Serbs and members of other minorities, mostly old people
and children, are sheltered in the seminary, guarded by German
peacekeeping soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian quarter, a collection of old tiled town houses,
climbs the hill behind the seminary. The steep cobbled streets now
wind through a scene of devastation of charred rafters and rubble.
One house was still smoking, set on fire just a few days before.
</P>
<P>
   An Albanian couple living in the area said a house is burned
almost every night. They say they do not know who is responsible
and refuse to give their names or be interviewed. Albanians appear
uncomfortable about the house burnings but few of them actually
condemn the violence shown to their Serbian neighbors. ``It is the
same to me whether the Serbs stay here or go,'' the man said.
</P>
<P>
   In the western part of town, the 2,000 Gypsies are starting to
experience a similar fate to that of the Serbs. On Monday night Isa
Viseli, 27, a street cleaner, had to flee with his family when
Albanians shouted a warning that they had come to burn their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouted: `Leave the house, go,' so we left,'' Viseli
said. ``When we had gone halfway, I looked back and saw the house
was burning.'' He scrambled down the hillside, with his wife, three
children, his brother's family and his parents. They are now living
in a relative's house, joining other refugees in the increasingly
overcrowded Gypsy community clustered around the city hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They had lost everything, he said, and now were worried that
they would be thrown out of their new refuge. His father, Bajram
Viseli, sat silently, his dark eyes troubled. ``The Albanians have
changed since the war, but I never expected them to burn our
house,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Albanians have often accused Gypsies of collaborating with the
Serbian forces during the war. Now they are doing the same of the
Goranis, or Muslim Slavs, who number some 17,000 and live in the
mountainous southern tip of Kosovo. In the last two weeks, OSCE
officials in Dragas, the administrative center of the Gorani
district, have reported seven grenade attacks on Gorani families.
</P>
<P>
   Tossed into gardens, courtyards or shops, the grenades are aimed
at intimidating the Gorani population, either to make them leave,
or to stop those who had left from thinking of returning, according
to Maria Avello Martinez of the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
   The Goranis' misfortune is that their language is close to
Serbian and they were loyal to the government in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not being pushed out, but these attacks are a warning
to those who did collaborate,'' said Merfid Huseini, a young lawyer
in Dragas. Some people are profiting from the general anarchy, too,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Peter Michalski, spokesman for the German commander of
the NATO forces in the region, denied all knowledge of the grenade
attacks in Dragas and questioned the veracity of many of the
accounts of violence in Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very calm now and has been for several
weeks,'' he said. But another German officer, who asked to remain
anonymous, said that the NATO troops were anxious to avoid clashes
and so were choosing not to tackle the high level of crime head on.
``They want to go home with a clean uniform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Albanians are being allowed to threaten and
even kill Kosovo's unprotected minorities with impunity, said Ms.
Giaever of the OSCE. ``We have to increase security. We have to
find out who is doing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She joined a growing call for the Albanian leadership, and in
particular Hashim Thaci, the former leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army and head of the provisional government, to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian leadership was guilty by omission, said one OSCE
official, requesting anonymity. ``They have people on every street
corner, they could stop it but they are taking no action at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramush Haradinaj, one of the most senior commanders of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and now of the Kosovo Protection Corps in
Prizren, denied that the violence was organized. He also said it
was no longer his responsibility, since the KLA had been disarmed
and turned into a civilian organization. ``It is not our task to
keep law and order,'' he said.

 &HT;    Georgia health benefits plan short $150 million
 &HT;    By Andy Meadows
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's health benefits plan that covers more than
500,000 state employees, teachers and dependents faces a projected
$150 million deficit this fiscal year, a state official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the State Health Benefit Plan needs $43 million to
replenish its reserves, said Russ Toal, commissioner of the state
Department of Community Health.
</P>
<P>
   Toal had warned of a higher-than-expected shortfall in
September. He said Thursday that the employee plan's medical costs
were rising at a 14 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tolerate this,'' Toal said to hospital executives at
a Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals meeting at Callaway
Gardens. ``We have to change the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The DCH will resurrect a state proposal to move more employees
into cost-saving managed-care plans. The agency will request bids
from preferred provider organizations to land the employee business
_ in sheer numbers, the biggest insurance prize in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit plan covers 560,000 Georgians. About 158,000 belong
to HMOs, with the rest having traditional, fee-for-service
insurance. The PPO proposals, though, will include 90,000 members
of the University Board of Regents' plan, swelling the total number
covered to about 650,000.
</P>
<P>
   The university health plan itself needs $33 million to help
shore it up, Toal said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The DCH, which opened in July, also runs the federal-state
Medicaid program for the poor. Thus, it oversees benefits for
almost 2 million Georgians _ more than 20 percent of the state's
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's estimated shortfall greatly exceeds a $100 million
estimate that a state agency had given earlier this year and
follows a $75 million operating loss for the past fiscal year,
which ended in June. The benefits plan wound up in the black,
though its reserves were nearly wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders have vowed to keep the program running without
interruption. Toal insisted that it has the cash to pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gov. Roy Barnes had to budget more than $70 million to
prop up the benefits plan during the last session of the General
Assembly. He has given the DCH instructions to analyze the deficit
and develop options for dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the losses, employer contributions have been raised,
and workers now pay higher deductibles. The state also had sought
to move employees from traditional plans into PPOs, but that move
had been put off while the DCH was being formed thi
</P>
<P>
   PPOs are a form of managed care that allow patients to seek care
outside of the hospital and doctor network, though they must pay
more for that choice.
</P>
<P>
   The PPO bidding process had attracted interest among insurers
and hospital-doctor networks, who vied to win contracts for nine
regions of the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the competition will start from scratch again, Toal said,
with the university system now included. He indicated, though, that
employees would still have a traditional insurance option.
</P>
<P>
   Toal warned the hospital executives that the state would no
longer pay them ``full retail price'' for services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be able to continue to pay the rates as we
have in the past,'' Toal said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that hospitals that provide good health
outcomes for patients or that care for a high load of uninsured
Georgians may be rewarded. Other options include initiatives to
manage specific illnesses or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The new deficit projection may lead to higher premiums and
deductibles, but Toal has said that any major changes in the
program would be up to Barnes and the General Assembly. Employees
won't face any possible increases until next summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion-a-year state benefit plan also covers state
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for the shortfall, the DCH has listed higher
retiree costs, an aging workforce and prescription-drug spending,
increasing at a 20 percent rate. The state plan generally is
considered richer in benefits than most insurance packages offered
by private employers.

NEW YORK OPENING OF EXHIBITION ON NAZI ATROCITIES IS DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The planned opening in New York next month of an
exhibition linking ordinary German soldiers to Nazi war crimes has
been postponed as a result of a dispute over whether some of the
photographs may be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, called ``The German Army and Genocide,'' has
been fiercely controversial since it opened in Germany four years
ago because it has challenged the view widely held here that Nazi
atrocities were not the work of Wehrmacht but of Hitler's elite SS
and fanatical death squads.
</P>
<P>
   Having traveled to 34 cities in Germany, the exhibition was to
have opened in New York at the Cooper Union on December 2. The
exhibit has provoked rancorous dissent from right-wing groups that
say the army was professional and relatively untainted by the Nazi
atrocities. The controversy culminated in a bombing attack in the
western city of Saarbrucken in March.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Philipp Reemtsma, a wealthy industrialist and art patron who
sponsored the exhibition, said Thursday that the New York opening
would be delayed to allow a three-month review of the exhibits by
historians. ``The exhibition has suffered an extraordinary loss of
credibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a Polish historian, Bogdan Musial, has argued
that at least nine of the 801 photographs did not belong in the
show. For example, he has contended that a photograph called
``Pogrom at Ternopol,'' purporting to show Wehrmacht soldiers at a
mass grave in Ukraine, in fact captures a massacre by the Soviet
secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Another disputed photograph shows a German firing squad shooting
youths in Yugoslavia in 1941. Musial and other historians have
suggested that the soldiers involved were not German but Hungarian.
</P>
<P>
   Such dissent has fueled a feverish outcry over the exhibition,
organized by the Hamburg Institute for Social Research and already
visited by close to 1 million Germans. The show was shocking to
many Germans because it questioned the view that the army remained
detached from the worst of Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Because 20 million men, representing all shades of German
society, served in the Wehrmacht during World War II, the challenge
posed by the exhibition was particularly intimate and widespread,
touching many German families that previously thought of themselves
as relatively unsullied by Hitler's genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition prompted a debate in parliament, where some
deputies broke down in tears as they told of the suffering of their
families during the war. Erika Steinbach, a member of the
conservative Bavarian party, the Christian Democratic Union,
proposed a counterexhibition to restore the Wehrmacht's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But the weight of the evidence _ most of it in the form of
gruesome photographs taken by soldiers at the front and sent to
their families or girlfriends at home _ appeared overwhelming until
the credibility of the exhibition was undermined by the doubts over
a few photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Most serious historians now believe that, as Germany's top
cultural official, Michael Naumann, has put it, ``the Wehrmacht was
responsible for the logistics of the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Stern magazine published before Thursday's
announcement of the postponement, Reemtsma, the sponsor, said:
``Our exhibition is not the only one to contain mistakes, but it is
the only one where errors make such large waves. And that is
because the exhibition is so provocative to so many people.''

LARRY DOLAN TO BUY INDIANS FOR $320 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Dolan was crestfallen last year when his $525 million bid
to acquire the expansion Cleveland Browns team failed, but Thursday
he agreed to buy the Cleveland Indians from Richard Jacobs for $320
million for his sporting thrill.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' price tag is the most ever paid for a baseball
team, exceeding the $311 million paid last year by Rupert Murdoch's
Fox Entertainment Group for the Dodgers, a purchase that featured
Dodger Stadium and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time to hold and a time to fold,'' Jacobs, 74, said
during a news conference with Dolan, whose initial bid of $275
million last week was rejected. ``I don't think I'll suffer from
seller's remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Jacobs and team shareholders will realize a ninefold
gain on the $35 million that he and his late brother, David, paid
for the team in 1986. The deal will not be closed until March or
April.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan is paying $22.25 to $22.75 for each of the shares owned by
Jacobs and other shareholders. The team went public at $15 a share
last year. In trading Thursday, the stock closed at $20.625.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dolan, 68, is a longtime Indians fan who was part of a
group that earlier this year tried to buy the Cincinnati Reds. He
has been heartened by the Indians' return to power but frustrated
by the team's World Series defeats in 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want one World Series for the Indians, I want a string
of them. I want to reach the holy grail,'' said Dolan, whose
brother, Charles, is the chairman of Cablevision, the principal
owner of Madison Square Garden, the Rangers and the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dolan, a successful Cleveland-area lawyer, said he and his
family trusts, which are said to be enriched by appreciating
Cablevision stock, will own the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the owner,'' he said. ``Myself and four family trusts. My
brother is not involved; Cablevision Systems is not involved.'' The
family trusts _ of which there are many to benefit the Dolan family
_ are believed to be completely separate from any control by
Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Dolans tried to buy the Browns, Larry was
designated the general partner, and Charles a limited partner.
Without the financial clout of the family trusts, the NFL felt,
Larry Dolan's net worth was not deemed adequate to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners felt the arrangement was an end-run around a
league's rule that prohibits owners from having teams in major
sports in other NFL markets. Larry Dolan said last year that the
structure was ``not transparent.'' But a general partnership by
Charles Dolan in the Browns would most likely have triggered the
rule because of Cablevision's ownership interests in the Knicks and
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision is a leading candidate to buy the Mets and Jets. It
is not known if Cablevision's corporate ownership of the Mets would
conflict with Larry Dolan's personally funded purchase of the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have not seen the structure of the Larry Dolan
purchase so it's hard to comment if there are any potential areas
of conflict,'' said Bud Selig, the Major League Baseball
commissioner. ``But it's something we will look at in the coming
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago-based
consulting firm, said there could be a conflict _ one that might
give the impression of Cablevision money being behind the Indians
and Mets _ if Larry Dolan has any voting control over Cablevision
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision's proxy statement does not provide that detail or
how many shares Larry Dolan owns. But it shows that two of his
children, Paul and Matthew, own 9.8 million of Cablevision's Class
B shares.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Larry Dolan and Cablevision declined to provide
details of the family trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball may have to examine another potential conflict if
Cablevision buys the Mets. If the purchase goes through, the Fox
Entertainment Group, which owns the Dodgers, could own an indirect
minority interest in the Mets because of its partnership with a
Cablevision subsidiary in the Fox Sports Net cable service. The
current agreement gives Fox 40 percent of the Garden, the Knicks
and the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jacobs, the Indians changed from a moribund team to a
perennial powerhouse that won the American League pennants in 1995
and 1997, but lost the World Series in those years to Atlanta and
Florida. In Jacobs' time, the Indians made the lucrative move into
the publicly financed Jacobs Field, which always sells out, and for
which the team pays a nominal rent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Indians earned $2.9 million on revenues of $144.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months ended June 30, the team lost $772,000 on
revenues of $70.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' stays in the postseason have proven fruitful. In
1997, because it was in the World Series, the team posted $13.5
million in extra revenues. Last year, when the Yankees beat
Cleveland in the ALCS, the team generated $8.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' public financial records also show that Jacobs was
paid $467,424 last year, while the general manager, John Hart,
received $795,692 in salary and bonus.

FOUR IBF OFFICIALS ARE ACCUSED OF SOLICITING BRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Va., Colombia)  (th) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The founder of the International Boxing
Federation and three others in the powerful sanctioning
organization were indicted Thursday on federal racketeering and
bribery charges, accused of soliciting bribes from fighters and
their promoters in exchange for advancing them in the
organization's rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-count indictment handed up Thursday in U.S. District
Court in Newark accuses top officials of the organization _ one of
three major international ranking groups for boxing _ of receiving
a total of $338,000 in payments for manipulating the rankings to
allow boxers to qualify for lucrative fights.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment did not specifically name any fighters or
promoters who figured in the bribery charges. But the indictment
referred to a heavyweight title bout in June 1995 between George
Foreman, then the IBF champion, and a previously unranked boxer,
Axel Schulz, that was at the center of the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that the champion's manager and promoter
paid a $100,000 bribe to officials of the IBF to obtain a ``special
exemption'' that would permit the fight between Foreman and the
unranked Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Foreman was serving as his own manager and his
promoter was Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said in a telephone interview Thursday night that it would
be ``incorrect to assume that I am the promoter they are referring
to.'' Butch Lewis, another noted fight promoter, said he had been
hired by Foreman as a consultant to help arrange the Schulz fight,
but he also denied that he was the promoter referred to in the
indictment. Foreman did not return messages left with two of his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman, who won awards as both boxer of the year and manager of
the year from the Boxing Writers Association of America in 1995,
won the fight against Schulz, earning $10 million. Schultz earned
$350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the indictment accused the sanctioning group's
officials of accepting bribes from seven promoters and 23 boxers in
various weight classes, ranging from welterweight and middleweight
to cruiserweight and heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that the lower weight classes commanded
smaller amounts, in the area of $1,000 and $2,000, while the higher
weight classes commanded bribes of from $10,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a culture of corruption that festered in the IBF
virtually since its origin,'' Robert J. Cleary, the first assistant
United States attorney for New Jersey, said in announcing the
indictments. ``IBF ratings were not earned; they were bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Named in the indictment were Robert W. Lee Sr., 65, of Fanwood,
N.J., who is the founder and president of the ranking organization,
which is based in East Orange; his son, Robert Lee Jr., 38, of
Scotch Plains, N.J., who held the title of liaison to the president
of the federation; Donald William Brennan, 86, of Warsaw, Va., who
was formerly chairman of the federation's ranking committee, and
Francisco Fernandez, an international commissioner and South
American representative of the group, who lives in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before U.S. Magistrate Dennis C. Cavanaugh on
Thursday, the elder Lee, short, balding and dressed in a dark brown
suit, was released on $100,000 bond. His son was ordered held for
24 hours pending efforts to have him admitted to a private drug
treatment and rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   Should he be admitted to such a program, Cavanaugh said that the
younger Lee would become eligible for release to that program on
$100,000 bond. His lawyer, John DeMassi, said in court that his
client had an addiction to crack cocaine, and prosecutors said that
they found evidence of the drug when they arrested him at his home
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan was scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate in
Virginia, and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Fernandez.
Cleary said the crimes with which Fernandez is charged are not
covered by the extradition treaty between the United States and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which began two years ago, is continuing and
there may be more indictments, Cleary said. FBI agents have twice
gone to the group's headquarters in East Orange with search
warrants. They have also searched the Miami offices of the fight
promoter Don King, who has said publicly that he believes he is one
of the targets of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators would not speculate on who, if anyone,
else might be indicted in the case, but associates of the elder Lee
said privately that they had long believed that prosecutors would
try to use Lee to build a case against King.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were indications in court on Thursday that federal
prosecutors had attempted to win Lee's cooperation. Jose Sierra, an
assistant U.S. attorney, said that as far back as Oct. 21, 1998,
investigators had approached Lee and ``showed him certain
evidence'' of his alleged crimes and had given him an opportunity
to help them in their investigation. Sierra said that Lee had
instead ``continued to commit racketeering acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bribery charges, the four IBF officials were
charged with money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former Hudson County police officer who founded the
ranking organization 16 years ago, called the charges outrageous
and a product of ``vicious gossip'' by groups within the boxing
business who stood to benefit from the IBF's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall return to this courthouse where a jury of our peers
will put an end to this nonsense,'' he said, standing on the steps
of the federal courthouse after his release.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Naomi Wolf, the feminist writer turned feminist
campaign consultant, disputes the notion that she has been giving
Al Gore secret lessons in how to bare his teeth, growl and get
elected leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Wolf calls the whole idea that she has been
instructing him on how to be a dominant ``Alpha male'' rather than
a subordinate ``Beta male'' a total fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pure imagination'' she said, and even sang a few bars:
``Just my imagination, running away with me.'' (It was late, and
this was one of a number of follow-up calls from Ms. Wolf, who was
eager to right the record.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, she did mention Alpha vs. Beta males, she allows, but only
once, in passing, either in a conversation or a memo _ she doesn't
recall, really. ``The thing about writers is that we mention a lot
of things in passing.'' But she insists that she has never talked
to Gore about it.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting reports from within the Gore camp, she also said
she had not been telling him how to dress, either: not a single
fashion tip, or even so much as a ``nice tie, Mr. Vice President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he has much more important things to think about than
what he's wearing,'' she said forcefully, in an interview in her
office in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Like, for example, the fact that Washington is in a full-blown
tizzy this week over reports that Ms. Wolf had been paid $15,000 a
month for telling the vice president how to get aggressive, as well
as how to accessorize. Certainly it is ironic that Gore, who has
been widely ridiculed for being too timid, too formal and too
Washington, is now being pummeled for seeking the advice of someone
perceived as thinking too far outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, even Jay Leno was talking about Ms. Wolf,
including a long riff about her in his monologue.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has resisted the obvious Alpha Male response, which
would be to dump her at the first sign of trouble. He even called
her, as the story was breaking, just to check in.
</P>
<P>
   But there is continuing concern about her role, even within the
Gore camp. The concern seems to stem at least in part from the fact
that because she often deals directly with the Gore family _ the
vice president, his wife and especially their daughter, Karenna
Gore Schiff _ she is resented, and not seen as a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's critics say the controversy typifies his campaign, which
has already been dinged for hiring Carter Eskew, a media adviser
who once worked for the tobacco companies Gore crusades against,
and Tony Coelho, the campaign chairman, whom government auditors
found to have mismanaged oversight of America's participation in
last year's World Exposition in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's spending all his time defending his staff,'' said Dick
Morris, the former Clinton adviser, who got Ms. Wolf's campaign
advice for free in '96. ``And it should be the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, though, said the vice president should have known better
than to put Ms. Wolf on the payroll. When Morris himself tried to
cut her a check in '96, he recalls her saying, ``You don't want to
have a formal relationship with me. I've written some things that
could come back to haunt you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf, who says she mostly writes memos for the Gore campaign
about the concerns of women, and works closely with Ms. Schiff on
reaching younger voters, is keenly interested in sticking up for
her boss.
</P>
<P>
   Who, she insists, she never tagged as a Beta type, as first
reported in this week's Time Magazine. ``It was just a truism,
something the pundits had been saying for months, that the vice
president is in a supportive role and the president is in an
initiatory role. I used those terms as shorthand in talking about
the difference in their job descriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some in the campaign, though, remain alarmed, and not only by
her fondness for way-outside-the-Beltway language, which one Gore
loyalist laughingly described as ``psycho-sexual.''
</P>
<P>
   But others in Gore's circle say her influence has been wildly
overdrawn. One former aide said some of the suggestions that she's
practically running Gore 2000 come from insecure colleagues who are
not sure what she's doing up in New York, but envy her access to
the candidate and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Another defender, Eskew, said he had not heard about the ``Alpha
male'' before this week and is not aware that Ms. Wolf has played
any role beyond advising Gore and his message team about the
concerns of women.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say how many hours a week she was working for
that $15,000 a month, a sum only lately slashed to $5,000 by Gore's
new campaign manager, Donna Brazile. But Ms. Wolf, who has a fourth
book, on pregnancy, in the works, clearly has at least one other
best-seller in her: A how-to on salary negotiations. But she wasn't
offering any tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have written a whole book about how women should not have to
apologize for making the same fees men make,'' she said. ``Also,
I'm a reasonably successful writer, and I had to close down my
whole shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in this case, Ms. Wolf was until recently earning
slightly more than her boss, the vice president. But Ms. Wolf said
that she's fine with taking the lesser sum for the good of the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Crossfire'' this week, Patricia Ireland, among others, said
the criticism of Ms. Wolf was plainly sexist and noted that nobody
has ever questioned how much male consultants, like Karl Rove, the
top strategist of the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush, are
paid. And one quasi-defense of Ms. Wolf repeatedly being put
forward is that men have been overpaid for hit-and-miss political
advice throughout the centuries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf says she joined the Gore team last January after an
aide to the vice president, Eli Attie, noticed a column she had
written about Gore in George Magazine. They called her in, she met
Gore for the first time and decided to put her ``whole life on
hold'' because she was convinced he is the only candidate who cared
about women's issues before they were trendy, or is truly committed
to protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Her role in the campaign, she said, has always been to keep the
vice president in touch with the everyday concerns of women, who
Ms. Wolf, 37, has been listening to over the last decade. Concerns
about the ungodly cost of day care, or the way women in the service
industry worry about job security and health insurance. ``I just
carry these women's voices with me, and that's what he's listening
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism of Ms. Wolf's campaign work has focused on
the fact that it had been kept quiet. She is paid through Bob
Squier's consulting firm, so her salary does not show up on records
of campaign expenses. If Gore were ``comfortable in his skin,'' in
the favorite phrase of admirers of his Democratic challenger,
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, he would not be hiding her
involvement, his critics have said.
</P>
<P>
   Why was she kept under wraps? She insists it was her own idea:
``I wanted to make a transition in a respectful way from being a
journalist to being a partisan. It was a concern I had. I do have
views that have been taken wildly out of context but are
attention-getting, and I wanted to take my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it also her idea to be paid through Squier's operation? No,
she said. ``But my understanding about campaigns is it's quite
common to pay consultants the way Carter, Shrum and I are paid,''
she said, referring to media consultants Carter Eskew and Bob
Shrum. ``It's to keep the numbers looking like there's low
overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her boss, Ms. Wolf has never been criticized for lacking
passion, and throughout the interview she was energetic in her
professions of admiration for Gore. At one point, she even stood up
and hopped around in a circle to emphasize a point about how
important it is that he be elected: ``It makes me crazy,'' she
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   She did not come off as crazy, though. Wearing no make-up and a
pair of hand-me-down maternity stretch pants passed on by a friend,
Ms. Wolf, who is expecting her second child on Valentine's Day,
looked less like some whoopee girl sex writer than like your
average expectant mom, flagging in some moments at the end of a
long day. ``Can I answer that one after I have had a little more
caffeine?'' she asked at one point, sipping her tea.
</P>
<P>
   Deadly serious through much of a more-than-two-hour discussion,
she repeatedly tried to steer the conversation back to the wonders
of Al Gore. ``I respect someone who's willing to change the
paradigm,'' she said. ``I think he's gutsy to reach out to people
outside the Beltway.''

 PFIZER IN $82.4 BILLION HOSTILE BID TO BREAK UP MERGER OF DRUG

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hours after executives of American Home Products Corp. and
Warner-Lambert Co. announced a $70 billion merger agreement on
Thursday, Pfizer Inc. attempted to break the deal up with an $82.4
billion hostile bid for Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry cautioned
Thursday night that a higher offer could yet emerge for
Warner-Lambert, either from American Home or Pfizer or another drug
company. Warner-Lambert's board was meeting Thursday night to
consider the new offer, which is contingent on eliminating
financial penalties imposed by Warner-Lambert and its preferred
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert is considered a prize within the industry because
of its blockbuster drugs, including the cholesterol-fighting
Lipitor marketed jointly with Pfizer, and because of its many other
treatments under development.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has become intense among the world's largest drug
makers to create blockbuster drugs _ compounds that are
billion-dollar sellers and control a commanding share of the
market. Drug companies also need to replace drugs coming off
patent, which are far more profitable than their subsequent generic
versions, and want to amass bigger research budgets in hopes of
generating a hit drug. The rush to consolidate may also be hastened
by the elimination after next year of a favorable accounting method
for mergers that are exchanges of stock, as both proposed deals
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's bid for Warner-Lambert shatters all drug industry
records. The $82.4 billion offer is in fact the biggest hostile bid
ever for any company, and the deal would be the third-largest ever
if completed.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if Pfizer were to acquire Warner-Lambert, it
would be by far the biggest drug company. AstraZeneca, now the
largest, had $10.68 billion in worldwide prescription drug sales
last year and 4.2 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would have $15.9 billion in sales and
a 6.3 percent share. Drug stock analysts said that because Pfizer
would have a relatively small share of a splintered market, and
because the companies have little overlap, antitrust issues were
not expected to be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   If Warner-Lambert were to complete its merger with American Home
Products, the combined American-Warner would still be the biggest
drug company, but with sales of $13.8 billion and 5.5 percent of
the total market.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how Warner-Lambert's 43,000 employees, 3,000 of
whom work in New Jersey, would fare in the Pfizer acquisition. Some
analysts had said that Pfizer would probably close Warner-Lambert's
headquarters in Morris Plains, N.J., and cut other jobs from the
company's confectionary or manufacturing divisions. Pfizer, which
is based in New York, has 46,400 employees spread worldwide. Pfizer
said Thursday that it expected $1.2 billion in cost savings once
the acquisition was completed.

EXPERTS SEEK EXPLANATION FOR FLIGHT 900'S WILD RIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ Now that crash investigators have
used radar data to lay out a picture of a Boeing 767 on a wild
roller coaster ride in the last few minutes of EgyptAir Flight 990,
people familiar with the airplane are busy trying to concoct a
chain of events that would match the data.
</P>
<P>
   Some talk of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others think the autopilot might have mistakenly triggered
a dive and that the pilots tried too abruptly to pull out. Still
others theorize that a key part, like the tail elevator, broke. A
few think the problem is on the other end, with the radar data
itself, which they say cannot be correct.
</P>
<P>
   All say that their theories could be just wild conjecture, and
that the cause could be something no one has mentioned yet.
Whatever the cause, the radar data, released on Wednesday by the
National Transportation Safety Board, has added a piece to a puzzle
that will be difficult to solve, because most of the pieces are
still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the radar data offer a clue to what touched off the
accident in the first place, which could have been anything from
mechanical failure to pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Thursday, a variety of experts described a
number of plausible explanations for the last minutes of Flight
990, which plunged sharply, then climbed more than a mile before
falling again. Natural aerodynamic tendencies designed into the
airplane could help explain part of the up-and-down, porpoising
course, but possibly not all of it; parts breaking off in flight
could be part of the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts said they had very little information to go on
that would fill in the blanks. Some of that crucial information,
like the condition of the crew and the condition of the plane, may
be on the data recorders that the Navy is trying to recover from
the ocean floor. At times on Thursday, the experts sounded like the
proverbial blind man trying to describe an elephant by touching it,
but most of the elephant is missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if the crew is still alive,'' said one longtime
767 captain, speaking of those puzzling minutes over the Atlantic
early Sunday. The captain, who spoke only on the condition that he
not be named, said in a telephone interview that he was sitting in
his office with another jet pilot talking over the large variety of
possibilities. ``We don't know who is flying the airplane, if
anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Forte, a former official of the safety board who is now a
safety expert at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, said the
fact that there was no mayday call was ``a strong indication of
some sort of crew incapacitation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about the tail falling off or something like
that,'' Forte said, ``then there would be nothing else to do but
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said that while there was no evidence for it
yet, an attempted hijacking could have taken control of the flight
away from the crew, or created erratic or improper commands from
the cockpit to the plane's control systems. On an EgyptAir flight
on Oct. 20, an Arabic-speaking passenger kicked in the cockpit door
on a flight from Istanbul to Cairo and forced the crew to fly to
Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   Without pilots at the controls, experts said, the natural
tendency of the airplane would be to pull out of a dive if the
speed became so great that the lift increased. Whether that would
account for a climb as steep as the one reported by radar analysts
is not so clear.
</P>
<P>
   The data shows a dive from the assigned altitude of 33,000 feet
down to 16,700, at a rate of 24,000 feet per minute, triple the
rate recommended by Boeing and about 10 times as fast as the
fastest normal descent. But then the plane rolled to the right,
dashed back up to 24,000, and then fell to 10,000 feet, where it
took a turn to the left and apparently broke up, two miles above
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But from the point when it descended initially to 16,700 feet,
about 37 seconds after the first dive began, the plane's
transponder, the onboard system that reports altitude to ground
controllers, quit working. Altitude data from that point forward
came from the U.S. Air Force, which has radars in Riverhead, on
eastern Long Island, and Truro, on Cape Cod, that can estimate the
altitude of incoming objects by recording the angle of elevation of
the radar when the signal hit the object.
</P>
<P>
   But some investigators are dubious that the plane could have
climbed a mile and a half, and suggested that the interpretation of
the radar data was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Error increases with distances,'' one radar expert said. ``I
don't think anybody's going to have a clue until we get the
airplane off the bottom.'' Even then, he said, the plane's
instruments could have been thrown off if the plane was spinning or
skidding through the sky and its nose was not pointed forward.
</P>
<P>
   To other experts, a climb, commanded by the pilots, seems
perfectly reasonable. A retired aeronautical engineer said that the
EgyptAir accident could resemble the crash of a B-45 bomber in a
government test in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the plane flew a profile that looked like peaks
and valleys, but at the top of one peak it reached zero gravity and
the pump for the hydraulic system, which was needed to move the
flight-control surfaces, drew in air instead of hydraulic fluid and
stopped working. The plane went into a dive until the system
started working again, at which point the pilot pulled up so
sharply that the resulting forces tore off most of the wings.
</P>
<P>
   In the EgyptAir case, he said: ``You could postulate very easily
that you could get a glitch in auto pilot, and by the time they
realized that, and they finished reaching over and turning off the
auto pilot, they're in a dive. Then the pilots are like people
going crazy in the cockpit. You pull back on the yoke, you look out
and the wings are gone, and you have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   If the 767 was flying at or near supersonic speed at that point,
as the safety board has reported, it could have had enough momentum
to climb 8,000 feet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a major airline, a 767 captain said on Thursday afternoon,
``When we talked a little bit around the office about what could
have occurred, we think they somehow lost elevator control, some
kind of failure in the cable or something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The elevators are the movable portions on the horizontal tail;
if deflected down, they make the tail rise and the nose face down,
causing a dive. ``Who knows what would happen if you got into a
very steep dive?'' he said. ``How would the elevator react?''
</P>
<P>
   The captain said the 767 might then behave like the Learjet that
crashed last week with Payne Stewart, the golfer, aboard, following
a more or less straight course but rising and falling as it went.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Bradley, whose $65 billion health care plan has
been attacked by Vice President Al Gore as ill conceived and too
expensive, went on the offensive in East Harlem on Thursday before
some of the people most lacking in adequate health care.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to more than 100 residents of East Harlem, a
predominantly Puerto Rican community, Bradley, the former senator
from New Jersey who is challenging Gore for the Democratic
presidential nomination, reiterated his theme that the federal
government should make health insurance affordable for almost all
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five percent of all Latinos in the country don't have
health insurance,'' said Bradley, who spoke in the auditorium of
the Union Settlement Association, a century-old social service
organization. ``Thirty percent of all Latino children don't have
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers,'' he said, ``are unacceptably high.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech came soon after an appearance on the CBS
program ``Early Show,'' in which he said no when asked if he could
share a ticket with Gore if the vice president won the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strategists think a victory in the New York primary
will be critical to his insurgent campaign, and both he and Gore
have stepped up their appeals to core Democratic voting groups in
New York. On Monday, Gore met with a group of prominent black New
Yorkers, two months after Bradley gave a speech on race relations
in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley received a warm welcome from the audience in East
Harlem, where 40 percent of the families were below the poverty
line in 1990. Several in the audience said later that the Medicaid
and Medicare programs serving their community did not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, many said they knew little about Bradley or his proposals.
A few said they remembered him as a basketball player with the New
York Knicks, and later as a senator, but had not known details
about his health care plan, which he first outlined in Los Angeles
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to help us old people,'' said Catalina Santos, 63,
who added that she had high blood pressure and a thyroid disorder,
but did not have health insurance. ``I don't remember everything he
said, but he talked about health care and Medicaid and Social
Security and other things that are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Petra Allende, 79, one of six people who questioned Bradley
after the speech, said, ``What he said, if it happens, if it's
true, would make him a man of the people, but you can promise a lot
of things and then you forget when you're elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley mentioned other proposals likely to win support for him
in East Harlem, including strict gun control and an increase in the
minimum wage. But he spent most of his 22-minute speech pushing his
health care plan and the financing formula needed to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Otero, 60, who conceded that she knew little about Bradley
before his speech, said she was glad a serious candidate had
campaigned in her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``More of them should come ask for our support,'' added Ms.
Otero, a retired factory worker who said she lacked Medicaid
coverage. ``I like his manner. I liked the way he expressed
himself. I like the way he explains.''

COMMENTARY: AIR RUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No sooner had the polling booth curtains stopped twitching in
New York this week than Rudolph Giuliani took to the air upstate,
with the first commercial of the 2000 U.S. Senate campaign. (The
race still has no official entrants. But Giuliani has bought TV
time and Hillary Clinton has bought a $1.7 million house, either of
which is as good as an announcement as far as I'm concerned.)
</P>
<P>
   The ad is a basic 30-second rundown of the mayor's achievements
as mayor _ fought crime, increased jobs, etc. _ with shots of
Giuliani and lots of happy New Yorkers. It's notable for only one
thing. His euphoric constituents _ smiling, waving, walking their
babies across the extremely safe streets _ all appear to be white.
Closer inspection reveals a man who is possibly African-American
working on the roof of a building far up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani says there's one shot of the Puerto Rican Day parade.
He and his aides were busy all day Thursday, pointing out possible
minority New Yorker sightings in the footage. ``In the shot of the
Staten Island ferry, if you look to my left there's a woman who
appears to be Hispanic,'' the mayor said. It was sort of a
political version of ``Where's Waldo?''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, to the casual observer the ad really does look as
if the mayor of the nation's most wildly heterogeneous city was
taking a bow for making things safe in Des Moines. It's not the
most critical lapse in the history of modern politics, but it is
peculiar. Giuliani's biggest problem as a mayor has been deflecting
charges of racial insensitivity. One of his biggest challenges as a
Senate candidate is to mollify black voters, at least to the point
that they don't turn out in record numbers to vote against him.
Why, then, would he introduce himself as a Senate candidate in a
commercial that seems to have turned New York monochromatic?
</P>
<P>
   There are several possible explanations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thanks to the mayor's efforts stimulating the economy, black
New Yorkers were too busy working at construction jobs to come down
to the ground and pose for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giuliani camp thinks this is what upstate voters would
like to think New York City looks like.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whoever made the piece was just sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ad is a perfectly fine portrait of New York in all its
glorious diversity, and anybody who thinks otherwise is a dreadful
person.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which answer the mayor likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got to be your problem,'' he said, to a suggestion that
there seemed to be something missing in the ad. Alerted by my
question to an aide, Giuliani had called to discuss the errors in
my thought process and point out the Latino woman on the ferry. It
was a brief conversation, although Giuliani managed to squeeze in
the terms ``truly absurd,'' ``a reach'' and ``kind of sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that the other common criticism of this mayor
involves a problem with accepting criticism?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad that people look at the world this way,'' he
continued, declining to be distracted from his theme of racial
hypersensitivity. Bringing up the whole issue, he added, was an
example of ``a tired old stereotypical attack on Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a low blow. We're immersed in a presidential campaign
that documents every single interaction between George W. Bush and
minority voters in breathless detail. (Look, everybody! He's going
to another black church!) The media are so excited about this
Republican inclusionism that we fall into a swoon every time Bush
says ``Hola!''
</P>
<P>
   But Rudy Giuliani isn't Bush. He's also probably not a political
figure who needs any introduction to the voters upstate. The ad
actually seems like a waste of money, since you can walk into a
cornfield in Iowa and get somebody to tell you that New York City
is a much better place these days, and identify who's responsible.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent New York Times poll, practically all the
state's voters not only feel they know Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani,
they've already made up their minds whom they're going to vote for.
The election's still a year away, and the undecided-voter pool is
vanishing. The way we're going now, the entire election will hinge
on a retired appliance repairman in Cooperstown who thinks Jimmy
Carter is still president and a couple of unemployed survivalists
living near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   If they watch television, there's already an ad coming their
way.

 &HT;    Billick's mouth adds even more drama to Browns-Ravens game
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two teams have combined for just three victories
this season. But Baltimore coach Brian Billick's mouth increased
interest in the Ravens' matchup with the Browns on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Billick made his third big mistake as a head coach _
the first two were trading for quarterbacks Scott Mitchell and Tony
Banks _ when he accused the NFL of wanting the Browns to win.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland fans already were excited about hosting the Ravens.
The game comes nearly four years after owner Art Modell announced
he was moving the former Browns to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know darn well we're not going to get a call in Cleveland,
no way, no shape, no form, no how,'' Billick said. ``The league
would really like to see Cleveland beat us. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The league helped them to bring football back to Cleveland,
and they want to stop teams from moving,'' he said. ``The league
also gave Cleveland a lot of latitude in the drafts and free
agency. At least with Jacksonville and Carolina, they had to
compete with each other, and it was kept under control. In the case
of Cleveland, a lot was given to one entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick also said he was worried about his team's safety in
Browns Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to rent the little 'Popemobile,' the one the Pope has
with the glass shield, for me to come out, but unfortunately, we
can't get it here on time,'' he said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Billick later tried to retract his statements, but the damage
was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the losing is getting to him,'' Browns president Carmen
Policy said. ``He's not coaching an expansion team. He's coaching a
team with one of the best defenses in the NFL, and expectations
were high.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick said he sent Policy a bottle of wine to congratulate him
after the Browns' first preseason win. Billick said that if Policy
is angry with him maybe the gift should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Policy might need a bottle of champagne Sunday, especially with
Banks under center for the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   DIVISIONAL MATCHUP
</P>
<P>
   The Bears travel to Green Bay, where the Packers will be looking
to take out their frustration from losing to former coach Mike
Holmgren. Chicago should be inspired after the death of Bears great
Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   UPSET OPPORTUNITY
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is a 4 1/2-point underdog at Carolina, which is
reeling after a rash of injuries. Panthers quarterback Steve
Beuerlein threw three interceptions against the Falcons; he might
have more than that against the ball-hawking Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks running back Ricky Watters hasn't scored in seven
games. That touchdown drought will end against the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   INDIVIDUAL MATCHUP
</P>
<P>
   Vikings receiver Randy Moss had three catches for 163 yards
against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day. Dallas was playing without
cornerback Deion Sanders, who's coming off his worst game in
several seasons. Last week, the Colts burned Sanders for four
catches for 84 yards.

 &HT;    Thrashers build trust every game
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A victory can obscure reality. Especially when it is
the third in 11 games for a team searching for a steady line
combination.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' 4-1 victory over Tampa Bay on Wednesday barely
will make the footnotes in NHL record books, but the game might
prove significant in the Thrashers' development.
</P>
<P>
   Several players mentioned the words ``trust'' and
``communication'' after practice Thursday to illustrate the
improved defensive zone play. The defense had been the topic of
daily lectures from the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   That the Thrashers held Tampa Bay to one goal after allowing 38
in the first 10 games can be attributed at least partly to the
players' increasing familiarity with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, last night we were able to trust each other more,
so we weren't overcompensating for someone else's poor
positioning,'' said defenseman David Harlock, who was named the
third star of the game. ``You do your own job, and let things take
care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to keep saying this over and over,'' forward Kelly
Buchberger said, ``but when you have 23 players from different
teams, nobody's used to playing with each other, and you don't know
what they're going to do all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always second-guessing,'' Buchberger said. ``You have
to get that trust in one another. You have to know how he's going
to react when the puck goes some place. Last night, we probably
communicated better than we had in any game all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Edmonton,'' he said, ``when they had all of those good
teams, they'd only bring in one or two guys a year because they
didn't want to break up that chemistry. When you bring in a lot of
guys, it's tough to build that trust and communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Better communication led to better positioning, which led to an
increased physical presence by defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you find yourself chasing the puck,'' defenseman
Kevin Dean said. ``When that happens, you're out of position and
it's tough to be physical.''
</P>
<P>
   The improvement is timely for the Thrashers, because the games
will begin to outnumber the practices soon. On Saturday in Boston,
they play the first of four consecutive road games. Beginning
Wednesday in Florida, the Thrashers play three games in four nights
and 10 in a 19-day span this month, including two sets of
back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   But the players are embracing the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be good, because we haven't played all that much,'' left
winger Andrew Brunette said. ``It seems like our games have been
spread over two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more games you play, the more familiar you become with
everybody,'' Brunette said. ``We need that right now. We need some
team bonding. We go on a road trip and play a lot of games
together, it's easier to get that. When you're trying to get some
chemistry going and you play a game and then you're off for four or
five days, it's tough, especially (for) a first-year team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlock said: ``It's not like we're getting sick of practice.
You just lose that edge when you have so many days off. You're a
little lethargic and slow to get into it. All these games should be
good for us.''

WHILE DEFENDING CRACKDOWN, CHINA ADMITS APPEAL OF SECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The government continued to lash out at the Falun Gong
spiritual movement Thursday, comparing it to ``organized crime''
and predicting it would soon ``vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government can not sit back and do nothing about Falun
Gong, a group that has seriously endangered public safety and
order,'' said Ye Xiaowen, director general of the State
Administration for Religious Affairs, at a news conference at the
Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the crackdown on Falun Gong, in which thousands of
members have been detained since the group was banned in July, Ye
said: ``We should have outlawed it sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, which blends traditional Chinese exercises and
meditation with elements of Buddhism and Taoism, promises its
followers improved health and spiritual peace. It was wildly
popular, particularly among the middle-aged and the retired, until
the government banned the movement and labeled it an ``evil cult.''
</P>
<P>
   But some members have continued to practice, and a number have
recently come to Beijing to protest the ban. Every day for the past
10 days, police have been carting off small numbers of Falun Gong
members from Tiananmen Square, where they sat and sometimes
meditated in acts of silent protest.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news conference highlighted what Chinese officials
called the ``dangerous'' and ``superstitious'' aspects of Falun
Gong with video clips that showed the movement's leader, Li
Hongzhi, discussing supernatural powers, millennial visions and
reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Li, a former government clerk who started the movement in 1992,
now lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the oldest in the universe _ I produced my parents,'' he
says at one point in the tapes. And, at another: ``I have so many
incarnations, I can protect you all.''
</P>
<P>
   Other segments are said to show him urging practitioners to
forgo medical care with admonitions like this: ``If you go to the
doctor it shows you don't trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's leaders have said they do not forbid members to seek
medical care, but they have also said that practicing Falun Gong
promotes health and may limit the need for medical treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has produced more fabricated stories
about Falun Gong practice, but the truth will prevail since the
Chinese people keep coming back to Tiananmen Square,'' said Erping
Zhang, a Falun Gong spokesman based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials insist that 1,400 Falun Gong followers have
died because they did not seek medical treatment, and the
government has made this a major justification of the current
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, the government has announced its intention to
prosecute leaders of the group under a new anti-cult law. Most had
been arrested over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's press conference, officials spoke for the first
time of the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of ordinary
practitioners _ including office workers, farmers, students and
business people _ who have been detained in Beijing this week.
</P>
<P>
   The detainees were not arrested but ``taken away and and given
some education,'' said Li Bing, vice minister at the State Council
Information Office. He said that practitioners who told the police
where they were from were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that some had been ``unwilling'' to say where they
came from and so ``we are still trying to reason with them so they
can be sent back.'' The information office said there ``were no
accurate statistics'' concerning how many had been detained or sent
home.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that Li Hongzhi had duped millions of Chinese,
officials at the news conference acknowledged that the social
upheavals of contemporary China provide fertile ground for groups
like Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people here not used to the fast-changing society,''
said Ye, the religious affairs official. ``They feel upset and
disoriented. I don't deny that. Cults like Falun Gong have emerged
and attracted them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he characterized those still devoted to the group as ``a few
die-hards'' who ``will surely be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Also reflecting the government's intense crackdown, five Western
journalists who attended a clandestine news conference with Falun
Gong members on Oct. 28 were summoned to the Public Security Bureau
for questioning on Wednesday and had their journalist accreditation
cards and residence permits confiscated. The documents were
returned Thursday to three of the reporters, including Erik Eckholm
of The New York Times.

   France and Britain may be heading for an agreement that would
allow the sale of British beef in France again. Senior officials
from both governments and the European Commission are to meet
Friday in Brussels to discuss increased safety measures that French
officials have suggested might end their objections. Among the
issues are the traceability of cattle, increased testing for mad

 &HT;    Racing to turn 50
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the mad dash for the elusive 50th career Winston
Cup victory, Rusty Wallace and Jeff Gordon are riding side by side
in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   The two rival drivers are tied with 49 career victories. It is
no secret that Wallace and Gordon would love to beat each other to
the magic 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd be lying to you if I told you it's no big deal, but
it is a big deal,'' Wallace said. ``I'd like to get my 50th before
he does. ... But, then again, I've got to think _ if he gets 50
before me or vice versa, what effect will it have on my goal? I
don't know if it'll have any effect on my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Gordon are two of the favorites in Sunday's Dura
Lube 500 at Phoenix International Raceway. Wallace won the
rain-shortened event last year. Gordon has won two of the past four
Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to even conceive of the fact that we have won 49
races,'' said Gordon, who plays down his rivalry with Wallace. ``It
would be nice to get that 50th win at Phoenix. However, you never
know when any win will be your last, so we'll be thankful to get a
win anywhere we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, appears to have the edge. Despite losing longtime
crew chief Ray Evernham late in the season, Gordon has maintained
his composure while winning seven races this season to lead Winston
Cup. His last two, at Martinsville and Charlotte last month, came
under the guidance of Brian Whitesell, Evernham's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon, who began Cup racing in 1992, traditionally
struggles at Phoenix, where he has not won. In six starts on the
1-mile oval, Gordon's best finish was fourth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon will race in Saturday's Busch race to prepare for
Sunday's Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't test at Phoenix, and we only race here once a year,''
he said. ``So, each time we go, we learn a little more about the
track and our setup. We felt like we hit on it last time and that
we had a shot at the win but never got the chance to show what we
had at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's race was called after 257 of 312 scheduled laps
because of heavy rains in the desert. Wallace, who desperately
needed the victory to extend his streak of winning at least one
race per season to 13 years, was leading at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the sun would go in and out or the track would
change a little bit, my car just ate up all the mistakes,''
recalled Wallace, who led 196 laps in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember, after it was all done, they said there were a lot
of guys complaining about the track changing so much, and I didn't
feel any big changes in my car. That was a Cinderella race; that
was awesome. I hope I can go back and do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 43, has posted only one victory in each of the past
three years. It appeared he was on the way to a multiwin season
after taking the pole and checkered flag at the Food City 500 on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Daytona, we ran really good, and four races later we're at
victory lane at Bristol,'' he said. ``We led a lot of laps, but
then after that we kind of got into a rut where it seemed like
every race we were seventh or eighth. I couldn't get back into what
I call that coveted top three.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a 20-year Winston Cup veteran, failed to take advantage
of three other pole positions. He threatened to win No. 50 at
Watkins Glen before being overtaken by Gordon on the road course.
Wallace finished third, which was his best nonwinning performance
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first priority, as it has been for many weeks now, is to
get us that 50th career win,'' Wallace said. ``Yeah, I do think
about it (all the time), and I just hope I get it. It's just a goal
of my own that I set to try and achieve. It's a good solid
number.''

IS THERE A HOME-HORSE ADVANTAGE? BET ON IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Everybody is looking for an angle in the
South Florida breezes this week, an easy yet winning approach to
betting on the Breeders' Cup, which appears on Daily Racing Form
paper to be as difficult as ever before.
</P>
<P>
   May we suggest one possible approach?
</P>
<P>
   Sheer, shameless, unmitigated provincialism.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a horse _ or jockey or trainer _ in a major national
event because he's from your local track is not the kind of
handicapping they write books about. Rooting blindly for the home
team is one thing. Risking money blindly on the home team is just
plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Did you know you could have turned a solid profit on past
Breeders' Cups simply by betting on every horse who (a.) was
favored on the tote board and (b.) ran his prep race at a
California track?
</P>
<P>
   It's true, and here's why it might continue to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Human nature causes people to be more impressed by winners we
saw with our own binocular-aided eyes than the ones we watched on
some simulcast television set or read about in the paper. Human
nature causes people to feel more strongly about the losing horses'
excuses we jotted down on our own track programs than the ones we
heard from a professional handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Breeders' Cup rolls around and the best
thoroughbreds come in from all over the continent and globe to face
off, it's natural that Californians tend to back Californians, New
Yorkers tend to back New Yorkers, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what if one side of the country tended to bet more money
than the other, or if one side backed its own horses more
enthusiastically than the other?
</P>
<P>
   Then, under the immutable, mathematical laws of the parimutuel
system, the odds on horses from the one side would tend to be lower
than their true chances of winning, while the odds on horses from
the other would tend to be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Does this happen? Well, with only 15 Breeders' Cups in the
books, it's hard to draw conclusions with any certainty.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what seems to happen: New York and surrounding
states, with more of the country's major racetracks and more fans
contributing to the Breeders' Cup mutuel pool, drive down the odds
on horses from that region and raise the odds on horses from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's a plausible explanation for the following:
</P>
<P>
   In past Breeders' Cups, 52 horses who prepped in the New
York-New Jersey-Pennsylvania area have run as post-time favorites,
17 have won (a normal percentage) and they've produced a 26 percent
loss on win bets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 15 horses who prepped in California _ usually at
Santa Anita _ have run as post-time favorites, seven have won
(that's a lot) and they've produced a 24 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, favorites from Kentucky (8 wins in 14 tries) have returned
a 39 percent profit and favorites from European countries (6 for
19) have eked out a 3 percent dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Looking closer, you find that based on past Breeders' Cup
results, horses coming off New York-area races have seemed to be
most heavily overbet in the Classic, winning just 4 of 14 as
favorites; the only California-prepped favorite, Ferdinand in 1987
at Hollywood Park, won.
</P>
<P>
   In the two previous Breeders' Cups held in Florida, New
York-area horses went a weak 1 for 8, the victory coming in the
1992 Classic with A.P. Indy, a California-based 3-year-old who
prepped in New York's Jockey Club Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   All of which probably sounds technical _ trust me, I sport
neither a green eyeshade nor a pocket protector while typing this _
and might or might not be significant as you dive into Saturday's
races.
</P>
<P>
   But it suggests you'll have history and human nature on your
side if you back these three favorites: Forest Camp, 3-1 on the
morning line in the Juvenile after running an educational second in
the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita; Chilukki, 8-5 in the Juvenile
Fillies after making the Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita her sixth
victory in a row; and Brave Act, 7-2 in the Mile on turf after
running a troubled third in the Oak Tree Mile at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach to betting college football is not
recommended this year.

 &HT;    Martin may quit Busch after 2000By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Martin is leaning toward withdrawing from
competition in the Busch Series after the 2000 season. However,
Martin, the all-time leader in victories on the junior circuit,
prefers not to use the ``R'' word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'm going to 'retire' from Busch,'' Martin
said. ``When I get too old to run Winston Cup, I may want to go
back and run Busch cars. It's not out of the question. I'm leaving
the door open.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 40, is a full-time Winston Cup driver and has been
running about half of the Busch schedule since 1987. Martin said
the idea to leave the Busch circuit is his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away from the racing and from the marketing and the
sponsorship commitments I have to do for Valvoline and everyone
else,'' Martin said. ``I can't manage a 14- or 15-race schedule
anymore, based on the demands placed on me in Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Long-time Busch sponsor) Winn-Dixie would be happy to go on
as long as we wanted to go. I contemplated getting out of Busch
racing after this year, but I was persuaded by a number of
different people to at least give everyone a year to figure out
what they wanted to do other than just to step aside. So I gave
them one more year.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has won a record-setting 40 Busch races in 186 career
starts, including six victories in 13 races this season. More than
anything, though, Busch racing provided Martin with job stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I couldn't win races in Winston Cup cars for
whatever reasons, so my stock would have been drastically down in
the sport had I not been winning Busch races,'' Martin said.
``Busch racing has been responsible for me maintaining a top ride
in Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   RACING TO THE RESCUE
</P>
<P>
   The racing community raised about $2,500 to present to track
worker Randy Hall, who suffered head and shoulder injuries after
falling off a safety vehicle during the Martinsville race on Oct.
3. Hall was released last week after a lengthy hospital stay.
Doctors project a full recovery, but it might take six more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys over at Goodyear came up with the idea, and I just
helped spread the word,'' Dale Jarrett said. ``It was an
unfortunate injury, and, hopefully, the money will help (Hall)
while he is out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bodine was one of several drivers who either sent get-well
cards or called to check on Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The safety workers) are out there for us,'' Bodine said.
``They try to make sure the race track is clean and safe and ready
for us to go racing. Most of them are volunteers, and it is just a
shame what happened at Martinsville. Our hearts go out to (Hall).
EXTRA LAPS
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Mike Bliss last week, Eel River Racing has
hired Todd Bodine to drive the No. 30 Pontiac at Phoenix. Bodine
might also be in the seat at Miami, but he has committed to operate
the No. 41 Chevy at Atlanta. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Cosworth Racing, known for building the engines of championship
teams in CART and Formula One, will cross over to NASCAR next year.
Cosworth has signed to construct motors for the Busch Series car
owned by PPI Motorsports to be driven by Acworth's Anthony Lazzaro.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Barrett, who also works as a Hollywood stuntman, will
drive for Xpress Motorsports in the final two Busch races.

   Pfizer's bid leaves American Home Products of Madison, N.J., in
a potentially vulnerable position. When announcing the deal with
Warner-Lambert, American Home's chief executive said his third
attempt at a merger would be a charm. Previous deals between
American Home and SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto fell apart over
conflicts over who would retain executive control. Though that
problem had apparently been worked out with Warner-Lambert, the
issue may not be so easily resolved again.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the troubles ahead for American Home, its stock
price fell Thursday, even though the company became a possible
acquisition target, something that would normally push up a
company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts said Thursday that it could be months before any
merger deal is finalized for any of the companies involved. Several
European companies _ including Glaxo Wellcome and Novartis _ have
long been seen as possible acquirers in the industry, especially if
they can increase their prescription drug sales in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to figuring out which company may make an
acquisition, you can play chess board here to your heart's
content,'' said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmacological research firm in New York. ``It's hard to
identify specific large companies that would not feel compelled to
go in this round.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pfizer's executives expressed confidence Thursday
that their bid would be successful, questions remained.
</P>
<P>
   Upon making its offer, Pfizer immediately filed a lawsuit in
Delaware, where most big companies are incorporated, contesting a
$2 billion break-up fee. William Steere, Pfizer's chairman, said
Thursday in an interview that Pfizer's offer was contingent on the
fee being removed. He called the break-up fee ``egregious and
unheard of'' for a deal of that size.

 &HT;    Auburn's men, Lady Vols top preseason poll
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Auburn's men and Tennessee's women are the
preseason picks to win SEC championships.
</P>
<P>
   In the media poll at the annual SEC tipoff meetings, the
Tennessee women got 16 first-place votes, while Georgia received
four to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn men got 40 first-place votes to finish atop the
Western Division, while Florida received 30 to lead the Eastern
Division. Georgia was picked to finish fifth in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's Chris Porter led all vote-getters on the men's
preseason all-conference team, followed by teammate Doc Robinson.
The others on the preseason team are Florida's Mike Miller,
Tennessee's Tony Harris and Kentucky's Jamaal Magloire. Porter was
chosen player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tamika Catchings of Tennessee headed up the women's team, with
Auburn's Conswella Sparrow the second-leading vote-getter. The
other women on the team are Georgia's Kelly Miller, Semeka Randall
of Tennessee and Florida's Tonya Washington. Catchings was chosen
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   NO PRESSURE
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's Tubby Smith says son Saul can handle any kind of
pressure this year when he starts at point guard. ``Unlike other
players, he's lived with me over the years. He's seen up close what
it's all about. He's seen me lose and he's seen me win. Point guard
is the area I'm least concerned with this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the Wildcats won't have a set lineup this year.
``Ordinarily I like to stick with a set lineup, but you'll see our
lineup changing more this year than in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of players who are equal in talent.''
</P>
<P>
   HAIR APPARENT
</P>
<P>
   Porter says he sports a big Afro for a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Samson, my strength is in my hair,'' the 6-foot-7 senior
said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter obviously needed all the strength he could find. He said
he shot 350 jump shots a day during his summer workouts, in hope of
extending his game.
</P>
<P>
   WE'RE FOR REAL
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's big 1998-99 season was ``a beautiful story,'' coach
Cliff Ellis said. ``Last year, people kept wondering when we would
fold. Last year, there was nobody that had us in any poll. In
February, we were ranked No. 2 in the country. Folks kept saying,
'When will they fold?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to be 17-0, and then we lost and everybody said,
`Ah-ha.' But we responded with eight straight wins after that.''
</P>
<P>
   JOB SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson says he enjoys being an underdog
in the SEC. ``The only reason we aren't total underdogs is because
of tradition,'' he said. ``Tradition sometimes gets you things you
don't deserve. People figure you've been there before, so you will
probably get there again. Tradition will also get you fired.''
</P>
<P>
   THE RECORD IS DECEIVING
</P>
<P>
   Although her team was 11-16 and 0-14 in the SEC last year, South
Carolina senior Annie Lester said the Lady Gamecocks might be the
most improved team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   A former standout at Meadowcreek High School, Lester has a
career average of 13.8 points a game and is one of South Carolina's
top returnees, along with her sister, sophomore Jocelyn Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the program are three big Eastern European standouts
and former Tennessee center Teresa Jeter, who is sitting out her
transfer season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, South Carolina was picked to finish last in a preseason
media poll. ``Losing is not a good feeling,'' Lester said. ``But I
think we were a better team than our record showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been picked to finish last. This year, we want to
prove a lot of people wrong.''

IS THERE A HOME-HORSE ADVANTAGE? BET ON IT

<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Everybody is looking for an angle in the
South Florida breezes this week, an easy yet winning approach to
betting on the Breeders' Cup, which appears on Daily Racing Form
paper to be as difficult as ever before.
</P>
<P>
   May we suggest one possible approach?
</P>
<P>
   Sheer, shameless, unmitigated provincialism.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a horse _ or jockey or trainer _ in a major national
event because he's from your local track is not the kind of
handicapping they write books about. Rooting blindly for the home
team is one thing. Risking money blindly on the home team is just
plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Did you know you could have turned a solid profit on past
Breeders' Cups simply by betting on every horse who (a.) was
favored on the tote board and (b.) ran his prep race at a
California track?
</P>
<P>
   It's true, and here's why it might continue to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Human nature causes people to be more impressed by winners we
saw with our own binocular-aided eyes than the ones we watched on
some simulcast television set or read about in the paper. Human
nature causes people to feel more strongly about the losing horses'
excuses we jotted down on our own track programs than the ones we
heard from a professional handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Breeders' Cup rolls around and the best
thoroughbreds come in from all over the continent and globe to face
off, it's natural that Californians tend to back Californians, New
Yorkers tend to back New Yorkers, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what if one side of the country tended to bet more money
than the other, or if one side backed its own horses more
enthusiastically than the other?
</P>
<P>
   Then, under the immutable, mathematical laws of the parimutuel
system, the odds on horses from the one side would tend to be lower
than their true chances of winning, while the odds on horses from
the other would tend to be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Does this happen? Well, with only 15 Breeders' Cups in the
books, it's hard to draw conclusions with any certainty.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what seems to happen: New York and surrounding
states, with more of the country's major racetracks and more fans
contributing to the Breeders' Cup mutuel pool, drive down the odds
on horses from that region and raise the odds on horses from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, that's a plausible explanation for the following:
</P>
<P>
   In past Breeders' Cups, 52 horses who prepped in the New
York-New Jersey-Pennsylvania area have run as post-time favorites,
17 have won (a normal percentage) and they've produced a 26 percent
loss on win bets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 15 horses who prepped in California _ usually at
Santa Anita _ have run as post-time favorites, seven have won
(that's a lot) and they've produced a 24 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, favorites from Kentucky (8 wins in 14 tries) have returned
a 39 percent profit and favorites from European countries (6 for
19) have eked out a 3 percent dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Looking closer, you find that based on past Breeders' Cup
results, horses coming off New York-area races have seemed to be
most heavily overbet in the Classic, winning just 4 of 14 as
favorites; the only California-prepped favorite, Ferdinand in 1987
at Hollywood Park, won.
</P>
<P>
   In the two previous Breeders' Cups held in Florida, New
York-area horses went a weak 1 for 8, the victory coming in the
1992 Classic with A.P. Indy, a California-based 3-year-old who
prepped in New York's Jockey Club Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   All of which probably sounds technical _ trust me, I sport
neither a green eyeshade nor a pocket protector while typing this _
and might or might not be significant as you dive into Saturday's
races.
</P>
<P>
   But it suggests you'll have history and human nature on your
side if you back these three favorites: Forest Camp, 3-1 on the
morning line in the Juvenile after running an educational second in
the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita; Chilukki, 8-5 in the Juvenile
Fillies after making the Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita her sixth
victory in a row; and Brave Act, 7-2 in the Mile on turf after
running a troubled third in the Oak Tree Mile at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach to betting college football is not
recommended this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (going into Thursday's races): David
Flores, 25; Alex Solis, 24; Garrett Gomez, 15; Gary Stevens, 14;
Chris McCarron, 13. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 17; Ron McAnally and
Bill Spawr, 11; Richard Mandella, 8; Doug Peterson and John Sadler,
7. &QL; 
On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $100,000 Morvich
Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 6{ furlongs on turf; Sunday, $250,000
Las Palmas Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1[ miles on turf;
Monday, $65,000 Skywalker Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1 mile. At
Gulfstream Park: today, eight stakes with purses totaling $975,000;
Saturday, eight Breeders' Cup races totaling $13 million; Sunday,
eight stakes totaling $1.05 million. &QL; 
Mileposts: The Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita ends Monday. Cavonnier
might make another comeback in the Skywalker that day. Hollywood
Park opens Wednesday and runs to Dec. 20. First post is 12:30 p.m.
almost every day. The first two Friday cards will be held at
night.... Santa Anita gates will open at 7:30 a.m. Saturday. First
live race is scheduled for 9:15; Santa Anita will run two live
races before and five live races after the Breeders' Cup, which
starts on TV at 10:10.... Top Northern California jockey Russell
Baze is out for the rest of the year after injuring his back in an
accident Sunday at Bay Meadows. Baze, with 346 victories in 1999,
will see his string of 400-win seasons end at a record seven. He
suffered a compressed vertebra and a hairline fracture when Rural
Charmer clipped heels with Buckaroo Bandit and fell near the
five-sixteenths pole. Baze's 6,782 career wins rank eighth
all-time.... The top Santa Anita jockeys set to ride in Arcadia on
Saturday _ not at the Breeders' Cup _ are Hall of Famers Laffit
Pincay and Eddie Delahoussaye, tied for sixth in the standings with
11 wins.... With Pincay 30 wins from Bill Shoemaker's 8,833, Santa
Anita is challenging fans to guess the day and race in which he
breaks the record. Entries will be taken starting Saturday. A tie
will go to the earliest entrant. Prize: $8,834. &QL;

NO JOY IN SEATTLE: MIGHTY GRIFFEY HAS CUT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Baseball fans here used to say their town had the
game's very best player and its very worst stadium. Then that
player, Ken Griffey Jr., led the team on a memorable playoff run in
1995 that was a huge factor in the city's decision to forsake the
tomb-like Kingdome and build the state-of-the-art Safeco Field, a
baseball Xanadu that opened in July and is the most expensive
ballpark in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past few days, as fans have come to the team store at
Safeco to buy whatever Griffey memorabilia they could find,
Seattleites were trying hard to adjust to some bitter news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unbelievable,'' said Monte Condon, a 42-year-old
truck driver and season-ticket holder. ``Here we are in the House
that Griffey Built, and now Griffey's leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceding to their franchise player's request to play in a city
nearer his family's permanent home in Orlando, Fla., the Mariners
announced on Tuesday that they were putting their 10-time all-star
up for a trade. Griffey, who turns 30 in two weeks, rejected an
eight-year, $135 million deal that would have made him the
highest-paid player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll get the next Ken Griffey Jr. in this trade,'' the
Mariners' president, Chuck Armstrong, said at the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that hopeful aside, the long faces worn by Armstrong and
other club officials expressed their true feelings. ``For me, it's
pretty emotionally devastating,'' Armstrong said. ``He has come to
personify the Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any other city, Seattle has plenty of other things on its
mind these days.
</P>
<P>
   A shooting at a shipyard office on Wednesday left two people
dead and the killer still at large Thursday, prompting a wave of
fear across the city. On Tuesday, voters passed a statewide antitax
measure that all but did away with car taxes, handing a budget
crisis to Gov. Gary Locke and the state Legislature. And Seattle is
somewhat nervously gearing up for a meeting of the World Trade
Organization, at which protest groups are vowing to mobilize tens
of thousands of people in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, the Griffey departure remains huge news here.
It made for a banner headline in The Post-Intelligencer on
Wednesday, and it remains a subject of wide discussion, although
one that the shootings and the manhunt certainly keep in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But at the team store at Safeco Field, Griffey memorabilia has
been selling at two to three times its normal rate, said Tim Hevly,
a club spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Tsue, a 30-year-old Seattle resident who recently graduated
from business school, was stocking up with a Ken Griffey Jr.
pennant, five Griffey posters, a Griffey ``headliner'' figurine and
two toddler T-shirts with Griffey's name and number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sad to think we'll never see him in a Mariner
uniform again,'' Tsue said. ``I'm not even all that mad at him for
going _ he's got his own life to live and all that _ but it's
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Just where Griffey is headed remains uncertain. The Cincinnati
Reds, in his hometown, are interested, and so is Atlanta, which
creates the possibility that the man who is widely regarded as
having the best chance of breaking Hank Aaron's career home run
record of 755 may pursue that quest in the city where Aaron, who
played for the Atlanta Braves, set the record.
</P>
<P>
   For Griffey to leave Seattle is an unquestionable blow to the
city, a bit like the Chicago Bulls giving up Michael Jordan or the
Denver Broncos trading John Elway in his prime, with one notable
exception _ as great a player as Griffey is, he never led his team,
the way those two players did, to the world championship. (In their
thrilling run in 1995, the Mariners made it as far as the American
League championship series.)
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some fans saw hope in the prospect of a Griffey
trade. With the money from his salary possibly freed up, the
Mariners might be able to acquire some hot young prospects or even
some good bullpen pitching, which has been notorious in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other teams have made it to the World Series without
Ken Griffey Jr.,'' Pam Nomura, who took her 11-year-old son to 25
home games this season, said hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that Griffey might stay in the House that
Griffey Built, where his home run average of 1 in every 3 games was
slightly higher than the pace of 1 per 3.1 games he set in the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   While Griffey says he wants to play for a team that has its
spring-training camps in Florida and is much nearer his home than
Seattle (the major league city farthest from Orlando), the Mariners
want to get top value for their star. If they do not, they could
balk at a trade, and pay him the $8.5 million he is due for the
remaining year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, and if Griffey is sullen and the team starts
losing, ``the biggest seller out at Safeco will be Pepto-Bismol,''
said Vinnie Richichi, who is more commonly known as New York Vinnie
(he is originally from Jackson Heights, Queens) and is the host of
a popular sports-radio talk show on KIRO-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Richichi said there was a 10 percent chance that Griffey will be
back in a Mariners uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they came out of the box and won a lot of games,'' he
said, ``the fans would forget all this. Winning generally cures a
lot.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With a bitter blast at Israel, Roman Catholic and
Orthodox Christian leaders here said on Thursday that they would
close their churches for two days to protest a government decision
to permit construction of a mosque on state land next to the Church
of the Annunciation in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Building a mosque ``only a few meters away'' from the venerated
Roman Catholic church would be an act ``of clear discrimination
against the Christian community,'' their statement said.
</P>
<P>
   They contrasted Nazareth's 500 years of ``peaceful coexistence
between Christians and Muslims'' under Ottoman rule with the
atmosphere of ``intolerance and tension'' that they said
characterizes the city today.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was signed by the three most influential Christian
clerics in Jerusalem: Dideros I, the Greek Orthodox patriarch;
Torkon Manoogian, the Armenian patriarch, and Michel Sabbah, the
Latin Patriarch. A fourth signatory was the local head of the Roman
Catholic Franciscan order, who has traditional responsibility for
Catholic sites in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``To express the disapprobation of all the churches at the way
that their rights have been violated, we wish to inform our
faithful masses as well as pilgrims that all the sanctuaries of the
Holy Land will be closed on Nov. 22 and 23,'' the patriarchs said.
``We trust that we do not need to take any further steps in the
near future, and that the government will rise to the challenge by
applying law and order for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpreted as a clear warning about the possible cancellation
of millennial celebrations in Israel next year, the announcement
was pointedly directed to ``all ambassadors, local Christians,
Christian pilgrims and travel agents in the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reference to the Holy Land, the closure will not
affect churches in Bethlehem or any other area under Palestinian
rule, said Wadie Abunassar, a spokesman for the Latin Patriarch,
which represents Roman Catholic interests here. Churches will be
closed in Israeli-held East Jerusalem, including the old walled
city center, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entity to be punished by this action is Israel,''
Abunassar said. ``The Palestinians have proven that they are better
at protecting minority rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Muslims in Nazareth have been camped out for a year on the
site proposed for the mosque, a site they say has historic
associations with Saladin, the Muslim warrior who drove out the
Crusaders in the region's last millennial upheaval. For Catholics,
the disputed vacant lot is their cathedral's front plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic, ecclesiastical and municipal political battle over
the mosque plan set off riots in Nazareth last Easter, and has led
to rising tension since between the Catholic Church and the Israeli
government. In their first concerted attempt to block the mosque
plan, Catholic and Orthodox churches closed their doors for one day
last Spring. Vatican officials recently suggested that it could
provoke the cancellation of a visit to Nazareth planned in March by
Pope John Paul II, who would be the first Roman Catholic pontiff to
visit Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials persuaded local Muslim leaders to greatly
scale back their plans _ the minarets as originally conceived would
have towered over the neighboring church spires _ and to delay
construction until after Christian celebrations of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Christian hierarchy here, any mosque at the
Annunciation site would be a deliberate affront. They have
portrayed the decision to permit construction as an electorally
motivated move to placate the newly assertive Muslim majority in
Nazareth, which had long been dominated economically and
demographically by Christians. &QL;

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Use of melatonin to help ease insomnia debated
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Beatrice Goldstein spends most nights
bumping around her Delray Beach home, wandering between the
kitchen, the bedroom and the den _ everywhere it seems except off
to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 15 years of insomnia, Goldstein said she has
tried almost every cure offered. Recently, her son, a respiratory
therapist, suggested melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it can't hurt,'' she said. ``Well, it didn't help
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the usefulness of melatonin as a sleep aid rages
well beyond the Goldstein home. Within the last week, two eminent
research laboratories issued opposing conclusions after studying
the need to replace this nocturnal secretion of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't results from Harvard Medical School jibe with those
taken at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology?
</P>
<P>
   ``Science certainly can be confusing,'' said Dr. Andrew Monjan,
chief of the neurobiology of aging branch of the National Institute
on Aging. The institute paid for both studies and Monjan said he is
now asking the researchers to attempt to reconcile their differing
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT study was presented to the Society of Neuroscience on
Oct. 27 in Miami Beach by Dr. Richard Wurtman. Harvard's results,
written by Dr. Charles Czeisler, were published today in the
American Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Melatonin is sold in health food stores and marketed as
effective for a variety of ills, including insomnia, cancer, AIDS
and Alzheimer's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers agree that the substance may be effective for
combating jet lag and some forms of insomnia. At issue is whether
melatonin production in the brain naturally declines as people age.
</P>
<P>
   MIT reports that it does. Harvard counters that it does not.
</P>
<P>
   So what is an insomniac to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who is recommending melatonin until
there is some definitive study,'' said Bill Traylor, a respiratory
therapist who works in the sleep disorder clinic at Delray Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Traylor addressed more than 100 seniors who went to a
suburban Palm Beach County library looking for a good night's
sleep. Mostly Traylor was peppered with questions from people tired
of being tired. They asked about the effects of pain, medication
and snoring.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor recommended lifestyle changes, such as creating a
bedtime routine, and told his audience to ask their doctors for
relief.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against finding relief in a bottle on a shelf
at the health food store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melatonin is just an herb,'' Traylor said. ``And it is making
some people a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Goldstein is giving melatonin a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pharmaceutical companies are doing all right by me
already,'' she said.

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The highest court in Massachusetts faced a case
Thursday that called for the wisdom of King Solomon:
</P>
<P>
   Who, by rights, controlled the frozen vial containing four
specks of embryonic cells? The 44-year-old mother, known in court
papers only as B.Z., who wanted to try to become pregnant with
them? Or the father, A.Z., her ex-husband, who does not want to
have more children with her?
</P>
<P>
   The case of A.Z. vs. B.Z., whose oral arguments were presented
Thursday before the Supreme Judicial Court, is a first for
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But such cases are becoming common nationwide, leading to the
initial makings of a legal consensus on such charged questions as
whether, say, a woman's constitutional right to have children is
greater than her now-unwilling ex-husband's constitutional right
not to be forced to beget them.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, experts say, similar courtroom disputes have
occurred in Illinois, Michigan, Texas, Alabama and New Jersey. Each
had its own wrinkle, but all hinged on control of embryos that were
created to help infertile couples with in vitro fertilization
procedures, frozen for later use and then overtaken by divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable, since we have 150,000 or more embryos
frozen, that couples' circumstances change and a divorce results,
and there's a battle over the embryos,'' said Lori Andrews, a
professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law and author of ``The Clone
Age'' (Henry Holt, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts case stands out because the wife has seven
consent forms signed by her ex-husband, saying in part that if the
couple separated, the embryos reverted to her. If courts eventually
rule in her favor, it will be the first time a state's highest
court has ruled in favor of the parent who wants the embryos
implanted over the other parent's objections.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far, the husband has won. A family court judge ruled in
his favor, saying in part that because the couple had had twins
since their agreement, and then divorced, circumstances had changed
and he should not be held to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of laws governing this form of conception, and in
the near-absence of lawmakers willing to write them, judges have
largely muddled through, and rulings have tended to flip-flop from
one level to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Each judge might draw different conclusions, for example, about
whether embryos should be treated as property or people, or whether
a woman should have more control over an embryo than a man should.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say a consensus of sorts seems to be emerging,
though it is non-binding and has arisen among state courts that
watch each other's decisions as they make their own.
</P>
<P>
   When the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court weighs in, that
common understanding is expected to advance another step.
</P>
<P>
   At least two precedents have emerged, legal specialists say:
that embryos are considered neither children nor property, but
rather a ``special entity'' with the potential for life. And that
whenever possible, the agreement a couple signs with an infertility
clinic about what to do with their embryos if the couple divorce or
die should be considered a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too few cases to call it a consensus, but there does
seem to be a consistency among the few high state courts that have
considered it that those two principles should govern,'' said Susan
L. Crockin, a Massachusetts lawyer specializing in reproductive
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crockin would add a third area of agreement: that the
special rights that abortion law gives a woman over the embryo
growing in her body do not apply when the embryo is in a freezer,
so the father and mother should have equal rights over what is done
with it.
</P>
<P>
   State courts have ruled that those equal rights can shift, if
the embryos seem be a potential parent's only chance to have
biological children.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. John A. Robertson of the University of Texas, a leading
authority on such cases, recently wrote, ``The party wishing to
discard wins, unless there is no other way for the party seeking
implantation to reproduce.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the arguments in the Massachusetts case. Gretchen
Van Ness, B.Z.'s lawyer, told the Supreme Judicial Court Thursday
that her client would turn 45 next year, the fertility clinic's
cut-off age for implantation of frozen embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took her over 10 years to create those embryos,'' she said.
``She doesn't have time to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial court judge, Anthony R. Nesi of Suffolk County Probate
and Family Court, ruled that because the couple had already had
children, the harm done the husband by being forced to become a
parent, which would include financial obligations, outweighed the
wife's desire to have more children. It would also be unfair to a
child to be unwanted by one of its parents, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the two state Supreme Court rulings that are
considered the precedents in such cases, one in Tennessee and one
in New York, ultimately allowed the embryos to be implanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstances were different in each. In the New York
case, Kass vs. Kass, the wife had signed an agreement that the
embryos would be donated to research, then changed her mind. And in
the Tennessee case, Davis vs. Davis, in which there was no written
agreement, the wife was seeking to donate the embryos rather than
have them implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Massachusetts, most of the justices' questions Thursday
concerned whether the agreements A.Z. signed could be considered
valid.
</P>
<P>
   He had testified earlier in family court that they had not been
filled out when he signed them and that after he saw them, his wife
had crossed out the boilerplate choices offered by the clinic _
that the embryos be destroyed or donated _ and filled in that they
should revert to her, without informing him.
</P>
<P>
   The wife, in contrast, testified that the changes reflected a
joint decision.
</P>
<P>
   Such focus on contract law may seem dry when the stakes are tiny
points of potential life.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Van Ness said that an emphasis was appropriate, however,
because decisions about children and marriage rightly belong in a
``zone of privacy'' where private decisions, rather than the state,
should rule.
</P>
<P>
   The couple ``are in this private agreement stating their deepest
held feelings about what these embryos mean to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A.Z., the father, was not represented in court Thursday. His
lawyer from the trial court, Paula H. Noe, said in a telephone
interview that she had tried to reach him and failed, and he was
``not participating for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Noe said, she thought the high court would
uphold the lower court ruling. Her side had argued both that no
valid contract existed, for reasons ranging from the change in
circumstances to A.Z.'s habit of signing blank consent forms, and
that B.Z. could have a child using donor sperm or adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other lawyers and judges in such cases, Ms. Noe
pleaded for federal or legislative guidance: ``I think clear
direction is necessary because if we're going to do this on a state
by state basis, it's going to take 42 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, two new laws may be on the horizon. Bills are pending
in the New York and New Jersey legislatures that would require
clients at in vitro fertilization clinics to sign explicit forms
about what they want done with their frozen embryos in case of
their divorce or death.
</P>
<P>
   The contract would function much like a living will, said Neil
M. Cohen, the sponsor of the bill in New Jersey, forcing people to
think things through in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody has relied on the courts trying to deal with
this situation, but it became abundantly clear that the courts are
not equipped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was spurred, he said, by the New Jersey case, in which a
divorcing wife wanted embryos destroyed and the husband objected. A
Camden County superior court judge ruled in the wife's favor last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Ms. Van Ness said Thursday she hoped the
Supreme Judicial Court, which has put the case on a legal fast
track, would decide it within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One more precedent will be welcome, legal experts say. For all
the cumulative rulings, ``I don't think we've gotten all that
far,'' said Alexander Capron, university professor of law and
medicine at the University of Southern California. ``This whole
area continues to be a real headache for everybody.''

SUSPENSION OF MILITARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND U.S. TO END 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China and the United States have agreed to resume
military relations suspended by Beijing last May when NATO bombed
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Secretary of Defense William Cohen
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every indication they would like to resume
military-to-military contacts,''he said. ``I am hopeful that they
can come about soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese agreed to remove this irritation in relations with
Washington last week during a visit by Deputy Undersecretary of
State Thomas Pickering to Beijing. For its part, the Clinton
administration is trying to repair the relationship by completing a
deal to insure that China becomes a member of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of reconciliation, the U.S. Navy destroyer O'Brien
visited Hong Kong this week at China's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said that the two countries have yet to agree on how
they will go about reviving the full military relationship, which
has included high-level visits, port calls, joint exercises and
negotiations on maritime rules.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Kurt Campbell, the deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Asian affairs, will visit China this month to pave the
way for formal negotiations on resuming military-to-military
relations. Those talks could come as soon as January, said Kenneth
Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to work out the details, including the details of
when a defense consultative committee or team will get together to
actually figure out what the next steps are,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said he would like to exchange visits with Defense
Minister Chi Haotian ``when the conditions permit.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July the United States agreed to pay China $4.5 million in
compensation for the victims of NATO's bombing of the embassy and
are now discussing compensation for the destroyed embassy building.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were killed and 27 wounded in the bombing, which
provoked a serious crisis in relations between Washington and
Beijing and led to angry anti-U.S. demonstrations in the Chinese
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese rejected Washington's explanation that the May 7
bombing was an accident, caused by poor intelligence and
last-minute demands for new targets during the NATO air war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   China postponed all meetings with the United States on human
rights, security issues, including military-to-military ties, and
China's membership in the World Trade Organization. But after
repeated apologies and several telephone calls from President
Clinton, the Chinese began to relent. In their meeting in
September, Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin seemed
determined to restore normal relations.
</P>
<P>
   And this week the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended
that retired Adm. Joseph W. Prueher be confirmed as the next
ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
   That post has been empty since July with the departure of former
Ambassador James Sasser. China delayed giving its approval to
Prueher's nomination, reflecting its continued anger over the
embassy bombing. As former commander of the U.S. forces in the
Pacific, Prueher was active in deepening military-to-military
relations with China, but also oversaw the sending of U.S.warships
to waters near Taiwan in 1996 when China launched a series of
provocative missile tests in the area.

   DRUG GIANTS' MERGER DEAL PROMPTS OFFER FROM PFIZER
</P>
<P>
   Hours after executives of American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert announced a $70 billion merger agreement, Pfizer
attempted to break the deal up with a $82.4 billion hostile bid for
Warner-Lambert. Analysts who follow the pharmaceutical industry
cautioned that a higher offer could yet emerge for Warner-Lambert,
either from American Home or Pfizer or another drug company.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE APPROVES FINANCIAL MEASURE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved legislation that opens the door for a new
era on Wall Street in which commercial banks, securities houses and
insurers will find it easier and cheaper to enter one another's
businesses. The House of Representatives was discussing the matter
at press time and was expected to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY POSTS DECLINE IN EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney said that profits for its fourth quarter and full
year fell sharply, hurt by slumping sales of home videos and Disney
merchandise, and that its profit for the next year would be flat.
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, said that he was shifting the
company's emphasis away from adding new businesses and properties.
Shares of Disney climbed 62.5 cents, to $27.50.

Nasdaq gained 27.44 points, to 3,055.95. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 30.51 points, to 10,639.57. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index advanced 7.71 points, to 1,362.64.

   BELL ATLANTIC AND GTE NAME TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and GTE, which are merging, announced a tentative
senior executive team that, at least numerically, is drawn equally
from Bell Atlantic and GTE. Executives from Bell Atlantic appeared
to win the top operational and financial jobs while senior GTE
executives will largely control staff functions that have less
effect on the combined company's quarter-to-quarter financial
results. Last year, the companies announced that Charles Lee, GTE's
chairman, and Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman, would

MCCAIN TO BEGIN MAJOR TV AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Trying to capitalize on his growing prospects
in the Republican presidential race, John McCain's campaign will
launch a major advertising buy on Boston television beginning
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator is the first of the eight candidates for
president to go on the air in the Boston market, which reaches into
vote-rich southern New Hampshire. He is also ratcheting up his
advertising on WMUR-TV in Manchester, as well as going up on
WNNE-TV in Burlington, Vt., to target the western side of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   All told, his 60-second biographical spot should reach 90
percent of all households in the state about 11 times, said Greg
Stevens, McCain's media adviser. Additional 30-second ads will be
added to the mix later, he said, with the total buy expected to
approach $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, McCain has been moving up steadily in the
polls, emerging as the most significant threat to front-runner
George W. Bush, the Texas governor. Thursday, a poll released by
Franklin Pierce College and WNDS-TV in Derry, put McCain within
eight points of Bush, the narrowest margin to date. The margin of
error in the poll is 6 percent. McCain advisers said they hope the
advertising will cement his gains and further propel his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any disputing that we have some
momentum,'' Stevens said. ``If there's anybody in the field who's
been gaining ground in the last two months it's John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The full-court advertising press comes at a time when Bush has
been showing some vulnerability. He skipped two Republican forums
in Durham and Hanover and has been criticized by supporters and
opponents for not spending enough time in New Hampshire. Bush said
this week he will spend much more time in the first-in-the-nation
primary state, but his aides have also explained that he is running
a national campaign and needs to travel around the country, too.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, McCain has made New Hampshire his top priority,
followed by South Carolina and California. He has virtually ignored
Iowa, home of the first party caucuses in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are going to run lots of ads, but ultimately this
race is going to be decided on the ground by the voters who have a
chance to look the candidate in the eye and ask that candidate a
question,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, McCain completed his 19th trip to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the money that Bush has, and he doesn't have
the heavy hitters in the state like Bush has lined up,'' said Andy
Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.
``What he has is a whole lot of energy and enthusiasm right now.
He's done well in the polls so far because he's gotten out and
gotten his face known.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush just completed his sixth trip to the state. And while
McCain has concentrated his efforts on answering voters' questions
at town-hall style forums, Bush has limited his question-and-answer
sessions. In Littleton, Tuesday night at the Elks Lodge, the
governor took six questions before deciding it was time to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two more questions, then I got to go to bed,'' Bush said. It
was 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday in Meredith what he thought of McCain's
rise in the polls, Bush said he was not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good fella, he's a good man,'' Bush said. ``I always
expected there was gonna be a contest in this state, there always
is in New Hampshire politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain is beating Bush to the airwaves in Boston, his
campaign aides acknowledge that the Texas governor has the upper
hand when it comes to money. Bush has raised about $57.7 million
and McCain has raised about $9.4 million, according to the most
recent Federal Election Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we're still huge underdogs and Bush has
millions of dollars, scads of endorsements from party bosses, and
governors and former ambassadors and a phalanx of advance people
and a large security detail and we're just running with the
people's army,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political director.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising spot being broadcast from Boston is not a new
one. It tells McCain's story of being shot down over Hanoi during
the Vietnam War and spending five and a half years in a prison
camp. The campaign hopes that story will persuade voters that he is
a man of principle, who should be believed when he says he wants to
take on the establishment and defy special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are only three other candidates who are
advertising on television in New Hampshire: Bush, Steve Forbes, and
Vice President Al Gore.

 &HT;    Notre Dame doesn't faze Vols
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Growing up in Chicago, Dwayne Goodrich
learned at an early age about the mystique of Notre Dame football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame was everything to us,'' Tennessee's All-SEC
cornerback said. ``Touchdown Jesus. The Gold Dome. If you cared
anything about college football, that was where you wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Goodrich grew older, his perspective changed and, like a
lot of other great players, he decided to come South.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, this was where the best football was being
played,''Goodrich said. ``So I wanted to be down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The college game unquestionably has changed over the last
generation. Those changes are evident in the opponents Satuday
night _ Notre Dame and Tennessee (7:30 p.m., ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   For much of the century, Notre Dame exemplified football
excellence and tradition. Seven Heisman Trophy winners and 11
national championships were enough to put even the biggest of
opponents in awe.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year of the '90s, the balance of power in
college football has shifted. Notre Dame last won the national
championship 11 years ago. When the Irish arrive at Neyland Stadium
on Saturday night, the Tennessee players won't have stars in their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't follow Notre Dame and don't know all that much
about them,'' running back Jamal Lewis from Atlanta said. ``I
watched them on TV a little bit but didn't pay attention. It just
wasn't one of the places I thought about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame's got some tradition, but we have a lot of
tradition down here, too,'' defense tackle Darwin Walker said. ``We
think we play football here as (well) as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Irish (5-3) play in several difficult venues,
including the Big House at Michigan, which seats more than 110,000
people. But the fans in Ann Arbor do not approach the loudness or
intensity that Notre Dame players will hear and feel Saturday night
when they walk into the den of the defending national champions.
More than 107,000 Vol fanatics will be there to offer them some
``Southern hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie sees the game as an opportunity for a
team trying to find itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we ever wanted out of this season was to get to November
and play some games that mean something,'' said Davie, whose team
has rallied from a 1-3 start. ``This is a game that if we can win,
it will mean a lot to us and to our program. We think we are
getting better. This is our opportunity to find out how good we
really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will be favored, but coach Phillip Fulmer does not
expect an easy night. During the '90s, the Volunteers have lost
only two November games. One was to Notre Dame, which beat the Vols
in Knoxville 34-29 in 1990. The next year Tennessee returned the
favor, knocking off the Irish 35-34 in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our kids are going to be in awe but we are
respectful, just like any other team that comes here,''Fulmer said.
``We play a lot of big games around here, and this one is as big as
any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have a lot at stake. Notre Dame is back in the
rankings at No. 24 after squeaking by Navy 28-24 last week. The
Irish, who had close losses to Michigan, Michigan State, and
Purdue, are looking to go back to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (6-1) probably has no shot at winning its third SEC
title in a row, as Florida will go to the championship game if it
can beat Vanderbilt on Saturday and South Carolina on Nov. 13. But
the Vols still have an outside shot of getting back in the national
championship race.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee also still is in line for an at-large spot in one of
the BCS bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our goals for this season are still out there for
us,'' Fulmer said. ``We have to keep playing hard every week.''

PRESSED BY REPORTER, BUSH FALLS SHORT IN WORLD AFFAIRS QUIZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush could not name several
foreign leaders when he was hit with a pop quiz by a Boston
television reporter, according to a report by the television
station on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hiller, the reporter for WHDH-TV in Boston who administered
the impromptu test, asked Bush in an interview on Wednesday if he
could identify the top person in power in four countries or regions
that have recently encountered turmoil and been in the news:
Taiwan, Chechnya, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, seemingly knew the answer for Taiwan _ Lee Teng-hui _
but not the others, and tried to turn the tables on Hiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you name the foreign minister of Mexico?'' asked Bush,
whose familiarity with that country is abetted by its shared border
with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Hiller answered, ``but I would say to that, I'm not
running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most persistent criticisms that has been levied
against the 53-year-old Texas governor is that he is not
knowledgeable enough about foreign policy to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who never held elective office before becoming governor in
1995, has inadvertently fueled that charge with references to
Greeks as Grecians and East Timorese as East Timorians.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said Bush's
trouble with Hiller's questions _ which, she said, few Americans
could answer _ proved nothing about his fitness for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the American people,'' Ms. Hughes said, ``the relevant
question isn't how many names of foreign leaders a candidate knows,
but whether he has the strategic vision for America's role in the
world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the television interview, Bush also offered an assessment of
the situation in Pakistan, where Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power
in a coup d'etat last month, that some foreign policy experts would
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, failing to name the general, said, ``It appears this guy
is going to bring stability to the country, and I think that's good
news for the subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush referred to the Taiwanese president simply as ``Lee.'' Bush
could not name the leader of the breakaway Russian state of
Chechnya, who is Aslan Maskhadov, or the new, recently elected
prime minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has no monopoly on foreign flubs among Republican
presidential candidates. At a ceremony a week and a half ago, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona twice referred to the Czech Republic as
Czechoslovakia, a nation that ceased to exist after Jan. 1, 1993,
when it became two separate states _ the Czech Republic and
Slovakia.

NEW NOSE STRIPS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ When D. Wayne Lukas heard about racehorses
wearing nasal strips _ like the ones two-legged athletes use to
open up the air passages _ he laughed as hard as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Whoa, I've seen all the gimmicks ...,' '' the Hall of
Fame trainer said this week.
</P>
<P>
   What next? Horses with eye black, knee pads, sweatbands?
</P>
<P>
   But Lukas isn't sure it's a joke anymore. He plans to affix the
strips to his seven horses in Saturday's Breeders' Cup races at
Gulfstream Park, including Cat Thief in the Classic and contender
Surfside in the Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers Bobby Frankel (four horses) and Joe Orseno (three) also
plan to use the strips, essentially larger and darker-colored
versions of the white Band-Aid-like items humans wear.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three is convinced the strips will make a
difference. Or that they won't. None of the three has used them
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, it might help and it won't hurt,'' Lukas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The strips were sent to trainers all over the country last month
by the same company that makes the product for people. Their
arrival caused surprising controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida, Kentucky and other states approved their use,
California and New York racing officials said no for now, citing
questions about whether the betting public had to be informed of
their addition and removal (as is the case with certain medications
and with blinkers though not with other equipment changes).
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita stewards ordered Frankel to remove a nasal strip
affixed to a filly named Zante in the Santa Anita paddock before an
Oct. 28 race. Zante finished second in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said (to the stewards), `Why? You let 'em run with
everything else _ earmuffs, tongue ties,''' Frankel, still
exasperated, said at Gulfstream. ``If I'd put it on his
(hindquarters), they'd have let me run him. Why worry about a
Band-Aid?
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what it is? It's the human race. Anything they
don't know about, they're frightened of.''
</P>
<P>
   California Horse Racing Board spokesman Mike Marten said
Thursday the matter is under review.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said he'll try a strip on Bouccaneer in one of the
Breeders' Cup-eve stakes races here today, the opener of a special
three-day Gulfstream ``season.'' The Hall of Fame trainer, who
hasn't won a Breeders' Cup race in 31 tries, will run Juddmonte
Farms-owned English import Chester House in the Classic on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's not going to help 'em 10 lengths, but it might
help 'em that much,'' Frankel said, holding his hands inches apart.
``And how often do you get beat by that much?'' Pretty often.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky late last month, horses wearing nasal strips won at
33-1 and 9-1 odds. Inconclusive data, but provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be years before we know if they really make a
difference,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders' Cup officials aren't requiring trainers to declare
their intention to use the strips. No public notification is
planned.
</P>
<P>
   But the strips should be visible low on horses' snouts even if
they wear blinker hoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a hard-core handicapper and your life depends on
knowing everything about a horse, go to the paddock (and look at
the noses),'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COUNTDOWN TO THE BREEDERS' CUP &QL; 
BREEDERS' CUP TURF &QL; 
Pu million; $2.08 million to the winner. &QL; 
Eligible: 3-year-olds and up. &QL; 
Distance: 1\ miles on the main (dirt) track. &QL; 
Record: 1:59.16 by Skip Away in 1997 at Hollywood Park. &QL; 
History: The general public knows the Kentucky Derby; but the
Breeders' Cup Classic is the race of the year for insiders, the
sport's heavyweight championship, the richest U.S. race. Six of the
15 winners were voted Horse of the Year. No Classic loser has
received that title. Memorable Classic moments are Wild Again's
wild victory in the 1984 inaugural, featuring Gate Dancer's
disqualification from second for interfering with Slew o'Gold in
the stretch; Ferdinand's narrow win over Alysheba in the 1987
battle of Derby winners; Alysheba's 1988 win in near darkness at
Churchill Downs; Sunday Silence's grudge-match win over Easy Goer
(1989); French import Arcangue's 133-1 stunner (1993); and the 10th
of Cigar's 16 straight wins (1995). Jerry Bailey rode four out of
five Classic winners from 1991 to 1995. &QL; 
Contenders: Not the race it might have been before midseason
injuries and retirements, Saturday's finale finds New York-based
5-year-old Behrens a lukewarm favorite to clinch the Horse of the
Year title with his fifth win in nine starts. He'll have to beat 13
other horses, including the Bob Baffert-trained duo of 3-year-old
California-bred General Challenge and 6-year-old ex-claimer River
Keen; Arab-owned Almutawakel; and Belmont Stakes winner Lemon Drop
Kid. &QL;

 GREENSPAN CRANES HIS NECK OVER STOCK AND HOME PRICES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, as everyone knows, is always trying to keep
inflation down without sacrificing too much economic growth. The
public debate that accompanies this process focuses on the behavior
of the real economy.
</P>
<P>
   The booming stock market has stretched that focus, of course.
But even so, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, is expressing
greater concern lately about the dangers of a high stock market and
rising home prices.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than in the 1970s or 1980s, the wealth embedded in
stocks and home ownership generates spending, and thus raises the
odds that consumer demand will exceed the nation's supply of labor,
materials and services. Inflation would then accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and his fellow policymakers have argued that case in
the past. And now the chairman has underscored his concern in three
speeches since mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frequency with which he makes this point means that his
not-terribly-successful campaign to talk down the stock market
continues,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and a former
Fed vice chairman. ``He has not given up.''
</P>
<P>
   And if his jawboning doesn't work? If stock prices fail to
decline from present levels, or even resume their climb? Would he
want to raise rates at the next Fed policy meeting, on Nov. 16,
fulfilling an expectation that unsettles the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan himself has probably not decided yet. The Fed tries to
control inflation, or the threat of it, by raising interest rates.
But the target is inflation itself, Fed officials insist, not any
one of the contributors to it, like stock prices. In his recent
speeches, Greenspan has not changed that message. But his remarks
have heightened the profile of stock prices and home prices as
potential contributors to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The economy once drove the stock market; now the opposite is
true. Raising rates is one way to discourage stock buying and
nullify the market's inflationary potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the stock market has become an
important component'' of our discussions, said Edward M. Kelley
Jr., a Fed governor.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's recent speeches outline these discussions, or at
least his decisive contribution to them. New technologies, he
argues, have made corporate management more efficient, and have
raised the level of labor productivity, or the amount of goods,
services and revenue that an average worker produces in an hour.
All this adds to Corporate America's capacity to increase supply
and thus satisfy rising demand.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stock prices reflect this improvement, Greenspan says.
They also reflect a view that stocks are less risky an investment
than in the past and therefore worth more. Both factors, however,
may be unsustainable. Stock prices, in short, may be unjustifiably
high, in bubble territory.
</P>
<P>
   A financial crisis could restore the old risk factor. A stock
that now seems worth $10 may, a few months from now, be fairly
valued at only $8 to a more nervous investor. The ``equity
premium'' will have risen, or, as Greenspan puts it, ``The key
question is whether the recent decline in equity premiums is
permanent or temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   If the improvement is temporary, then stocks will eventually
plunge in some crisis, damaging the economy and also creditors who
have loaned tens of millions of dollars for the purchase of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity-growth trend presents another danger. While it
certainly is at a higher level than in the recent past, that level
cannot keep on rising. When the inevitable plateau comes, Greenspan
warned in one of his speeches, then consumer demand, still driven
by market wealth, ``can accelerate so much that total demand could
rise above even the productivity-augmented'' greater supply of
goods and services. As demand exceeds supply, shortages develop and
prices rise.
</P>
<P>
   A speech on Tuesday added home prices to the mix, but in a
subordinate role to stocks. For every dollar of stock market gain,
consumer outlays are lifted by 3 to 4 cents, Greenspan said, while
higher home prices yield 5 cents for each dollar of gain. But only
``about a sixth of the so-called wealth effect _ that is, the
impact of capital gains on consumer spending _ stems from equity
extracted from the sale of existing homes,'' he said, or the
refinancing of mortgages. The rest comes from the huge, booming
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction adds to the stock market's importance in the
Fed's deliberations. ``Greenspan is not targeting the stock
market,'' said William C. Dudley, a chief economist at Goldman,
Sachs, ``but he is saying the market is an increasingly important
factor in setting interest rates.''

CURMUDGEONS ON CUE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, when I bought a bicycle that cost more than
my first year of college, I realized that I was firmly in the
throes of middle age. I look back on that purchase as an important
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've been advancing on schedule. Earlier this year,
a young clerk at a health food store offered me a free sample of an
herbal supplement for prostate problems.
</P>
<P>
   In case I didn't get the message, the very next day a waiter in
a Chinese restaurant warned me against using much soy sauce. Too
salty and bad for high blood pressure, he told me. I finished
eating and creaked out of the place.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, while watching television with my wife, I
complained that the few shows I liked seemed to be sponsored by
Viagra or bladder-control medications. I also groused that I didn't
recognize half the celebrities on ``Hollywood Squares.'' She
accused me of harboring curmudgeonly tendencies, until I reminded
her that a couple of years ago I had to restrain her from braining
a waiter in Virginia who called her ``dearie.''
</P>
<P>
   From waiters to the minions of Madison Avenue, all kinds of
impersonal, external sources are barraging us with signs that we
are getting older. But these are based on stereotypes, not
individual reality.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants and advertisers had better start getting it right,
however, because as the baby boomers _ with their well-documented
purchasing power and active lifestyles _ start hitting late middle
age and early old age, they are poised to shake up many
preconceived notions about growing older. It remains to be seen
whether the boomers prove any more graceful or successful than
their parents at accepting retirement and elder status.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are a staple for Dr. Ilene Cohen, the director of
psychology at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. For 12 years, she was
the senior psychologist in the hospital's geriatrics outpatient
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cohen, who is 51, is well aware of the signals of aging.
``The trainees and students I deal with seem to be getting younger
and younger,'' she said. ``They could be my children.''
</P>
<P>
   She regularly deals with people, especially men, who have
difficulty accepting retirement. Men, she says, are more prone to
defining themselves by their careers. ``If your sense of power is
defined by your job, retirement changes that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing she stresses the most for successful aging: ``Stay
emotionally connected to other people. Don't allow yourself to
become isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul C. Mims, 76, who retired 18 years ago from teaching high
school English and art history in a Philadelphia suburb, has worked
through many of these problems on his own.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired, his first impression was that he had become
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I announced I was going to retire, it was as if I
was no longer there,'' Mims said. ``The same feeling continued for
a while after I retired. I was no longer in the loop. That feeling
of invisibility lasted until I got a new identity and got involved
in a different kind of world.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mims, who lives in Glen Mills, Pa., with his wife, Ann, 73,
also a retired teacher, that different world involved spending more
time painting; volunteering as a docent at the Brandywine River
Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa., and building a cabin in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mims, a Marine during World War II who is 6 feet 2 inches tall
and has tattoos on both arms, says that despite how others may view
him, he still doesn't feel old psychologically _ although he has
accepted that he can't do physical work the way he used to.
</P>
<P>
   He now faces old age with acceptance. ``Old age isn't joyous but
it's inevitable,'' he said. ``Philosophically and objectively, I
have accepted that I'm going to grow old and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, life has been better for me as an old man than as a
young man. I'm not ragged with free-floating anxiety like I used to
be. I have more money and leisure than I ever had. I have a nice
house. My health is relatively good. Having enough money to live
comfortably is very important _ along with having something
meaningful to do, as well as a sense of humor about it all.''

ZVI GRILICHES, ECONOMIST PLAYED KEY ROLE AT HARVARD; AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zvi Griliches, a pre-eminent empirical economist, died Thursday
at home in Cambridge, Mass. of complications arising from
pancreatic cancer. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor, at 14, of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, he
emigrated first to Palestine, then in 1951 to the United States,
where for five decades he was a central figure in identifying and
measuring the benefits of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role as well in Harvard University's return to
global prominence as a center of economic learning.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griliches was noted for the clarity of his studies of
technological innovation and attendant price changes _ and a
scrupulous honesty about its limitations. Adam Jaffe of Brandeis
University described it as ``almost a way of thinking. You never
entirely believe what you find, but you always learn something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Iain Cockburn of Boston University, who recently compiled a
``family tree of Zvi'' showing the substantial fraction of the
community of measurement economists who had been trained by Mr.
Griliches and his students, lamented tongue-in-cheek the inevitable
(but negligible) imprecision of his study with the family mantra:
``There are, as usual, problems with the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griliches was born in Kaunas, Lithuania. His father was a
chemical engineer whose family's tannery had fallen on hard times.
His mother's family's cigarette factory was prospering, however,
and he was raised with his sister Ellen in comfortable
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of the Germans in 1941, the Jews of Kaunas were
ordered into the ghetto. ``Imagine the Jewish population of Boston
being moved into the river edge part of Watertown, which will be
abandoned by its other inhabitants and surrounded by barbed wire,''
he later described it.
</P>
<P>
   The Griliches family eventually was sent to Stutthof, near
Danzig, then to a work camp in the Dachau system in Bavaria. He was
not yet 15 when, after losing both parents, he saw American troops
led by Gen. George S. Patton liberat the camp in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling through Europe via the ``underground railroad,''
he took a boat bound for Palestine that was intercepted by the
British; he was interned in Cyprus for seven months. Arriving in
Haifa in 1947, he joined the Israeli army. As a student at Hebrew
University, he was greatly influenced to a profound skepticism by
Jacob Talman, a student of Karl Popper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Mr. Griliches won a scholarship to the University of
California at Berkeley in agricultural economics _ a topic chosen
for its practical significance. He married Diane Asseo of Los
Angeles, and in 1954 they moved to the University of Chicago. There
he became a pupil of Theodore Schultz, who later won a Nobel Prize,
and burrowed deep into the amalgam of economic theory, measurement,
and statistics known as econometrics.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griliches spent 12 years at the University of Chicago. His
thesis in the diffusion of hybrid corn launched a new wave of
interest in the economic incentives to technical change _ at the
very moment that Keynesian macroeconomists were declaring the
subject more or less out of bounds. His work in 1958 on automobile
model changes for the Stigler Commission produced the ``hedonic''
price indices that since have become standard for delineating
problems of quality change. In 1965 he won the John Bates Clark
Medal as the best economist under 40.
</P>
<P>
   He was lured to Harvard University in 1969, as part of a big
shakeup that included the appointments of Kenneth Arrow, John
Meyer, Dale Jorgenson, and Martin Feldstein. In the literature, Mr.
Griliches is paired forever with Jorgenson, with whom he mounted a
memorable assault in 1967 on then current practices in productivity
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected president of the Econometric Society and the
American Economic Association and a fellow of the National Academy
of Sciences. Since 1980, he headed the productivity workshop of the
National Bureau of Economic Research. He was a founder of the
Moscow School of Economics, and in recent years worked on a careful
history of the rise of minor fame in the 19th century of the
Griliches engravers in the court of the czars in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a serious contender for a Nobel Prize,'' said Gary
Becker of the University of Chicago Thursday. ``I was hoping, on
sentimental grounds, that he might get it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Diane Asseo, a professional photographer;
and two childen, Eve, of Charlestown, Mass., a telecommunications
executive, and Marc, of Brookline, Mass.

ADVENTURES IN EXPENSE ACCOUNTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., Wis., Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewed dispassionately, expense accounts shouldn't be
troublesome. In theory, someone who spends money while conducting
company business simply accounts for the expense and is reimbursed.
But decades of excessive creativity have bred understandable
suspicion. Still, truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, and
once in a while, there's a pot of gold (or at least a few dollars)
at the end of the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, John W. Mason, now of Fort Worth, was a geologist in
Midland, Texas, at the lowest level of management of a major oil
company. As part of his job, he had approved the expense account of
a geologist who had spent some time in the oil town of Iraan,
Texas, working on a nearby well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss called me to his office and confronted me'' with the
expense account, Mason writes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the boss noted a charge of $8.50 for dinner at the
Bobcat Diner in Iraan. ``I grew up in Iraan,'' the boss said.
``There is no way you can spend more than $5 for a dinner in Iraan,
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   After some discussion, the boss agreed to let the expense go
through, but he had some advice for Mason: ``Watch this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two weeks, Mason, his boss and the geologist were
returning together from a field trip when they stopped at the
Bobcat Diner in Iraan. ``Sure enough, the most expensive item on
the menu was sirloin steak at $4,'' Mason writes. ``My boss looked
at me over his glasses, to make sure I was getting the message.''
</P>
<P>
   The geologist ordered the sirloin, Mason continued, ``ate it
while we were still eating our salads and ordered another.'' This
time, Mason said, the geologist told the waitress: ``Don't overcook
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss looked at me and raised his eyebrows,'' Mason writes.
``I controlled a smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason recalls another detail. The geologist, he said, was
6-foot-2, weighed 265 pounds and had been a tackle at Texas Tech. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The expense account story I'm about to share is not mine, but
I wish it was,'' writes Susan Friend of Manhattan. ``And it's not
wild and woolly, but warm and fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened two years ago to a very good friend of mine who
held a sales position at a Manhattan computer company. His
half-anticipated, half-dreaded 30th birthday was approaching, and
the dread stemmed from the fact that he was still living the life
of a Single Guy rather than Family Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he pressed on nonetheless and even had a glimmer of hope
when he met a seemingly compatible woman whom he took out on a date
the night before his big event. Of course, that glimmer slowly
faded when, during a $200 dinner, he learned that instead of being
a sweet, moral bookworm, she was instead a bitter, promiscuous
party animal.
</P>

   ``Bummed but not broken, he went into his office the next day
and vented the episode to his boss, who, as a cherished mother
figure, was sure to give him a good pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the talk, she patted him on the back and said his
disappointment would soon pass. That made him feel a little better.
But two seconds later, she peered into his office and said, `By the
way, did you mention our company name at least once during dinner?'
When he said yes, she added:
</P>
<P>
   ```Expense it. No one should have to suffer through such a bad
date. Oh, and happy birthday.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That made him feel a lot better.'' &QL;

   For a fall day in northern Wisconsin, where Thomas J. Newman of
Racine was conducting a management seminar in a hotel near Lake
Michigan, it was unusually warm. The temperature was in the upper
80s, but the hotel's air-conditioning had been shut down for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To cool the room, we opened all the windows, and in came
swarms of pesky flies from the lake,'' Newman writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the noon hour, I went to a nearby supermarket and bought
24 large fly swatters, one for each participant. The afternoon went
much better; we gave a special award to the person who killed the
most flies that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expense problem arose when I included in my report an item
for $48 to cover my cost of the 24 swatters without a detailed
explanation of the issue. It took an hour of negotiation with my
boss, but after the problem was explained clearly to him, he agreed
the fly swatters were a legitimate expense.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Tom Armor of Los Angeles, a rural development expert,
was working as half of a consulting team under a contract to the
United States Agency for International Development. After winding
up their week's work in Tanzania, they were to fly to Nairobi,
Kenya. But there was a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   In a dispute with Kenya about tourism revenue, Tanzania had
closed its border with Kenya to mechanical vehicles, on land or in
the air. The standard practice for business travel was therefore to
fly to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and then to Kenya, at considerable
extra cost and inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   One night at the hotel bar, Armor and his colleague, Peter
Wiesel, encountered a Belgian tour operator and told him about
their plight. The man, whose business included wildlife-viewing
safaris, had an idea. ``He offered to sell us his hot-air balloon
and assured us that the law exempted it from the border closure,''
Armor writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story gets long, but more to the point it fell to me to
list `one hot-air balloon _ $600' on my expense account upon
finally returning to the United States. When called upon to
explain, I told the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Armor pointed out that the cost of two airline tickets to
Nairobi via Addis Ababa would have been far greater than $600, and
he buttressed his argument for reimbursement by producing a
clipping from a Kenyan newspaper. The headline read: ``Travelers
Reach Nairobi by Balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Armor got his money.

MBA CLASSES CASTING THEIR ASPIRATIONS ABROAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ariz., Pa., Mich., Ga., Texas)   (af)  
 By DEBRA K. DECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For MBA candidates at several universities, the essential new
tool is no longer the latest business calculator or the fastest
laptop. It's a passport.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Southern California's Marshall School of
Business was the first to require its entire full-time MBA class to
travel abroad to study business. Now the business schools of
Georgetown University and Southern Methodist University have
embraced the idea, with their students' first overseas ventures
scheduled for next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The trips, lasting one to two weeks but with many more weeks or
months of preparation and follow-up, reflect educators' attempts to
go beyond the textbook in addressing the increasingly global nature
of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international aspect is so much a part of the fabric of
business,'' said Milton R. Blood, managing director of the
International Association for Management Education, a business
school accrediting agency in St. Louis, ``It has to be a part of
business education.''
</P>
<P>
   And the trips are very popular with students, whether or not
they are planning careers abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools, like Thunderbird, the American Graduate School of
International Management, in Phoenix, already offer specialized
programs in international management. There are also joint degree
programs like the MBA/MA in international studies at the Lauder
Institute at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Others, like the University of Michigan, require an international
business course as part of their core graduate curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Actual foreign field study, however, is a newer trend.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Marshall School started including short class trips
to cities like London and Paris in some elective courses. Those
classes proved so popular that it decided to make overseas study a
requirement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 first-year MBA students at Marshall can choose among
several nations on both sides of the Pacific _ in May 2000, they
will be Japan, China, Indonesia, Mexico and Chile. The students
spend a week visiting businesses and local officials as part of a
five-week study of business practices in Asia and Latin America.
Students also take part in consulting projects.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall graduates are enthusiastic about the program. George
Chang, who graduated last year, said his trip to China led to a
summer 1997 internship with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, a native of Taiwan and now an American citizen, had the
advantage of speaking Chinese. Others, however, are less likely to
come away with overseas assignments than with a heightened sense of
how international business works.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Ransford, a 1998 Marshall graduate, said he visited both
successful and struggling companies on his trip to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the significant portions of the MBA experience was an
awareness of the coming of the global age and what that means for
business,'' Ransford said. ``That experience I don't think you can
get in the classroom. Are you ready to move to Japan to do business
there? No, but it exposes you to the issues of running a global
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Students were especially struck by the importance of
partnerships and relationships _ called guanxi in China, for
example _ in doing business abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Asia Bribiesca, a 1998 Marshall graduate, said her international
experience before attending business school was limited to
vacationing in Mexico. ``Business school really opened my eyes to
how much more relationships mean in different countries than they
do here,'' she said. ``It seems that here in the U.S., we look at
bottom line. It doesn't have anything to do with whether we trust
that individual or organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bribiesca traveled to China, Singapore, Indonesia and Japan
as part of her elective course work.
</P>
<P>
   All three students remained in Southern California after
graduating: Ms. Bribiesca with Ernst &AMP; Young, Ransford with
Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an investment banking firm, and
Chang with AlliedSignal. All have had or expect to have
international assignments.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgetown University, the McDonough School of Business will
take its first classwide overseas trip next March, with each of the
260 second-year MBA students spending a week in New Delhi, London,
Buenos Aires or Hong Kong. The trips are part of three months of
course work building on the first year's required international
business courses, all part of a curriculum introduced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many schools will tell you they are international,'' said
Lawrence S. Abeln, McDonough's director of graduate programs.
``This is one way we are actually able to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown says 37 percent of its MBA students are foreign,
compared with 25 percent at SMU and 23 percent at Marshall,
according to school officials.
</P>
<P>
   SMU's Cox School of Business, in Dallas, will take 120
first-year MBA's on two-week regional tours in April. The class
will split into three groups to tour Europe (London, Brussels,
Frankfurt and Budapest), Asia (Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo and Taipei,
Taiwan) or Latin America (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil;
Santiago, Chile; and Monterrey, Mexico). Students will visit the
same or similar companies in each region, then compare the
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Albert W. Niemi Jr., dean of Cox, was inspired by a study trip
to Japan 15 years ago. ``In two and a half weeks, I learned more
than I could have learned in two years reading about it,'' he said.
``It was a life-changing experience. I've always thought if I had
the opportunity and could figure out a way to deliver that program
to our MBA students that it would have the same dramatic impact on
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Niemi, formerly dean of the University of Georgia business
school, found his opportunity when he arrived at Cox three years
ago. It helped that Donald J. Carty, chief executive of American
Airlines, is on his board. American agreed to provide $1 million
toward SMU's purchase of airline tickets over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Carty calls it both a gift and an investment aimed at producing
graduates that American, which is based near Dallas, can hire.
``This is not a risky proposal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is the only one of the three schools that has not raised
charges to cover the foreign travel; its annual tuition and fees
are $23,800. McDonough students pay $25,678 annually, plus a $3,200
supplement for trips and other programs. At Marshall, tuition and
fees are $26,783 plus a trip supplement of $1,450 to $1,950. All
three schools say they also support their programs with endowment
funds and alumni donations.
</P>
<P>
   The schools view the programs as a way to set themselves apart,
to attract students and to raise their standings in published
rankings. Marshall's dean, Randolph W. Westerfield, said
applications had more than doubled since the program was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Many business schools that are ranked among the nation's best
have so far shied away from making foreign travel mandatory.
Westerfield said Wharton, where he was chairman of the finance
department, seriously considered making foreign study a requirement
but decided to create optional programs instead.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall professors generally favor the new foreign trips, but
there is some resistance to emphasizing such less-formal education.
``It's a very difficult thing for faculty to do,'' said K. Ravi
Kumar, executive director of Marshall's international program.
``You don't know what's going to happen in Tokyo. It puts a lot of
risk on the professors _ academia is fairly risk averse.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-term benefits to the students or the companies that hire
them are difficult to assess. Although business-school
accreditation standards include a ``globalization'' requirement,
Charles Hickman, former director of member relations for the
International Association for Management Education, said most
employers would rather hire students well versed in business
basics. ``If you do a poll of most of the companies who are major
employers of MBA graduates and give them a menu of different
choices, international knowledge or perspective still comes out
rather low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said that graduates with international education might not
get higher salaries immediately, but that the benefits might become
apparent later on. ``Whether the experience gave them a better view
of management and whether companies value that,'' he said, ``we'll
see 5 to 10 years from now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I. _ Two Navy ships on a mission to
recover the data recorders from EgyptAir Flight 990 steamed out of
port and into rough, wind-swept seas Thursday, hoping to reach the
sunken wreckage in time to take advantage of a brief respite of
calm seas forecast for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After a second day in which the search and recovery operations
were suspended by bad weather, the Grapple, a search and salvage
ship equipped with an underwater robot and a team of deep-sea
divers, and the Mohawk, which picked up signals from the data
recorders earlier this week, will try to reach the crash site in
13- to 15-foot swells.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. William G. Sutton said that the ships were trying to
reach the site 50 miles south of Nantucket by morning so that if
the seas calmed down for several hours, as weather forecasters
predicted, they would be able to begin trying to retrieve the
recorders _ the so-called black boxes _ from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Crash investigators are hoping that the boxes, which contain the
flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, will provide a
valuable clue as to why the Boeing 767 crashed before dawn on
Sunday, killing all 217 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   But Sutton cautioned that the mission was dangerous in this
weather since big waves can rock the ships and threaten to wash up
on deck as sailors work with the heavy, delicate underwater robot,
Deep Drone, that they hope to launch over the side of the Grapple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 concern is safety,'' he said. ``We don't want to
increase this tragedy any more.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Whiting, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ship that uses a side-scan sonar to map the ocean
floor and the wreckage that lies on it, also left port Thursday
night to continue its long, methodical work, which will be
important in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to launch the ships into rough open seas for what
may be a window of opportunity of mere hours reflects the desire of
the authorities to get on with the salvage operation and address
some of the concerns of family members, who have expressed their
frustrations about the lack of answers on what brought the plane
down.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Sultan, whose 34-year-old daughter, Riham, died in the
crash, said that he and the other relatives of the victims were
anxious for an explanation. ``We ask, desperately, `Why?''' he said
Thursday outside the hotel on Goat's Island where the relatives are
staying. ``And they say, `Wait until we get the black boxes, then
we'll know what happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other relatives, Sultan, who lives in
California, said he wanted to take his daughter's body home for
burial. But investigators have said that the human remains
recovered so far were not intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came about her body,'' he said. ``We can't do a memorial
without her body. We can just have people sharing sadness, that's
it. Not a memorial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Quonset Point, across Narragansett Bay from here, workers
reported making some progress at the makeshift morgue that was
established. Many relatives provided officials from the medical
examiner's office with dental records and other distinguishing
characteristics that could help identify the remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Marcus Girgis, who led a memorial service at the St.
Mary and St. Mena Coptic Christian Church in Cranston on Thursday
morning for around 10 Coptic Christians who died aboard Flight 990,
told the grieving relatives that no matter what condition the
victims' bodies were in now, they would still be able to enjoy life
after death.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he intoned the prayer for the departed from the
Liturgy of St. Basil the Great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustain them in a green pasture, by the water of rest, in the
paradise of joy; the place from which grief, sorrow and groaning
have fled away, in the light of your saints,'' he told the mourners
assembled in the carved wooden pews.

 INVESTING WITH EUGENE E. PERONI Jr.: JOHN NUVEEN &AMP; CO.  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(af) 
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who's in charge of the stock market? The little guy, says Eugene
E. Peroni Jr., director of equity research for defined portfolios
at John Nuveen &AMP; Co., the money management firm based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutional investors dominate the market only in terms of
trading volume,'' Peroni said from his office in Radnor, Pa. ``The
turning points in the market, the more reliable and sustainable
moves, are led by individual investors.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he scans the ticker tape, looking for heavy and
consistent buying in particular stocks by investors trading in
relatively small lots of 10,000 shares or less, almost your average
mom and pop.
</P>
<P>
   Following small investors has helped Peroni turn in an
impressive record. Each year since 1995, he has picked 10 stocks to
be packaged into a unit investment trust, or UIT, an unmanaged
portfolio of securities that are held for a set period _ 13 months.
Investors can then roll over their investment into a new UIT the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Peroni's UITs were available only to clients of
Janney Montgomery Scott, a brokerage firm in Philadelphia where he
was director of technical research. In May, he joined Nuveen, and
on June 15, started the $40 million Peroni Growth Portfolio: Summer
Series 1999, which holds 20 stocks. Starting on Dec. 6, Nuveen will
offer a UIT called the Peroni Top 10 Picks Portfolio: 2000,
consisting of 10 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At Janney Montgomery, Peroni's 10-stock portfolios combined to
produce an impressive record, returning 24.7 percent a year, on
average, for the 10 years through December 1998, compared with 16.6
percent for the Dow Jones industrial average. Through Oct. 29, the
$138 million Janney Montgomery Peroni Top 10 Growth Trust 1999
portfolio, which started Dec. 4, 1998, returned 35.6 percent,
before commissions and fees, versus 19.0 percent for the Dow Jones
index, Nuveen said.
</P>
<P>
   UIT investors can buy shares only during a brief window (through
January, for example, for the Peroni Top 10 Picks portfolio to be
offered next month). The portfolio almost never changes over the
life of the UIT.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pay a 2.95 percent commission to their brokers the
first year and 1.95 percent if they decide to roll it over _ so
this is not a low-cost alternative to a mutual fund. The new Nuveen
UIT also carries expenses of 0.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Peroni's stock-picking system was designed by his father, Eugene
E. Peroni Sr., 89, an architect who became a prominent PaineWebber
technical analyst in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Peroni, who describes his investing style as
moderately aggressive, looks for mid- or large-capitalization
growth stocks that have been trading for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   Peroni doesn't have much use for computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on the tools that were available at the turn of the
century,'' he said, ``ticker tape, a quote machine and
point-and-figure graphs, which are drawn by hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The point-and-figure charts illustrate a stock's price movements
of $1 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The graphs give us a good overall look at pricing patterns,''
Peroni said, ``and let us quickly identify departures from a
stock's historical price trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Peroni ignores trades of 10,000 shares or more, which are
usually institutional. Why? ``We find that institutional traders
react to news, like rumors or changes in analysts' direction,'' he
said. ``Individual investors are intuitive and anticipate positive
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about the CNBC couch potato or the day
traders,'' he said, but rather ``astute individuals who may have
spent their career at a particular company and know the business,
the technology or the service intimately.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the ticker tape, which shows all trades, rather than
computer programs that typically highlight only high-volume trades.
Patterns are sometimes visible in a day, but typically take several
weeks to identify, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He takes special note of companies when he is satisfied that
individual investors are making a strong commitment to their stock.
Institutions follow sooner or later, Peroni says.
</P>
<P>
   He whittles his list to 40 or 50 stocks by focusing on strong
sectors where investors are buying steadily, typically choosing
market leaders in each group. Currently, he likes technology, drug
and telecommunications stocks.
</P>
<P>
   By design, his 10-stock list generally includes just three or
four industry groups. ``For many years, the market has been driven
by a few key industries and stocks,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Peroni gives minor consideration to nontechnical factors,
including company news, economic events and research reports. And
he pays no attention to typical valuation measures like
price-to-earnings ratios or book value.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite stocks is Solectron, in Milpitas, Calif., a
contract manufacturer of high-technology products like computer
motherboards. Solectron is in his 1999 Janney Montgomery UIT and
the Nuveen summer UIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we're moving to a new generation of
chips that would require retooling of equipment companies,'' Peroni
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock could advance, he said, not only because of rising
earnings expectations but because of the prospects for
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Commscope, a Hickory, N.C., manufacturer of cable
that transfers data and voice more efficiently than copper lines.
The cable is used in cell-telephone towers, telecommunications
links and in computer line hookups. Peroni said the stock, which is
in the Nuveen summer UIT, had consistently outperformed earnings
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Texas Instruments. He is bullish on the
semicondutor business in general, but he also likes the company for
its pursuit of higher-growth areas of the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has refocused away from calculators and
semiconductor chips, and focuses on digital signal processing as a
way to put data into digital format,'' he said, ``so that
information transfers more rapidly and efficiently than in an
analog format.'' Texas Instruments is in the summer UIT.

ZVI GRILICHES, ECONOMIST PLAYED KEY ROLE AT HARVARD; AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zvi Griliches, a pre-eminent empirical economist, died Thursday
at home in Cambridge, Mass. of complications arising from
pancreatic cancer. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor, at 14, of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, he
emigrated first to Palestine, then in 1951 to the United States,
where for five decades he was a central figure in identifying and
measuring the benefits of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role as well in Harvard University's return to
global prominence as a center of economic learning.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griliches was noted for the clarity of his studies of
technological innovation and attendant price changes _ and a
scrupulous honesty about its limitations. Adam Jaffe of Brandeis
University described it as ``almost a way of thinking. You never
entirely believe what you find, but you always learn something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Iain Cockburn of Boston University, who recently compiled a
``family tree of Zvi'' showing the substantial fraction of the
community of measurement economists who had been trained by Mr.
Griliches and his students, lamented tongue-in-cheek the inevitable
(but negligible) imprecision of his study with the family mantra:
``There are, as usual, problems with the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griliches was born in Kaunas, Lithuania. His father was a
chemical engineer whose family's tannery had fallen on hard times.
His mother's family's cigarette factory was prospering, however,
and he was raised with his sister Ellen in comfortable
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of the Germans in 1941, the Jews of Kaunas were
ordered into the ghetto. ``Imagine the Jewish population of Boston
being moved into the river edge part of Watertown, which will be
abandoned by its other inhabitants and surrounded by barbed wire,''
he later described it.
</P>
<P>
   The Griliches family eventually was sent to Stutthof, near
Danzig, then to a work camp in the Dachau system in Bavaria. He was
not yet 15 when, after losing both parents, he saw American troops
led by Gen. George S. Patton liberat the camp in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling through Europe via the ``underground railroad,''
he took a boat bound for Palestine that was intercepted by the
British; he was interned in Cyprus for seven months. Arriving in
Haifa in 1947, he joined the Israeli army. As a student at Hebrew
University, he was greatly influenced to a profound skepticism by
Jacob Talman, a student of Karl Popper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, Mr. Griliches won a scholarship to the University of
California at Berkeley in agricultural economics _ a topic chosen
for its practical significance. He married Diane Asseo of Los
Angeles, and in 1954 they moved to the University of Chicago. There
he became a pupil of Theodore Schultz, who later won a Nobel Prize,
and burrowed deep into the amalgam of economic theory, measurement,
and statistics known as econometrics.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Griliches spent 12 years at the University of Chicago. His
thesis in the diffusion of hybrid corn launched a new wave of
interest in the economic incentives to technical change _ at the
very moment that Keynesian macroeconomists were declaring the
subject more or less out of bounds. His work in 1958 on automobile
model changes for the Stigler Commission produced the ``hedonic''
price indices that since have become standard for delineating
problems of quality change. In 1965 he won the John Bates Clark
Medal as the best economist under 40.
</P>
<P>
   He was lured to Harvard University in 1969, as part of a big
shakeup that included the appointments of Kenneth Arrow, John
Meyer, Dale Jorgenson, and Martin Feldstein. In the literature, Mr.
Griliches is paired forever with Jorgenson, with whom he mounted a
memorable assault in 1967 on then current practices in productivity
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected president of the Econometric Society and the
American Economic Association and a fellow of the National Academy
of Sciences. Since 1980, he headed the productivity workshop of the
National Bureau of Economic Research. He was a founder of the
Moscow School of Economics, and in recent years worked on a careful
history of the rise of minor fame in the 19th century of the
Griliches engravers in the court of the czars in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a serious contender for a Nobel Prize,'' said Gary
Becker of the University of Chicago Thursday. ``I was hoping, on
sentimental grounds, that he might get it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Diane Asseo, a professional photographer;
and two childen, Eve, of Charlestown, Mass., a telecommunications
executive, and Marc, of Brookline, Mass.

DAISY BATES, 84, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader who in 1957 led the fight to
admit nine black students to Central High School in Little Rock,
Ark., died at a hospital there Thursday. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   In the struggle, rocks were thrown through her window, a burning
cross was placed on her roof and the newspaper published by her and
her husband, L.C. Bates, was ultimately destroyed financially. But
she nurtured the nine black children who faced vicious insults and
physical intimidation. She encouraged them to be courageous, while
striving to guard them against howling white mobs.
</P>
<P>
   The result was one of the major early victories in the civil
rights movement. The desegregation of Central High School with the
aid of federal troops signaled that Washington would strongly
enforce the 1954 Supreme Court decision to outlaw racial
segregation in schools. Mrs. Bates, as Arkansas president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was a
central figure in the litigation that led to the confrontation in
front of the yellow-brick school building, as well as the mean and
snarling scenes that unfolded in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Little Rock campaign, she later said, ``had a
lot to do with removing fear that people have for getting
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In her forward to Mrs. Bates' 1962 book, ``The Long Shadow of
Little Rock,'' Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, ``I have paid her homage in
my thoughts many times, and I want to tell her again how remarkable
I think she was through these horrible years.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Thursday called her a dear friend and a
heroine and said her death ``will leave a vacuum in the civil
rights community, the state of Arkansas and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Bates was born in the little sawmill town of Huttig in
southern Arkansas, growing up in a shotgun shack, because one could
stand at the front door and look straight through the front and
back doors into the backyard. She attended segregated schools that
used out-of-date textbooks passed on from white schools, according
to the African-American Almanac.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she told of the trauma of learning at 8 that her
birth mother had been killed in a rape attempt by three white men.
After she had heard rumors, her father told her the truth in simple
and straightforward terms. ``So happy once,'' she wrote, ``now I
was like a little sapling which, after a violent storm, puts out
only gnarled and twisted branches.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 15, an insurance agent came to visit her
home. He was L.C. Bates, who had studied journalism and then worked
for newspapers in Colorado and Kansas City. Newspapers were a shaky
calling in the depths of the Depression, and he had turned to
selling insurance.
</P>
<P>
   After a courtship, the two married and settled in Little Rock.
Together, they started a newspaper called The Arkansas State Press.
It reported extensively on racially motivated violence and became
known as a strong exponent of civil rights. After being elected
state NAACP president in 1952, and as a result of the Supreme Court
decision that had the effect of outlawing segregated schools, Mrs.
Bates became a particularly forceful advocate of desegregation. She
began by taking black children to white schools to be registered.
If the school refused, as it always did, she would report it in her
paper.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, local and state officials initially tried to delay
school desegregation, ostensibly to make the process more orderly.
This resulted in a suit by the NAACP to force the issue. At Central
High School, 75 black students initially registered, a number that
was ultimately reduced to nine chosen by school authorities. They
were deemed the most emotionally mature.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Orval Faubus, responding to political urging from other
Southern governors as well as polls showing 85 percent of the
state's residents opposed school desegregation, sent in the
National Guard to stop blacks from attending. Faubus said that
``blood would run in the streets'' if they tried. A forewarning of
the escalating tension was a rock tossed through the Bates' window.
A note was tied to it, saying: ``Stone this time. Dynamite next.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of school, the young people were turned away with
bayonets at the schoolhouse door. Racial and sexual epithets were
hurled at them. Mr. and Mrs. Bates were at the scene. The next day,
the National Guard stepped in again.
</P>
<P>
   Then President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent in the federal troops,
rebuffing governor. Faubus' pleaded for a one-year cooling-off
period. In her book, Mrs. Bates tells of waiting for a call from
the superintendent telling her to bring the children the next day.
She had told the parents that if they did not hear from her by 10
to take their phones off the hook and get some sleep. But shortly
after midnight, the superintendent called and said that the next
day, Sept. 24, the children should come to school.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Bates spent the next three hours visiting the
parents. The next morning, all the children showed up at the Bates'
home to be picked up by a military convoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes none too dry, I saw the parents with tears of
happiness in their eyes as they watched the group drive off,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Bates' newspaper would close because sales
of advertisements had slowed to almost nothing. She served in
various civil rights positions both locally and nationally and was
the only woman who spoke at the March on Washington in 1963. In an
interview in 1986, she said: ``I'm 75 and a half. But I'm not too
tired to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I
would like to see before I die that blacks and whites and
Christians can all get together.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mrs. Bates suffered a series of strokes. ``She
just wore out,'' her niece, Sharon T. Gatson said. She is survived
by four brothers: Leo Gatson of Strong, Ark.; Kucas and Lowell
Gatson of Spearville, La.,, and Emmitt Gatson of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Her body will lie in state of on the second floor
rotunda of the Arkansas state capitol. Just a few feet away is the
office where Faubus orchestrated the 1957 confrontation.

FREIGHT STRIKE A TEST OF HOFFA'S METTLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOONACHIE, N.J. _ At daybreak Thursday Ernie Soehl, a
gruff-voiced fireplug of a man, was already yelling orders to the
picket line of Teamsters just north of Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing black nylon Teamster jackets that glowed in the passing
headlights, the pickets had massed, placards in hand, outside the
Overnite Transportation Co.'s truck terminal, to further James P.
Hoffa's crusade to stop the decline in the Teamsters' freight
division, which his father once built into a swaggering symbol of
union might.
</P>
<P>
   Soehl, vice president of a New Jersey local, told the assembled
protesters to fan out in twos and threes, follow Overnite trucks
throughout northern New Jersey and set up picket lines wherever
they made deliveries, to pressure Overnite's customers to turn to
other trucking companies.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 days now, ever since the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters began a nationwide strike against Overnite, the union and
the company _ one of the nation's largest nonunion shipping
concerns _ have played cat and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is far more than a game. It is an effort by
Hoffa, who assumed the union's presidency last spring, to step out
of his father's shadow and prove his mettle as a union leader. In
addition, the walkout, supported by unions across the nation, has
become a high-stakes effort to show that it is possible to win
union recognition and a contract from one of the country's most
vehemently anti-union companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts predict that Overnite will win because a
company information campaign has turned many workers against the
union and because so few of Overnite's workers are on strike. The
union says nearly one-fourth are, while the company says just
one-tenth.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts predict that the union can outlast the company
because the strike will cut into Overnite's important Christmas
business and because the low unemployment rate will make it easy
for strikers to find jobs during the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoffa has staked his future on winning this fight,'' said John
Schulz, associate editor of Trucking World, a trade magazine. ``The
Teamsters have not organized a freight company of any magnitude
since 1980. This would be a crown jewel. This one dwarfs them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa says he is standing up to the nation's worst labor-law
violator, a company against which the teamsters have filed more
than 1,000 charges with the National Labor Relations Board,
accusing Overnite of illegally firing and retaliating against
scores of union supporters. One of the strike's chief goals, Hoffa
said, is to force Overnite, with 8,200 drivers and loading-dock
workers, to stop such unfair labor practices. The company denies
engaging in any illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in what looks as if it could become a war of attrition,
both sides are claiming the upper hand. The union insists that
Overnite will surrender, saying the strike has cut its business by
30 percent at a time the industry is booming. Overnite officials
say that they are shrugging off the strike, that its terminals are
making deliveries on schedule and that business is down just 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters officials says they have pickets at 140 of Overnite's
166 terminals _ many of the pickets are Teamsters who do not work
for Overnite. The company say there are pickets at just 30
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Rosenfeld, an Overnite spokesman, said, ``As far as we're
concerned it's a normal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Soehl called the company's assertions poppycock, saying that
workers inside Overnight's Moonachie terminal had told them that
shipments were down by at least one-third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep up this fight until it's done, whether it
lasts a week or a year,'' Soehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Teamster officials acknowledge that the stakes are high _ it is
the union's biggest showdown since the 1997 United Parcel Service
strike, and it is an effort by Hoffa to succeed in a fight in which
the predecessor he detested, Ron Carey, failed.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of trying, the union says it represents 3,600
workers at 37 of Overnite's terminals, although the company argues
that because of legal challenges, the union represents only 1,800
at 22 locations. The union says it has made so little headway
because of intimidation, while Overnite executives offer another
reason: most workers do not want a union. Overnite will soon pay
its drivers $17.75 an hour, up from $17. Unionized drivers earn $19
an hour, and their fringe benefits are considerably better than
Overnite's.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hoffa's father, James R. Hoffa, the teamsters' president from
1957 to 1971, built the union's freight division to more than
400,000 workers, representing more than 60 percent of the nation's
truck drivers. But after deregulation bankrupted many unionized
companies, now only 20 percent of the nation's truck drivers are
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   With this strike, the younger Hoffa is trying to turn that
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Teamster market share in trucking continues to fall, we
lose power, the bargaining power to win the contracts our members
deserve and expect,'' Hoffa said in a recent speech to Overnite
workers. ``If we can no longer win those contracts, we besmirch the
history of our forefathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's hard-line stance has surprised many labor experts.
Michael Belzer, a trucking industry expert at the University of
Michigan, said, ``The Hoffa administration has been rather militant
when a lot of people expected it to roll over and play dead or roll
over and make deals with the bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 7 a.m. Thursday, Pete Brown, the president of
Teamsters Local 560, was following Soehl's instructions and driving
along northern New Jersey roads, tailing an Overnite truck that
eventually stopped at a Samsung warehouse in Secaucus. There, Brown
stood outside, holding a picket sign that he said has turned back
truckers from unionized companies. But Thursday no other trucks
showed up at the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The driver whom Brown followed, Robert Link, was pro-union.
``Overnite is a romper room with favoritism galore,'' Link said,
adding that union supporters often faced retaliation. ``The
question is, `Why don't they want to sit down and sign a contract
instead of spending millions on overpriced lawyers to fight the
union?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld, the Overnite spokesman, later responded, ``We have
been bargaining in good faith. We've told the union all along we
can not sign a contract that makes us noncompetitive. We have to
remain competitive with other nonunion companies.''

TV GOES FISHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of TV sports according to me:
</P>
<P>
   The closest most urban warriors have come to a bass is a fork in
a restaurant or Dan Aykroyd's unique use of a blender in the
classic ``Bass-O-Matic'' Saturday Night Live skit.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in America is urban. There are 55 million
anglers here, and Fox Sports hopes a few of them would like to
watch a bass fishing contest, the $3.5 million Ranger Millennium M1
Bass Tournament from Florida, on live television Sunday afternoon
(1:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   The rest of America might laugh, especially at the notion that
someone may tune out a NFL game out to watch Ned someone drop a
lure into a lake. But Fox doesn't care. In an era of declining
Nielsen ratings and audience shares, niche programming has taken on
greater importance.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brown, Fox Sports senior producer, explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our audience projection is around a 2.0,'' he said. ``But we
really don't know what we'll get. If the first telecast gets a 1.0,
people will congratulate us and say we tried. If we get a 2.0,
people will shrug. If we get a 3.0, it will raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we get a 4.0, there will be staff meeetings at all four
networks by the end of business day Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's all hope for a 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   Like most everything it does, Fox Sports is treating the event
big time. It is a production headache, since anglers will be
covering 10 fishermen working out of five boats on five lakes, a
setup similiar to early round coverage of the Bob Hope Invitational
golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoorsman Forrest Wood will an analyst in the Fox booth, but
the other voices are better known for baseball, Joe Buck and Bob
Brenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction was `couldn't they find anyone among the
55 million anglers who can handle this?' '' said Buck, who has also
done horse racing and daredevil jumping (Robbie Knievel) this year
around baseball telecasts. ``This week, I picked up a copy of
Fishing for Dummies and watches tapes of ESPN's (taped) fishing
shows. What I've learned most is that there's more to this than
people merely watching guys catching fish.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent for this show. ESPN and The Nashville
Network (TNN) regularly air fishing shows in the early a.m. on
weekends. And back in the '60s and '70s, one of ABC's highest rated
weekend sports shows was ``The American Sportsman'' hosted by Curt
Gowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox President David Hill will get much of the blame or
congratulations, because the idea began when his wife sent him on a
fishing troller in Alaska as a birthday gift. Well, I think it was
gift.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is up: Speaking of niche programming, the 16th edition
of NBC's Breeders Cup goes to the post Saturday. NBC's coverage
begins at 10 a.m., with an eighth rave added to the usual card.
</P>
<P>
   The Nielsen for the first Breeders Cup, at Santa Anita in 1984,
was a 5.1, and it remains the highest-rated Cup telecast. Last
year's event earned a 2.2 Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The irony here is that while NBC created the event in
association with NTRA officials as niche ratings boost, its been of
greater benefit to the horse industry. The Breeders Cup has become
as important to racing as the Triple Crown series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Triple Crown races had a 100-year headstart on the
Breeders Cup,'' said NBC's Tom Hammond, who has worked on every
telecast. ``But when you consider the money spent, the media
interest, and the way it's altered racing's schedule, it's had a
dramatic impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Cup lacks star attractions or heavy favorites. Hammond
thinks that's a plus, because all the stories will be fresh. ``And
if you're a handicapper,'' he said, ``you're going to like the
prices you get, because these are all wide-open races.''
</P>
<P>
   KXTA stuff: The all-sports station may be negligible in the
Arbitron ratings, but programming director Mike Thompson says the
station is running at a healthy profit, buoyed in part by dotcom
advertising and a positive response to Terry Bradshaw's noon
one-hour show.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw has a two-year deal to host this show during the
football season, but Thompson would like to talk Fox Sports
personality into making it a year-round thing and perhaps expanding
it to two hours. Down the road, he thinks the show could by
syndicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry has a lot to offer,'' said Thompson. ``The biggest
problem is his schedule. I'd like to see what we could work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also expects morning guy Derrick Hall to stay despite
his being wooed to return to the Dodgers. He would like to add a
permanent partner to Hall's morning show, but for now he likes the
work A. Martinez is doing. Lee Klein is hosting at night around
Clipper and UCLA basketball broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also plans to investigate having a Dodgers post-game
show originate from the Stadium Club at Dodgers Stadium and thereby
having it more interactive with fans. KXTA shows have already
worked out of the new Fox restaurant at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Roughing penalty: Someone needs to explain to me why USC, a
school with a Trojan-for-life tradition, is persecuting its former
broadcast team of Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn and Lamb, a former USC offensive lineman, served the
university and its football and basketball programs superbly for
three seasons. Their broadcasts were solid and they were tireless
in representing USC at various functions.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of year three, their company was behind in its rights
fee payments to USC, but it also had a new partner in hand ready to
offer USC a new, more lucrative contract that would keep Kahn and
Lamb on the air and assist them in meeting their nut from the
previous contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, USC athletic director Mike Garrett took the broadcast
package in-house (buying time on XTRA) and is prosecuting Kahn and
Lamb in court. USC has already won one summary judgment against
their corporation, and a decision has been delayed on a suit that
would allow USC to put a lien on their personal assets.
</P>
<P>
   This seems so petty. USC has every right to seek their lost
revenue, but trying to put a lien on the home of a former USC
player and send both men into personal bankruptcy hardly
exemplifies Trojan spirit.
</P>
<P>
   And now the news: Parity pays. Every network save one is showing
a gain in NFL ratings at midseason. Fox's average of 10.8 is 11
percent higher than its 9.7 for 1998. It's the highest week eight
average for Fox since 1995. CBS is averaging a 9.9, up 10 percent
from 9.0 last year, and ESPN's Sunday night games has a 6.3, up 13
percent from a 5.5 a year ago. ABC's average of 13.6 is flat from
last season, due in part to competition from playoff baseball last
month and some low-wattage games. One ratings point is equal to
994,000 homes ... Brian Barnhart will not return on Angels
broadcasts next year. Dick Enberg, whose contract at NBC expires
this month, is interested in returning in some capacity, but this
issue has had low priority compared to hiring a new general manager
and manager ... Enberg, who has been named Sportsman of the Year by
an Orange County group, will guest on Irv Kaze's KIEV (870 am) show
Saturday (6 p.m.) ... Baseball playoff ratings were up over last
year, Fox getting an average of 9.2 for its ALCS coverage, a 21
percent bump, and NBC posting a 11.3 for the NLCS, including a 15.4
for Game 6 between the Braves and Mets. NBC's World Series averaged
a 6.0, up 13 percent from last year but still the second-lowest
all-time ... CBS will send L.A. the blah Florida-Vanderbilt game
Saturday (12:30 p.m.) instead if No. 3-ranked Virginia Tech versus
West Virginia ... The Long Beach State women's volleyball team
plays UC Santa Barbara Saturday on the University Television
Channel and OCN (7 p.m.) ... HBO's long-running ``Inside the NFL''
has moved to Thursdays at 7 p.m., with replays on Friday (7 p.m.)
and Saturday (11 a.m.) ... A contest, The Bruin Broadcast Bowl,''
is being held at UCLA today. Five finalists will do five minutes of
sportscasting before a panel, and the winner will win a computer
and will broadcast the Nov. 13 UCLA-Washington game on contest
sponsor Live365.com. Live365.com is a global broadcasting Internet
company that offers free bandwidth for those seeking to get their
news, sports or music offerings on the net.

<P>
   Making Alterations For the New Dow 30 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An overhaul of the Dow Jones industrial average was completed
last week, but it caused barely a murmur in the mutual fund
universe. After all, very few funds explicitly track that venerable
benchmark, which on Monday dropped four issues _ Union Carbide,
Goodyear, Chevron and Sears, Roebuck _ while adding four
standard-bearers of the new economy _ Microsoft, Intel, Home Depot
and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the makeover meant a lot to Richard Moroney, co-manager of
the $110 million Strong Dow 30 Value fund. It indexes half of its
portfolio to the Dow, then uses various Dow valuation theories to
weigh the other half, which also holds only Dow stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the index, Moroney said, will mean an increase in
the fund's turnover, to 30 percent or 35 percent from 25 percent
for the year. But overall, he is excited about the restructuring.
``I think its going to be great for the Dow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, he figures, is that the consensus earnings growth
estimate for the departed stocks was 10 percent a year over five
years, versus 20.5 percent for the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   He seems in tune with Dow Jones executives who altered the
index, in that all of the departed stocks were underweighted in the
actively managed portion of his portfolio. ``They were all
losers,'' said Moroney, who is also editor of Dow Theory Forecasts,
an investment newsletter in Hammond, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, he has been overweighting both Intel and SBC. He
is market-weighting Microsoft and underweighting Home Depot, but
only because he thinks their share prices have run up too far.
</P>
<P>
   Moroney, whose fund returned 17.1 percent in the first 10 months
of the year, compared with 18.4 percent for the Dow, said the
addition of the growth-oriented stocks would not necessarily
increase the riskiness of the index, noting that the volatility of
the departed stocks is about the same as that of the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   So does Moroney plan to lobby the Dow Jones executives on
further changes in the index? That won't be necessary, he said.
``They certainly have every incentive to make the index as
attractive as possible,'' he added. &QL;

COACH AND FIRST CLASS AT STAPLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Marx would have detested Staples Center, viewing it as the
apotheosis of capitalistic excess.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as history has shown with the unspeakable havoc
wreaked by the Communist system throughout the 20th century, Marx's
ideas were fancifully idealistic and dangerously misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a definite caste system in place at Staples
Center, with those well-heeled holding luxury box or premier
tickets given exclusive access to the best parking lots, the best
entryways and the best restaurant, the Arena Club.
</P>
<P>
   And you know exactly who these fortunate folkare because they
are the entitled ones adorn in all-access badges dangling from
strings draped around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in my life, I felt like a Wall Street big
shot at Staples Center the other night because I was wearing my
press pass, but I found out quickly I still was very much a member
of the proletariat class in this case those holding tickets to the
corner lodges and upper concourse when I attempted to walk up to
the luxury box suite level.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a special pass to go any farther,'' said an usher,
courteously and firmly turning me away.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the upper concourse it's such a high elevation I idly
wondered if oxygen masks were issued must remain in the area,
although I guess there are special walkways that will allow them to
reach the Fox Sports Sky Box restaurant that is located several
levels below.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not exactly a bargain, since there is a lengthy wait
to get into the Fox eatery that, at least on the Lakers' opening
night, turned out to be far too small to accommodate all the
prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum, of course, had its wealthy senate seat areas, but all
the sections in that old building seem to blend together and there
was only passing notice of class distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the case at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   There are definitive boundaries, with the premier seats between
the baskets and the three-tiered luxury box suites being the refuge
of the rich and the rest of the place being a sanctuary for such
lowly salt of the earth wage earners as, well, newspaper reporters.
...
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing cheap at Staples Center a turkey sandwich of
relatively modest size goes for nearly seven bucks and its owners
are equal opportunity gougers.
</P>
<P>
   In the press parking lot across the street from the arena, the
fare is $12.50. ...
</P>
<P>
   I kept having to pinch myself the other night that I was
actually watching an NBA game actually, the presence of the
Vancouver Grizzlies inspired similar feelings at the Forum because
the immense size of the Staples Center seems to muffle any serious
crowd noise. Indeed, it was so quiet throughout the listless match
that I expected the Lakers' theme song, Randy Newman's ``I Love
L.A.'', to be replaced by Pachelbel's ``Canon''. ...
</P>
<P>
   Like Phil Jackson, Magic Johnson doesn't expect the Lakers to be
an imposing team the first half of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time for the players to adjust to the new
offense and to do what Phil Jackson is trying to accomplish,'' he
told me before the Lakers went through the motions in beating the
Grizzlies. ``We're going to have some bad nights. There are going
to be some frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Magic Johnson figures by the year 2000 that the Lakers will
have developed into an efficient and dangerous team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better beware of the Lakers after January,'' said Magic. ``And
by that time, there figures to be some big men (i.e., power
forwards) on teams that are struggling badly who will be available
to us. I figure we're going to wind up with one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the makings of a terrific team. I think Shaq
(Shaquille O'Neal) is going to be better than ever, and he badly
wants that (championship) ring. Kobe Bryant is the most exciting
young player in the league. We've got the top coach in Phil
Jackson. He knows how to get the most out of his talent. We're
going to be as good as anyone in the second half of the season.''.
...
</P>
<P>
   I've seen the Lakers play in three places since they arrived
here in 1960 from Minneapolis, the Sports Arena, the Forum and
Staples Center, but the venerable Laker reporter, Mitch Chortkoff,
also saw them perform at Los Angeles State and the Shrine
Auditorium. ...
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take UCLA football fans long to yearn for Terry
Donahue, did it?. ...
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Ken Griffey Jr. stop being such a colossal phony,
and just say he wants to go to a big-market team with a winning
record instead of claiming he wants to depart the Seattle Mariners
so he can be closer to his family in Florida? If that's the case,
then why doesn't he demand a trade with the Florida Marlins, or
Tampa Bay Devil Rays?. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure Bobby Cox is anxious to have Griffey. I mean, how
could this perennial October bumbler explain blowing another World
Series with Griffey in the Atlanta Braves' lineup? One of these
days Ted Turner is going to wake up from his baseball snooze and
realize Bobby Cox can't manage. ...
</P>
<P>
   I've seen underachieving college football teams before, but none
to quite match Paul Hackett's stumbling USC Trojans, who have a lot
of talented players on their roster. If they can't beat
injury-ravaged Arizona State on Saturday, well, where have you
gone, Ted Tollner and Larry Smith, when USC is in desperate need of
your services?. ...
</P>
<P>
   I have more respect for Kurt Warner and the surprising St. Louis
Rams after watching them lose to the Tennessee Titans than I did in
watching them beat a bunch of stiffs for their 6-0 start. Still, it
won't surprise if the Rams are beaten again this Sunday by the
Detroit Lions. ..
</P>
<P>
   Congrats to the Long Beach State coach, Wayne Morgan, for
recruiting a team good enough to be chosen as the favorite to win
the Big West title. I presume that means the 49ers are actually
expected to win more games than they lose this season. Wow!. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'd be surprised if Alex Rodriguez doesn't eventually wind up in
New York with either the Mets or Yankees. I hear he'd even be
willing to convert to third base if he joins the Yankees because,
after all, his best friend, Derek Jeter, is the team's incumbent
shortstop. ...
</P>
<P>
   I always thought the Santa Ana winds posed the most misery to
pool guys in these parts, but mine, Mr. Paul Grieco, claims
earthquakes are his greatest curse. ``They not only knock a lot of
water out of pools, but also knock a lot of dirt and other stuff
into them,'' grouses Grieco, a true American hero and the Cal
Ripken of his weird trade for not missing a day of cleaning pools
since he graduated with honors from Downey High in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   I hear the new Dodger boss, Robert Daly, is a nice guy and has
been a long-time passionate patron of the Dodgers. Swell. I'm sure
there are a few hundred thousand other individuals around the
country who are peachy fellows and rabid Dodger fans. Does that
mean they should be put in charge of running the Dodgers? Of course
not. Mr. Daly is going to discover to his distress that running a
baseball team is slightly different than running Warner Bros. ...
</P>
<P>
   I did a column a few years ago before the Long Beach Grand Prix
on Walter Payton, who was involved with a racing team. I remember
him as being exceedingly cooperative. I also remember his toughness
and competitive spirit on the sporting fields where he ran for more
rushing yardage than anyone in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that the notoriously erratic Chicago Bears'
coach, Mike Ditka, didn't acknowledge Payton's greatness in the
1986 Super Bowl when he gave the gimmick ball carrier, William (The
Refrigerator) Perry, an opportunity to score a touchdown at
Payton's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton never complained about such an obscene slight,
reflective of his divine character.

PANEL TO FOCUS ON CITIGROUP AND BANK DEPOSITS BY AFRICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citigroup's handling of bank accounts controlled by prominent
African leaders and their relatives is expected to come under
scrutiny in congressional hearings that begin on Tuesday, according
to people involved in the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts, none of which are currently active, were
controlled by Gabon's president, Omar Bongo, and by two sons of the
late Nigerian dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Those accounts are part of a broader examination by the Senate's
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into how Citigroup, the
financial services giant, and other major banks have handled
private accounts for foreign officials and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus has been Citigroup's handling of accounts
controlled by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of the former
Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Raul Salinas, who used
Citigroup accounts to hide millions of dollars that investigators
believe came from illicit activities, is in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but a
federal investigation of the banking concern and Salinas is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the role that American institutions may have
played in helping corruption overseas was heightened by the
investigation of Salinas, which began in late 1995. Those concerns
have gained momentum because of the federal investigation of
possible money laundering by Russians through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want American banks being conduits for moving dirty
millions around the world,'' Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat
who heads the Senate subcommittee, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup officials declined to discuss any specific information
about Bongo's accounts of the Abachas, citing client
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the bank said the Salinas investigation was
an embarrassment that forced the bank to tighten oversight in all
its operations, especially in its private-banking unit. These
people said that since 1996, the bank has improved screening
procedures and extended the scope of the disclosure it requires
from prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   John Reed, a Citigroup co-chairman, is to testify at the
hearings next week. Although there has been speculation about
Reed's relationship with Raul Salinas, people close to Reed said he
had never met or talked to Salinas. People familiar with Reed's
planned testimony said he would acknowledge lapses in the
management of the Salinas accounts and discuss the steps the bank
has taken since then to stymie the movement of dirty money through
its accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the reports of problems with the Bongo and Abacha
accounts suggest that the bank perhaps has not yet fully insulated
itself from suspicious funds.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money in the Citigroup accounts controlled by
Bongo and Abacha's sons could not be determined. But individuals
with direct knowledge of Bongo's Citigroup account said that more
than $20 million was deposited into the account prior to 1998.
Swiss investigators are examining whether Bongo was the recipient
of bribes paid by Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group.
</P>
<P>
   Bongo's account, opened about 30 years ago, was reviewed by the
Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency in 1997. The
agencies told Citigroup there was no reason to close the account.
Still, the account was closed by the bank last year, but not
liquidated, after news accounts surfaced about the Swiss
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts controlled by Abacha's sons were in London and New
York. The New York account was closed in 1997, but the London
account remained open until last year, when it was frozen by
British investigators. It could not be determined why British
investigators were examining the London account.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the bank said the reason for inconsistencies in
how the Abachas' accounts were handled resulted from a lack of
uniform standards throughout the company on how accounts controlled
by public officials and their relatives should be handled. These
people said new steps had been taken to make sure all parts of the
bank maintain the same standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve seemed to support this view. After another
examination of Citigroup's management of its private banking
division in January 1999, the Federal Reserve said, ``Significant
progress has been made in correcting control deficiencies noted at
the prior inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Levin said Thursday: ``I'm glad they've taken new
steps, but they've taken new policy steps before that they've been
very lax in implementing. There are much more recent problems at
Citigroup than Salinas. This is not something that ended with
Salinas.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Busloads of desperate refugees poured out of Chechnya
Thursday, as Russia opened the border following Western criticism
that it was needlessly endangering civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of civilians have been stranded on the Chechen
side of the border, as women, children and the elderly have fled
the Russian bombardment of Chechnya. Moscow, which began a military
campaign against the breakaway region in September, had effectively
sealed the border for almost two weeks. The Russian decision to
admit the refugees _ who have been living in the open, often
without food or water, as temperatures have plummeted _ comes as
Western observers have stepped up their criticism of the Yeltsin
government's handling of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have reported that Russian artillery
attacks and bombing raids have killed and injured many civilians,
based on interviews with refugees in neighboring Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch reported Thursday that many civilians are
pinned down in basements and that the conflict has overwhelmed
Chechnya's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian shelling complicates medical evacuations,'' the
organization reported. ``Injured civilians who do attempt to flee
face potentially life-threatening delays at the Chechen-Ingush
border.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has expressed similar concerns, adding
that it is worried by the relatively restrained criticism on the
part of Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, for example, has sought to balance
its support for the Yeltsin government, and its fight against
Islamic militants, with its concerns about civilians. Russia, which
fought a war in 1994-96 to suppress a Chechen bid for independence,
blames the militants for incursions into the neighboring republic
of Dagestan and a series of terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington has said it deplores the danger to
civilians, it has not pressed for an end to Russia's offensive by
threatening a cutoff in international assistance or the curtailment
of other cooperation, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the intensity of the fighting and the plight of the
refugees has led some Western governments to become more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   The British prime minister, Tony Blair, has sent a letter to his
Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, urging Moscow to refrain from
a bloody assault on the Chechen capital of Grozny and to help the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has rejected most of the Western criticism, and the
current military campaign has helped boost Putin's popularity
rating to 29 percent, higher than that of other potential
presidential candidates, according to the Public Opinion Fund, a
Russian polling organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is also due to attend an important meeting of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Istanbul
this month. Russia has sought to promote the organization as an
alternative to NATO, and does not want the meeting to be dominated
by criticism of the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's response Thursday was to to press on with its military
campaign while taking some visible steps to ease the plight of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Russia allowed busloads of Chechen refugees to enter
the neighboring region of Ingushetia. Ingush authorities said that
more than 3,000 people had crossed in a 24-hour period, compared
with a small trickle in previous days.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Shoygu, the head of the Russian emergencies ministry,
said that efficient exit routes would be established. He said that
a two-week supply of food would be brought to the border region in
Ingushetia, but that many refugees would have to be resettled
elsewhere in the northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russia has provided little assistance to the 200,000 who
have already fled to Ingushetia, raising questions about how much
help Moscow is prepared to give those in the new influx.
</P>
<P>
   The Ingush government has complained that the refugees lack
food, shelter and medicine. Aid from the Russian government, it
says, is woefully inadequate and international support is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Ruslan Aushev, president of Ingushetia, said that the actions of
Russian troops manning the Ingush-Chechen border over the last two
weeks have been ``inhumane and humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen civilians, not Islamic terrorists, have borne the brunt
of the suffering during the military campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia promised to help the refugees Thursday, there is no
doubt about its ultimate aim: the defeat of Islamic militants and
the seizure of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said on Tuesday that Russian
forces plan to take firm control of the entire region, a goal that
eluded them in the previous war. Russian troops have already taken
up positions outside Grozny and are also deployed near Gudermes,
Chechnya's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said that Russia should try to protect itself against
Chechen guerrillas by restricting travel from some Caucasian
nations. He proposed that entry visas be required for travel from
Georgia and Azerbaijan. Georgia and Azerbaijan criticized the
proposal, saying it would complicate relations.

FBI WARNS CRIMINALS THAT IT IS YEAR-2000 READY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI turned the clock forward to Jan. 11, 2000,
on its main crime-fighting computer Thursday, in a test that
indicated fugitives would not slip through the cracks because of
glitches caused by the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   A computer technician demonstrated by running a simulation of a
traffic stop early in the new year, and it showed that the National
Crime Information Center's extensive database of mug shots,
fingerprints and criminal histories would be up and running. The
computer housing the database, which is used by police agencies all
over the country, had been considered one of the federal
government's most crucial requiring protection against Year 2000
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's message to those who think they might break the law
and get away with it is simple: the criminal justice system is
going to be ready,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news
conference at FBI headquarters. ``The Department of Justice and the
FBI are going to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Reno acknowledged that with less than two months before
the new millennium, computers handling 1 percent of the
department's operations were not ready for it. These crucial
computers still under review, aides said, are housed in some of the
Justice Department's overseas offices, which number more than 100.
The attorney general said that all the computers were expected to
be ready by Dec. 31 but that contingency plans were being made.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is also bracing for millennium-related terrorist
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many extremist individuals and groups place some significance
on the next millennium, and as such it will present challenges to
law enforcement at many levels,'' the bureau said in a report that
was presented to police chiefs this week.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problem stems from designers' efforts to save
memory space by representing a date's year with just two digits,
like 99 for 1999. As a result of that practice, some computers
could read 00 as 1900 rather than 2000, or simply fail to recognize
a date at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FBI's computers function smoothly, state and local
police agencies could face problems in gaining access to the
database if their own computer programs are outdated. A study
issued Thursday by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative and auditing arm, said an FBI review of all 50
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico had found five
jurisdictions with inadequate updates to their law-enforcement
computers. The study did not identify those jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Reno expressed optimism that federal prison guards
would not find cell doors suddenly opening, that drug and
immigration agents would not face inoperative crime-fighting
technology and that police officers around the country would not be
cut off from the national database's listings of criminal records
and outstanding warrants.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, President Clinton's adviser for the Year 2000
problem, said at the news conference that the federal government as
a whole was 99 percent ready for the new year. But as a precaution,
he said, a governmentwide command post will be set up before Dec.
31 to monitor problems inside and outside the United States. ``All
of us need to be ready for the inevitable glitches,'' Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing on the issue Thursday, Rep. Steve
Horn, R-Calif., expressed uncertainty as to whether the government
was prepared. Already, he said, there have been sporadic signs of
disruption among the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Minnesota in 1993, a 104-year-old woman was instructed to
report to kindergarten because '89 was at the end of her
birthday,'' said Horn, chairman of the House government Reform
Subcommittee on government Management, Information and Technology.
``More recently, in Maine, car owners or their banks got car titles
identifying their 2000-model-year vehicles as horseless
carriages.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn's subcommittee has graded federal agencies on their
response to the problem. The Justice Department's latest grade,
issued in September, was a C-minus, but improvement is expected
with the next report cards, the last before Congress adjourns for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows for sure what will happen during the first hours,
days and weeks of the new millennium,'' Horn said. ``Will Y2K come
in like a lion with a worldwide roar, or pass silently?''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 55 years as a reporter, foreign correspondent,
editor and columnist, A.M. Rosenthal spent his last working day at
The New York Times Thursday packing up his memories the only way he
knew how: by writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal ended a run of nearly 13 years on the newspaper's
Op-Ed page with a column that appears Friday, looking back on a
career that made him one of the most influential figures in
American journalism in the last half of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen happier days,'' he acknowledged in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one word that he said he would never use to
describe his new status. Don't dare to whisper ``retirement,'' he
said, recalling what Barbara Walters, an old friend, told him a few
weeks ago when it became clear that his weekly column, ``On My
Mind,'' was near an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `But Abe, you're starting fresh,''' he said.
``And I suddenly realized, of course I was. Then I realized that
I'm not going alone. I'm taking my head with me. I'm going to stay
alive intellectually.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, 77 and universally known as Abe, said he intended to
continue ``writing journalistically,'' though at this point he had
no specific plans. ``I want to remain a columnist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unmistakable end-of-an-era feel to the announcement
Thursday that Rosenthal would leave a newspaper that, family aside,
had been his life. Indeed, during his 17 years as its chief editor,
until he stepped down in 1986 with the title of executive editor,
``Rosenthal'' and ``The Times'' were pretty much synonyms for many
readers _ often, though not always, with their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Michael Rosenthal brought raw intelligence and enormous
passion to the job, qualities that were apparent from his first
days at The Times, as a part-time campus correspondent at City
College in the 1940s. The college was tuition-free in those days,
and a good thing, too, said Rosenthal, who was born in Canada and
grew up in poverty in the Bronx. ``Free tuition was more than I
could afford,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming a full-time reporter in 1944, he covered the
fledgling United Nations. Then, from 1954 to 1963, he was a foreign
correspondent, based in India, Poland and Japan. Covering India was
a personal high point. But it was in Poland, whose Communist rulers
expelled him in 1959, that he won a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   It was also where he wrote an article for The New York Times
Magazine that, among the thousands he produced, contained a passage
that some quote to this day. He had been to the Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so,'' he wrote, ``there is no news to report from
Auschwitz. There is merely the compulsion to write something about
it, a compulsion that grows out of a restless feeling that to have
visited Auschwitz and then turned away without having said or
written anything would be a most grievous act of discourtesy to
those who died there.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion in that paragraph carried into his time as editor.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch, in 1971, The Times published the so-called
Pentagon Papers, a secret government history of the Vietnam War.
That led to a landmark Supreme Court decision upholding the primacy
of the press over government attempts to impose ``prior restraint''
on what it may print.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rosenthal, the once-ponderous Times became a far livelier
paper. Major innovations were quickly copied at other newspapers,
notably special sections on lifestyles and science that were
introduced in the 1970s. But his biggest accomplishment, in his
view, was keeping ``the paper straight,'' which meant keeping the
news columns free of writing that he felt stumbled into editorial
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, he did not lack for critics. With his passion
came dark moods and a soaring temper. Rosenthal made many
journalists' careers. But he also undid some. Even now, years after
his editorship, his defenders and his attackers talk about him with
equal vehemence.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal agreed that people tended not to be neutral about him.
Many will be saddened by his departure from The Times. ``And,'' he
said, ``there'll be people dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   His column on the Op-Ed page, which first appeared on Jan. 6,
1987, often stirred similar emotions among readers. Over the years,
recurring themes emerged: Israel's security needs, human rights
violations around the world, this country's uphill war against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on those themes once more for his final column. Then
he turned to the mundane task of packing up mementos as well as
memories. Off the wall came a framed government document from the
1950s attesting that the Canadian had become an American. It was,
he said with a cough to beat back rising emotions, among his most
valuable possessions.  &QL;

A.M. ROSENTHAL _ REPORTER, COLUMNIST, EDITOR _ RETIRES FROM NEW
YORK TIMES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 55 years as a reporter, foreign correspondent,
editor and columnist, A.M. Rosenthal spent his last working day at
The New York Times Thursday packing up his memories the only way he
knew how: by writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal ended a run of nearly 13 years on the newspaper's
Op-Ed page with a column that appears Friday, looking back on a
career that made him one of the most influential figures in
American journalism in the last half of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen happier days,'' he acknowledged in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one word that he said he would never use to
describe his new status. Don't dare to whisper ``retirement,'' he
said, recalling what Barbara Walters, an old friend, told him a few
weeks ago when it became clear that his weekly column, ``On My
Mind,'' was near an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `But Abe, you're starting fresh,''' he said.
``And I suddenly realized, of course I was. Then I realized that
I'm not going alone. I'm taking my head with me. I'm going to stay
alive intellectually.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, 77 and universally known as Abe, said he intended to
continue ``writing journalistically,'' though at this point he had
no specific plans. ``I want to remain a columnist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unmistakable end-of-an-era feel to the announcement
Thursday that Rosenthal would leave a newspaper that, family aside,
had been his life. Indeed, during his 17 years as its chief editor,
until he stepped down in 1986 with the title of executive editor,
``Rosenthal'' and ``The Times'' were pretty much synonyms for many
readers _ often, though not always, with their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Michael Rosenthal brought raw intelligence and enormous
passion to the job, qualities that were apparent from his first
days at The Times, as a part-time campus correspondent at City
College in the 1940s. The college was tuition-free in those days,
and a good thing, too, said Rosenthal, who was born in Canada and
grew up in poverty in the Bronx. ``Free tuition was more than I
could afford,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming a full-time reporter in 1944, he covered the
fledgling United Nations. Then, from 1954 to 1963, he was a foreign
correspondent, based in India, Poland and Japan. Covering India was
a personal high point. But it was in Poland, whose Communist rulers
expelled him in 1959, that he won a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   It was also where he wrote an article for The New York Times
Magazine that, among the thousands he produced, contained a passage
that some quote to this day. He had been to the Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so,'' he wrote, ``there is no news to report from
Auschwitz. There is merely the compulsion to write something about
it, a compulsion that grows out of a restless feeling that to have
visited Auschwitz and then turned away without having said or
written anything would be a most grievous act of discourtesy to
those who died there.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion in that paragraph carried into his time as editor.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch, in 1971, The Times published the so-called
Pentagon Papers, a secret government history of the Vietnam War.
That led to a landmark Supreme Court decision upholding the primacy
of the press over government attempts to impose ``prior restraint''
on what it may print.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rosenthal, the once-ponderous Times became a far livelier
paper. Major innovations were quickly copied at other newspapers,
notably special sections on lifestyles and science that were
introduced in the 1970s. But his biggest accomplishment, in his
view, was keeping ``the paper straight,'' which meant keeping the
news columns free of writing that he felt stumbled into editorial
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, he did not lack for critics. With his passion
came dark moods and a soaring temper. Rosenthal made many
journalists' careers. But he also undid some. Even now, years after
his editorship, his defenders and his attackers talk about him with

</P>

said, ``there'll be people dancing.''

EDITORIAL: A.M. ROSENTHAL OF THE NEW YORK TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ROSENTHAL-COLUMN, NYTIMES-ROSENTHAL) 
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 5:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The departure of a valued colleague from The New York
Times is not, as a rule, occasion for editorial comment. But the
appearance Friday of A.M. Rosenthal's last column on the Op-Ed page
requires an exception. Rosenthal's life and that of this newspaper
have been braided together over a remarkable span _ from World War
II to the turning of the millennium. His talent and passionate
ambition carried him on a personal journey from City College
correspondent to executive editor, and his equally passionate
devotion to quality journalism made him one of the principal
architects of the modern New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Rosenthal began his career at The Times as a 21-year-old cub
reporter scratching for space in the metropolitan report, and he
ended it as an Op-Ed page columnist noted for his commitment to
political and religious freedom. In between he served as a
correspondent at the United Nations and in three foreign countries,
winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1960 for his reporting from Poland. He
came home in 1963 to become metropolitan editor. In that role and
in higher positions, he became a tireless advocate of opening the
paper to the kind of vigorous writing and deep reporting that
characterized his own work. As managing editor and executive
editor, Abe Rosenthal was in charge of The Times' news operations
for a total of 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of his many contributions as an editor, two immediately come to
mind. One was his role in the publication of the Pentagon Papers,
the official documents tracing a quarter-century of missteps that
entangled America in the Vietnam War. Though hardly alone among
Times editors, Rosenthal was instrumental in mustering the
arguments that led to the decision by our then publisher, Arthur
Ochs Sulzberger, to publish the archive. That fateful decision
helped illustrate the futile duplicity of American policy in
Vietnam, strengthened the press' First Amendment guarantees and
reinforced The Times' reputation as a guardian of the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The second achievement, more institutional in nature, was
Rosenthal's central role in transforming The Times from a
two-section to a four-section newspaper with the introduction of
separate sports and business sections and new themed sections like
Weekend and Science Times. Though a journalist of the old school,
Abe Rosenthal grasped that such features were necessary to broaden
the paper's universe of readers. He insisted only that the writing,
editing and article selection measure up to The Times' traditional
standards.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Abe Rosenthal could be ferocious in his
pursuit and enforcement of those standards. Sometimes, indeed,
debate about his management style competed for attention with his
journalistic achievements. But the scale of this man's editorial
accomplishments has come more fully into focus since he left the
newsroom in 1986. It is now clear that he seeded the place with
talent and helped ensure that future generations of Times writers
and editors would hew to the principles of quality journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Canada, Rosenthal developed a deep love for New York
City and a fierce affection for the democratic values and civil
liberties of his adopted country. For the last 13 years, his
lifelong interest in foreign affairs and his compassion for victims
of political, ethnic or religious oppression in Tibet, China, Iran,
Africa and Eastern Europe formed the spine of his Op-Ed columns.
His strong, individualistic views and his bedrock journalistic
convictions have informed his work as reporter, editor and
columnist. His voice will continue to be a force on the issues that
engage him. And his commitment to journalism as an essential
element in a democratic society will abide as part of the living
heritage of the newspaper he loved and served for more than 55
years. &QL;

   Finding Weight Bias Across the Workplace &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next time you're turned down for a pay raise or a new job,
and you don't know why, you might step on a scale.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to major work-related events _ hirings, firings,
promotions, demotions and pay levels _ you are more likely to be
discriminated against if you are overweight than because of your
race or sex, new research has found.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark V. Roehling, an assistant professor of
management at Western Michigan University's Haworth College of
Business in Kalamazoo, employers discriminate against overweight
people _ especially women _ on important workplace issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper to be published next month in Personnel Psychology, a
journal, Roehling reviews and evaluates 29 weight-discrimination
studies. Separately, he conducted his own interviews with employers
and with people who felt that they were victims of such
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be the acceptable bias,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In one discussion, Roehling said, a manager _ a slightly
overweight man _ recalled an overweight woman who applied for a
job. ``Boy, was she fat,'' the manager told him, adding, ``One
person I'm never going to hire is a fat girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Roehling said, ``This illustrates the boldness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state laws provide little protection against weight
discrimination, Roehling said, adding that Michigan is the lone
state where weight was made a protected characteristic under the
state's fair employment law. &QL;

<P>
   Don't Call Them Workaholics &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once a workaholic, always a workaholic, right? Well, some of the
prime candidates don't seem to think so.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Exec-U-Net, an online executive career information
network in Norwalk, Conn., found that 23 percent of 800
senior-level executives considered themselves workaholics in 1998,
down from 39 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' work hours, however, showed a different trend.
The average workweek for all of those surveyed increased during
that period to 56.35 hours, from 55.59.
</P>
<P>
   And among those who didn't consider themselves workaholics, the
workweek was only slightly shorter, at 55.42 hours.

the days when dormitories had a single pay phone on each floor,
calls were made on Sunday night after the rates went down and long

ARIZONA PICKED TO WIN PAC-10
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thursday morning, in an LAX hotel ballroom, the
Pacific-10 pushed aside its football misery and giddily promoted
its upcoming men's basketball season. As expected, Arizona was a
near-unanimous choice to win the league title with 32 of 36
first-place votes in the preseason media poll.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was picked second and Stanford third. USC was seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The poll is a pleasant harbinger for Arizona. The media _
believe it or not _ has correctly picked the league champion five
consecutive preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three (Arizona, UCLA and Stanford) get the nod, to me,''
Oregon coach Ernie Kent said. ``The reason is they have the most
continuity within their programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast start: Grant High product Gilbert Arenas has impressed the
Arizona coaches and is challenging Bell-Jeff's Ruben Douglas for
the starting wing-guard spot.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Wildcats coach Lute Olson on Arenas: ``He's the real
deal. We're very fortunate that not a lot of people knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   A shot at UCLA? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Steady recovery: After missing most of two seasons with a knee
injury, Stanford freshman and Harvard-Westlake graduate Jason
Collins should start at center for the Cardinal in its Nov. 11
opener against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty mature kid,'' Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery
said. ``I don't see any tentativeness in him whatsoever....
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would like to see the Collinses play together, and
correctly so. That's a combination you'll see a significant amount
of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason's twin brother, Jarron, is a junior forward for Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Add Stanford: In a decision that should concern Arizona and
UCLA, the Cardinal probably will redshirt 6-foot-9 forward Justin
Davis, one of the league's most talented freshmen. At this point,
Montgomery said, Stanford doesn't need Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Wow.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day: From USC coach Henry Bibby, when asked if he
was concerned about replacing top shooters Elias Ayuso and Adam
Spanich: ``If you think kids who shoot 30 percent shoot the ball
well, then yes.''

KILLER OF SHEPARD SENTENCED TO 2 LIFE TERMS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REMOVES ``to the court'' from the 2nd graf; ADDS `Mr.' to quotes
in 4th and 5th grafs; adds 12th graf with Wyoming not having a
hate-crime designation)  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial of a man convicted of murdering Matthew Shepard, a gay
University of Wyoming student, ended Thursday in Laramie, Wyo.,
with a deal approved by Shepard's parents that will spare his
killer the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a request from the court-appointed lawyers for the
defendant, Aaron McKinney, prosecutors agreed to give him two
consecutive life sentences if he relinquished his right to appeal.
After the agreement was concluded, Shepard's father, Dennis
Shepard, made a long, impassioned statement about his son, whom he
called ``my hero'' for his courage in enduring slights and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his address, he turned toward McKinney and
with obvious emotion said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like nothing better than to see you die, Mr. McKinney.
However, this is the time to begin the healing process, to show
mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Mr. McKinney, I am going to grant you life, as hard
as it is for me to do so, because of Matthew. Every time you
celebrate Christmas, a birthday or the Fourth of July, remember
that Matthew isn't. Every time you wake up in that prison cell,
remember that you had the opportunity and the ability to stop your
actions that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard concluded his remarks by saying, ``You robbed me of
something very precious, and I will never forgive you for that. May
you live a long life and may you thank Matthew every day for it.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Judy Shepard, did not address the court.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven men and five women in Wyoming District Court
convicted McKinney on Wednesday of second-degree murder, robbery
and kidnapping _ a combination of charges that made him eligible
for execution, which is by lethal injection in Wyoming. Thursday he
told the court, ``I really don't know what to say other than I'm
truly sorry to the entire Shepard family.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement came as something of a surprise on the first
day the jury was expected to consider punishment for McKinney, a
22-year-old former roofer, who, with a friend, had lured Shepard
out of a bar on Oct. 6, 1998, robbed him of $20, beat him with the
butt of a pistol and left him for dead on a prairie fence at the
edge of Laramie.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, who was 21 years old, was found unconscious the
following morning and taken to a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo.,
where he died five days later.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Russell Henderson, 22, accepted virtually the same
deal last spring that McKinney received.
</P>
<P>
   While the case was widely perceived as a hate crime, Wyoming is
one of eight states that have no such official designation.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian rights groups praised the plea agreement as fair
and benevolent. ``Gay and lesbian Americans can now have renewed
faith in our justice system,'' said David M. Smith, a spokesman for
the Human Rights Campaign, an activist group. ``We can only hope a
strong message was sent, that in America hate crimes will not be
tolerated and that there are severe consequences for violent,
hateful actions.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by President Clinton, who said in a
statement, ``We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our
society who lash out at those who are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Rerucha, the Albany County prosecutor, said he had not been
in favor of offering McKinney a deal. But Smith said it largely
came about at the insistence of Mrs. Shepard, who has spent months
campaigning for more states and the federal government to pass laws
that include a victim's sexual orientation as a basis for
designating the crime as a hate crime. So far, only 21 states have
such provisions; a federal proposal died in conference this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the court, Shepard conceded that to some
people, his son had become ``a symbol, some say a martyr, putting a
boy-next-door face on hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and his family opposed an earlier deal for
McKinney because they believed that McKinney was their son's
principal antagonist, which McKinney's confession to police
confirmed, and they wanted a full public airing of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial was necessary,'' Shepard said, ``to show that this was
a hate crime and not just a robbery gone bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But that did not mean he, his wife or their son philosophically
opposed capital punishment, Shepard told the court. He recalled a
conversation with his son in which they agreed that some killers,
like those convicted of murdering James Byrd Jr. of Jasper, Tex.,
by dragging him to his death, deserved to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did we know,'' he said, ``that the same response would
come about involving Matt.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As brutal as the murder of Shepard was, the trial of McKinney
was more noteworthy for an evidentiary ruling by Judge Barton
Voigt, that McKinney's lawyers could not engage in a so-called
gay-panic defense. They had planned to present evidence showing
that McKinney had suffered from homosexual abuse as a child and
that in attacking Shepard, their client acted out of sheer
revulsion from a sexual advance they claimed Shepard had made
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   But Voigt ruled that Wyoming law does not provide for such a
defense as a basis for seeking conviction on a lesser charge, and
that decision was hailed by gay rights groups as a victory against
future attackers seeking to escape more severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, McKinney's lawyers tried to convince the jury that
drugs and alcohol played a role in McKinney's violent actions.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the court, Shepard thanked Judge Voigt for the
ruling. ``By doing so,'' he said, ``you have emphasized that
Matthew was a human being with all the rights and responsibilities
and protections of any citizen of Wyoming.''

   NEW YORK _ In the 30-year history of the New York City Marathon,
only Grete Waitz, Bill Rodgers and Alberto Salazar have won three
or more years in a row. On Sunday, John Kagwe, who won the marathon
here in 1997 and 1998, can join them.

   All week, people have been asking Kagwe how he feels about the
prospect of making history. His response boils down to ``Enough,
already.''

   ``I don't think anybody is super,'' the 30-year-old Kenyan said

win the race. There's no pressure on me to win three in a row. I
just want to win the next one on Sunday. I've prepared myself well.
The race is very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 6 inches and 113 pounds, Kagwe looks frail enough to
be blown over by a decent breeze. Instead, he is mentally and
physically tough. While many other elite runners train at altitude,
he lives most of the year in Norristown, Pa., outside Philadelphia,
and trains in nearby Valley Forge National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can train anywhere and be good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, despite two stops to tie a shoelace, he won by 75
seconds in 2 hours 8 minutes 12 seconds, still his career best.
Last year, in the closest three-man finish in a major marathon, he
won in 2:08:45, beating Joseph Chebet of Kenya by 3 seconds and
Zebedayo Bayo of Tanzania by 3 seconds more.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet and Bayo are back this year. Kagwe has special incentive
to beat Chebet because Chebet won the Boston Marathon in April in
2:09:52, with Kagwe fifth in 2:13:58.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Kagwe might have won here, he finished fourth
because, as he explained it: ``I kept an eye on the key guys and
they didn't move. By the time I realized that, the other guys got
away.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned from that. In 1997 and 1998, he ran with the leaders
and made his winning move on the uphill stretch just before Central
Park, with 4 miles of the 26.2 miles to go. This year, he said, ``I
will try to win the same way I won before.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running near the front, he is resigned to being a
one-man police force to keep someone from stealing the race. For
example, if some brave soul tries to break away after 18 or 19
miles, which is early for a big move, Kagwe says he will go after
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let anyone get away,'' he said. ``They are
not going to fool me. If you let them do that, you're going to pay.
I will cover every move the whole race. If you don't, someone might
build a possessive lead and say, `Oh, I can keep going.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So you do what you have to. It is never easy. Whatever comes,
even cramps, you fight them. Last year, I had leg cramps in the
23rd mile. My legs were not cooperating very well. You try to
forget it, but you can't. So I told myself in my mother tongue to
forget it and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe knows he is a marked man. Still, he is supremely
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not fear anybody,'' he said. ``Whoever beats me beats me
because he's better than I am. If I beat them, it's because I'm
better than they are. I'll give what I have. If God wishes, I'll
bring No. 1 home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You respect your opposition. I don't know what they're
cooking. They don't know what I'm cooking. We'll see what's in the
pot on Sunday.''
</P>

 ATM Fees Cash Cows for Wells, BofA  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
ATMs don't just provide money to customers. They're cash machines
for the banks as well.
<P>
   For the first time, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, San
Francisco's largest banks, have spelled out exactly what they take
in locally from fees levied on noncustomers who use their ATMs.
It's not chump change.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents connected with their lawsuit filed Wednesday
to overturn the city's just-approved ballot measure banning ATM
surcharges, BofA said its 188 San Francisco ATMs collect about
$245,000 per month from the surcharges. Wells Fargo said its 174
ATMs in the city take in $210,000 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   That's annual revenue for the two banks of about $5.5 million a
year from ATM surcharges in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   BofA and Wells charge noncustomers $1.50 for using their ATMs.
In most cases, consumers also have to pay a separate fee to their
own bank for using an outside ATM. It's the first fee, the
surcharge levied by the ATM owner, that is banned under the San
Francisco measure.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a key U.S. bank regulatory agency said it will
support the banks in their federal suit against the San Francisco
ATM ban. The California Bankers Association is also a plaintiff in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garsson, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, said the agency will file a friend-of-the-court brief
backing the bank's argument that local governments don't have
jurisdiction over nationally-chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will argue that its authority pre-empts San
Francisco's in the case of banks that operate under U.S. charters,
including BofA and Wells Fargo, Garsson said. The figures disclosed
in the banks' suit show why they are fighting so hard to block fee
bans in court. BofA and Wells Fargo ``derive significant revenues
from their ATM non-account holder usage charges,'' the banks said
in a court document. ``These charges could never be recouped'' if
San Francisco's ATM surcharge ban and a similar law recently
enacted in Santa Monica are allowed to stand, the banks noted.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, BofA and Wells Fargo have about 14,000 and 6,500
ATMs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Richard Kovacevich, speaking
yesterday at a Boston conference of Wall Street analysts, said the
bank collects about $50 million annually from ATM surcharges.
That's less than 1 percent of its $15.4 billion in total revenue
last year.
</P>
<P>
   A BofA spokesman declined to say how much it collects in ATM
surcharges. But if each of BofA's cash machines generated surcharge
revenue at the rate of their San Francisco ATMs, the bank would
collect more than $200 million nationwide. BofA may actually  &LR; take
in less because ATM usage levels may be lower in other places than
they are in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, banks have been striving to boost their income
from fees to compensate for the slow growth of their basic business
_ taking deposits and lending money.
</P>
<P>
   BofA and Wells officials said their ATM networks are expensive
to maintain. Without income from surcharges, the banks will have to
retool their ATM strategies, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That might mean boosting the ATM fees charged to the banks at
which noncustomers keep their money, which could prompt the
customer's own bank to pass along the increase by raising the fees
it charges for using an outside bank's cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   BofA and Wells Fargo are also threatening to cut off ATM access
for noncustomers. BofA ``has determined that it may become
infeasible to serve non-account-holder customers in San Francisco
and Santa Monica without being able to assess a convenience fee. If
so, it will discontinue access to non-account-holder customers,''
the bank noted in a court filing.

 _ SF CHRON   Old, New Firms To Share Space In S.F. Landmark 
 &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One of San Francisco's oldest companies and one of its newest will
occupy most of the former Southern Pacific headquarters after
renovation of the building is completed next year.
<P>
   Del Monte Foods, the venerable food processor founded in 1916,
has signed an agreement for 101,000 square feet on the top three
floors of the historic, 11-story structure, which has been renamed
the Landmark at One Market.
</P>
<P>
   Del Monte now has its headquarters in the adjacent One Market
Street tower, at the corner of Spear Street, and will vacate that
space.
</P>
<P>
   Scient Corp., a 2-year-old software company that helps clients
exploit the Internet and other new technologies, will move into
165,000 square feet on the fifth through eighth floors and out of
its current headquarters at One Front Street.
</P>
<P>
   Although the parties wouldn't comment on the lease costs,
comparable Class A office space in San Francisco goes for more than
$50 per square foot per year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Covarrubias, president of the Martin Group _ which
bought the building for $47.5 million and expects to finish a $50
million overhaul by next  &LR; May _ said his firm is negotiating to
lease the remaining office space in the 360,000-square-foot
structure to a single company. He declined to identify the
prospective tenant.
</P>
<P>
   The building already has a beauty shop and a restaurant _ One
Market _ on its ground floor. Covarrubias said other space on that
floor probably will be occupied by a retailer _ identity still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Pacific tower, built in 1917, was short on modern
amenities when it changed hands last year, in the wake of SP's
merger with Union Pacific. It lacked air-conditioning and even hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will have both, Covarrubias said, as well as ``all-new
elevators.'' It has been completely completed  &LR; rewired and has
undergone a thorough seismic retrofit.
</P>
<P>
   However, it will continue to be one of the few office towers in
San Francisco with windows that open.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disparity in their ages, both Scient and Del Monte
held initial public offerings of their stock this year.
</P>
<P>
   Scient's stock, buoyed by the market's enthusiasm for the
Internet, has soared from an offering price of $20 in May to
$125.25 at yesterday's close. Its total market value tops $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Del Monte, offered at $15 per share in February, has since
skidded to $13.63. Its market value is slightly greater than $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spain, a Del Monte spokesman, said that the company's lease
at One Market Street expires in January 2001 and that the move into
the new headquarters will begin next October.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company looked at many buildings, including some
outside San Francisco, but settled on the Landmark at One Market
because it offered the greatest flexibility ``in terms of the space
we need and how the offices are laid out.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NETS MAKING RIGHT MOVES OFF THE COURT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The Nets didn't have to win a championship or
even a game to get an audience Thursday with the president, who
came to their home, or at least to the city they say will someday
be home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Jersey Nets are coming to Newark _ remember that!''
the team's principal owner, Lewis Katz, told a packed gymnasium at
Malcolm X Shabazz High School on, where else, Clinton Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   This heartfelt promise was received with generous applause, the
most enthusiastic of which came from local politicians and invited
businessmen, not the student body, which wasn't exactly outfitted
in Nets-wear for the occasion. Until they persuade the commander in
chief to send them the secretary of defense, the Nets are a less
appealing attraction than their inspiring blueprint to assist in a
resurgence of New Jersey's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   In kicking off the second phase of his New Markets tour,
President Clinton wasn't championing any investments in Knick
futures though. For the sake of executive privilege, it is
currently better to be owned by rich, loyal Democrats than to lose
in the finals to San Antonio. Ten Nets players shook off another
defeat in Cleveland Wednesday and joined the coach and Al Gore
supporter Don Casey on stage with the president, who had the best
seat in the house, right next to Jayson Williams, a resident _
believe it or not _ of Clinton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the Nets in Newark and the commitment they've made to
have 40 percent of the profits go to the community and the children
is a challenge to all sports teams to follow the path of Lewis Katz
and Ray Chambers,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, in reality, are a long way from Newark. And even if
the Republican administration in Trenton should soon embrace the
Nets' offer to finance an arena in exchange for improvements in the
Newark infrastructure, there are other shadowy elements of what the
president called ``an astonishing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Katz introduced Williams as the last speaker of the
program, he told of how he and his rehabilitating center had just
before heard a female student speak of her wish to become a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first patient is my owner,'' Williams told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be paying you $80 million, I need a psychiatrist,'' Katz
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the microphone, Williams said: ``Thank you, George
Steinbrenner. And that's $86 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gets the last word on Williams, but the points
subliminally made were these: Nets' ownership, locked into massive
contracts for players who have yet to demonstrate a knack for
winning, may not be realizing much profit any time soon. Further
clouding the issue of how to define the Nets' largess is the recent
marriage of all administrative affairs to the Yankees and
Steinbrenner, who has his own, less ambitious, philanthropic style.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, after drawing six million fans the last two years,
Steinbrenner has yet to commit to keeping the Yankees in the Bronx.
The Devils' owner, John McMullen, meanwhile, is scheming with
Cablevision to build his own arena in Hoboken, N.J., which needs
more congestion like it needs more bars. At least the Nets are not
assaulting common sense with their Newark plan. At least they are
promising to be the taxpayers' partner, not their plunderer.
</P>
<P>
   This past week saw voters in San Antonio surrender to the Spurs
on a new arena referendum, while voters in St. Paul-Minneapolis
told the Twins to forget taxpayer subsidy of a new ballpark. The
Spurs had the leverage of their title and Tim Duncan's free agency.
The Twins had more bad baseball to offer. Unrealized potential
aside, the long-losing Nets have only the reputations of Katz and
Chambers, men who haven't forgotten the New Jersey inner cities in
which they were raised.
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough for the state to tell McMullen to forget
Hoboken, to help steer the Nets into Newark. Then it ought to
insist that Jayson Williams, in addition to getting rebounds for
his $86 million, be named executor of the Nets' community plan.
</P>
<P>
   Williams recently donated $2.1 million to St. John's University.
Thursday, unrehearsed, Williams promised new computers for the high
school, uniforms and instruments for its band. On a benevolent
roll, he couldn't stop giving away Katz's and Chambers' money.
</P>
<P>
   The students, finally hearing their own language, roared. The
owners laughed. The players mingled. Gheorghe Muresan bent down to
give the Rev. Jesse Jackson a hug. The president gave everyone a
thumbs-up. Seldom has there been a better day to be a New Jersey
Net.  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON  
 Drug Testing Takes a Hit  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Drug testing on the job, once a controversial practice at a few
companies, has become so pervasive that it now seems as common as
filling out a W-4 form or punching a time clock.
<P>
   Want that high-profile new job at a Fortune 200 company? Here's
your cup, there's the bathroom. Give us a urine sample, then we'll
talk stock options, pal.
</P>
<P>
   Want to stay employed in that construction job? Better watch
what you ingest over the weekend because you may be randomly
selected to give a sample before firing up the bulldozer Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, only 21.5 percent of companies tested employees,
according to a survey by the American Management Association. By
1996, 81 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Fortune 200 companies that require pre-employment
or random drug testing grew from 6 in 1983 to 196 in 1996, the AMA
found.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three percent of employers surveyed believe that testing
slows employee drug use, according to the AMA study. But 80 percent
of companies in the same survey had never done a cost-effectiveness
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, several studies question the worth of
workplace drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the American Civil Liberties Union issued a report
based on studies by the National Science Foundation and the AMA
showing that testing has been ineffective in reducing drug use and
has no noticeable impact on reducing either absenteeism or
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences recently found that illegal
drugs contribute little to workplace accidents and that off-duty
drug use has about the same small effect on worker accidents as
off-duty drinking.
</P>
<P>
   And, in January's Working USA magazine, two researchers with the
Le Moyne College Institute of Industrial Relations surveyed 63
Silicon Valley companies and found that productivity was 29 percent
lower in firms with pre-employment and random testing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few businesses have abandoned drug testing, even though
the AMA found it costs a company $77,000 to find one drug user by
testing all employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If drug testing didn't work, why would we see so many
companies instituting policies in an era where every department in
a corporation has to prove its worth?'' asked Mark de Bernardo,
executive director of the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace and
managing partner at Littler Mendelson's Washington, D.C., office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt for a second it works. It's ludicrous to think a
program that results in deterrence and detection of substance abuse
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis Maltby, director of the ACLU's National Taskforce on
Civil Liberties in the Workplace, called for employers to rethink
what he calls ``an invasive and humiliating procedure for
employees.'' Maltby charges that most large and medium-size
corporations know there is little cost benefit or effectiveness in
testing employees. They do it, he says, for public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who formerly was the CEO of a Fortune 500
company, and I asked him why he spent all that money on a
drug-testing program even though he'd told me privately he knew it
wasn't doing that good for the bottom line,'' Maltby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `I don't care if it improves bottom line. I'm a
publicly held company. I've got stockholder meetings and every year
I get asked what we're doing about the drug crisis in America. The
policy is my answer.' It's there for image.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Greenberg, director of management studies for the AMA, said
drug education and awareness programs have proven more effective
than testing, according to his group's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years of survey data have not allowed us to make a
statistical case that drug testing makes a difference,'' Greenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline cq &LR; Beecham Clinical Laboratories, the nation's
leading drug-testing corporation, recently reported that positive
test results fell from 18.7 percent of pre-employment and random
testing in 1987 to 5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenberg argued that test-positive rates went down not
because fewer workers were doing drugs, but because more companies
moved from testing only ``for cause'' to more widespread random
testing. ``In all of our years of researching, the only hard case
we can make in our data is that drug education and awareness
programs in companies deter use, whether they test or not,''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area corporations are believed to have a lower
pre-employment testing rate than companies in other regions, though
no statistics exist, because private-sector companies are not
required to make policies public.
</P>
<P>
   Levi-Strauss, for instance, performs pre-employment drug testing
on employees in manufacturing and logistics, according to a
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area's other major apparel company, the Gap, does not
require pre-employment testing, according to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Intel instituted pre-employment drug testing shortly after
Congress passed the 1988 Drug Free Workplace Act, which requires
federal contractors and grant recipients to provide drug-free
workplaces. Though Intel does not do federal contract work, it
instituted testing to enhance quality control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the nature of this business,'' Intel spokeswoman
Tracy Koon said. ``It's a matter of safety and productivity. We
want to make sure our product is high quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Koon said that in 1997, Intel had 0.39 percent positives out of
13,165 tests. In 1998, positives fell to 0.18 percent out of 3,696
tested. This year, through October 19, Intel had 0.15 percent
positives out of 6,294 pre-employment tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that our testing has helped these numbers
fall and raises our productivity,'' Koon said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Silicon Valley firms, such as Cisco Systems, do not
test.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Shepard, co-author of the Le Moyne study of drug testing in
Silicon Valley, said his researchers combined each company's
drug-testing data with its public financial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that productivity was 16 percent lower in companies
with pre-employment testing than those that didn't test, and it was
29 percent (lower) in companies with both pre-employment and random
testing,'' he said. ``It's hard to determine exactly why that is,
because it's not easy to get companies to talk about drug testing
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said his survey didn't delve into the reasons
productivity declined, but he has a theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If drug tests contribute a negative view toward the company,
as other surveys have found, then workers may not contribute as
much in return, or they may seek employment elsewhere,'' Shepard
said. ``You may lose your best workers to companies that don't
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Abrahamson, a San Francisco attorney for the Lindesmith
Center, a national drug policy institute that opposes drug testing,
said he receives at least one e-mail a week from high-tech workers
who smoke marijuana away from the job and are concerned about drug
testing at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of smart, creative people who work in Silicon
Valley in programming and they feel it helps them intellectually to
use marijuana,'' Abrahamson said. ``So testing might actually hurt
their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed, a 27-year-old financial analyst at Charles Schwab in San
Francisco who declined to give his last name, said he would have
thought twice about accepting an offer from the company six months
ago if that company required pre-employment drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use drugs,'' he said, ``but I would look at that
company as not as trusting (and) more rules oriented, as opposed to
a place that values its employees and entrusts them to do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco was the first city in the country to pass
legislation limiting drug testing in the workplace. In 1985, the
Board of Supervisors passed a statute drafted by civil rights
lawyer Cliff Palefsky banning random drug testing except for
workers in safety-sensitive jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Safety-Sensitive Jobs
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, California also passed a statute allowing
random testing only for employees in safety-sensitive jobs. What
constitutes ``safety sensitive'' is open to legal interpretation,
however.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a worker at the Fresno Irrigation District was fired
for failing a random drug test. Ron Smith, a ditch digger who had a
spotless record and won five safety awards in six years on the job,
won a suit in Fresno Superior Court saying the test violated his
constitutional rights because he wasn't employed in a
``safety-sensitive job.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in May, the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Fresno
overturned the ruling, saying that Smith's job was safety
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone operating a big piece of heavy machinery, sure, that
might harm other people, but Smith barely even used a shovel,''
said Joseph A. Davis, Smith's attorney. ``Fresno argued that Mr.
Smith could possibly fall into the canal and someone else may be
imperiled going in to save him. Well, if that's the case, we're all
in safety-sensitive jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in non-safety-sensitive jobs, some companies will be
more lenient in punishing drug-test offenders, notes Greenberg of
the American Management Association. Not that they will admit it
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of companies that test for drugs that are illegal but
really don't affect job performance,'' Greenberg said. ``They'll
pick and choose which positive tests to act on. Some companies just
don't want to know. Any advertising firm that gave its copywriters
pre-employment tests would have a real hard time filling positions,
if you know what I mean.''

UCLA FRESHMAN CLEARS HIS THROAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA might be light on leadership in its junior
and senior classes, but the Bruins have several freshmen and
sophomores with potential to fill the void. Linebacker Robert
Thomas, tight end Bryan Fletcher and quarterback Cory Paus are
prime candidates. They are vocal, insightful and tough.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has shown more fledgling leadership skill than
defensive end Rusty Williams, an energetic, extroverted freshman
who was named captain for the Arizona game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was flabbergasted that I picked him to be a captain,''
Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``He does want to be a leader, and he
thinks he will be. So do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, though. Not this season. Williams was Vista High's
captain for three years, but he doesn't feel comfortable speaking
up in UCLA's locker room before games or after defeats. Within the
delicate team dynamics, Williams hasn't earned the right to
criticize, question or motivate his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But he has taken the first step toward that privilege. He talks
on the field between plays _ sometimes to no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to me that nobody's talking with each other,''
Williams said. ``I know it's because there's lots of young guys.
But on the field I say, `Hell with it. I don't care.'''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the field. Next year, the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   What's his name?: If not the most original, Williams surely has
the Bruins' largest tattoo. In two-inch letters, he has
``Williams'' splattered across the top of his back in the same
place his name appears on his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy gave me a really good deal,'' Williams said. ``It took
about 2{ hours. It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing. It took some
thinking. I thought about going small, then I decided: `Go big, or
go home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: The Bruins lost as many games in October
(four) as they did in the 1997-98 seasons combined. They were 20-4
those years.
</P>
<P>
   Bright spots: Toledo lauded two seniors, cornerback Ryan Roques
and defensive tackle Pete Holland, for their recent play.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, who doubles as the defensive captain, has seven tackles
in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best he's ever played,'' Toledo said. ``He never
used to make plays, and he's making plays. He's playing to his
potential, and that's what you want. I always tell them it's
performance that counts, not potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonlighting: Quarterback Ryan McCann's move up the depth chart
(to second string) hasn't altered his plan to play the outfield for
the UCLA baseball team starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing every Sunday,'' said McCann, an Agoura High
alum. ``I talked to Joe Borchard (who plays both sports at
Stanford), and he said he only missed two spring practices because
of baseball conflicts. I can definitely do both.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!The schedule:!off! While the players have a three-day
weekend, the coaching staff will work today and Sunday. However,
Toledo plans to spend Saturday on the couch watching four
Pacific-10 games on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to relax, sit around and cheer for everybody to
lose,'' he said.

GIVING IN ON FOREIGN AID BILL, GOP FOCUSES ON AN ELECTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Ky.)  (th) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Congress agreed Thursday night
to cut a deal on a foreign-aid bill, adding $799 million more than
Republicans wanted to spend, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the battle, Republican leaders see a golden opportunity
to paint Democrats as more concerned about helping foreigners than
protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, the Republicans held up the foreign-aid bill _ and
with it, the battle over the budget, in which five of the year's 13
spending bills remain unsigned _ arguing over the desire of the
White House to spend $370 million to ease the debts of 41
impoverished nations, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the aid would ``enable the world's poorest and
most heavily indebted countries to finance health, education and
opportunity programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, calls it an
effort to ``rob the Social Security surplus to underwrite the
national debt of Nepal.''
</P>
<P>
   And aides to Speaker Dennis Hastert and DeLay say Democrats want
to spend money on foreign aid that would come from the Social
Security surplus, which both parties have sworn to protect. The
aides said the Republican leaders believe that argument could be
instrumental in helping Republicans keep control of Congress in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   One aide said it boiled down to this: ``Ghana vs. Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   The aides say the Republicans will paint the Democrats as
willing to put foreign potentates before aging Americans. ``All
they want,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said on the House floor
Thursday, ``is to give the taxpayers' money away to foreign
countries and be damned what happens at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' tactics became clear during tense talks between
Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Republican Congress contained $12.7
billion, 14 percent less than Clinton's request. On Oct. 18, he
vetoed it, calling it ``another sign of the new isolationism that
would have America bury its head in the sand at the height of our
power and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators went into closed-door conference in Hastert's
office Wednesday night thinking they might make a deal. They did
not. A serious sticking point developed: debt relief for foreign
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wanted $370 million, about $1.20 per American, to help
the 41 nations identified by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as ``heavily indebted'' lighten the burden of their
poverty. Thirty-three of those nations, including Ghana, are in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans held the line on debt relief at $123
million. This quarter-billion dollar difference was the biggest
barrier to completing the bill. Thursday night, a senior Republican
aide said they had won that argument.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they agreed to a White House proposal to add $799
million to their $12.7 billion bill. The major increases were $170
million in economic support funds, $150 million for international
development assistance, $104 million for nuclear-security programs
in the former Soviet Union, and $75 million for peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo. They earlier agreed to spend $1.8 billion
over three years to underwrite Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Now the White House and Congress will move on to negotiations
over four more bills financing the departments of Commerce,
Justice, State, Interior, and Housing and Urban Development and
federal money for the District of Columbia. They set a new deadline
Thursday night: Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Still the argument over foreign aid vs. Social Security, the
Republicans say, will be a main campaign theme in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rebuttals. For example, it could be said that the
Republican-written spending bills dip into Social Security,
according to the Congressional Budget Office. Since money comes
from the same pot, any program can be identified as the one that
used Social Security money. Opponents of more military spending,
for example, point out that Congress increased Pentagon spending by
$17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's view of debt relief _ he calls it ``American taxpayer
dollars sent overseas to subsidize the corruption and mismanagement
of foreign countries'' _ resonates with many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But not all: Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian
Coalition and a former Republican presidential candidate, supports
debt relief. So do Pope John Paul II, the World Bank and most of
the world's aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt-relief initiative sends our tax dollars to make sure
children are educated and vaccinated, and there are roads to get
farmers' goods to markets,'' said Seth Amgott, spokesman for Oxfam,
a worldwide anti-poverty agency. ``An American contribution to that
effort is entirely worthy and eminently affordable.''

 Companies Resist Installing Strict Security Measures 
 &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bay Area security experts are unanimous on the question of whether
it is feasible to keep guns out of the workplace.
<P>
   In a word: No.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful hard to stop a person who snaps,'' said Rico Ches,
vice president of operations for IPSA International, the consulting
division of Oakland's American Protective Services. ``It's not only
something we're going to have to live with, but something that will
grow worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The surest way to prevent guns from entering the workplace is to
introduce metal detectors and baggage searches at entrances.
However, most companies reject such measures so as not to give the
impression that their employees could be in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, security professionals urge firms to target disgruntled
workers before they turn violent and are trying to make corporate
managers more aware of the danger signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is very limited at most Bay Area companies,'' said
Richard Hongisto, a former San Francisco police chief and sheriff
who now runs Ambassador Private Security, which provides guards for
local hospitals, construction sites and other locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of business entities out there that need to
get up to speed,'' he said. ``It's usually only after a person has
been hurt that people will think about security.''
</P>
<P>
   Xerox Corp. said it is now thinkng more about security after a
copier repairman allegedly opened fire on his co-workers at the
company's Honolulu warehouse Tuesday, killing seven.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, workers at a boat repair company at the Northlake
Shipyard remained in disbelief after a man wearing camouflage
clothing strolled into the office on Wednesday and shot four
employees, killing two of them.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco experienced its own workplace rampage in 1993 at a
law firm at 101 California St., when a gunman killed eight people
and wounded six others before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you put metal detectors at every entrance, it isn't
possible to prevent guns from being brought into the workplace,''
said Kim King, president of King Security Services, which provides
guards for Bay Area hotels, department stores and highrise
buildings. ``We just have a society that is, unfortunately,
carrying guns.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can a company do?
</P>
<P>
   Short of metal detectors and other such defenses, security pros
advise corporate managers to pay closer attention to employees'
moods and behavior and watch for a few telltale signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who commit violence in the workplace have a distinct
profile,'' said Kenneth Carlisle, principal consultant with the
Carlisle Group, a security firm in San Juan Bautista. ``Typically,
these people begin to signal their behavior before they cause
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, disgruntled employees frequently will make
threatening comments around the workplace, such as telling
co-workers that they will retaliate if they fail to receive a
promotion or are disciplined or dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts also advise managers to watch for flashes of
anger, absenteeism, poor work performance or indications of drug or
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you see it coming,'' said Ambassador's  &LR; Hongisto. ``I
don't think it's too often that (workplace violence) is a big
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that relatively few corporate managers
receive training to spot disgruntled behavior in the early stages,
much less to intervene before a tragedy happens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes a violent episode comes right out of the
blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone who goes postal will give you signs,'' said
Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist who specializes in
trauma situations. ``There are some people who just don't fit in
well in a workplace environment. They blow up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, IPSA's Ches said the Bay Area's generally informal
corporate culture makes it even more difficult for companies to
adopt security precautions like closed-circuit TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is especially true in Silicon Valley, where people expect
free breakfasts and soft drinks and won't tolerate Big Brother
looking over their shoulder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ches observed that some companies have had
success with in-house hot lines, allowing employees to anonymously
report a co-worker's troubling behavior.
</P>
<P>
   All security experts agree that metal detectors are the best way
to prevent weapons from being brought into workplaces. But few, if
any, local companies are known to be using such devices on a
full-time basis to check for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to do it,'' said Kimo LePree, head of San
Francisco's Cougar International Executive Protection, a bodyguard
service. ``They don't want to do it for the cost, and they don't
want their offices to look like war zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at banks. They get robbed every day, and they don't have
metal detectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Highcom Security is one of the Bay Area's leading providers of
metal detectors. Its president, Yochi Cohen, said he has made only
a handful of sales to private companies over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Highcom sells most of its walk-through metal detectors to
airports, courthouses and other public buildings, at prices ranging
from $2,300 to $8,000 per unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of psychological hesitation to putting in a
metal detector,'' Cohen said. ``People think you will scare
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he has rented out metal detectors for corporate
shareholder meetings six times this year alone. Cohen speculated
that people feel less spooked by security measures when used only
on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no location better illustrates the private sector's
reluctance to impose tight security than 101 California St. A
spokesman for American Protective Services, which oversees security
at the building, said the owners decided after the shootings to let
individual tenants handle their own precautions.
</P>
<P>
   There are still no screening measures in the lobby, and not one
tenant has installed a metal detector.

RODRIGUEZ AND GREEN CAUSE TEAMS TO QUIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez, his agent and the Seattle Mariners' brain trust
were in the same room in the same city for a while Thursday, while
Shawn Green and his agent and the Toronto Blue Jays' general
manager were in the same state only 20 minutes apart. But both
groups really were in the same state _ a state of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Green are two of the band of glamorous young
players who could be free agents at the end of next season, and
whose teams must decide which path to follow if they can't sign
them to new contracts. The growing feeling among club presidents
and general managers is to trade the players rather than enter next
season with them unsigned for the future and face losing them as
free agents while receiving nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the Texas Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez to the
Detroit Tigers and Ken Griffey Jr. asked the Mariners to trade him
to a team closer to his Orlando, Fla., home. The Blue Jays must
also make a decision on Carlos Delgado, and the Cleveland Indians
are in a similar position with Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly understand, as does Shawn, that the longer these
talks go on the more likely it is the Blue Jays will pursue other
options,'' Jeff Moorad, Green's agent, said after a late-afternoon
conversation with General Manager Gord Ash. ``Gord has made it
clear that they would rather trade Shawn than go into the 2000
season with him unsigned for the future. We understand Gord's
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorad was speaking by telephone from his office in Newport
Beach, Calif. Ash was 20 minutes south at the hotel in Dana Point,
where general managers will hold their annual meetings beginning
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said the Blue Jays' preference was to sign Green, whom they
have offered a five-year contract. ``But,'' he added, ``I think
he's leaning another way. I think we want to have another
conversation with Moorad, but we've both had ample time to make
sure everybody's mind-set is what it is, and we need to go from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was in Las Vegas for Friday night's Players Choice
awards dinner, and he and his agent, Scott Boras, met with Pat
Gillick, the Mariners' new general manager; Howard Lincoln, the
club's new chairman, and Chuck Armstrong, the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was billed as a ``get acquainted'' session, but the Mariners'
triumvirate had one of those with Griffey last Tuesday and emerged
with the stunning announcement that their superstar center fielder
had asked them to trade him. The news came unexpectedly to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners knew they were going to have trouble retaining
Griffey and Rodriguez, their superstar shortstop, even after they
offered them long-term contracts worth more than $250 million
combined. If they determine that they can't sign Rodriguez and want
to trade him, the Mariners will face another formidable task.
Rodriguez and Boras have said publicly that if the shortstop is
traded, he does not intend to sign a new contract, waiting for free
agency to do that.
</P>
<P>
   So, teams would be faced with giving the Mariners a package of
players they want without knowing if they would have Rodriguez for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only a very narrow market for those players to begin
with for economic reasons,'' Ash said. ``Then when you pile on the
uncertainty of whether they will be there, it becomes more
difficult. It's not the easiest thing to trade a player a year away
from free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rodriguez, Griffey apparently is willing to listen to
contract offers from the team he is traded to, if he is traded. But
even Rodriguez could change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oakland Athletics traded Mark McGwire to St. Louis on
July 31, 1997, there appeared to be no chance that he would sign a
new contract with the Cardinals and remain with them beyond that
season. He was intent on playing in southern California so he could
be near his son. But less than two months later, having become
quite happy with the environment in St. Louis, he signed a
three-year contract. His record-breaking home run feats followed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Green would sign a contract with a team he were traded
to, Moorad said: ``It would depend on the organization involved. A
year away from free agency, Shawn has the ability to choose his own
team in a year. At the same time, we've compiled a preference list
internally with Shawn. There are some situations that are frankly
much more attractive than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash said the Blue Jays have not changed their initial offer to
Green because of the way the talks have proceeded, but they have
amended their offer to Delgado. They are no closer to an agreement,
though, than they are with Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the player and the representative is they want
to talk about one year,'' Ash said. ``One year doesn't work for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Blue Jays were to trade Green and Delgado, Ash said, they
would want players in return who ``come close to replicating what
they've done.'' He said Toronto did not have the luxury that the
Rangers had when they traded Gonzalez with hitters like Rafael
Palmeiro and Ivan Rodriguez remaining in their lineup. ``We need
more mature major league players,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   This past season Green hit .309 with 42 home runs and 123 runs
batted in. Delgado batted .272 with 44 home runs and 134 RBI.  &QL;

   UNITED NATIONS _ Poverty in Yugoslavia has nearly doubled since
the Kosovo conflict, with almost two-thirds of the population,
predominantly Serbian, living at or below the poverty line, the
senior U.N. relief official there reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Steven Allen, said at a briefing for journalists
that the number of people in poverty, which he defined as earning
$60 a month or less, reached 63 percent in September. By
comparison, 33 percent of the people were earning that amount or
less in July 1998, when the Serbian police and paramilitary units
started harassing ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the province in
Serbia where Albanians accounted for 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of poverty is but one measure of the price that Serbs
have paid for President Slobodan Milosevic's attempt to rid Kosovo
of Albanians and NATO's 78-day campaign of retaliatory airstrikes.

BIBBY: SEVENTH IS TOO LOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC basketball coach Henry Bibby scoffed at
Thursday's preseason media poll that had the Trojans finishing
seventh in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they know?,'' Bibby said. ``I don't know how they
picked us that low when we finished 15-12 and beat Stanford, and
some other good teams. I don't know how they can do that.
Everyone's gotten better on our team. I don't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans tied for seventh last season.
</P>
<P>
   With such little fanfare, junior center Brian Scalabrine expects
the Trojans to sneak up on the Pac-10's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the team that's going to catch up from behind and try
and knock off the top teams,'' Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   The starting five: USC's starting lineup will consist of point
guard Brandon Granville, shooting guard Jeff Trepagnier, small
forward David Bluthenthal, power forward Sam Clancy and Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   Senior forward Jarvis Turner will be the Trojans' sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the six guys that showed maturity,'' Bibby said.
``Jarvis can do more off the bench. He can accept coming off the
bench more at this time than David.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans should have six reliable players and will hope two
or three newcomers will contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby thinks junior-college transfer Rashad Jones will
contribute at point guard, and 6-foot-11 freshman Kostas Charissis
can back up Clancy and Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: USC is awaiting a decision from 6-9 forward
Andrew Zahn of Redondo High. Zahn is also considering Oregon State.
USC has stopped recruiting 6-6 small forward Nick Enzweiler of
Moraga.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have received one commitment from highly touted
shooting guard Desmon Farmer of Flint, Mich. USC has three
scholarships available this season.
</P>
<P>
   USC is heavily recruiting two Compton College players for the
spring signing period _ point guard Kevin Bradley and small forward
Anthony Reason.
</P>
<P>
   Health check: Bibby said freshman shooting guard Nate Hair is
two-to-three weeks away from practicing. Hair suffered a stress
fracture in his knee last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost all the conditioning that he had,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Rashad Jones suffered a separated shoulder in
practice, but Bibby said he should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition tonight: USC plays its first exhibition game tonight
at 7:30 against the California All-Stars at the Lyon Center.
</P>
<P>
   Same floor, new look: USC's floor at the Sports Arena has been
repainted and will have ``Trojans'' printed across the center. The
free-throw lanes have been painted cardinal. The floor was
previously blue and red to reflect the Clippers' colors.

QUESTIONS SURROUND SUDDEN DIVE OF EGYPTAIR FLIGHT 990 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I _ Even the experts can only guess, so far, why
EgyptAir Flight 990 went into a sudden dive early Sunday morning
over the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But once its steep descent began, the Boeing 767 might have
experienced a phenomenon known as ``Mach tuck'' in its harrowing
17,000-foot dive.
</P>
<P>
   As it neared or passed the speed of sound, the nose of the plane
would have dropped and continued to drop as the speed increased,
according to an aeronautics expert familiar with the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data shows the plane abruptly halted its high-speed
descent, climbing more than a mile and a half after reaching the
bottom of the dive.
</P>
<P>
   Were the pilots struggling to regain control of the plane? Were
they momentarily successful?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Aerodynamic forces, structural failure or something other than
any actions by the pilots could have caused the plane to go back
up, said Ted Beneigh, an aeronautics expert on the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could have caused it to dive, could have
caused it to climb,'' said Beneigh, an associate professor of
aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. His
expertise is current jet transports.
</P>
<P>
   Beneigh has flown Boeing 727s and is rated in a simulator to fly
the 767. He teaches a course on how the 767's navigation and
control systems work.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the dozens of people intimately familiar with the
Boeing 767 who tried Thursday to concoct a chain of events that
would match the radar data released by the National Transportation
Safety Board on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some talked of pilots whose ability to work the controls was
reduced or eliminated by a hijacker or by an accident in the
cockpit. Others told The New York Times they believe the autopilot
might have mistakenly triggered a dive and that the pilots tried
too abruptly to pull out. Still others theorized that a key part,
like the tail elevator, broke.
</P>
<P>
   A few believe the problem is on the other end, with the radar
data itself, which they say cannot be correct.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data offers no clue as to what touched off the
accident, which could have been anything from mechanical failure to
pilot error to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary analysis of the data, however, suggests the plane
may have approached or even passed the speed of sound during the
dive from its cruising altitude of 33,000 feet, investigators say.
The jet then climbed about 8,000 feet before making a final plunge
into the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
</P>
<P>
   For the 217 crew and passengers on the plane, only 30 minutes
into their flight to Cairo early Sunday morning, the rollercoaster
ride ended at 10,000 feet when the plane broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Unraveling the mystery of Flight 990 now depends largely on
investigators being able to extract good data from the plane's two
black boxes, which the Navy hopes to attempt to recover as early as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to look at the radar data, but the best
situation is to have a fully functional flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder to the impact point,'' said John Clark, an
NTSB radar expert.
</P>
<P>
   Locator beacons on the two black boxes have been heard in a
debris field about 275 feet deep, but high winds and rough seas of
more than 22 feet have delayed any salvage effort by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But with calmer weather forecast for Friday, the Navy late
Thursday sent the USS Grapple and another ship out to sea so they
could arrive at the crash site by first light. Weather permitting,
the Grapple will try to recover the two black boxes using a remote
device called Deep Drone. The weather window will be short-lived,
though. Another storm is expected by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My No. 1 concern here _ and I've explained this to all the
sailors involved _ is the safety of these young men and women who
are going to be out on-scene conducting this incredibly dangerous
event,'' said Rear Adm. W.G. Sutton, who has assumed tactical
command of the Navy forces involved in the recovery operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the downed plane's flight data and voice recorders are
analyzed, investigators will have many more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane dove for about 40 seconds, from 33,000 feet
to 16,700 feet. They believe it reached its fastest speed about
midway through the dive, where the speed of sound _ which varies
based on temperature and altitude _ would have been about 735 mph.
</P>
<P>
   They know the plane's manual says it should not be flown more
than .86 times the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   As the 767 approached the speed of sound, strange things would
have happened to the plane, said Beneigh.
</P>
<P>
   The air flowing over the wings of the 767 would have compressed,
resulting in the jet's nose dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose starts to go down and you are out of control,'' he
said. ``You do whatever you can to try and slow the airplane
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Radar showed the plane continued to descend to 16,000 feet
before making a gentle turn to the right and climbing back to
24,000 feet. It then began another rapid descent to 10,000 feet
where it structurally came apart.
</P>
<P>
   While the extreme steepness of the initial drive would have
terrified passengers, they would not have known when the plane
approached the sound barrier, Beneigh said. On the Concord, he
pointed out, passengers know they have crossed the barrier only
because they can see a cabin Mach meter.
</P>
<P>
   For pilots of EgyptAir Flight 990, though, it would have been a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   Their control yokes or steering columns would have started to
shake violently. Ailerons on the wing would have started to
vibrate. This is known as ``aileron buzz,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things can happen,'' he said, ``but I don't know anyone
who has ever tested a 767 at speeds that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators aren't certain just how fast the 767 was going in
that initial dive. They have stressed that their radar analysis is
very preliminary and could change as they get more information.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots never made a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the plane was out of control,'' Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator said the jet was dropping about 24,000 feet per
minute during the initial dive.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate
for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute. An emergency descent, for
example, might be necessary if the plane lost cabin pressure and
pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Early analysis has focused on one of the jet's thrust reversers
_ the engine device used to slow a jet after landing _ which had
been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But speculation that a thrust reverser could have been deployed
in flight was fueled mostly because the only other 767 to crash
from a mechanical failure _ a 1991 disaster in Thailand _ was
blamed on a thrust reverser which deployed in flight. The Lauda Air
crash killed all 223 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauda jet's flight data recorder, which could have provided
information about how the plane behaved after the reverse thruster
deployed, was destroyed in the crash. Investigators had only radar
from which to reconstruct the accident. They knew a thrust reverser
deployed, for example, from listening to the cockpit voice
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Based on radar data, investigators believe the Lauda Air jet
flipped over into a steep dive.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary analysis of radar tacking of the EgyptAir flight
does not suggest the plane flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also don't know why, when the EgyptAir plane
reached 16,700 feet, its transponder stopped working. A plane's
transponder sends out an electronic signal that provides air
traffic control radar with the plane's altitude and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   That would indicate a loss of electrical power or some kind of
electrical malfunction on Flight 990 as it neared the end of its
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But even with electrical power out, the pilots could have
continued flying the plane because it uses hydraulic-power cables
rather than a fly-by-wire system. If the plane's power system
failed, the hydraulic pumps would continue to work as long as the
engines were running, Beneigh said.
</P>
<P>
   But were the pilots battling to fly the plane? Or had
aerodynamic forces merely taken it on a terrifying roller-coaster
of a plunge?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these questions will be answered when they get the
flight data recorder,'' Beneigh said. ``And the voice recorder,
too. ''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is only speculation.

INTERNET COMPANIES SET POLICIES TO HELP PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   To address online privacy concerns, a group of leading Internet
advertising and data-profiling companies has agreed to adopt
policies that allow consumers to find out what information is
collected by the marketers and to turn off the data-gathering
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The industry initiative is set to be announced on Monday at a
public workshop about online profiling in Washington, which is
being held by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of Internet technology and its use by companies to
identify personal patterns of online buying and behavior is a
subject of increasing concern to privacy groups and the government.
Profiling software can monitor every World Wide Web site that a
computer user visits, every online advertisement she views, every
mouse movement she makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is something we haven't examined closely, yet
it allows companies to collect great amounts of information without
the slightest knowledge by consumers that it is being collected,''
said Robert Pitofsky, the FTC chairman. ``It certainly strikes me
as a troubling notion. And this surreptitious nature of the data
collection makes this different from other privacy issues we've
dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 companies involved in the self-regulatory effort are
Internet ``middlemen'' businesses that place ads on Web sites and
assemble demographic profiles for marketers and Web sites. Until
now, most pressure for online privacy policies had been applied to
the brand-name sites of the Internet like America Online,
Microsoft's MSN, Yahoo and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, by and large, invisible to consumers, so we do need to
make an extra effort,'' said David Zinman, vice president of
marketing for Adknowledge, a company controlled by CMGI that is in
the group, which has been tentatively named the Network Advertising
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ryan, president of Doubleclick Inc., another member of the
group, said, ``We're doing this as one step toward the broader goal
of making consumers feel comfortable on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies started working together on voluntary
privacy-protection guidelines earlier this year after prodding from
the FTC and the Department of Commerce. The Clinton administration
has generally adopted a self-regulatory approach to Internet
privacy, though it did endorse online privacy legislation for
children, which was passed last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. policy of self-regulation has been a sticking point in
long-running trade negotiations with Europe, which has adopted a
data protection law. To try to settle the dispute, David L. Aaron,
the undersecretary of commerce for international trade, and the
European Union's top negotiator, John Mogg, met in Washington
Thursday. Their discussions will continue Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies in the initiative plan to announce that they have
agreed to clearly notify consumers of their data collection
practices and allow them to ``opt out'' of the profiling
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are also working with Web sites and advertisers so
that their privacy policies clearly state that they are using these
Internet middleman services, known as infomediaries. In addition,
the host sites and advertisers should have links to the profiling
companies, making it easier for users to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   The companies in the initiative have pledged to have their
privacy practices checked by independent Internet monitors,
including Trustee, BBB Online and Webtrust. The group is also
setting up its own Web site, www.networkadvertising.org, where
consumers can read about the practices of Internet advertising and
profiling companies, and opt out if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Doubleclick and Adknowledge, the companies initially in
the group are Netgravity, a unit of Doubleclick; Adsmart and Engage
Technologies, which are also controlled by CMGI; Matchlogic, a unit
of Excite(AT)home; Flycast Communications; 24-7 Media, AdForce; and
Real Media.
</P>
<P>
   At the profiling workshop, Doubleclick says it will clarify its
position on how it plans to work with Abacus Direct, an information
company whose database contains the catalog-buying habits of 88
million households.
</P>
<P>
   In June, when Doubleclick said it would buy Abacus for $1
billion in stock, privacy groups were very worried about how
Doubleclick might merge the Abacus buying data with its online
profiles. Ryan said that the Abacus catalog-buying data will not be
linked to Doubleclick's online profiles without clearly notifying
consumers and letting them opt out.
</P>
<P>
   Doubleclick has met with the FTC, Ryan said, to discuss how that
notification and choice could be clearly presented to users so they
do not have to be technically sophisticated to opt out. But no
final arrangements, he added, can be made until the merger closes
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Many key issues about online profiling technology, privacy
experts say, lie in the future as the software becomes increasingly
powerful. The profiling companies note that their technology
identifies a user's machine through an identifying software tag on
its browser. But, they add, the profiling software does not track
individual users by name.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates say that the distinction between a person's
machine and the person can be a fine line at best _ and a line
quickly crossed if a person buys an item online with a credit card
or registers by name at a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of serious challenges to privacy raised by the
activities of these companies, which people don't have knowledge or
control of,'' said Deirdre Mulligan, staff counsel for the Center
for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, said, ``Putting up some
principles does not represent a serious effort to protect Internet
privacy.''

IN VISIT TO NORTHEAST, CLINTON CALLS FOR INVESTMENT IN CITIES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ As President Clinton toured a struggling high
school in Newark, N.J., and a slowly recovering Hartford
neighborhood to announce a series of corporate investments in
impoverished cities, the White House and the speaker of the House,
Dennis Hastert, reached a bipartisan agreement to merge their
anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, described by Hastert in an interview and by
Clinton's aides as he traveled the Northeast with executives, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and basketball stars, is to be announced by
Clinton and Hastert on Friday in a low-income Chicago neighborhood.
But it is likely to yield little fruit until Clinton is out of
office _ the two men agreed on a set of principles, and left the
specifics and the financing to next year's budget debates.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the bitter atmosphere prevailing in Washington,
the pact may be remarkable simply for the fact that the two agreed
on anything. Clinton's aides said they had little chance of getting
corporate America to sign on to any program that did not have
bipartisan support, and Hastert appeared to be trying to inoculate
the Republicans against renewed charges by House Democrats who say
the congressional leaders are as extreme as the former speaker,
Newt Gingrich, when he first led the Republican revolution in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would essentially merge relatively small-scale
proposals that differ in specifics but share the goal of spreading
a remarkable era of prosperity more evenly. It is a delicate
political problem: Both in Newark and Harford Thursday, Clinton
tried to walk the line between acknowledging that many Americans
have been left out of the boom while promoting ``New Markets'' in
some of the country's oldest cities. It proved a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's audience of students Thursday morning at Malcolm X
Shabbazz High School in Newark gave the president a rousing cheer _
``No one comes here,'' one student said from the bleachers _ but
they quickly appeared restless and more than a bit bored by the
stream of announcements of investment projects and tax incentives
for small businesses and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The students immediately perked up at the appearance of Jayson
Williams and other stars of the New Jersey Nets, as Clinton hailed
the team's decision to put 35 percent of its profits into
scholarships, basketball leagues and programs to clean up parks.
</P>
<P>
   Williams told the audience that the students who performed the
most hours of community service could ``come to my house and party
hard,'' an incentive that drew far more rousing cheers than
Clinton's efforts to urge Congress to pass a new tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   The credit is one of a cocktail of modest government programs _
most of which are still tied up in congressional budget battles _
that Clinton has argued are needed to bring down urban
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Clinton's programs are based on modestly successful
administration efforts to encourage American investment abroad,
chiefly to open new export markets. Much as he did in July in
visits to Indian reservations, the Mississippi Delta and Los
Angeles, Clinton made the case that the last untapped markets are
in poor urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do in passing this program,'' Clinton said in
Newark, ``is nothing more or less than to give American business
people and other investors the same incentives to invest in the
poorer communities of American that we give them today to invest in
the poorer communities of South America or Africa or Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day in Hartford, he used the backdrop of a new arts
education center to make the case that he is devoting the last year
of his presidency to ``keeping this magic economic moment going.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far the programs he has described are tiny by most
economic measures. All the big numbers thrown around Thursday have
more to do with boardroom decisions than White House decisions.
``That does not mean that government programs are useless,''
Clinton's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said earlier this
week. ``Sometimes you need to give things a shove. The leverage
comes from the kind of incentives we are creating here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, President Clinton toured El Mercado, an indoor
Hispanic marketplace where he had campaigned in 1992, and then
joined insurance executives and Connecticut's Republican governor,
John Rowland, at the Artists Collective, the new arts center. There
he announced that local corporations were spending nearly $200
million to redevelop the city. He called it ``one of the most
impressive commitments'' to new markets in any city.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out Citigroup for its $7.4 million commitment of
equity and debt capital to build 70 homes in the Frog Hollow
neighborhood (though he pronounced it ``holler.'') And he thanked
Richard L. Huber, chairman and chief executive of Aetna, for
joining him on both his July and November ``new markets'' tours of
disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the morally responsible thing to do for the business
leaders of this community and this state and this nation to invest
in these places,'' Clinton told a crowd of about 150 people. ``It's
also the economically smart thing to do. It is a magic moment, and
we dare not let it pass us by.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford is a classic example of a city that has seen prosperity
pass it by: While Boston and New York have boomed, thousands of
insurance and aerospace jobs have been wiped out here, and there
has been relatively little new industry to replace it.

   A portion of the new $200 million in private investments Clinton
announced here Thursday will go toward redeveloping the downtown,
particularly through the $1.3 billion Adriaen's Landing project,
which would include a domed stadium, a convention center and new
retail stores, adjacent to the newly refurbished banks of the
Connecticut River. The state has pledged $455 million to the
project, provided the project can attract $210 million in private
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Charles, Sr., executive director of One/Chance, a
neighborhood economic development group, said he hoped that
permanent jobs from the new initiatives would reach residents of
struggling neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some concerns about how the table is set in this
process,'' he said. ``I am concerned about the extent to which
neighborhood voices are part of the overall planning process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, was working to make sure this initiative did
not suffer the fate of many others he has proposed: becoming grist
for partisan warfare. In July, he first broached Hastert with a
proposal to merge Democratic and Republican initiatives for cities.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Capitol Hill Thursday, Hastert said that he
and President Clinton had agreed to work together to try to come up
with a bipartisan strategy to bring new markets and new capital to
the impoverished parts of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I know needs to be worked on,'' Hastert
said. ``The president has an initiative fairly close to ours, so we
made a commitment to work together.'' He said the two wanted to
address environmental cleanup and to ``try to get people working
together so that people can have some individual enterprise in
these communities and try to build those communities back.''

FORMER TERRORIST NOW FIGHTS FOR PAROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Susan L. Rosenberg, a former member of the Weather
Underground, was arrested in New Jersey in 1984 after she and a
companion were found unloading 740 pounds of dynamite and weapons,
including a submachine gun, from their car. Ms. Rosenberg, who had
planned to supply others with explosives for bombings, was tried,
convicted and sentenced to 58 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has gained a reputation as a model prisoner and
she is now eligible for release. But the government has ordered
that she remain in jail for 15 more years because of a crime she
was never convicted of committing: the notorious 1981 armed robbery
of a Brink's armored car in Nanuet, N.Y., in which a guard and two
police officers were shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenberg was never put on trial in the Brink's case. The
United States attorney at the time, Rudolph W. Giuliani, dropped
the charges, indicating that there was no reason to try her given
the lengthy prison term she faced in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Denying any guilt in the Brink's case, Ms. Rosenberg has asked
Judge Charles S. Haight of Federal District Court in Manhattan to
grant her release or to reinstate the Brink's conspiracy charges
against her and then dismiss them outright.
</P>
<P>
   Howard W. Gutman, one of her lawyers, said: ``No individual
should be sentenced to 15 years in jail on charges for which they
were never tried or convicted. And no citizen in this country would
believe it could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenberg's lawyers have also cited a parole officer's
comments to Ms. Rosenberg last year that but for the Brink's case,
she would be released, and that the government was ``perhaps being
unfair to you by not having tried you and giving you a chance to
appear before a jury of your peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman declined to make Ms. Rosenberg available for an interview
this week. But the court papers, filed on Tuesday, show that she
has told the Parole Commission that she had renounced violence and
had worked diligently to rehabilitate herself.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted her guilt to the commission and apologized for the
New Jersey explosives case, saying, ``the criminal activities I was
involved in, I think that they were wrong and that they were
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   But she still maintains her innocence in the Brink's case and
the other crimes in New York, saying, ``I am not guilty of those
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney, Mary Jo White, said that the
office would have no comment on Ms. Rosenberg's filing but would be
responding in court. Ms. White's office opposed parole for Ms.
Rosenberg as early as 1994, when she first became eligible, citing
her role in the Brink's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Susan Rosenberg now professes a change of heart about
her pursuit of violence as a means to achieve her political
objectives,'' Ms. White wrote to the Parole Commission, ``the
wreckage she has left in her wake is too enormous to overlook.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parole Commission, in refusing to release her, has said that
it is appropriate to consider information beyond the specific
crimes for which she is serving time. The commission has also said
it ``does not find credible'' her denials of involvement in the
Brink's case and the other crimes that prosecutors say were
committed by a group of violent radicals who called themselves
``the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors' decisions to drop charges are usually not subject
to legal challenge. But Ms. Rosenberg's lawyers contend that in
dismissing the Brink's conspiracy charges in 1985, the government
deprived Ms. Rosenberg of the right to challenge the evidence in
court and then punished her in a new forum, the Parole Commission,
``in which she was stripped of nearly every right and protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenberg was one of 11 people originally accused in a
nine-count indictment in 1982. It included federal racketeering and
bank robbery charges such as the $1.6 million Brink's robbery and a
1981 armed robbery in the Bronx as well as helping engineer the
1979 prison escape of Joanne D. Chesimard, a Black Liberation Army
leader.
</P>
<P>
   After fleeing the indictment, Ms. Rosenberg and a companion,
Timothy A. Blunk, were arrested in November 1984 off Interstate 295
in Cherry Hill and charged in the weapons and explosives case in
New Jersey. As she was led to arraignment, she shouted: ``We're
caught, but we're not defeated. Long live the armed struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Both were convicted in March 1985 of eight counts of possessing
explosives, weapons and fake identification cards and were
sentenced to 58 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Giuliani's office, over Ms. Rosenberg's
objection, dropped the Brink's conspiracy charges against her,
citing the long term of imprisonment she faced in the New Jersey
case. Blunk, who had no role in the Brink's case, was paroled after
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   A prison official in Danbury, Conn., where Ms. Rosenberg, now
44, is housed, has told the Parole Commission that she ``is a
perfect example of one who has truly changed.'' She has developed
AIDS programs for prisoners, counseled troubled inmates and worked
in the prison chapel and library, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A parole officer told her last year that based on the New Jersey
charges alone, she should be released. But the officer, Raymond E.
Essex, said that the Brink's conspiracy and the deaths that ensued
required that she serve 15 more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting off three murders is a real problem,'' Essex said.
``I agree with you and your counsel that in some ways it is unfair
to you because you were not heard in a proper forum.''

<P>
   Slightly more than a month after warning investors to expect
disappointing financial results soon, Avon Products said Thursday
it was replacing its chief executive with the ultimate Avon Lady.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Andrea Jung, Avon's president and chief
operating officer, comes less than two years after a high-profile
executive search in which she and three other women at the company
were passed over in favor of Charles R. Perrin, an outsider with no
experience in direct selling or cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jund becomes the fourth chief executive of a Fortune 500
company who is a woman, and the scone to be named this year. She
joins Carleston S. Fiorina At Hewlett-Packard, Jill Barad at Mattel
and Marion Sandler at Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said Thursday that Stanley C. Gault, a 14-year
Avon director who has been chairman and chief executive of the
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. and Rubbermaid, would replace Perrin
as chairman, a position he had held since May.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 18 months after Perrin arrived at Avon, two women
considered for the top job back then have left the company and
Avon's North American business is in a slump. Perrin, who is 53,
abruptly announced Thursday that he was retiring with more than a
year left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Avon board is counting on Ms. Jung _ who is 41 and had
been the company's second in command _ to revive a business that is
facing tougher competition, slowing sales in the United States and
a credibility issue with disappointed investors and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the weakness in Avon's core business, analysts said, the
change was not entirely unexpected. But the timing was surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Perrin became chief executive in July 1998, his
predecessor, James Preston, said that the inside candidates, which
included at least two men in addition to the four women, were
``just a few years away'' from being ready to take over.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Perrin's selection, Ms. Jung was also promoted to
president from executive vice president, signaling her status as
heir apparent to Perrin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jung ``has a thorough knowledge of the company and the
global beauty industry, as well as the passion to mobilize the
organization during this period of significant change,'' Gault, who
is 70, said in a statement Thursday. ``It has been the board's
intention that Andrea would become Avon's next CEO, and given
Charlie's decision to retire, we firmly believe this is the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Avon's recent poor performance, analysts and industry experts
say, probably accelerated the change at the top. The company said
on Sept. 29 that it would not meet analyst expectations in the
current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With annual sales of $5.2 billion, Avon, which is based in New
York, was expected to earn 63 cents a share for the period.
Instead, it said profits would only match or improve slightly
compared with the 56 cents it earned in the corresponding period a
year ago. The company also said last month that because of weak
holiday sales, it would probably not meet its target of 5 percent
revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Avon's domestic business has been hit by stiffer competition
from companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble, which recently introduced a
line of Oil of Olay cosmetics. It also suffers from an image
problem with consumers who regard Avon as their mothers' makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what has gone on in the last year or so at Avon it's
reasonable, but it's a little earlier than expected,'' said
Mellissa Grant, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jung, a marketing whiz who is said to have a keen grasp of
the Avon consumer as well as the company's unique sales force of
door-to-door ``Avon Ladies,'' is credited with updating Avon's
image, merchandise and packaging.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Ms. Jung said that her top priorities
would be to invest heavily in advertising and marketing, continue
to expand the company's consumer-marketing programs and to
``execute with a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though some analysts question the depth of Ms. Jung's
operational skills, others familiar with Avon say she is clearly
the best choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a broad-based strategist,'' said Kirk Palmer, president
of Kirk Palmer &AMP; Associates, a New York executive search firm
specializing in retailing. ``Andrea's going to bring new energy and
new vitality to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Wellington, president of Catalyst, a nonprofit New York
group that monitors the treatment of women in the workplace, said
that Ms. Jung's appointment was also ``an indication that there are
cracks in the glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any list of best companies for women would not be complete
without Avon,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Ms. Wellington emphasized, that ceiling ``was not
shattered and lying on the floor in executive suites across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors certainly endorsed the change, with the company's
shares rising $2.125 Thursday, to $31.75.
</P>
<P>
   Though Avon has long enjoyed a reputation of career
opportunities for women and though its board includes several, the
company came under criticism when Perrin took over because of the
number of high-ranking insiders, most notably Ms. Jung, who were
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times people don't want to take a risk on a woman,'' said
Dee Soder, a managing director at the CEO Perspective Group, a New
York executive advisory firm. ``I think there was a bigger risk
taking someone outside the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrin, a former chief executive of Duracell International, the
battery company, was never a good fit. When he arrived at Avon,
Perrin acknowledged that not having direct selling experience was a
drawback. But he said he was brought in to explore new sales
strategies and to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I just don't think he understood who he was
marketing to,'' said Allan Mottus, a consultant to the beauty
industry and publisher of The Informationist, a trade publication.
On Perrin's watch, Avon confused its core customers by trying to
become too upscale, he added. ``Avon is not Fifth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrin, though, may be taking the fall for some circumstances
beyond his control. Like many consumer-products companies with
substantial global operations, Avon was hurt by the collapse last
year of many overseas economies. More important, the company has
grappled with how to update its sales force to fit the needs of
consumers in an age of e-commerce and working women.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will be up to Ms. Jung to lead a makeover. Indeed, in
many ways she is the epitome of the way the Avon customer has
evolved from the days when many women were home during workday
afternoons and Avon representatives dropped by with the newest
shade of eye shadow or the latest flavor of lip gloss.
</P>
<P>
   A working mother in a family of overachievers _ she is married
to Michael Gould, chief executive of the Bloomingdales unit of
Federated Department Stores _ Ms. Jung joined Avon in 1994 as a
marketing executive. Before that, she was the executive vice
president of Neiman Marcus responsible for women's intimate
apparel, accessories and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton University, she also serves as a board
member of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Jung, who is Chinese-American, said that the Avon
board tapped her for her ability to ``get the job done'' to
rejuvenate the business, she said she was keenly aware, and proud,
of her responsibilities as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my heritage and certainly my gender,'' Ms. Jung
said. ``I think it's a privilege being a minority woman leading a
Fortune 250 company.''

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKERS RAISE KEY RATE A HALF-POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Declaring that Europe's economic outlook
had turned ``far more favorable,'' the European Central Bank
reversed course Thursday and raised interest rates for the first
time in its short history.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the benchmark refinancing rate, to 3 percent
from 2.5 percent, had been widely expected and still left European
interest rates substantially below those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And although higher rates tend to brake economic growth,
investors reacted favorably. European stock indexes rose and bond
yields narrowed slightly, apparently reflecting investors'
conviction that the fairly big increase Thursday would preclude
further rate rises for at least a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders in the United States also appeared unfazed by the
European move, concluding that it had little bearing on whether
Federal Reserve policy makers would raise rates at their next
meeting on Nov. 16. Stocks ended higher, with the Nasdaq market
reaching its fifth consecutive record close.
</P>
<P>
   But the European single currency took a somewhat surprising dip.
After initially climbing against the dollar, the euro slipped to a
six-week low and settled at $1.0377 in New York, down from $1.0485
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hints of Thursday's move in the refinancing rate _ the interest
that the European Central Bank charges commercial banks for
short-term loans _ had been well advertised in recent weeks by bank
officials. They had repeatedly emphasized a growing concern about
risks of heightened inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until Thursday, the central bank had been primarily
concerned with preventing a serious economic downturn or a possible
bout of deflationary price decreases. The bank reduced its rates in
April to 2.5 percent from 3 percent. That followed a rate cut in
December, just before the European bank formally assumed its
powers, by the individual central banks of all 11 member countries.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's decision, the bank placed the emphasis once
again on preventing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Though concrete evidence of inflation remains as negligible in
Europe as in the United States, the supply of money has increased
more quickly than European central bankers either expected or
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's main measure of the money supply expanded by at an
annual rate of 5.9 percent in recent months, far above its target
of 4.5 percent. More money in circulation can increase inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the conclusion that there is ample liquidity,''
said Wim Duisenberg, the European Central Bank's president. ``We
want to prevent the liquidity situation from becoming so ample that
it would over time exert an upward pressure on prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase coincided with a smaller increase by the Bank
of England. That move, to 5.5 percent for the securities repurchase
rate from 5.25 percent, was the second increase in two months in
Britain, which has not yet adopted the euro and sets monetary
policy independently of the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic situation in Britain is considerably better
than across much of Continental Europe. Though growth is quite
strong in France and torrid in smaller countries like Ireland and
the Netherlands, it remains modest in Germany, which accounts for
about one-third of the euro zone's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   France's economy is growing at an annual rate of more than 2.5
percent and business confidence is improving. But at this point,
Germany will do well to grow by more than 1.5 percent this year and
2.5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Because European interest rates are still low, economists
throughout the region greeted the rate increase as a fairly
painless precautionary step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate cut in April was really not necessary because there
really was no threat of deflation,'' said Stefan Bergheim, an
economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt, ``so this in some ways
corrects that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Preuschl, an economist at Deutsche Bank, told Bloomberg
News, ``Investors got what they wanted _ an assurance European
central bankers are keeping a close eye on inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase of a half-percentage-point, rather than just a
quarter-point, was considered fairly forceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A timely rise in interest rates will avoid the need for a
larger increase in interest rates later,'' Duisenberg said
Thursday. At the same time, he refused to rule out further rises.
After reducing rates in April, he said ``this is it'' and there
would be no more rate cuts. Thursday, he said he simply could not
say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many analysts are convinced that higher rates are likely
later next year. Though few experts think that the European Central
Bank will move again for several months, many predict that rates
will climb next summer or autumn.
