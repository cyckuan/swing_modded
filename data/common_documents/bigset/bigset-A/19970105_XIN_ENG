<HEADLINE> Five Killed in Armed Clash in Central Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Three guerrillas and two
policemen were killed today in an armed clash between police and
members of an ultra-leftist group at a village in central Nepal,
the official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened early this morning when the armed
guerrillas attacked a temporary police post in the Ramechhap
district, about 60 km east of the capital Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The attackers killed two policemen while three guerrillas
including a woman were shot dead by the police in the armed
encounter, the RSS reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the six policemen stationed at the post, one policeman
was seriously injured and another was missing, it said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers later set ablaze the police post and fled to the
nearby forest, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A police team has been sent to the scene to hunt for the
guerrillas, a Home Ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 people have been killed during encounters between
police and members of the ultra-leftist group, according to the
Home Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on State Affairs of the lower house of parliament
has criticized the government for failing to find a political
solution to the problem concerning the ultra-leftist group's armed
movement.
</P>
<P>
The Home Ministry argues that the government has received no
response to its letter sent to the ultra-leftist group calling for
a political settlement.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Plan to Hold Anti-US Rally at Hajji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Defying Riyadh's different view,
Iran said today that its pilgrims will hold an anti-United States,
anti-Israeli rally during the forthcoming religious ritual in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri, the
representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on Hajji
affairs at a meeting with a group of clergies.
</P>
<P>
Reyshahri noted that a political ceremony, besides a
worshipping one, was an integral part of the Hajji -- a ritual
that annually attracts a million of Muslims from all over the
world to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
He described it as "the most important duty of the Muslims" to
hold the anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli rally at the Hajji which falls
on April 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
But Riyadh has disagreed over the nature of the rally known
among Iranians as Disavowal of the Disbelievers Ceremony, fearing
of a politicization of the religious ritual.
</P>
<P>
A 1987 rally left over 400 Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims
dead as Saudi security forces fired on the rally mass, an event
which led to severance of ties between Riyadh and Tehran in 1988.
</P>
<P>
This year, Saudi Arabia allows 100,000 Iranian pilgrims to
Mecca, or 66 percent more than the number for last year.
</P>
<P>
The first group of Iranian pilgrims will set off to Saudi
Arabia on March 23, 1997. Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979,
some 1.7 million Iranian pilgrims have visited Saudi
Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Former Olympic Champion Sun Shines in Diving GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Former Olympic champion Sun
Shuwei of China made a flawless last dive to win the men's
10-meter platform gold medal at the FINA Diving Grand Prix here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sun, the gold medalist in the same event at the Barcelona
Olympics in 1992, was competing in his first international tourney
after he failed to made the Chinese team for the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He collected a total of 674.10 points, followed by the
14-year-old compatriot Huang Qiang with 614.34 and Tony Lawson of
Australia, 570.27.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women divers followed their male compatriots to
finish 1-2 in the three-meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
Lu Haisong captured the gold with 486.06 points and Yang Lan
seized the silver with 485.31. Kazakhstan's Vygouzova Irina,
third finisher in the 10-meter platform on Friday, went away with
her second bronze with 465.27 points.
</P>
<P>
Sun, 20, who was second in the semifinals after Huang, executed
all his six dives in the finals successfully.
</P>
<P>
With all the first five dives scored over 76 points apiece, Sun
made a brilliant final dive of reverse three and a half
somersaults in tuck position, which brought him 90.78 points, the
highest mark of the competition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied with my performance," Sun said. "I think I
have reached the standard of 1992 when I won the Olympic gold."
</P>
<P>
But Huang's coach Yang Zhuliang said his teenage student should
have done better. "He was really impressive in training," Yang
said. "Anyway, he was still young. He has enough time to improve."

DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Major donor agencies and countries
are unhappy about Bangladesh's poor performance in project
preparation and implementation, according to government officials
here.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the donors, including the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank and Japan, are annoyed to find that work
never starts immediately after the signing of loan and project
agreements between them and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi officials have always taken "unnecessarily" long
time in processing tender documents and preparing the projects,
the donors have complained.
</P>
<P>
The donors have demanded an improvement of the situation before
more funds could be channelled to the country.

<HEADLINE> China, Australia Big Winners at World Cup Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia came out
as the big winners on the opening day of the two-day Epson
Short-course Swimming World Cup Hong Kong '97 here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
And world champion Laudia Poll from Costa Rica was the most
decorated swimmer of the day with her triumphs in two freestyle
events of the weekend event.
</P>
<P>
A fairly young 13-swimmer Chinese team scored a flying start of
the year with their grab of nine medals today -- four gold, two
silver and three bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
The strong Australian side chalked up an almost same score with
an opening-day medal credit of 4-2-2.
</P>
<P>
Germany was ranked third after today's actions, with a 3-3-2
record.
</P>
<P>
But 24-year-old Poll, winner at the short-course world
championships in 1995 in Brazil, was obviously the swimmer of the
day, winning the women's 200 meters and 800 meters freestyle
titles in the same evening.
</P>
<P>
But her first victory of the day came only after taking a tough
challenge from Chinese, two of them.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympians Nian Yun, 14, and Wang Luna, 15, pressed on
the world champion so hard that Poll almost lost the race.
</P>
<P>
Wang was the first to reach the 50 meters turn, with Poll 0.21
seconds behind. Poll lagged further behind at the 100 meters
mark, ranking only third.
</P>
<P>
And it was not until at the 150 meters turn that Poll took over
the lead. She never gave up and led the field through to the end.
</P>
<P>
Poll later took the 800 meters freestyle event.
</P>
<P>
Other gold medals were taken by Marek Krawczyk of Poland,
Ukraine's Denis Silantiev, Japanese Yasuko Tajima and Frenchwoman
Diane Buiduyet.
</P>
<P>
"We've won what had been expected," said Zhang Xiong, the
deputy head coach of China's national swimming team.
</P>
<P>
"Two of our young swimmers pushed Claudia (Poll) really hard,
which forced her to win only through utmost efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This meet is a good test for what we've achieved during the
first phase of the winter training and we can see the young
members are doing well," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good beginning. Let's wait and see what they could
do tomorrow," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sunday will see actions in the 17 remaining events of the meet.
Hong Kong is the first leg of the eight-leg World Cup series of
the year. The next stop is Beijing, slated for next Wednesday and
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Troops Kill Two Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Two members of an
anti-government organization of Iran were killed and two others
arrested in recent clashes with government forces, Iran's official
Irna news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Irna report said the clashes occurred in western province
of Kermanshahan on Thursday night when two teams of the
Iraq-based armed opposition group, People's Mojahedin of Iran
(PMOI) tried to cross into the country from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The report said that several pistols and Kalashnikov rifles
were seized from the outlawed members.
</P>
<P>
Those who were arrested have confessed cooperation and
coordination with the Iraqi intelligence agency on crossing the
border, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, PMOI staged a series of bombing attacks around the
country during the fourth Iranian parliamentary elections. The
government reacted by staging an air raid on PMOI's base inside
the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
The PMOI, the largest anti-government organization, was founded
in 1964 and declared outlawed by the government in 1981. The
opposition exile force fought on Baghdad's side in the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Teen Pregnancy "Epidemic" in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
declared today "the epidemic of teen pregnancy" one of the most
serious obstacles to the nation's long-term success.
</P>
<P>
"We still have some pretty big problems in our society. None
stands in our way of achieving our goals for America more than the
epidemic of teen pregnancy," Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is on his Caribbean vacation on the U.S.
Virgin Island, said, "We know children who are born to teen
parents are more likely to drop out of school, get involved in
crime and drugs and end up in poverty, more likely to suffer ill
health, even to die as infants."
</P>
<P>
He noted that teen parents often find their own lives are
changed forever. "Too many don't finish school -- not ever -- and
therefore they never learn the skills they need to succeed."
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for effective action on it and urged Congress to
consider more fund on programs aimed at reducing teenage
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned his administration's achievement in the programs
as statistics show that the teenage birth rate has dropped for the
fourth year in a row, and that out-of-wedlock birth rates dropped
for the first time in 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed budgeting another 7.5 million U.S. dollars in
federal funds to encourage local and privately run programs to
discourage teenage pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> 2 French Soldiers Killed in Central African Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Two French soldiers were killed
today during a confrontation with rebel soldiers in the Central
African capital of Bangui, the scene of a two-month-long mutiny by
rebels against President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Colonel Henri Pelissier,
a press official of the French army, as saying that French troops
confronted what he called "uncontrolled elements" this morning on
a main street of Bangui, "to prevent the situation from
degenerating."
</P>
<P>
He said that a team of mediators including some army officers
of other African countries and some French soldiers tried to talk
with the rebels, but the latters opened fire and killed two French
soldiers when the mediators were returning to their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A local civilian was killed earlier in Bangui when rebel
soldiers threw grenades in the street after French troops were
deployed to prevent them from going to the residence of President
Patasse, reported AFP.
</P>
<P>
French troops, numbering some 2,000 in the Central African
Republic, intervened several times last year in the on-going
mutiny and two earlier mutinies against the rebels, who are
calling for the resignation of Patasse.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, U.S. Cooperate on Letter Bombs Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is offering full cooperation
in investigating the letter bombs that reached Washington via
Alexandria mail, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted an official source at the General Department of
Transportation Police as saying today that the Egyptian security
authorities are holding high-level contacts with the U.S on the
letter bombs that were disabled before they could cause harm.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified source said it has not been proved yet whether
the seal on the mail was forged and it's hard to tell if they were
really sent from Egypt's Mediterranean resort of Alexandria, 200
kilometers from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
All Egyptian letters and correspondents are thoroughly
inspected before reaching their destination, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Eight letter bombs disguised as Christmas cards, carrying the
seal of Alexandria post, were found in three different locations
in the U.S. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department today announced that most
of the letters were not sent from Egypt, as evidence suggests that
they were also sent from other Mideast countries, but it did not
specify.
</P>
<P>
But there is no evidence of government involvement in the
letter bombs and no one has claimed responsibility until now,
said a U.S. spokesman.

<HEADLINE> France Regrets US Keeping of Provision IV of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
suspension of provision III of the Helms-Burton law by U.S.
President Bill Clinton, but regretted the maintenance by
Washington of the law's provision IV on banning entry into the
U.S. of foreign enterprise leaders doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration made today, the French Foreign Ministry said
that the suspension by President Clinton for another six months of
the application of provision III of the law "deserves favorable
salutation."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the renewed suspension of the provision,
of which Clinton initially imposed the suspension on July 16,
1996, would "postpone the application of a legislation with
extraterritorial reach and contrary to the principles of the World
Trade Organization" and "avoid the risks of conflicts that its
application would bring about."
</P>
<P>
Provision III of the law, signed by Clinton last March, is
mainly to deter foreign investment in Cuba. It would punish
foreigners who do business on properties of Americans nationalized
in Cuba after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
But the declaration stressed that France was worried about the
maintenance of provision IV of the law, which allows the U.S.
government to ban access to U.S. territory by foreign businessmen
doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
France "cannot but reiterate its opposition to such unilateral
measures, and appeals for the respect of the rules guaranteeing
the security and liberty of international trade," said the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands,
Friday that he had decided to renew the suspension of provision
III of the law.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law has been widely condemned by Canada and
European and Latin American countries, which argued that the
United States was trying to impose its anti-Cuba trade sanctions
on them.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries have moved to enact laws to counter
Helms-Burton and filed trade complaints to the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Contracts to Buy Russian Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today contracted for
surface-to-air missiles from Russia despite neighboring Turkey's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government ministers and representatives of the Russian
state-controlled Rosvoorouzhenie company concluded the
multi-million-dollar contract at a meeting in the Ministry of
Defense, the Cyprus News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
But both the Minister of Defense Costas Eliades and Minister of
Finance Christodoulos Christodoulou who attended the meeting
declined to say if the missile contract has been officially signed.
</P>
<P>
Nor did the agency report specify the value of the contract and
the type of missiles. But observers here believed the S-300
surface-to-air defense system is on the deal.
</P>
<P>
Eliades expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting,
while Christodoulou described the cooperation between Cyprus and
Russia as "very good."
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Cyprus bought modern Russian tanks
T80-U and Russian-made BMP-3 armoured vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry has said the stationing of the
missiles in Cyprus can be "a threat to the security of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Observers noted the new missiles, with a range of 150
kilometers, will be deployed to protect naval and air bases under
construction on the west coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The bases are being built under a joint defense pact between
Cyprus and Greece, agreed in November 1993 to face possible
Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over this East
Mediterranean strategic island.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of
the island would mean war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Returns to Germany After Talks With Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
left here for home this evening after his talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin focusing on the planned eastward expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Kohl arrived in Moscow today for a one-day working visit and
had 75-minute talks with Yeltsin in the Russian president's Rus
residence outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"Special attention was paid at the talks to NATO's planned
eastward expansion," according to sources close to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky quoted the Russian
president as telling him, "We were looking for a solution to the
problem. We agreed to continue discussing the Russi-NATO subject
in the future."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Yeltsin agreed to pay a brief working visit
to Germany in April, during which he will go to Baden-Baden to
receive a prize from the German mass media that have selected
him the Man of the Year (1996).
</P>
<P>
He invited, via Kohl, his German counterpart, Roman Herzog, to
come to Russia in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin and Kohl also agreed to
closely cooperate this year, especially in preparing for a
coming summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations
plus Russia to be held in Denver, the United States, in June.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the two leaders were satisfied with the
results of their talks.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Kohl told a news conference at Moscow's
Vnukovo-2 airport that he had also discussed with Yeltsin
bilateral economic cooperation between Germany and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the NATO leaders had "no intention to
bring NATO's military infrastructure closer to Russia's
frontiers."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that a sound solution that will not create new
separation lines in Europe and will reflect lawful interests of
Russia's security will be found in 1997," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl was the first Western leader to meet Yeltsin after his
heart bypass operation performed on November 5. In 1996, he met
with Yeltsin in or outside Moscow three times and had regular
telephone contacts with him.

<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Former U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here today he is ready face any mission
that will serve Egypt or the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who returned home late Friday night at the end of his
five-year mandate, had a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak
today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference after the meeting that over the past
five years the U.N. has held a series of international conferences
which "laid down new basis for socio-economic development at the
international level."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Conference on Environment in Brazil, the Conference on
Population and Development in Egypt, the Social Conference for
Development in Copenhagen and the Conference on Women in China
all took place during his reign at the world body.
</P>
<P>
Ghali pointed out that the new U.N. secretary general has to
attempt to solve its financial crisis and defend its independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on "Good Morning Egypt" TV program upon arrival, he
said "my wish for 1997 is that peace is established in the Middle
East and the world."
</P>
<P>
During his stopover in Paris on Friday, Ghali said he will
never quit politics.
</P>
<P>
He also said he needs some time to compile his diary after
having completed a new book entitled "Agenda For Democracy," which
is about the Egyptian-Israeli peace negotiations and the peace
initiative in November 1977.
</P>
<P>
Ghali was the first secretary-general appointed in the
post-Cold War era. His renomination for a second five-year term
was vetoed by the United States, while the other 14 members of the
Security Council supported him.
</P>
<P>
He held the rank of Egyptian deputy prime minister for foreign
affairs in 1991 after more than 13 years as minister of state for
foreign affairs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Invites Arafat to Visit Washington: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has invited Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat
to visit Washington, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was contained in a message sent by Clinton a
few days ago, in which the U.S. president urged Arafat to speed
up the talks with Israel on reaching a deal on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The report added that Arafat intended to travel to Washington
"very soon," but it did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has also sent a similar message to Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to urge him to conclude the
long-awaited Hebron agreement. Clinton invited Netanyahu to visit
the U.S. capital at the end of the month to hold a strategic
dialog over the stalled peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The moves taken by Clinton were apparently aimed at pressing
the two sides to reach the Hebron deal so to pave the way for
pushing forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
But the Hebron talks, rumored to be closed days ago, now seem
to be backtracking following the Wednesday shooting incident by an
Israeli soldier in Hebron, which wounded seven Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is reportedly hardening his position to pressure Israel
to set a date for further Israeli troop redeployment in the rest
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources blamed the backtracking on the talks on Egypt,
which is said to have urged Arafat to delay the signing of the
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a weekly PA cabinet meeting Friday, Arafat
said some progress had been made in the talks, but the issue of
further redeployment still remained unsettled.
</P>
<P>
The legislative Palestinian Council also called for sending
international forces to protect the safety of the Palestinian
residents in Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to wrap up the marathon talks, U.S. special peace
envoy Dennis Ross today held a meeting with Arafat in Gaza. He
tried to persuade Arafat to meet with Netanyahu to initial the
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Ross told reporters that "we are still working, and we will
continue to work because we believe it is very important to reach
an agreement," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
today strongly denounced a bus explosion in Damascus, Syria, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE strongly condemned the criminal bus explosion" which
killed 12 people and wounded dozens of others, said the Foreign
Ministry in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said such terrorist move against innocent
civilians could never be pardoned.
</P>

Meanwhile, the ministry expressed its sympathy and solicitude
for families of the victims.
</P>

The UAE was confident that the terrorist bombing would not
shake Syria's stand on reaching a comprehensive and just peace in
the Middle East on the basis of international decisions and the
"land-for-peace " principle, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian authorities blamed the Israeli Muassad (intelligence
department) for the attack, but Israel flatly denied the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Signed Mideast Accord Must Be Implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that the Palestinians and Israelis should work to
implement an agreed formula on Hebron redeployment rather than
dish up a new accord.
</P>
<P>
Egypt respects the previously signed agreements and is keen to
contribute to the peace process by bringing together the
Palestinians and Israelis on implementing them, he added.
</P>
<P>
"What is taking place now is preparing a protocol to carry out
the agreements on redeployment in Hebron and the phased
withdrawal," Mubarak said during a two-hour meeting with the
Egyptian Television News Department.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expounded on the points of difference between the
Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Israeli government, and the
efforts exerted to bridge the gap between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
According to the Egyptian leader, Israel and the PA disagree on
two major points. Israel rejected any Palestinian presence at the
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, a city where some 450 Jews live among
120,000 Palestinians, and refused to set a timetable for ending
redeployment from the rest of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will not take part in any act or formula which
contradicts with the agreement signed between the two sides, he
added, and he denied reports that Egypt attempts to add new
articles to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations do not affect the core of the agreement or
its articles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PA and Israel are still trying to narrow their differences
on implementing the much-delayed Israeli troop pullback from
Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli control, as
well as pinning down the timetable for further redeployment in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The recent favorable atmosphere for signing the Hebron deal was
affected after an off-duty Israeli soldier opened fire at a
crowded market place in Hebron, wounding seven Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year interview with the "Good Morning Egypt" program
Friday, Mubarak said that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
were not seeking a new accord rather than an "executive protocol"
to a previous pact signed by the two parties and approved by
Israeli and Palestinian legislators.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening now is a protocol to carry out the
agreement, not a new one," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned that Israel would make a mistake if they were
seeking a new accord with the PA for further troop redeployment
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that terrorism, not war, will be the
alternative for peace in the Middle East. Peace opponents on both
sides will try to hinder it through terrorist attacks, he added.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment process should have started on September 7,
1996 and will end a year later.

Thus, the country's telecommunications business is fully
privatized with the company's shares sold out to the private
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Jordan Times reported that the new
company, with a capital of 250 million Jordan dinars (about 352
million U.S. dollars), "operates on full commercial basis."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Post and Communications launched the process
of privatizing TCC in July, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The TCC was first commercialized and streamlined with the
government retaining full ownership. Then the shares of the
company were gradually sold to the private sector. The whole
privatization process was officially concluded on January 1,
1997.

AMMAN -- Exports of the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC)
rose to 350 million U.S. dollars in 1996 with an increase of 30
million dollars over 1995, JPMC's General Manager Sameh Madani
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The company exported 4,350 million tonnes of phosphate last

The general manager also noted that the Jordan-Japan Chemical
Fertilizers Company with an investment of 85 million dollars will
start production this year and the chemical fertilizers will be
exported to Japan.
</P>
<P>
On the future plans, Madani said that the company this year
will increase its exports to Europe, Asia, Australia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the second largest exporter of phosphates in the
world after Morocco, reaching a peak production of 6.8 billion
tonnes in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has proven phosphate reserves of 1,500 billion tonnes,
and the state-owned JMPC accounted for about 15 percent of the
world's phosphate production in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Forces Continue Cross-Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces today
continued the cross-border military operations against the
rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern
Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Turkish F-4 fighters and Cobra
helicopters, which took off from the air base in Diyarbakir in
southeastern Turkey this morning, bombarded PKK Sinath,
Nizori, Ayitepesi camps and PKK temporary shelter centers in
Sindi Throat in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ground forces entered into the areas which were
bombarded, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It said that Turkish government troops and village guards
had cleaned up Pirbela and Avagoze camps of the PKK in the
region following the bombardment of the Turkish fighters.
</P>
<P>
Turkish state-run TV station reported Saturday night that more
than 150 PKK rebels had been killed and 25 wounded in the
cross-border operations by the Turkish security forces during the
last five days.
</P>
<P>
The PKK uses bases in northern Iraq outside Baghdad's control
as part of its guerrilla war for self-rule in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops have crossed into northern Iraq
several times in large numbers to wipe out the PKK militants, who
intermittently launch cross-border raids against Turkish
targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government made protests against the Turkish
cross-border military operations before and accused Turkey of
violating its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the 12-year-old guerrilla war which
has claimed more than 21,000 lives since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Kill 10 Rebel Soldiers in Bangui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- French troops killed 10 rebels and
arrested 30 on Sunday in a reprisal action against the mutinous
soldiers in Central African Republic's capital Bangui, after two French
officers were killed by the rebels on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry said that no loss was reported on the
French side in the operations against two key strongholds of the
rebels -- a police station in the southeast district of Petevo and
the Kasai military barracks in the northeast part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a French military
spokesman Colonel Henri Pelicier in Bangui as saying that French
troops had taken control of the police station, an oil depot and a
short-wave radio transmitter.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said a large number of arms were also
seized during the operation, including rifles, machine-guns,
mini-machine-guns, and many RPG rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the 2,000-man strong French troops deployed in
Bangui used armored vehicles and two Puma helicopters armed with
20-mm cannons in their attack against the rebels, which began at
01:00 (00:00 GMT) this morning.
</P>
<P>
The rebels kept resisting the French troops in the eastern part
of the city by 07:00 (06:00 GMT), according to reports from
Bangui.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic is in the grip of its third army
revolt within a year. French troops, in the former colony under a
defense pact, intervened to keep President Ange-Felix Patasse in
power during the second revolt in May. The latest revolt began on
November 16, the first revolt was last April.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been killed in violence associated with
the revolts which were initially about pay but have turned into a
campaign to oust Patasse, a civilian elected in 1993 during the
impoverished nation's democratic transition.
</P>
<P>
French officials described Sunday's operation as "legitimate
defense" following the killing on Saturday of the two soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the two French military men who were
killed, a captain and a warrant officer, belonged to the Sixth
Parachutist Regiment of the Marine Infantry of Mont-de-Marsan.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers were ambushed and murdered by mutineers on
Saturday while with a mediating team led by officers from Chad and
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The names of the war dead are kept secret as a tradition of the
French military.
</P>
<P>
AFP said the tension in Bangui remained high this morning. But
the French Foreign Ministry said that no plan has been made to
evacuate the French expatriates living in Bangui and other parts
of the Central African Republic.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Calls for Cooperation From Ruling Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba today called for cooperation from a ruling partner
in order to maintain the stability of his three-party coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Deuba called on leaders of the
National Democratic Party (RPP), the second largest partner in the
coalition government, to unitedly support the present government
led by his Nepali Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for a wider consensus on issues of national
importance, the statement also called for serious dialogue between
all political forces in the country including the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML).
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML, with support from a faction of the RPP, last month
tabled a no-confidence motion in parliament against Deuba and his
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The motion was narrowly rejected by the lower house of
parliament, but the Deuba government was reduced into a minority
status as some RPP MPs led by its parliamentary leader Lokendra
Bahadur Chand who had earlier decided to withdraw their support
for the government, voted in favor of the censure motion in the
House.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa and his supporters
in the party have vowed to continue their support for the
coalition government.

<HEADLINE> Recidivism Rare Among Ex-prisoners in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The recidivism rate of former
prisoners in east China's Zhejiang Province has been below six
percent over the past three years, local judicial sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prisons in the province have scored remarkable achievements in
their comprehensive efforts to rehabilitate prisoners, said Bao
Gang, director of the Zhejiang Prison Administrative Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The success came as a result of the implementation of the
country's Prison Law during the past two years, which is aimed at
transforming prisoners and preventing and cutting down on the
incidence of crime, Bao said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Prison Law, inmates study the legal system, Bao said,
and then hold contests to test each other's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Bao said more than 95 prisoners have expressed regret for their
crimes and determination to rehabilitate themselves.
</P>
<P>
Prisons also teach general work skills to ensure prisoners can
earn a living upon release. In the past two years, more than
20,000 prisoners in Zhejiang have passed technical tests, and many
have passed advanced exams.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the prisons have introduced psychological
testing and consultation services for prisoners. Statistics from
ten prisons show that more than 4,800 prisoners have received
tests and psychological diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prisons have mobilized people from all levels
of society, especially prisoners' relatives, to offer support to
the inmates.

<HEADLINE> Britons Optimistic About 1997: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A recent Gallup International
study showed that Britain has become the most optimistic nation in
Europe and that, for the first time in this decade, a majority of
Britons are upbeat about their prospects for the new year.
</P>
<P>
More than a half of Britons now believe l997 will turn out
better for them than l996, while Germany, Italy and Spain are
suffering a sudden crisis of confidence, a new worldwide study of
the Feelgood Factor conducted across 49 nations by Gallup
International shows.
</P>
<P>
The figure, a rise of six points since last year, is the
highest recorded since the Lawson boom of the l980s.
</P>
<P>
It is reflected in rising house prices across Britain,
increased high-street spending and consumer credit jumping to the
highest levels since l987 at 1.1 billion pounds (1.815 billion U.S
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The study also found that while other European countries worry
their economies will be damaged by strikes, most Britons believe
industrial relations will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
The Gallup International poll paints a very different picture
in other large European states. Only a third of Germans (35
percent) are now optimistic about the new year, and the Italians
(39 percent) and Spanish (27 percent) are both more pessimistic
than at the same period in l996.
</P>
<P>
The Germans, Italians and Spanish are also deeply worried that
their economies will be blighted by industrial unrest.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of Germans think there will be an increase in
strikes during the year as their economy struggles with heavy
structural unemployment and spiralling welfare bills. Half of
Italian and Spanish respondents share that gloomy prognosis.
</P>
<P>
However, Fewer than a third of Britons worry about increased
strikes during l997, with a majority (54 percent) convinced that
industrial relations will remain peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The news was welcomed by British Prime Minister John Major as
he attempts to convince the electorate that the pain of the
recession has finally borne fruit and that Britain is at last on
course to become the Enterprise Center of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Major said on Saturday: Britain is in great shape. We have more
jobs, stable prices and mortgages....The people of this country
have worked hard to make their families better off, and it's only
right they should feel more optimistic about the future.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Core Program Project Near Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Eight of the 10 Airport Core
Program (ACP) projects are near completion, a Hong Kong
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the progress made in 1996, Billy Lam, director of the
New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office, said that starting from
February, the 34-kilometer long transport corridor, linking the
new town at Tung Chung and the new airport at Chek Lap Kok to the
urban areas, will be progressively opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
A 7.2-kilometer stretch of six-lane expressway running along
the West kowloon Reclamation and the Kwai Chung Viaduct section of
 Route 3 will be opened soon after the Chinese Lunar New Year
Festival which falls on February 7, he said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the expressway will ease traffic congestion in
the west Kowloon area, he said.
</P>
<P>
The next major ACP project set for completion is the
two-kilometer Western Harbor Crossing linking Sai Ying Pun to the
West Kowloon Reclamation which is due to be open to traffic in
April.
</P>
<P>
The remaining sections of the ACP highways network, the Lantau
Link, the Tsing Yi section of Route 3 and the North Lantau
Expressway, will open in May.
</P>
<P>
Lam said that apart from maintaining good momentum on the ACP,
one of the significant achievements of the year was the reduction
of 1.85 billion HK dollars in the overall ACP budget from 158.169
billion to 156.364 billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, he said that despite excellent progress in 1996,
the next 12 months will be an important period for the
construction of the new airport and the airport railway where
there is much to be done.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 32,000 workers were employed on the
projects, of which 26,800 were local workers and the rest imported
ones.
</P>
<P>
He said that with work on the new airport and the airport
railway moving ahead rapidly, there will be a need to import
workers if there are not sufficient locals to fill the vacancies.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Fails to Earn More from Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- As the biggest oil exporter in
west Africa, Nigeria has been encouraging the export of non-oil
products in recent years in a bid to change its overdependence on
oil export for foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
But its hopes to earn more foreign exchange through the effort
last year may have been dashed.
</P>
<P>
A survey of the performance of 13 of the country's important
non-oil exports showed that at the end of last October, only
four, namely, cocoa, sesame seeds, groundnuts and cotton lint,
recorded increases over those one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The others, however, sustained year-on-year drops of between
11.7 and 65 percent in the 10 months under review.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Federal Produce
Inspection Service, a government agency responsible for
check-testing and fumigating all agricultural produce exports,
the total volume of cocoa exports in the January-October period
last year stood at 99,800 tons, up 49 percent from the 66,945.85
tons in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Since the cocoa season started from October, experts predicted
the total export for 1996 was certain to exceed 1995's 133,839.68
tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sesame seeds and groundnuts jumped by about 514 and
268 percent respectively, from 1,612.35 tons and 87.16 tons by
October 1995 to 9,902.86 tons and 321.06 tons in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The export of cotton lint increased 180 percent to 3,478.04
tons as against 1,932.06 tons a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, rubber exports dropped significantly from 22,959.82
tons in the first ten months of 1995 to 13,550.8 tons in the same
period last year, down by about 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cashew nuts and coffee did not fare any better as their
exports declined about 36 percent and 18 percent respectively,
from 18,946.55 tons and 650.03 tons to 12,085.88 tons and 531.38
tons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show Nigeria's export of gum Arabic, another major
non-oil export product of the country, plunged down sharply to
1,720.6 tons in the 10 months last year from the year-earlier
4,904.76 tons, while that of palm kernel cake dropped to
54,633.31 tons from 95,072.12 tons.
</P>
<P>
Other major non-oil products suffering drops in export last
year include animal skin, ginger and kolanuts.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts here, who ruled out the possibility of a
radical improvement in the non-oil exports in the last two months
of 1996, attributed the overall lull to the port reforms
introduced by the government in April last year which were aimed
at improving efficiency and accountability of the customs and
ports of the country.
</P>
<P>
Exporters are reported to generally complain that the reforms,
especially the introduction of inspection charges, amounted to
veritable disincentives to export.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Reorganize Trade Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An 18-member coordinating
committee has been set up in an attempt to reorganize the
Confederation of the Ethiopian Trade Unions, "The Ethiopian
Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The coordinating committee was formed on Saturday at a meeting
attended by executive committee members of eight industrial trade
union federations following the call by the Trade, Technical and
Printing Industries Trade Unions Federation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, President of the federation Mekonnen
Ambaye indicated that quite a significant proportion of the
Ethiopian working class has been subjected to various forms of
injustice and exploitation owing to the absence of a consolidated
central leadership that could have effectively protected the
rights of its members.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about that the valuable assets under the
former Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions, which stopped
functioning two years ago due to the undemocratic and unlawful
power struggle which broke out between a few individuals at the
top of its leadership, are being exposed to incalculable damage.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the participants reiterated the need for the
setting up of a coordinating committee which will help facilitate
the formation of a democratically elected Confederation of
Ethiopian Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they called upon the leadership of the Banking and
Insurance Trade Unions Federation to reconsider their stand and
join forces with their counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang's Anti-Poverty Speech Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The full text of an anti-poverty
speech delivered on September 23, 1996 by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the Central Work Conference on Poverty-Eradication was
released here today, calling on the nation to have a common
understanding of the general situation of the country and be
determined to help 80 million people get rid of poverty before the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The 9,544-character address was aimed at further mobilizing the
whole party and nation to strive for realization of the plan drawn
up by the central government in 1994 when there were still 80
million people in China who were living under the poverty
line. According to the plan, the 80 Million People will be helped
to escape the poverty within seven years.
</P>
<P>
"To basically solve the problem of having insufficient food and
clothing for the country's rural poor people by the end of this
century is a strategic goal already set by the Party Central
Committee and the State Council," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, China's poor population decreased from 250
million in 1978 to 65 million in 1995. He termed this an enormous
historic achievement and proof of the merits of China's socialist
system and the correctness of the Party line.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese leader warned that reaching the ultimate
goal will be extremely tough, as the work has entered into the
final challenging stages, and the remaining poor population now
lives in the country's most remote and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang suggested switching from old-fashioned,
poverty-relief efforts to a modern, development-oriented program
that will strengthen the individual poor regions' abilities to
improve their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
The whole Party and nation should be mobilized to participate
in the poverty-elimination efforts, Jiang said, noting that the
issue is an important task for the Party, the government and the
whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang proposed that Party organizations and governments of all
levels should play a leading role in the anti-poverty campaign.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the well-developed provinces and cities have
been asked to assist 10 poor provinces and ethnic minority
autonomous regions in implementing the poverty-eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the poverty-elimination efforts should be
carried out by depending on local people in the poverty-stricken
areas, stressing that while it is necessary to have the assistance
from the state and all walks of life in the anti-poverty campaign,
the local people must also meet some of the obligations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged that leadership be reinforced to carry out the
poverty-eradication plan and to adopt a responsibility system for
the leaders of all levels. The top leaders of all levels in the
related provinces, cities and counties should take part in the
work, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang concluded his speech by expressing his belief that the
anti-poverty plan will be fulfilled under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with China's own
characteristics and the Party's principal line and through the
joint efforts of the whole Party, the nation and the people.

granting asylum to Egyptian extremists.

<HEADLINE> Two Suspects Held for Rustenburg Blasts in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Two white men suspected of
making bomb explosions in small hours in and near the North West
Province town of Rustenburg were arrested this morning, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects, aged 32 and 26 respectively, were stopped on
the road when they were driving near the small town of Mooinooi,
about 15 kilometers outside Rustenburg, a police spokesman was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They were being held at the Rustenburg Police Station for
questioning about the blasts, but they had not been formally
charged, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Three bomb blasts went off between 1:15 and 3:00 a.m. on
Saturday in and nearby Rustenburg. Two people were slightly
injured in a blast at a mosque. Initial estimates put the damage
caused by the blasts at about 130,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the Rustenburg bombings
by early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the latest bomb attacks, two home-made bombs exploded
on last Christmas Eve in a shopping center near the southern city
of Cape Town, killing four people and injuring 60 others.
</P>
<P>
A right-wing group named "Boer Attack Troops" claimed
responsibility for the two bomb attacks.

<HEADLINE> Pierce Beats Spirlea in Sydney International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian Open champion
Mary Pierce ousted fifth seed Irina Spirlea of Romania on Sunday
in a first-round upset at the Sydney International tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-born, U.S.-based French player defeated Spirlea
6-3 4-6 6-4 in the last rehearsal before next week's Australian
Open in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
But Australian Mark philippoussis has quit the men's singles
because of tendinitis in his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, who beat world number one Pete Sampras at last
year's Australian Open, hit with top seed Goran Ivanisevic for 30
minutes in practice on Sunday before the injury forced him off
court.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Pierce, whose ranking has dropped to 24th,
recoved form a three-month shoulder injury as she built up an
early 6-3 4-2 lead over the 10th-ranked Spirlea.
</P>
<P>
But the Romanian baseliner used a fast first serve and
unsettling sliced backhand to take the next four games and looked
likely to repeat the three-set win she enjoyed over Pierce in the
final of a tour event in Florida last April.
</P>
<P>
Top women seeds Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Martina Hingis, Iva
Majoli and Lindsay Davenport have all received byes into the
second round and are not expected to play before Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> More Greek Shipowners Desert Greek Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Last year saw more Greek shipowners
lower the greek flag on their ships and hoist a number of convenience
flags, ranging from Bahamas to Malta.
</P>
<P>
According to today's local Greek weekly "To Vima" (The Tribune),
altogether 136 ships, about 8.5 percent of Greece's merchant marine
fleet, deserted Greek flags last year for convenience flags, while
only 48 new ones were added. Taking also into account the flag
changes through sale, Greece merchant fleet, since December 23,
has comprised 2,019 ships with a total capacity of 27,993,884
register tonnes, down from 2,129 ships of a total capacity of
30,398,771 register tonnes at the end of last February.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this flight from the flag is quite simple:
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
While most other countries employ foreign crews -- mainly from
developing countries -- on their ships, Greece puts a cap on the
number of foreign crew allowed on Greek ships. Since 1987, a ship's
"lower-rank crew" -- officers excluded -- can include up to 40
percent of foreign nationals, provided that no Greek sailors are
available to fill the positions.
</P>
<P>
Other European Union countries, faced with strong competition
from Asian countries have long liberalized the rules concerning
employment. Holland, for example, requires that only the captain
be a Dutch national for a ship to be included in its shipping
register. Since this measure was enacted, in the beginning of 1996,
70 Dutch-owned ships registered under flags of convenience went
back to Holland's shipping register.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged the Greek government to give more leeway to
shipowners in choosing their crews and give more direct or indirect
subsidies for ship acquisition, covering part of the operational
costs and helping reduce labor costs.

<HEADLINE> PA, Israel Still Lack Trust: Palestinian official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Local Government of
the Palestinian Authority Saeb Erekat said today that an
atmosphere of mistrust overshadowed the talks with Israel due to
its continued attempts to change the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
In an interview this morning with Sawt al Arab radio, he voiced
fears over what would happen if the Israeli government continued
its non-compliance with the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Asked for reasons behind the delay of signing the executive
protocol of the long-delayed accord on Israeli troops redeployment
in the West Bank town of Hebron, the minister said that there are
still some pending issues, such as the Palestinian-Israeli joint
patrol of the old city and Israeli further redeployment from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under Oslo accords, the Israeli redeployment should have been
completed by March 28 of 1996, but it was shelved after a series
of bombings in Israel early last year and further put off due to
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's demand for better security for
450 Jews living among 200,000 Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here at noon, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat met secretly with Netanyahu Saturday night in a bid
to finalize the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
The six-hour meeting led to a great progress regarding the
redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth meeting between the two leaders since
December 24, followed days of intensive mediation by Ross, who
decided to stay in the region until an accord is finalized.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who had brokered a summit meeting between Netanyahu and
Arafat last month, also met with Netanyahu and Arafat respectively
Friday. He held another round of talks with Arafat in Gaza
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, for the last two
weeks, had been saying that agreement of the Hebron redeployment
was around the corner, and another summit between Arafat and
Netanyahu would initial the deal.

<HEADLINE> Main Obstacle Remains After Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Some progress has been made
in a secret Arafat-Netanyahu summit earlier today, but one main
obstacle remained over signing the long-delayed Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the unexpected meeting took place
overnight at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza
Strip. Palestinian and Israeli sources earlier revealed the news
about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said the two leaders held talks for about
six hours which ended at six o'clock this morning in the
presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu joined the meeting with his lawyer Yitzhak Molcho,
while Arafat was accompanied by senior official Abu Mazen and
Palestinian security head Mohammed Dahlan.
</P>
<P>
No detail was disclosed about the surprise meeting, but the
sources said real progress had been made over clearing the last
obstacles blocking a deal on Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Israel Radio quoted senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil
Shaath as saying that one main stumbling block remained
unsettled: the timetable for further Israeli troop redeployment
in the West bank.
</P>
<P>
With the crucial meeting, the difficult Hebron talks that
have been lingering for three months seemed to have taken a
positive turn.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the meeting was the result of Ross'
intensive mediation efforts as the U.S. is increasing pressure
on both sides to wrap up the Hebron deal. After the meeting, the
agreement is now closer than ever, although it still remained
unclear when it would be formally signed.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that the agreement could be signed at a
ceremony in the White House hosed by U.S. President Bill Clinton
when the two leaders visit Washington in late January. Clinton
issued invitations to both Netanyahu and Arafat a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit, the outstanding obstacle blocking a Hebron
deal was the Palestinian demand for setting a target date for
further Israeli troop redeployment in the rural areas of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, Israel troops should complete
the pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank by September
1997 after the Hebron redeployment by last March. Israel has
delayed the Hebron pullback following the wave of Islamic suicide
bombing attacks from late February to early March last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron deal has virtually been completed, but due to lack
of trust between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority links
the signing of the deal with Israel's commitment to further
pullback. It wants the U.S. to guarantee in a written form of
Israel's commitment to the Oslo accords before it signs the
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ross is continuing his mediation efforts today to
bridge the remaining gap. He is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu
today before heading back to Gaza to hold further talks with
Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Hotline Advice Aids Anxious City Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Urban residents who are
frustrated with the pressures of city life can pour out their
troubles on a new telephone "hotline" set up by a former teacher
and traveling saleswoman in central China Province.
</P>
<P>
During her days on the road, 44-year-old Tong Guilan came to
the conclusion that many people experience a sense of anxiety as a
result of fast-paced living, and often need a ready listener.
</P>
<P>
After investigation into the services available in Zhengzhou, a
city of one million and the capital of central China's Henan
Province, Tong discovered that only a few hotlines were operated
by local radio stations, and decided to open her own telephone
service for free advice.
</P>
<P>
Last August, with 5,000 yuan contributed by her relatives and
friends, Tong rented an office in the city, launching her career
with only a telephone and few office supplies.
</P>
<P>
Her phone began to ring almost immediately after her telephone
number was announced. Since then, Tong has received hundreds of
calls for advice.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Wage Hikes for Government Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered the implementation of salary increases for his
country's 1.2 million government workers effective January 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The presidential directive was contained in Executive Order No.
389, implementing the fourth and final phase of the salary
standardization scheme which upgraded the salaries of government
employees since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The executive order provides guidelines for the implementation
of Republic Act No. 8244 allotting 27 billion pesos (about one
billion U.S. Dollars) for salary increases of government civilian
and uniformed personnel.
</P>
<P>
Starting January 1, an employee with a salary grade of 15 will
receive a monthly salary of 9,626 pesos (367 dollars), and on
November 1, this will be adjusted further to 11,515 pesos (440
dollars), according to the executive order.
</P>
<P>
Upon the full implementation of the salary standardization
scheme, the lowest paid among government workers will get at least
 4,400 pesos (168 dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The highest salary increase, corresponding to the level of a
cabinet minister, has been pegged at 30,188 pesos (1,152 dollars)
and this will be raised further to 35,000 pesos (1,335 dollars) on
November 1.
</P>
<P>
The president, vice president and congressmen are not covered
by the wage hike this time.
</P>
<P>
In his executive order, Ramos revised the 35-grade salary
schedule to the 33-grade, since it "is determined more
appropriate for an effective compensation administration."
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez, Jr.
explained that the Office of the President decided to adopt the
33-grade salary schedule instead of the 35-grade recommended by
the congress in 1994, "because it is less complicated and easier
to implement."
</P>
<P>
In returning to the original salary grade system, the president
now belongs to salary grade 33; the vice president, grade 32; and
cabinet members, grade 31.

<HEADLINE> W. Africa Warns Against Aviation Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Aviation ministers of west Africa
have warned to impose sanctions on any state in the sub-region
found placing restrictions on sister countries' national carriers
by November this year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will include suspension of flight and outright
ban of flights into and out of the affected countries by the rest
of the member states of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), according to the newspaper "Sunday Times".
</P>
<P>
The warning was triggered by the prevention of a Nigeria
Airways flight from flying across Niger a week ago and ECOWAS
aviation ministers held a week-long meeting on the issue, which
ended at the weekend in Yamousseukuro of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
They called on member nations to strictly adhere to the
internationally agreed standards of the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO).
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that member countries should strictly follow
the ICAO standards regarding qualified crew, the airworthiness of
aircraft and the responsibilities of airline operators and
aviation administrators.
</P>
<P>
West African countries agreed to cooperate in the civil
aviation field in 1988 when they passed a declaration that
contains an action plan for cooperation among the various civil
aviation authorities in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The Yamousseukuro declaration was made in response to the
globalization of civil aviation to enable member states to adhere
to internationally agreed standards.

CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held a secret meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu Saturday night, the CNN reported at noon today.
</P>
<P>
According to the American T.V. network, the meeting led to a
great progress regarding the redeployment of Israeli forces
in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting at the Erez crossing between Israel and the
Gaza Strip came after the Wednesday shooting incident had dimmed
two weeks of expectation that an agreement on the Israeli army's
redeployment in Hebron was about to be signed.
</P>

It was the fourth meeting between the two leaders since they

Hebron deal was Israel's refusal to commit to a time-table for
further redeployment of its troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, following Friday night's meeting between Ross and
Arafat, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters that there was still no deal between Israelis and the

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress to Continue Its Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- In the past couple of days,
Congress party leaders have reaffirmed the party's stand to
continue its support for the present United Front (UF) government
headed by Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Congress President Sitaram Kesri was elected leader
of the congress parliamentary party ( CPP) Friday evening, he made
it clear at the CPP executive meeting that the party would
continue to support the present government.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with satellite TV channel Star News here today,
new Congress leader of Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament)
Sharad Pawar ruled out any immediate withdrawal of support for the
UF government and formation of a Congress-led government.
</P>
<P>
The 13-party UF government came to power on June 1 last year
with the support of the Congress party headed by former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao from the outside. With the recent
change of Congress party leadership, there has been speculation
that the Congress would withdraw its support for the UF
government.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we are confident that we can face the elections, we
will not withdraw our support," Pawar said.
</P>
<P>
"If we withdraw our support, it will lead to instability and
that would be harmful to the country's economy. We don't want the
economy to suffer," he further said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pawar criticized the performance of the present
government in the interview. He said it (the present government)
followed Congress' economic policies only "half-heartedly", adding
that Deve Gowda was trying his best, but he had limitations.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- About 25 percent of an
estimated 650,000 people living in poverty in Hong Kong have jobs
but their wages barely allow them to live, according to a study
report released by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said some of the poorest spent just 504 to 629 HK
dollars a month (65 to 81 U.S. dollars) on food.

According to Chua Hoi-wai, project officer of the council,
poverty was defined as "the income of an individual or a household
 being not adequate to pay for basic and necessary expenditures"
while absolute poverty was defined as "the income of the household
 being not adequate to pay for basic and necessary food
expenditures."
</P>
<P>
Last year the council released a survey showing that about one
in 10 of Hong Kong's population, or 650,000 people, lived below
the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The report issued today noted that of the 650,000, 486,000 live
without any public assistance.
</P>
<P>
The report said almost one-third of the 486,000 people who live
without government assistance have jobs, mainly in factories,
restaurants, import and export companies, or in sales.
</P>
<P>
"People sometimes blame the poor, saying they are poor because
they are too lazy to work," Chua noted. "Our analysis found that
many poor people are working very hard. They have jobs but their
salaries are too low to support their daily expenditures."
</P>
<P>
He said many of the poor are elderly people with little
education.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 16,000 singles were classified
as extremely poor and 88 percent of those were aged 60 or older.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An Egyptian business delegation left here today for
Amman, Jordan to attend the meetings of the first Forum of the
Arab Businessmen Community.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will submit to the gathering two projects for
establishing a paper factory and a textile factory at a capital of
150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The forum is aimed at enhancing trade and economic relations
between Arab countries and increasing the competitiveness of Arab
products.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will discuss the Arab business societies' role in
boosting inter-Arab investment and trade cooperation in light of
privatization in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Some 140 Egyptian-German development projects are
being implemented in key sectors of Egyptian economy, education
and social services.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Egypt Wolf Dietrich Schilling made the
remarks recently on the occasion of presenting a new book which
documents the close and successful development cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The volume of bilatera exchanges beteen the two countries in
the past four decades involved a total of 19 billion Egyptian
pounds (5.6 billion U.S. dollars) in intensive cooperation, which
demonstrates the top position Egypt holds with its German
partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total sum, 16.5 billion (4.8 billion dollars) have
been allocated bilaterally, while the balance was channeled
through multilateral institutions such as the EU, the World bank
and U.N. agencies, he added.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria has achieved remarkable progress in
attracting Arab and foreign capital for boosting economic
development in accordance with its Law No. 10 designated in 1991
to encourage investment.
</P>
<P>
According to Syria's Investment Bureau, foreign investments
cover all fields, including 647 foreign-funded projects in the
industrial sector, with a total investment of 5.2 billion dollars
and 51 projects in the agricultural sector, involving an
investment of 440 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the transport sector, there are 794 foreign-funded projects,
with a total investment of 1.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The stock markets of Kuwait, Lebanon and Egypt
will be linked Monday to ease the way for investors in one market
to buy stocks in another, a local stock exchange official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Investors from all the three countries "can buy from the three
markets as on one market," General Secretary of the Union of Arab
Stock Exchanges and Security Commissions Safag Al-Rokaibi told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rokaibi, also director of Kuwait Stock Exchange Technical
Department, said share prices from each bourse will be relayed
immediately to the other trading floors. Egypt and Kuwait sighed
an accord last April to cross-list shares, Lebanon joined them in
September.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials say they are considering opening the market
to foreign investors, but this needs to be approved by the Kuwaiti
cabinet, parliament and the Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah. Egypt and
Lebanon have no restrictions on foreigners trading shares of
national firms.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti market is the most active of the three
bourses. Cairo's stock market is growing fast while Beirut is
still at its initial stage after its reopening less than a year
ago, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Cross-listing would encourage the establishment of joint
financial firms in Arab states, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, three of the six GCC states, signed a
similar agreement on December 25 as part of their long-standing
economic pact.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Netanyahu Meet Secretly to Finalize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu met secretly with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat earlier today in a bid to finalize the long-delayed Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian sources said that the meeting took
place at the Palestinian side of the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources told Xinhua that the two leaders held
talks for about six hours which ended at six o'clock this
morning in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior official Abu Mazen and Palestinian security
head Mohammed Dahlan also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
No detail was disclosed about the surprise meeting, but the
sources said that progress had been made over clearing the last
obstacles blocking the deal on Israeli troop redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
With the crucial meeting, the difficult Hebron talks that
have been lingering for three months seemed to have taken a
positive turn.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the meeting was the result of Ross'
intensive mediation efforts as the U.S. is increasing pressure
on both sides to wrap up the Hebron deal. After the meeting, the
agreement was closer than ever before, although it still remained
unclear when it would be formally signed.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that the agreement could be signed at a
ceremony in the White House hosed by U.S. President Bill Clinton
when the two leaders visit Washington in late January. Clinton has
issued invitations to both Netanyahu and Arafat a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit, the outstanding obstacle blocking a Hebron
deal was the Palestinian demand for setting a target date for
further Israeli troop redeployment in the rural areas of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the meeting was held secretly because of
the current sensitive situation regarding the Hebron
agreement. Netanyahu is facing increasing rebellion within his
coalition as seven of the 18 ministers have already threatened to
vote against the Hebron agreement.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Launch Attack on Rebel Soldiers in Bangui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- French troops took
action early this morning in Bangui in retaliation of the killing of
two French soldiers deployed in the Central African republic,
according to reports from the capital city.
</P>
<P>
About 800 French troops attacked rebel positions from
helicopters, destroyed several of them and took over control of
strategic points that had been in rebels' hands after their mutiny
on November 15, including a petrol depot and the national
broadcasting station.
</P>
<P>
French military officials said the operation, launched at 1:00
a.m. (0000 GMT), was a success and was nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
Three rebels were killed, but there were no losses on the
French side.
</P>
<P>
The French military offensive followed a day of violence in
which two French soldiers and a Central African civilian were
killed and several others injured in Bangui Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The French soldiers killed were on a mediation mission of the
truce monitoring committee and escorting two Central African
officers to a meeting with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
France and the rebels have been condemning each other for the
killings.
</P>
<P>
France now has about 2,000 troops permanently deployed in
Central Africa, 1,500 of them barracking in Bangui after a third
mutiny in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian IPF Not to Be Dissolved, Says IPF President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- M.G.Pandithan, President
of Malaysia's Indian Progressive Front (IPF), today denied that
the IPF will be dissolved for merger with the People's Progressive
Party (PPP), saying the IPF will not be dissolved "at any time".
</P>
<P>
Pandithan told 2,000 delegates at the 5th IPF general assembly
here today that "the IPF will never be dissolved".
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to a statement by People's Progressive Party
(PPP) president M. Kayveas who said last Wednesday that the PPP
was prepared to absorb IPF and its estimated 500,000 members into
the party and leaders of the two parties began negotiations on the
matter several months ago.
</P>
<P>
Expressing shock over the statement, Pandithan denied there
were any negotiations going on.
</P>
<P>
He said the IPF was willing to cooperate with the PPP and he
was prepared to meet Kayveas but not prepared to dissolve the IPF
"at any time".
</P>
<P>
Rather, he vowed to get the party into the Barisan Nasional
(BN) (National Front, a ruling coalition led by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad) "at any cost".

Egypt and Kuwait sighed an accord last April to cross-list

</P>
<P>
"On Monday the agreement will come into effect," Rokaibi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there are still restrictions for Egyptian or
Lebanese investors who want to buy Kuwaiti shares, as the right to
trade or own Kuwaiti shares remains exclusive to nationals of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials say they are considering opening the market
to foreign investors, but this needs to be approved by the Kuwaiti
cabinet, parliament and the Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Lebanon have no restrictions on foreigners trading
shares of national firms.
</P>
<P>
"The accord allows Arab residents in Kuwait to invest their
money in Egyptian and Lebanese shares, It also allows GCC nationals
living in Egypt and Lebanon to trade Kuwaiti shares at exchanges
there," Rokaibi said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti market is the most active of the three

<HEADLINE> Zambian Tourism to Earn More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Tourism is expected to earn
Zambia more than 70 million U.S. dollars last year compared to 50
million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tourists visiting the country are estimated at 200,000 last
year, an increase of 80,000 over 1995, according to the Tour
Operators Association of Zambia (TOAZ).
</P>
<P>
TOAZ attributed the boom of tourism to the government opening
policy, which has led to the formation of efficient domestic
airlines as well as more foreign investments in the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
TOAZ further attributed the growth to effective marketing
strategies by the Zambian National Tourist Board as well as by
all the tourism enterprises.

<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria witnessed a noticeable
drop in employment in the private sector, from 134,970 in 1995 to
122,253 in 1996, down by 10 percent, according to the Nigeria
Employers' Consultative Association (NECA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the unemployment crisis also deepened in the public
sector of the national economy, the local newspaper "Sunday
Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a sector-by-sector analysis of its 170 member
companies, NECA said that out of the 20 industrial groups
sampled, only eight recorded increase in their work forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1995-1996 employment statistics of NECA,
agriculture and allied services are the worst hit, with a 74
percent drop in employment from 3,800 in 1995 to an all low 984
last year.
</P>
<P>
The building and civil engineering sub-sector followed with a
33.6 percent drop from 9,547 in 1995 to 6,336 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Also hit by the unemployment crisis are sub-sectors producing
precision and electrical appliances; food, beverages and tobacco;
metal products, iron and steel; petroleum and national gas;
paper, paper board and printing; and chemical and non-metallic
products, as well as banking, insurance and air transport
sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
The leather, rubber and footwear industry recorded the highest
employment rate in 1996, enjoying an increase of 18.66 percent,
followed by the shop and distributive trade sub-sector, with an
increase of 17.12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other sub-sectors that created more jobs last year include
advertising, automobile, boat yard, shipping, clearing and
forwarding, textile and garment industries.
</P>
<P>
In the public sector, the same gloomy situation persisted last
year, the non-governmental organization claimed, saying that
11,000 workers were sent into the unemployment market in only two
of the 36 states across the country.
</P>
<P>
No further information about the unemployment situation in the
public sector is so far available.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Mubarak Accuses Netanyahu of Ruining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak told Israeli peace activists that trust between Egypt and
Israel had dissipated due to disappointment over unkept promises
made by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, two participants who were part of
a six-member Peace Now delegation, met with Mubarak for 90
minutes in Cairo last week. During the meeting the Egyptian leader
charged that "the trust that we have built over years was destroyed
in six months."
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of mistrust," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak contrasted this with the confidence he felt when he
talked to (late prime minister) Yitzhak Rabin, who he said
always made a point of consultation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's remarks came after he met with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, indicating that the meeting did not
resolve the problem between the two leaders, according to the
newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his meeting with Netanyahu in Cairo last July,
Mubarak told the Peace Now guests how "relaxed" he felt by
Netanyahu's promise for a quick Hebron pullback within several
weeks and a hint that the new Israeli premier would make as
far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians as Menachem Begin
made by yielding Sinai as the price for making peace with
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said, "Netanyahu told me 'I will be like Begin
and reach a final status peace agreement with the Palestinians,
and will move ahead in Hebron.'"
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said that he felt that Netanyahu let
him down again by first inviting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa to visit Israel and play a role in the Hebron talks, after
a lengthy preliminary meeting between Netanyahu and Moussa in
Lisbon, Portugal, only to retract the invitation upon his return
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he is not the only one who is wary
of the Netanyahu government. "The Moroccans don't want to have
anything to do with the peace process," he stressed, saying that
citing Qatar, Oman, and Tunisia have frozen contacts with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak declared that Egypt was not out to replace the
U.S. as the peace mediator, since the U.S. is irreplaceable as
a superpower. "The Americans are the key," he repeated several
times.
</P>
<P>
He said that progress with the Palestinians would trigger
resumption of peace talks between Syria and Israel after
almost a year's hiatus.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak dismissed the notion that Syrian troop movements last
fall portended any intention of going to war. "Syria will not go
to war against Israel alone," he said. "It cannot make war
without Egypt, and Egypt will never go to war against
Israel. This is why all the talks about war with Syria is
baseless," he noted.

<HEADLINE> First Youth Olympics Could Be Held in Sydney, Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee
(IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch said that the Olympic Youth
Games could be held in Sydney, a Japanese newspaper reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, who has promised financial support to a proposed
Olympic-like sport festival for youths, told the Yomiuri Shimbun
that a four-member IOC committee has been studying the feasibility
of the Olympic Youth Games since late July.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper, Samaranch also said the
inaugural edition of the youth games could be held in Sydney in
1999 as an pre-Olympic event if the idea is approved by the IOC
general meeting in September.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Samaranch also said the idea would be first
examined by the IOC executive board in March.
</P>
<P>
According to an initial concept, the youth games will bring
together between 2,000 and 3,000 athletes in 10 Summer Olympic
sports for seven to 10 days, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Entrants must be no older than 18 and have not taken part in
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
IOC vice president Kim Un-Yong, who heads the youth games study
committee, estimated the cost at between 20 million and 30 million
dollars, Yomiuri Shimbun said.

JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Three bomb blasts rocked an
area around the North West Province town of Rustenburg early today,
slightly injuring two men, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The first blast happened around 1.15 AM at a mosque in the

<HEADLINE> Abolition of Widow Inheritance Urged in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Women lawyers in east
Africa have called for immediate abolition of the custom which
allows widow inheritance as a precondition for widows' access to
her husband's estate, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
National Coordinator of Women and Law in East Africa (WLEA)
Tanzania Chapter Magdalena Rwebangira told reporters here on
Saturday that wife inheritance remains a problem in some east
African tribes.
</P>
<P>
Rwebangira said a study in the three east African countries
has revealed that some tribes are taking advantage of the
customary widow inheritance to breach the rights of the widows
over their matrimonial property.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, she said widow inheritance is still strongly
practised in Mbeya and Arumeru and when the women protest they
are likely to lose the property or are bewitched.
</P>
<P>
She said in case the widow refuses to be inherited she would
be allowed to stay on the clan land but on condition that she
does not get pregnant and in addition the relatives would make a
close watch.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, widow cannot inherit the property of
her deceased husband.
</P>
<P>
Citing examples from Iteso in northern Uganda, Rwebangira said
among the Iteso a widow is customarily regarded as part and
parcel of the estate. "Once married to a family, the woman
belongs to and she is a property of that family," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rwebangira said culturally in polygamous marriages, either the
step-son or a younger brother of the deceased takes over the
widow.
</P>
<P>
She said in case the young widow refuses to be inherited then,
she would be chased away from the home.
</P>
<P>
With the coming AIDS, she said, people have started to shun
the practice.
</P>
<P>
However, the WLEA's boss recommended that remarriage should be
a widow's right without losing economic support of the deceased
husband's estate as men do.
</P>
<P>
She also called upon the communities to review the rights and
status of women relating to the law of inheritance and practice
and formulate a policy which will treat women fairly.

<HEADLINE> More Investments Recorded in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Investment Center
(ZIC) issued 140 investment certificates and attracted total
pledged investment of 279 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Information from the ZIC indicates that though the number of
certificates issued in 1996 was less than the figure of 175
registered in 1995, the total value of pledged investment is 43.8
percent higher over the 194 million U.S. dollars of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The highest number of certificates issued was in the
agricultural sector which has 54 new licensed investors. In
addition, 38 certificates were issued in the manufacturing
sector, 23 certificates in the tourism sector, 16 in service, two
in transport and one in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, the ZIC main objective is to promote joint
ventures between local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
ZIC Director Bwalya Ng'andu said that focus will be on linking
both local and foreign investors to medium and long term
financial lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the coming year ZIC's promotional efforts
will target specific markets in Asia, Europe and Africa. In
Africa, Ng'andu added, his center will build on inter-Africa
cross border investment and has singled out South Africa and
Kenya as the major markets in the region in the sectors of
agriculture and tourism.

</P>
<P>
Michael Mak Kin-lam, Urban Council chief librarian, said that
through the Internet, library users will soon be able to check
whether the book they want is available without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of Hong Kong's first Literary Arts Festival
Saturday, Mak said the council would raise the number of lending
books from one per head of population to two over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of libraries would also double from one for
every 200,000 people to one for every 100,000.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Urban Council needs to buy an extra 350,000
books every year for 10 years to meet the target.
</P>
<P>
According to Mak, about 13.4 million books were lent out last
year, a rise on the 12.4 million in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Fourth HIV-Infected Baby Found in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A fourth baby born in a Hong
Kong hospital was confirmed to carry the HIV virus which causes
AIDS, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Hospital authority said the fact that the baby contracted
the virus from his mother indicated the number of women with the
virus is rising.
</P>
<P>
Lau Yu-lung, professor of pediatrics at the University of Hong
Kong and a member of the Advisory Council on AIDS, said he feared
there would be more HIV-positive babies because the difference
between the number of infected men and women in Hong Kong is
narrowing.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been a rapid rise in the number of females
with the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
The figures of new HIV cases provided by the Health Department
show that the ratio of males to females with the HIV virus was
eight-to-one in 1992, but by last year it had narrowed to
four-to-one.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a few years' time, the male-to-female ratio
could be one-to-one.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative figures released by the department in the third
quarter of 1996 show that 738 people in Hong Kong had the HIV
virus and 86 of them were female.
</P>
<P>
Lau called on the communities to reinforce the need for more
AIDS-prevention education.

asked for 100 million dollars as a "war tax", but met with a flat
rejection from the Japanese companies and lowered the number to 30
million dollars, an article carried in the Mainichi Shimbun said.
</P>
<P>
The article said the chief of one major firm told reporters
during an interview they would not pay any amount of money.
</P>
<P>
Among the Japanese executives believed to be held in captive
are the presidents of the Peruvian operations of Mitsui Mining and
Smelting Co, Mitsubishi Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry refused to make any comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, a group of MRTA guerrillas stormed the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima and took more than 400 people at a
cocktail reception hostage, including many high-ranking officials
and diplomats from Japan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas had promised to release the hostages if their
400 jailed comrades are set free by the Peruvian government, but
the later refused.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas are still holding 74 hostages in the residence
after freeing hundreds of them in the past three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Economy Cars Lose in Race for city Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Charades, the most common taxis
in Beijing, are losing ground to the 1.8-liter Santanas made by
joint venture Shanghai Volkswagen, says today's China Daily
(Business Weekly). .
</P>
<P>
The paper said that autorities in some big cities had stopped
renewing or issuing new registrations for micro-van taxis in an
effort to speed "taxi modernization."
</P>
<P>
Modernizing taxi fleets across urban China also means a shot in
the arm for lumbering automakers, still suffering from rising
inventories and unfavorable State policies.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Urban Taxi Association, there were at
least 500,000 taxis in the country in 1995, compared with 60,000
about 10 years ago. The group pegs annual demand at 80,000 to
100.000.
</P>
<P>
Economy cars like the Charade are undergoing an assault from
many directions. The 0.99-liter-engine car has been ordered out of
fleets in Beijing and Shanghai, and off Beijing streets on
alternating days, causing sales to drop precipitously.
</P>
<P>
"Big cities need better taxis as a part of the attraction for
investment and tourists," said Liang Yanqing of the taxi
association.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party to Talk With Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami League
(AL) will hold "formal talks" with the opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) soon for resolving the political impasse
arising from the latter's abstaining from attending parliament
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Since November 10 last year, the BNP has been boycotting the
parliament to press its 10-point demand including a "neutral role"
for the speaker and the Treasury Bench in the house and halting
"repression" of BNP leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
"We shall hold formal talks with the BNP to resolve the present
political impasse before the parliament goes into next session"
which is scheduled for January 15, Telecommunications Minister and
AL Organizing Secretary Mohammad Nasim disclosed at a meeting here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But no other details about the talks were available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan charged
that the government forced his party to take to the streets by
"making the parliament ineffective and barring the opposition from
carrying out its duties."
</P>
<P>
Addressing BNP ward commissioners in Dhaka City Saturday in
preparation for the party's January 7 agitation rally, Bhuiyan
called the government "fascist, anti-people and undemocratic."
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative to agitation to protest the
government's activities opposed to the interests of the people and
the country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Buy Submarines, Warplanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Navy plans to buy
four more submarines to add to the two it already has, Navy Chief
of Staff Arief Kushariadi said.
</P>
<P>
Arief was quoted by the Antara News Agency today as saying
Indonesia would get two of the four new submarines from Germany
sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
He did not give any details about the submarines, including
their prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that given Indonesia's vast marine territory, the Navy
shooed have at least six submarines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Indonesian Air Force announced that five new
warplanes, namely one Hawk-100 and four Hawk-200s it ordered from
the United Kingdom, will arrive in the country in March.
</P>
<P>
Air Force spokesman Mirsyahban said the Indonesian Air Force
has already received 12 Hawk-200s and seven Hawk-100s.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia at present has 24 Hawk warplanes (16 Hawk-200s and
eight Hawk-100s), all of which are stationed in Pekanbaru, Riau,
and in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hawk-200, a bomber, is a new tactical warplane that can
shoot land targets accurately, while the Hawk-100 can be
transformed into an aircraft to train pilots before they can fly a
Hawk-200 and other warplanes.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok's Elevated Railways See Little Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Construction of two routes of
Bangkok's elevated railways and roads, contracted by Hopewell
(Thailand) Co., has made little progress, leading to concern that
the Asian Games, scheduled for December 1998, would be adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
After an inspection trip on Saturday to the construction sites
on the two routes (Yommarat-Rangsit and Yommarat-Hua Mark),
Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop said he
found little progress on the two routes due to the company's
construction and financial plans.
</P>
<P>
Rangsit and Hua Mark would be venues for most of the events of
the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Suwat said Hopewell never has a plan or time-frame for the
completion of each section and it has financial problems, which
have resulted in the shortage of equipment and personnel.
</P>
<P>
He said Hopewell's plan to increase registered capital and
acquire support from financial institutes has never been clear.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hopewell complained that the State Railway of
Thailand (SRT), owner of the project, has not been able to hand
over land encroached on by squatters at many locations.
</P>
<P>
Another issue is the overlapping of Hopewell and Don Muang
tollway projects, according to Suwat.
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet Hopewell President Gordon Wu next Friday
to discuss the matter.

<HEADLINE> Financial Market to Open Wider: China Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to open the
door to its financial market wider in 1997 for foreign businesses,
according to a China Daily report.
</P>
<P>
Their business scope will be extended in more spheres, covering
banking, insurance and stock markets, and in broader range of
locations, said the Business Weekly of China Daily in a front-page
story today.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign banks received a long-awaited gift for the New Year
when the central bank, People's Bank of China, announced last week
the first four beneficiaries of the country's move to open its
once-monopolized local currency services," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A central bank official told China Daily that more overseas
banks applying to conduct renminbi services are being reviewed and
might receive licenses this year.
</P>
<P>
But the unidentified official "declined to specify the number,"
the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
And overseas banks will be encouraged to set foot in the
central and western regions this year in concert with the
country's efforts to boost the economy in its less-developed
areas, said the official with the central bank's foreign financial
institutions department.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also disclosed that a Sino-foreign investment
fund firm will be established this year to channel overseas funds
into China's A-share and B-share markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China has approved the establishment of 13 new
overseas financial institutions, including 10 banks, three
insurance firms and one joint-venture banks, raising the total
number of operative overseas financial businesses to 155.
</P>
<P>
By October last year, their assets totaled 28 billion US
dollars, and their after-tax profits hit 150 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank official spoke highly of the role of overseas
financial bodies in China's economy, especially in promoting
exports, saying that the arrival of foreign financial bodies has
helped draw overseas funds and improve China's investment
environment by offering excellent services, high-efficiency,
advanced settlement methods, and widespread branches catering to
the demand of foreign-funded customers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the officials said that the increasing presence of
overseas financial bodies injects energy into China's monopolized
financial industry formed under a planned economy.
</P>
<P>
And after more than 10 years of practice, the central bank has
worked out a series of effective supervisory means to prevent
potential problems and solve existing ones in the financial
market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Such measures include inspections before the start of
operation, on-the-spot inspection based on data analysis through
computer and satellite communication, spot investigation of
internal risk control, capital sufficiency, capital quality,
profitability and liquidity.

<HEADLINE> State to Rectify Glass Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Operation of 50 glass production
lines has resulted in an over-supplied market, prompting China to
close some small plants and restrict new projects, reported
today's China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
China was striving to guide manufacturers to pay more attention
to the market and to keep the market balance, the paper quoted Sun
Qian, deputy director-general of the planning and development
department under the State Bureau of Building Materials Industry,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China had only one float glass plant. By 1995, that
number soared to 42 and another 10 became operational last year,
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
High demand in 1992-93 led to an investment craze. Twenty float
glass production lines were completed in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the market has been withering since 1995 as the
central government restricts construction scale.
</P>
<P>
Sun said imbalance in supply and demand is inevitable since
China's glass industry is developing rapidly, but the fluctuation
should be to a lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
He said the bureau is determined to conduct structural
adjustment and technological progress in 1997 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
There are two main processes to produce flat glass: float
process and vertical-drawing process, the former more advanced
than the latter.
</P>
<P>
China developed the Luoyang float glass process at a plant in
Henan province in the late 1970s. The method, accepted
internationally as one of the three most advanced methods, will be
adopted in most Chinese plants still using the vertical-drawing
process.
</P>
<P>
Sun emphasized that many small glass factories merit closure
due to their poor quality, pollution and market disorder. Such
factories, scattered around the country, produce 20-30 million
boxes of glass a year.
</P>
<P>
But Sun also predicted glass demand will increase in 1997 since
residential housing construction is gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is welcome to expand high-quality float
glass production lines, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the bureau will restrict construction of new
glass projects except for those in some special areas, such as the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where raw materials are abundant
and the potential market great.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government to Ax Projects to Cut Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has instructed government agencies to reduce state
investment projects in line with the government's bid to cut back
current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Reduction of the deficit could be brought about only through
serious implementation of the austerity policy and not through
cosmetic adjustment of figures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under this policy, some major state investment projects would
have to be either delayed or their payments postponed.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to lower the current account deficit to 7
percent of gross domestic product from the existing 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, projects involving huge payments are under
review, including some military arms acquisition programs, the
plan of the Thai Airways International Co. (THAI) to buy 21 new
aircraft over the next five years and expansion of national
highways from four to eight lanes.
</P>
<P>
Unimportant investment plans and those without clear economic
returns will also be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit has instructed the National Budget Bureau to present
details of all these projects with financial commitment over a
number of years on Monday so that adjustment decisions can be
made.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Home Minister Indrajit
Gupta has termed the alleged spy scandal involving top
intelligence officer Rattan Sehgal as a "serious" matter, saying
the government would not allow "a drift on such an issue."
</P>
<P>
In the first official statement from the union government,
Gupta also confirmed that Sehgal, an additional director of the
Intelligence Bureau (IB), had been asked to resign following
allegations of unauthorized meetings with two U.S. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Indian Express, which was
made public here today, the home minister said, "We have not
closed the chapter. Investigations are in progress and if
necessary, several people will be questioned about it."
</P>
<P>
Once the allegations became known, the IB officer was put under
surveillance and certain restrictions were imposed upon him.
Sehgal's passport has been seized, the home minister said.
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized meetings Sehgal had with the U.S. diplomats
were detected by the IB and "nipped" in time, he further said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the U.S. diplomats with whom Sehgal was
having clandestine meetings were undercover operatives of the CIA,
the home minister said, "Of course, they were undercover. How else
do you expect them to work?"

Colombo, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to change its
university admission system, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that from August 1999 students who obtain a
stipulated minimum marks at the General Certificate Examination
(GCE) A/L (Advanced Level) will have to take an aptitude test for
selection to universities.
</P>
<P>
The current procedure for selection to universities on the
basis of the aggregate marks obtained at the GCE A/L examination
at the district level on a quota basis will be done away with as
it has adverse consequences on the nation.
</P>
<P>
The present system fails to serve the purpose of providing
equal opportunities to all students throughout the country, the
reports noted.
</P>
<P>
It has also led to exam-oriented teaching where students do not
acquire a real understanding of subject matter. Ability to
memorize is preferred to intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that the new procedure will help intelligent
and innovative students enter universities.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Rejects Nuclear Power Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will not be ready to
build a nuclear power plant to generate electricity in the next
decade because of the high cost, a senior Thai energy official
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The comment was made by Phongphisit Wisetkul, director of the
Energy Conservation Department of the National Energy Policy
Office (NEPO), as the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(EGAT) announced four site options for Thailand's first nuclear
power plant.
</P>
<P>
Based on the feasibility study over the past two years in the
country, using nuclear power to generate electricity will cost at
least four times more than conventional means, Phongphisit told a
seminar on the environment here.
</P>
<P>
Urging the EGAT not to promote nuclear power anymore, the
official believed that the nuclear option is not possible for
Thailand in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that the EGAT, a state-owned
enterprise which generates more than 90 percent of the country's
electricity, has proposed two sites in Chumphon Province, one in
Nakhon Srithammarat Province and one in Prachuap Khiri Khan
Province.
</P>
<P>
However, under the NEPO's policy plan, Thailand's power
generating sector, including the EGAT, will be privatized
gradually.
</P>
<P>
Phongphisit said no private firms would be interested in
building a nuclear power plant when they are likely to face
environmentalists and high production cost in the future.

<HEADLINE> Power Crisis Continues in Indian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian capital of New
Delhi has continued to face a power crisis in the past few days
with a shortfall of 350 MW of electricity from the Dadri Power
Station on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Power supply has been disrupted four times in the past week in
the capital. Even as several parts of the capital faced both power
and water crises, Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking (DESU) General
Manager V. K. Duggal expressed his inability to chart out a
loadshedding schedule.
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware of the following day's shortfall and thus
cannot prepare a timetable for loadshedding in advance," he said.
</P>
<P>
DESU has resorted to rotational loadshedding to deal with the
power shortage. While peak demand for electricity during winter
months in the city is between 1,800 and 1,900 MW, only about 1,500
MW of the needs were being met due to the ongoing disturbances at
the Dadri Power Station, DESU sources said.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh has asked the union government
for power supply from sources other than the northern grid to meet
the city's demand. Describing the power shortage as serious, he
said the existing situation is unacceptable as it is not due to
unforeseen reasons but due to negligence on the part of the
officials. He demanded that officers responsible for the lack of
maintenance of the Dadri Power Station be taken to task.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ministry of Power has appointed an independent
expert committee to probe into the frequent grid disturbances at
the Dadri complex, which have caused power blackouts in the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Injury-plagued Sun Shuwei Sets Sights on 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona Olympic diving
champion Sun Shuwei, who had operations for both eyes prior to the
national trials for the 1996 Games, came back strongly in the FINA
Diving Grand Prix here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who lifted the men's 10-meter platform gold medal in the
Barcelona Games, twisted and turned to win his specialty event on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first outing for the 20-year-old since he was
eliminated at the China's first-ever Olympic diving trials last
April.
</P>
<P>
Sun collected 674.10 points, beating 14-year-old compatriot
Huang Qiang and Australian Tony Lawson into second and third place
respectively. Huang scored 614.34 points and Lawson 507.27.
</P>
<P>
However, everything was by no means easy for the diminutive
star over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Just weeks before the Olympic trial, he had operations for both
eyes. Doctors said any diving will lead to aggravation of the
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Tenacious as he is, Sun refused to give up the hope of striking
a second Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
"No one in diving history had suffered eye injuries as serious
as he did," said Hu Enyong, Sun's coach for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic trials, Sun finished a disappointing third,
conceding the Olympic berths to new hands Tian Liang and Xiao
Hailiang, who later finished third and fourth respectively in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"What a shock for him!" Hu said of Sun's waterloo defeat in the
qualification tournament.
</P>
<P>
After the Olympic trials, Hu had to stay with Sun all the day,
encouraging his student as much as he could.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he overcame hard feelings of injuries and losing
Olympic berth."
</P>
<P>
Sun has become stronger mentally after suffering the biggest
loss in his life, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"One has to experience ups and downs," Sun said. "That was an
invaluable lesson for me."
</P>
<P>
Sun could have completed China's clean sweep of the four gold
medals in the Atlanta Games, said these vocal opponents against
the make-or-mar Chinese Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
The 10-meter platform was the only event which slipped off
Chinese hands in Atlanta. Russian Dimitriy Sautin won the event.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Xiong Ni clinched the men's springboard title
and Fu Mingxia bagged two women's gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"China should have won 17 gold medals instead of 16," said Xu
Yiming, head coach of Chinese national diving team.
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake to keep Sun out of Olympic Games, his mere
presence can put much pressure on Sautin," complained Xu.
</P>
<P>
However, Sun, now a Chinese literature student in Zhongshan
University in his hometown Guangdong province, said he can wait
another four years.
</P>
<P>
Hu said his diver had reached the standard when he won the
Olympic title in 1992 and Chinese head coach still regarded Sun as
an odds-on favorite in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If he can fully recover from his injuries, Sun is a sure shot
at an Olympic title in Sydney," Xu said.

KATHMANDU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission of
Nepal has asked the government to make security arrangements for
the upcoming by-elections for five vacant seats in the lower
house, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The commission instructed the government to maintain peace and
security in the electoral constituencies before and on February

</P>

NEW DELHI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has permitted authorized dealers in foreign exchange to
quote rates for providing forward covers above six months without
its prior approval, RBI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
This move is expected to provide a big relief for many foreign
exchange dealers and corporations seeking long-term forward
covers.
</P>
<P>
Authorized dealers can now quote forward rates using money
market factors or extrapolation of ongoing rates, the RBI said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this relaxation, dealers providing long-term covers
were required to obtain prior approval from the RBI on a
case-to-case basis.

<HEADLINE> China's Chemical Industry Continues to Do Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical industry had
252 billion yuan in output value for 1996, up 9.7 percent over the
previous year, while the industry's ministry gave top priority to
agricultural chemicals to support the country's agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
China produced 123 million tons of chemical fertilizer last
year, 8.4 percent higher than planned, and pesticide output grew
by 23.2 percent to 350,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the chemical industry started work on 72 large and
medium-sized projects, 16 of which were completed.
</P>
<P>
The industry succeeded in a share-issuing experiment, with 14
companies issuing A shares and raising 1.9 billion yuan for the
cash-strapped industry.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of last year, the chemical industry
exported and imported 22.75 billion US dollars worth of products,
up 10.4 percent over the corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, many problems in the industry still exist, such as
poor performance, a sluggish market, and money-losing enterprises,
according to Chen Shineng, the ministry's vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
At a national meeting on the chemical industry recently, Chen
said that the industry aims at an eight percent growth rate, and
an 11 percent increase for exports, this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the ministry will establish 55 large
enterprise groups that are technologically sophisticated and
competitive, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will continue to move ahead with the share-issuing
system to reform large and medium-sized state enterprises, adding
to the present 27 listed companies, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has offered to allow a
U.S. satellite in orbit over its territory in exchange for the use
by the Thai military of the satellite's transponders for
communications.
</P>
<P>
The offer is being considered by Washington and a reply is
expected by the middle of the month, according to Thai Defense
Permanent Secretary Yuthasak Sasiprapha.
</P>
<P>
Yuthasak expected that the United States will approve the
project.
</P>
<P>
The request was first made in late November when Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh met U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was
then on an official visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
If the United States agrees to the proposal, U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) officials will come to
Thailand to work out the details.
</P>
<P>
Yuthasak said Prime Minister Chavalit, who is concurrently
defense minister, has postponed new armaments purchases to cut
back government spending due to the sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Among those shelved are Thailand's own proposed 27-billion-baht
(1.06 billion U.S. dollars) military satellite and the Navy's
17-billion-baht (667 million dollars) purchase of two submarines.

<P>
KIEV, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said that he will pay a long-delayed official visit to Ukraine
some time this year, the Ukrainian presidential press office said
today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the promise in his New Year message on Saturday to
his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian-Ukrainian relations will begin a new page in
1997," Yeltsin said in the message, promising that an agreement on
friendship and cooperation will be signed during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had promised to visit Ukraine in April 1996, but the
trip was postponed because of the dispute over the division of the
Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said at the time that he would sign an agreement on
friendship and cooperation with Ukraine only after the division of
the fleet was completed. Ukraine insisted, however, that an
agreement of this nature be signed before the fleet is split.
</P>
<P>
The fleet, a heritage from the former Soviet Union which was to
be divided between Russia and Ukraine, is based in the Black Sea
city of Sevastopol, over which both countries claim sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese County Seat Looks for UN Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- If someone from 600 years ago
walked down the streets of Pingyao today, he would not possibly
lose his way, for nearly all the places familiar to him remained
exactly as they used to be.
</P>
<P>
This is virtually the only place in China where people can have
a chance to feel ancient and see how an ancient Chinese county
seat looked like centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
That is why the 2700 year-old town in north China's Shanxi
province, which had been a county seat since 221 BC, when China
was first unified, is now applying for listing by the United
Nations as a cultural heritage site.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that of all the thousands of towns built over
the centuries, only Pingyao remained as it was.
</P>
<P>
"According to records, the current town of Pingyao was built in
1370, during the Ming Dynasty, and is typical of the city
structure and building style of that time," a local historian said.
</P>
<P>
As a county seat, Pingyao had a city wall, streets, shops,
temples, government offices, a prison, a bell tower, and
residences that allow one a glimpse of the life of that time.
</P>
<P>
"If a person from 600 years ago walked down the streets of
Pingyao today, he might well be familiar with many of the places,
since the structure of the city is almost the same," the historian
noted.
</P>
<P>
Running across a total area of 2.25 square kilometers, over 100
streets, along with the shops built thereon, remained the same as
600 years ago, while some 3700 traditional residences still exist,
of which 400 are in fairly good shape.
</P>
<P>
According to An Jincai, deputy county chief of Pingyao, at
present there are nearly 100 cultural or historical sites here,
four of them under state protection.
</P>
<P>
"Since Pingyao was approved by the State Council as a
state-level historical city, we have established a special
authority, issued a series of administrative regulations, and
encouraged the public to participate in protection," An said.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1989, more than 10 factories have been removed from the
ancient town area, and many historical buildings have been
repaired or rebuilt," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a plan has been made to build a new
town nearby in order to keep the old town intact and free from
human damage. Construction is expected to be completed by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"The protection of Pingyao has attracted attention from the
outside world, too, as UNESCO has decided to send experts to study
Pingyao this year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Deny Alliance With Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) in the Philippines has assured the government that it
has no intention of forging an alliance with the Muslim extremist
group Abu Sayaaf, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman for political affairs,
Saturday dismissed a reported MILF alliance with the Abu Sayaaf in
a talk with Fortunato Abat, head of the government panel
negotiating with the Muslim rebels, the Philippine Star said.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar also said the MILF will neither ally with the Communist
Party of the Philippines, which has been in a conflict with the
government since its creation in the 1970s and is now also engaged
in peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said the MILF is careful in accepting new members amid
reports that the Abu Sayaaf would infiltrate its ranks.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayaaf, led by Ustadz Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, is
notorious for kidnappings and harassment of villagers in the
southern Philippines. Thousands of villagers have fled their homes
in a remote village in southern Basilan Province last week when
the Abu Sayaaf attacked the village and demanded protection fees.
</P>
<P>
With the MILF assurance of no alliance with the CPP and the Abu
Sayaaf, Abat foresaw no stumbling block in the coming technical
committee meeting between the government and the MILF in the
southern province of Sultan Kudarat on January 7.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government
force in the country after the MNLF concluded a peace deal with
the government last September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to accept the peace deal and wants its own
peace talks with the government.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- An identical model of Benz
Velo and hundreds of other vintage cars were on display in South
Africa's capital of Pretoria today as the city commemorated the
centennial of the arrival of its first car.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people came to see a fanfare display of a 1.5
horsepower, two-seater Benz Velo model. The original one was the
first engine-driven car which, built in 1896 in Germany, had
arrived in South Africa 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The owner of the original car was a businessman named John
Percy Hess. Although the car was destroyed in a fire in 1898, its
arrival marked the beginning of a revolution in South Africa's
local transport.
</P>
<P>
For today's celebrations, an identical model of the Benz Velo
was brought from the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Christoph Kopke, chairman of the Mercedes-Benz office in South
Africa, donated 21,000 U.S. dollars to the Nelson Mandela
Children's Fund at the commemorative ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of the event, the South African Post Office
today issued special postage stamps and commemorative envelopes
to mark the occasion.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Community Volunteers Help People in Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sun Qiu, the 29-year-old head
of a community volunteer group in the Hangzhou TV Plant, said "I
feel happy and proud that I can help people out of difficulties
with my skills,", as he bicycled on snow-covered streets with a
strong wind blowing, coming to the rescue of a senior citizen.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 young people have joined Hangzhou's volunteer
movement, which was begun by the Central Committee of the
Communist Youth League of China in 1993 with the goal to make
contributions to society and help each other build a better
future.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the Association of Young Volunteers was set up by
the city's Red Cross Society and youth education departments. At
present, nearly half of all offices above the county-level have
their volunteer groups, and 32 service centers have been
established across the city's residential areas.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, volunteers have launched a "green move" to improve
the West Lake, a scenic spot in the picturesque city. A total of
3,000 young people have planted trees or worked otherwise on
environmental protection in the region. Their slogan is to
"protect tourism resources" and increase public awareness of a
"green civilization."
</P>
<P>
On weekends, young volunteers also offer such free services as
household appliance repairs. Hundreds of individual old people,
homes for senior citizens and poor families have received their
help.
</P>
<P>
Yan Sufen, a researcher with the city's Study Center on
Education, said that such a move not only benefits social
development and ethic progress, but also makes up for the social
insurance system, which is yet to be improved.

<P>
XIAMEN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen of Fujian Province in
southern China, has made effective efforts at combating noise
pollution to safeguard its fame as "a garden on the sea."
</P>
<P>
Known for its scenery, Xiamen has attracted a large amount of
foreign investments in the past decade and more. However, along
with economic development came environmental problems, especially
noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
"The number of automobiles on the streets has increased more
than ten times, greatly worsening the environment by adding much
noise to the city", said a local official. "There was a time when
nearly all the city's streets suffered from serious traffic noise,
and an increasing number of citizen complaints pointed to the
problem."
</P>
<P>
"Then we decided to ensure a quieter environment, with efforts
focusing on noise produced by factories, automobiles, building
sites, and dance halls," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The four-year noise control drive have yielded good
results. According to the municipal environmental monitoring
authorities, the noise level in the city has decreased more than 6
percent from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The environment, in terms of noise control, is now the best in
10 years," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Exploration Speeded up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has speeded up oil
explorations on its territories over the recent years,
according to the latest report from the Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Currently the search for oil is focused on 15 blocks in
northern and northeastern Kenya, covering 2,370 to 33,416 square
kilometers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Oil deposits in Kenya, which have been found so far, are
proved to be uneconomical for exploitation.
</P>
<P>
However there are many remaining opportunities which have
been observed from seismic data," said the report, noting the
Rift Basin, especially the northern part of Kenya's Rift Valley,
is considered the most promising area.
</P>
<P>
The oil geology of the area is similar with Angola's Cabinda,
Sudan's Abu Garda and Brazil's Reconcavo Basin, all famous
oil-rich regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
The oil search in Kenya dated from the early 1950s when Shell
and other British companies exploited oil in the Lamu Embayment
zone in eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Big petroleum companies including Chevron-Esso and Texas
Pacific also had drilled test wells in Kenya under the permission
of the government by the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has passed laws to attract foreign
petroleum companies to exploit oil in the country.

Africa's capital of Pretoria today as the city commemorated the
centennial of the arrival of its first car.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people came to see a fanfare display of a 1.5

For today's celebrations, an identical model of the Benz Velo
was brought from the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

He said, the government would always encourage and

community.

management of our economy and I will always do whatever possible
to make it easier and worthwhile for you to increase industrial
production," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa assured the private sector that the government will
continue working hard to improve the areas concerned including

The president, who is also the CTI patron, challenged business
people to develop an entrepreneurial capability to set up and run

be honest and to pay due taxes in full and on time with the aim
of reviving and expanding the private sector.

Poll, 24-year-old winner at the short-course world
championships in 1995 in Brazil, was obviously the swimmer of the
day, winning the women's 200 meters and 800 meters freestyle
titles in the same evening.
</P>
<P>
But her first victory of the day came only after taking a tough
challenge from two Chinese.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympians Nian Yun, 14, and Wang Luna, 15, pressed on
the world champion so hard that Poll almost lost the race.
</P>
<P>
Wang was the first to reach the 50 meters turn, with Poll 0.21
seconds behind. Poll lagged further behind at the 100 meters mark,
ranking only third.
</P>
<P>
And it was not until at the 150 meters turn that Poll took over
the lead and led the field through to the end.
</P>
<P>
Other gold medals were taken by Marek Krawczyk of Poland, Ukraine's
Denis Silantiev, Japanese Yasuko Tajima and French Diane Buiduyet.
</P>
<P>
"We've won what had been expected," said Zhang Xiong, the deputy
heach coach of China's national swimming team.
</P>
<P>
"Two of our young swimmers pushed Claudia (Poll) really hard, which
forced her to win only through outmost efforts.
</P>
<P>
"This meet is a good test for what we've achieved during the first
phase of the winter training and we can see the young members are
doing well," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday will see actions in the 17 remaining events of the meet.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the first leg of the eight-leg World Cup series of
the year. The next stop is Beijing, slated for Wednesday and
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief on Arrest of Former Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of
African Unity (OAU) Secretary General, Salim Ahmed Salim, has
refuted reports that he is behind the detention of his former
aide, Cuni Zongo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Salim said Cuni Zongo
was arrested some two months ago by Ethiopian authorities after
failure to settle debts amounting to some 258,386 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuni Zongo, whose services at OAU ended on August
31,1996, had failed to settle the debts. But efforts are still
going on to bail him out, Salim added.
</P>
<P>
He said he had warned hist{.#!?:o engage himself in
businesses like operating a night club and transactions that were
incompatible with his diplomatic status, but " it is unfortunate
Major Zongo failed to co-operate."
</P>
<P>
Salim said that nobody knew the magnitude of Zongo's debts. A
few people at the OAU and some Ethiopians who volunteered to give
information on how much Zongo owes them made us manage to come up
with the 258,386 Dollars figure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim said that his former aide had a habit of issuing cheques
which were later dishonoured by bankers.
</P>
<P>
Asked on other possible causes of Zongo's financial problems,
Salim said that there were reports that last year he organised a
tour of a South African musician, Ms. Ivone Chakachaka, a deal
believed to have made him incur a heavy loss.

<HEADLINE> Salim Likely To Win Third Term of Office as OAU Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, the
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), is
much likely to win his third term of office if he mutters enough
supports in the next OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
Salim told a press conference here Friday that he has not yet
made his final decision on the continuaion of the job, but it
seems that some OAU heads of state wish he can retain.
</P>
<P>
"I have been approached by some leaders from West Africa,
southern and central Africa--- who ask me to retain as OAU
Secretary General," said Salim.
</P>
<P>
"There are those who feel that it is proper I continue with
the job and preside over the current agenda on conflict
resolution in the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If more OAU leaders are willing me to keep my job, I will
seek the re-election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who had been Tanzanian prime minister and a Tanzanian
envoy in the United Nations, was elected OAU Secretary General in
1989 and re-elected in 1993.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Calls for End to Conflicts in Zaire, Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, the
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), on
Friday urged to speed up efforts to end the conflicts in the
eastern Zaire and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
However, the efforts on ending the conflicts in Zaire should
be taken while considering the importance of maintaining unity
and territorial sovereignty of the country, Salim told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Africa cannot accept disintegration of Zaire. We are trying
to start talks between President Mobutu with the rebels," he
said, adding the rights of all Zaireans, including minority
groups and tribes should be respected.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse or disintegration of Zaire will have adverse
effects, not only to the country or to its neighbors, but to the
whole of Africa," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The end to the conflicts in Zaire will depend on the
restoration of an effective central authority and the creation of
democratic institutions in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation in Burundi, Salim said that the
security situation in Burundi continued to deteriorate and
hundreds of Burundi refugees returning home from eastern Zaire
were brutally killed for no reasons.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions, which were invisaged to speed up peace talks
between the military junta led by Pierre Buyoya and other warring
factions, are not final solutions to the crisis in Burundi, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the warring parties in Burundi to come out with
a new spirit this year, noting that peace in Burundi is not
likely to be achieved through the gun.

LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Nigeria hit
32.98 million U.S. Dollars in 1996, a remarkable increase from
1995's 1.137 million dollars, the official "New Nigerian"

<P>
The Director-General of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, Apostle
Alile was quoted as saying on Friday that the investment mainly
came from America, Far East, Asia and Europe.

legislations put in place in 1995: the Foreign Exchange
Provisions Decree and the Nigerian Investment Promotion
Commission Decree.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the encouraging trend in foreign investment
will continue in 1997 and promised better services to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Stock Exchange will expand its scope of Internet
services so that companies could access key market information at
any time irrespective of their distance, Alile said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's 1996 coffee
exports registered a 9.7 percent increase over the previous year
but earned 11 percent less as a result of lower prices.
</P>

total amount exported was the second worst in a decade, said Jose
Dauster Sette, general secretary of the Brazilian Coffee Exporters
Association.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the poor performance to bad weather spells and
inadequate government policies.
</P>
<P>
The biggest Brazilian coffee buyer was the European Union, with
51 percent of the total, followed by the United States with 16
percent, and Japan with 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Filming of Opium War Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The movie "The Opium War", about
the war that broke out in 1840 between China and Britain, has
completed filming and is expected to be released as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The film is directed by Xie Jin, one of China's best-known
directors.
</P>
<P>
The movie was produced to mark the return of Hong Kong and will
be released world wide on July 1, when China resumes the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin and his crew started shooting last May, and more than
200 well-known actors and actresses have been shuttling back and
forth between eight sites in the last seven months.
</P>
<P>
To make the movie, Xie and the film studio he opened, raised
80 million yuan (over 9.6 million U.S. dollars) for production
costs.
</P>
<P>
Xie said he believed he has made a good effort at reforming the
movie producing system. Under the old system of the planned
economy, China's movie industry relied on the state. This cycle of
dependence ran into challenges as the planned economy was being
replaced by a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Over 50,000 people, including 3,000 foreigners, have parts in
the movie. More than 20,000 sets of clothing and 20,000 props were
made for the movie. Some 200 scenes were prepared and 47 ships
made or renovated for the shooting. Street scenes in
Guangzhou in 1840 were re-constructed for filming in Dongyang
city, in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The movie is being edited and promotion work is being
prepared.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Urges Liberian Factions to Step up Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's peacekeeping force,
the ECOMOG, today urged Liberia's warring factions to step up the
disarmament process with the approaching of the January 31
deadline.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu, quoted by a report
reaching here today, reiterated that by the end of this month,
there would be no excuse for anyone to bear arms in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian general said though there is still hope that most
of the remaining fighters could be disarmed before the end of the
on-going disarmament exercise, ECOMOG commanders must prepare
their troops for the military operations of cordon and searches
to recover unsurrendered weapons.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary disarmament of Liberia's estimated 60,000
factional fighters started on November 22, 1996 and is scheduled
to be completed at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
But so far only about 5,000 combatants have been disarmed and
many disarmament sites across the country have not collected
weapons for several days.
</P>
<P>
The current disarmament operation is the third attempt by the
ECOMOG to disarm fighters in Liberia since the peacekeepers were
sent to Monrovia in 1990 to end the civil war, which started in
December 1989.
</P>
<P>
Similar operations in 1992 and 1994 were interrupted by
renewed factional clashes.
</P>
<P>
The current slow pace of disarmament is also partly attributed
to the delay of some West African countries in releasing
additional troops to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The five countries, including Burkina Faso, Ghana, the Gambia,
Mali and Niger, have pledged to jointly contribute 2,249 troops,
while Cote d'Ivoire has promised to send some medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
The troops were meant to be available when the disarmament
process began. But none of the countries has released their
troops so far.

JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Justice
Minister Dullah Omar today appealed to courts to make heavy
penalties on traffic offences.
</P>
<P>
Omar said in a statement that he agreed with Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj's call for heavier penalties to stop
reckless driving on the road.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest statistics which show that 1052
people have been killed in traffic accidents since December 3,

and the costs which amounts to billions of Rands (local currency)
each year."
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that South African judicial system
should play an important role in ensuring road safety.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for a traffic offender in South Africa is
a fine of 120,000 Rands (about 26,000 U.S. Dollars), an
imprisonment of six years and the suspension of license.

He said the process of democracy that his government has
embarked on will not succeed if the economy does not improve.

<HEADLINE> Somali Fundamentalist Group Claims National Power  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hassan Dahir Aweys, the
military commander of the Islamic fundamentalist Al-Itihad
Al-Islam group, said today his group has set a goal to rule
Somalia by either political or military means.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Itihad group is a pure and typical religious and
political organization which will seek to run the country under
the guidance of the Islamic Sharia laws, Aweys said at a press
conference in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he boycotted the agreement reached at the meeting
of 26 Somali faction leaders in Sodare, Ethiopia Friday. The
Somali groups agreed to form a "national salvation council"
authorized to establish a provisional central government in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Aweys said that the agreement will not bring about any
solution to Somalia's current political crises, instead, it will
further cripple the country.
</P>
<P>
"We can not recognize any agreement which is not based on the
Islamic regulations." He said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who met in Sodare are from the same alliance or enjoy
the same ideology," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aweys noted his faction will fully support all fundamentalist
groups fighting inside Ethiopia the forces of the Ethiopia
People's Revolutionary Democractic Front, an alliance of
insurgent groups seeking regional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"We support them morally and materially. We believe they are
fighting for the same cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Aweys admitted that a group of his Mujahidins
defected last month due to a split over the modalities of the
fighting against Ethiopia, but he declined to reveal the numbers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Kenya Try to Improve Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe/Kenya Joint
Commission started a two-day meeting here today, seeking ways to
improve the trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years the trade between our two countries has been
declining. We need to reverse the negative trend," Zimbabwean
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said while opening the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed there was huge potentials for improving
the bilateral trade relations because of the implementation of
trade liberalisation measures by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the meeting would also look at ways of
harmonising and rationalising cooperation between the two
regional groupings, the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the Common Market for East and Southern Africa
(COMESA).
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kenyan Foreign Minister Stephen Musyoka said:
"I wish to reiterate Kenya's support for harmonious coexistence
between COMESA and SADC, and to assure that we look forward to
convening a joint SADC/COMESA summit."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to resolving some of the outstanding issues
which hamper the expansion of our bilateral trade such as the
discriminating tariffs imposed on Kenyan exports, restrictive
import regulations which relegate some Kenyan products to a
negative list and the limitation on the use of foreign exchange
for purchase of vehicles from the COMESA region."
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Kenya and Zimbabwe was recorded at six
million U.S. Dollars in 1995 in favor of Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> "D-8 Group" Summit Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A summit of the heads of state of
the eight developing Muslim countries, known as "D-8 Group", is
planned for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was declared in a joint statement issued this evening at
the end of the first foreign ministers meeting of the "D-8 Group"
held in Istanbul today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan told a press
conference that the one-day ministerial meeting has shown a "new
and important step" among the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The two-month-old D-8, which groups Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Iran, Bangladesh and Malaysia, was formed with
an aim to be a vis-a-vis of the industrialized G-7 bloc.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said "D-8 Group" will work to seek peace,
dialog, cooperation, justice, equality and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said today was a "historical day" for the eight
countries.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministerial meeting discussed political, trade and
economic ties among the group members and did preparatory work for
the "D-8 Group" summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the foreign ministers
meeting this morning, the 70-year-old Turkish prime minister
highlighted the economic and technological cooperation among the
D-8 countries.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan also accused the European Union and the United States
of putting pressure and economic sanctions on Islamic states and
exploiting the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stresses Balanced Security for Arabs, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today accentuated the importance of setting up a mechanism
to ensure balanced security arrangement for Arabs and Israelis
alike in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told a press conference that the failure to come up
with proposals on Hebron acceptable to the Palestinians caused
the main stumbling block on the way to nail down a deal between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He said that unless a fair formula is reached on the Israeli
army pullback from Hebron the agreement will be nothing but a
draft acceptable to none.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israel are reportedly still
trying to narrow their differences on implementing the much-delayed
Israeli troop pullback from the last West Bank town of Hebron as
well as pinning down the timetable for further redeployment in
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent favorable atmosphere for signing the Hebron
deal was affected after an off-duty Israeli solder opened fire at
a crowded market place in Hebron, wounding seven Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody saying that there is instigation on the part of Egypt
means to find a pretext for failure, delay and procrastination,"
said the top Egyptian diplomat, adding that his country would
reject it.
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu just made
"nonsense" when he accused Egypt of instigating the Palestinians
not to sign a deal on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"This is groundless because the Palestinians know when and
what to accept," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, however, spoke of significant progress
in this regard although some points remain "unbalanced" and
"unfair."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, President Hosni Mubarak said today
that Egypt encourages the Palestinians and Israelis to work out
an executive protocol to carry out the agreed formula on Hebron
redeployment rather than dish up a new accord.
</P>
<P>
Egypt respects the previously signed agreements and never
attempts to add new articles to them, he added during a two-hour
meeting with the Egyptian Television News Department.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Condemn Damascus Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today condemned the terrorist bombing in Damascus, capital
of Syria recently, leaving 12 killed and dozens of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said in a telephone call with his Syrian
counterpart Farouq al-Shara that Egypt stands against all forms of
terrorism and those who act from behind the scene in these
operations.
</P>
<P>
Syria Thursday blamed Israel for the bus bombing on Tuesday. It
said the criminal action is in line with threats by Israeli
officials aimed to kill the Mideast peace process. But Israel
denied the allegations strongly.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid today sent a
cable of condolences to Shara on the death of the innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also voiced his strong condemnation of the terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
He said that such an incident would not affect the struggle of
the Syrian people and their determination to combat all forms of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have also strongly denounced
the blast.
