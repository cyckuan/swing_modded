CLOSS WALKS OUT ON SESSION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Closs, who seems to prefer zigging when zagging is
recommended, just left Wednesday when he was required to lift.
</P>
<P>
   So, on the strength of his latest backpedal from, the Clippers'
7-foot-3 backup center may not be in uniform for Friday's game with
the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the skinny:
</P>
<P>
   Closs, who goes about 215 pounds on days when he tells the
Mickey D's drive-through captain to ``super-size it,'' bugged out
of a mandatory weight-lifting session following Wednesday's
practice at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   His departure was witnessed by Coach Chris Ford, who peeled away
from his post-practice chat with reporters to confront the
third-year Clipper. But Closs, who said he had to attend a meeting,
kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said Closs would not suit up when the T'Wolves hit Staples
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A Closs-free zone will disappoint Clipper fans, who wildly
cheered him during Monday's 25-minute, 13-point, 7-rebound effort
vs. San Antonio. Closs, who appears to have a lease in Ford's
doghouse, was summoned just three minutes into that game, because
starting center Michael Olowokandi had just acquired his second
personal foul.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi stayed out of foul trouble Tuesday in Sacramento,
producing 14 points and 15 rebounds. Closs played just six minutes
and didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks: Wednesday was day one on the 10-day contract of
latest Clipper Pete Chilcutt. The 6-10 forward, whose NBA journey
has lasted nine years, averaged 1.8 points and 1.7 rebounds in 26
games this season with the Utah Jazz. ``I don't really know what to
expect,'' said Chilcutt of his Clipper role. ... While most of the
Clippers spent Wednesday's working running and shooting, Maurice
Taylor, Lamar Odom, Derek Anderson and Olowokandi received
treatment for an assortment of aches and pains. &QL;

EDITORIAL: HELMUT KOHL, HUMBLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Jan. 20: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's resignation as honorary chairman
of his beloved Christian Democrats was forced on him by his own
embattled proteges. But it will not stop the unraveling of his own
reputation or that of his party. By defiantly flouting his legal
obligation to reveal the names of donors to a secret campaign fund,
Kohl compounds the damage he has already caused.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years Kohl dominated German politics. He guided the
peaceful reunification of his country, helped fashion the political
framework for a united Europe and led the way to economic
cooperation on the continent and the adoption of a common currency.
But his admission that for years he operated a system of secret
accounts to handle undeclared cash donations to his party has dealt
a heavy blow to his formidable reputation. Now it threatens to
consume his party as well.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Bonn last month opened a preliminary criminal
investigation of Kohl, who has acknowledged that he received more
than $1 million in undisclosed political contributions while in
office. The former chancellor had stunned Germans in November when
he admitted, after previous denials, that he had used illegal bank
accounts to channel secret political contributions to local
branches of his party. But he has refused to disclose the names of
the contributors, citing his ``word of honor'' not to do so. Kohl's
image as a statesman is rapidly degenerating into that of a corrupt
and arrogant machine boss.
</P>
<P>
   The Kohl affair is a reminder that the United States is not the
only advanced democracy where the insatiable demands of campaign
finance threaten to undermine democracy. Since the reckless
fund-raising of the 1996 American presidential campaign, France,
Spain, Italy and Britain have all been rocked by fund-raising
scandals. It is troubling that a scandal of this magnitude is
occurring in Germany, which has the most generous system of state
financing of political parties in the world _ a result of similar
scandals in the 1980s in which Kohl was also implicated. Clearly,
public financing of elections has to be linked to vigorous
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The current scandal grew out of a public prosecutor's
investigation into cash payments of a half-million dollars to party
officials linked to an arms export deal with Saudi Arabia. Party
officials also allegedly received large sums of money from a French
oil company that took over a chemical plant in eastern Germany in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The widening investigation has exposed extensive deceit in the
upper reaches of Kohl's party. Last week his protege and successor
as party leader, Wolfgang Schauble, admitted accepting $52,000 in
cash from the same fugitive arms broker who gave secret donations
to Kohl's intermediaries. And on Wednesday the party said that $4.5
million more in apparantly illicit funds had been uncovered. Nobody
has yet alleged that the former chancellor benefited personally
from secret accounts. But he must not be allowed to hide behind his
stature as a statesman. If Kohl is to salvage his diminished
reputation _ and his party's _ he should disclose what he knows and
cooperate fully with efforts to establish the facts.

TOMS LEADS AFTER 63
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES -- David Toms had a breakthrough year on the PGA
Tour in 1999 with two victories and earnings of $1,959,672, which
was more than what he had won in his previous nine years on tour
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he had going in 1998 he had going again Wednesday when
he shot a nine-under 63 and grabbed the first-round lead in the $3
million Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Toms was playing Indian Wells Country Club, regarded as the
easiest layout in the four-course rotation, and made the most of
his day with a round that included two eagles, five birdies and not
a single bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My irons were real sharp today,'' he said. ``For nine-under,
you usually make a lot of putts. I made a couple of good putts, but
the rest of them were putts that you're supposed to make.''
</P>
<P>
   His longest birdie of the day was a 20-footer on the par-3,
163-yard 15th hole. Three other birdies were inside 15 feet and one
his eagles came from five feet on the 517-yard fifth hole, which he
reached with a five wood on his second shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions today were ideal,'' Toms said, referring to the
sunny, almost windless day. ``I think it was like playing golf in a
dome. Obviously, we all would like to play in this every day, if we
could, or at least I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms wasn't the only one who played well Wednesday in this
annual, five-day birdie binge. Paul Goydos, Bob Tway, Neal
Lancaster and Robert Damron were a shot behind at 64, and last
year's runner-up, Steve Pate, was at 65 along with the likes of
Esteban Toledo and Glen Day.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III appeared ready to join the Lancaster group at 64,
but he drove out of bounds on his final hole, took double bogey and
settled for a 66 at Indian Wells. Last year's winner, David Duval,
had a 68 at the Arnold Palmer at PGA West, the same course on which
he shot his stunning, final-round 59 to win a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tour rookie Casey Martin, playing at Indian Wells, had a solid
68 that included a chip-in for eagle.
</P>
<P>
   `` I had a lot of great looks, but I just didn't putt that
well,'' he said. ``But at the same time, I hit it great.''
</P>
<P>
   Love is playing in his first event of the year and said the Hope
tournament was a good place to start the season. He didn't qualify
for the recent Mercedes Championship at Kapalua because he didn't
win last year -- he hasn't won since the 1998 MCI Classic -- but he
probably wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on my swing,'' he said, and I didn't want to
try it out over there. With the winds, that would have been
counterproductive for me.
</P>
<P>
   I've been trying to get everything tuned up, and I felt pretty
good about that. This is a good spot to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Mediate played Wednesday at La Quinta Country Club, a
7,060-yard test thought to be the toughest of the Hope courses, and
said it was important to shoot well there and get it out of the
way. His 66 gives him plenty of confidence going into today's round
at Indian Wells, which he considers one of his favorite courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always has been,'' he said. ``You don't really have to
prepare. I just know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   What was unexpected Wednesday were some surprisingly high
numbers by some golf's well-known figures. Perhaps the biggest of
them all was Arnold Palmer, who was playing on his own course at
PGA West and struggled to a 10-over 82. Former U.S. Open champion
Steve Jones had a 78. Fuzzy Zoeller was at 76. Tour rookie Gary
Nicklaus had a 74 that included a back-nine 39. Tom Kite, who broke
the tour record for a 90-hole event with a 35-under-par 325 in
winning the 1993 Classic, was at 73.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 114 of the 128 players in the field were at par or
better. Only 14 others failed to break par.

FUEL CELL MAY BEAT BATTERY BLUES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The cell phone of the future may run without batteries, powered
instead by methanol, the key ingredient in windshield washer fluid.
</P>
<P>
   And it may solve mobile phone users' biggest complaint: not
enough talk time from their batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Motorola Labs in Tempe and Los Alamos National
Labs in New Mexico have produced a working version of a
methanol-powered fuel cell small enough to fit inside a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Battery technology has improved slowly over the years. Today's
best batteries require recharging after two or three days of
moderate phone use. The new fuel cell offers dramatic improvement
over battery power. It will support moderate use of a phone for
about a month before needing to be refueled, Motorola says.
</P>
<P>
   The new power source is slightly bigger than a postage stamp and
slightly thicker than a penny. Prototypes of the fuel cartridges
are about the size of AA batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Like all fuel cells, this one uses a catalyst to convert energy
stored in fuel directly to electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, one of the leading makers of cell phones, joined with
Los Alamos because researchers there had developed fuel cells that
run on methanol, also known as wood alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Methanol is rich with fuel, holding 10 times the energy, ounce
for ounce, as today's best batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel cell is up and running on a laboratory bench, as
Motorola tests its safety, durability and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers expect the device to be safe. It generates no extra
heat, making electricity at room temperature. The two byproducts of
the chemical reaction are carbon dioxide and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be three to five years before you see it in a product,''
said Bill Ooms, director of Motorola Labs' material, device and
energy research division.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers faced hurdles trying to get a working fuel cell in a
small electronic device. Fuel cells traditionally produce too low a
voltage to run a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Putting several cells together increased the voltage but created
another problem, because the cells require oxygen. Stacking the
cells restricts air flow and creates the need for an air pump.
</P>
<P>
   But that made the system too big.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Labs came up with circuitry to convert the output of a
single cell to the higher voltage.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola says it still faces the technical challenge of making
the fuel cells less expensive than rechargeable batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Ooms said other researchers are looking at fuel cells as a power
source for electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably in the lead for applying them to small portable
equipment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Jodoin, an analyst with the Cahners In-Stat Group high-tech
market research firm, said it's difficult to assess competition
because fuel cell research is likely being done in secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola produces the phones and the semiconductors (that
control power use), and now they're addressing the remaining
consumer concern: battery life,'' Jodoin said. ``Within the
industry, that makes them pretty unique.'' &QL;

FOR HOMEMAKER, DRUG TRADE `WAS A GAME, A BAD GAME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smugglers, apparently spooked by law enforcement agents, stashed
marijuana on her border property near Bisbee Junction. Lindstrom
mulled it over awhile, then hauled the stuff to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she was making regular runs, taking drugs north and coming
home with cash.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years later, Lindstrom, wearing a pink sweatshirt with
``MOM'' emblazoned across the chest, smiles innocently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get money, and I'd go skiing with it,'' the Doris Day
look-alike says. ``It was only for the extras.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Lindstrom's life seemed as scripted as a 1950s movie.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in the Valley of the Sun and graduated from Tempe
High School when she was just 16. She attended peace vigils during
the Vietnam War but was hardly a hippie. She went to college and
earned a bachelor's degree in zoology, along with a teaching
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Then she married a physician, moved to southern Arizona, raised
kids, volunteered at school.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Gary Patrick Callahan, a Border Patrol agent and Vietnam
vet who also defies the narco-profile.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom and Callahan became friends, then romantic partners.
In Bisbee Junction, a Mayberry-like town on the edge of Mexico, the
homemaker and lawman turned outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   They got drugs from smugglers and took them to William Bartel,
Lindstrom's brother and a Paradise Valley dentist, who sold the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1989 raid at Bartel's home, investigators found 81
pounds of cocaine. They arrested a dentist who was willing to avoid
prison by testifying against his divorced sister and her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   And that's only half the story.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lindstrom was convicted, married Callahan and served
two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan fled to New Zealand. He was hunted down, returned to
the United States and sentenced to 27 years in an Arkansas
penitentiary, where he whiles away the days filing appeals and
doling out legal advice to fellow inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan also helped found the November Coalition, one of the
nation's most prominent organizations dedicated to overthrowing the
drug war.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bartel, he never spent a day in prison. He pleaded guilty
to drug charges and, in return for cooperating, got probation and a
$5,000 fine. He has resumed practicing dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Abrams, an assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute the
case, quit his job and agreed to write a book with Callahan and
Lindstrom. Their theme: America's drug war is an unwinnable,
hypocritical, expensive police action that violates the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The book deal collapsed after Abrams ran for Cochise County
attorney and issued campaign fliers touting his prosecution of
Callahan and Lindstrom. Abrams lost the election. He has a private
practice now, defending drug offenders and other clients. &QL; 
FIGHTING BACK
</P>
<P>
   Gary Callahan has plenty to say about the drug war, and plenty
of time to say it.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that politicians have played the public for fools,
using anti-drug hysteria to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug campaign, he argues, has systematically squandered
tax dollars, eroded civil rights, destroyed families and
transformed America into the world's biggest gulag.
</P>
<P>
   His November Organization puts it this way: ``From the very
onset, the war on drugs was fashioned as a political tool, but it
has been hammer-forged in the ensuing years into a weapon that is
wreaking havoc on our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-page letter written from prison, Callahan elaborated,
``The drug war is destroying families at a pace that far and away
outstrips the damage that drugs do. Just go into any prison
visiting room on the weekend to see what this war is doing. It is a
thing unprecedented in American experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's cynicism is born of gung-ho idealism. His dad fought
at Guadalcanal with the U.S. Marine Corps, then became a U.S.
immigration officer in charge of the Bahama Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan followed suit, joining the Marines out of high school
while other young Americans protested the Vietnam War. He learned
to track the Viet Cong, watched buddies get killed and earned a
couple of Purple Hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go,'' he explains, ``mistakenly believing that it
was a valid cause. . . . I arrived in my company with 13 others.
Seven were killed. Five were shipped home shot or blown to bits.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Callahan signed up for a new tour of human
hunting, this time with the Border Patrol. But he grew just as
disillusioned chasing poor Latin Americans through the desert as he
had chasing the Viet Cong in the jungles of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan says his job was to defend America from illegal
immigration, but agency commanders were obsessed with making dope
seizures for publicity and federal money.
</P>
<P>
   He mocks those who say the drug war is winnable. Inspectors can
check only a fraction of the vehicles crossing U.S. borders. The
mass deployment of agents and money is laughable, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the insidious corruption . . . &QL; 
DOPE JUSTICE?
</P>
<P>
   Because of pending appeals, Callahan won't discuss his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of stealing marijuana and cocaine from smugglers
at the border, then transporting the stuff to Bartel for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Since his conviction on two charges, Callahan has claimed that
federal agents and prosecutors made their case with unlawful
searches, perjured testimony and illegal interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you've got rights?'' he says. ``Better think again.
. . . I would never on Earth receive a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan claims that is why he skipped bail, fled to New Zealand
and lived on a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the bitterness is rivaled only by his melancholy over
being banished from three sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been very close,'' he says. ``I haven't seen them in
years because the feds send you as far away from home as they can .
. . to punish you and destroy the very fiber of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan compares drug conspiracy statutes with Soviet
anti-thought laws. He accuses government prosecutors of routinely
bribing witnesses with money or coercing them with threats of
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He decries the incarceration of non-violent criminals and points
out that taxpayers spend billions to build prisons for drug
offenders while public schools fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staggering number of families destroyed. . . . Has it
worked?'' Callahan asks. ``That is the question that most needs an
honest answer.'' &QL; 
SHE DIDN'T INHALE
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lindstrom says she tried marijuana in the '60s, ``but I
didn't inhale because I didn't want that stuff in my lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   She grins at the Clintonesque irony, adding, ``I was in college.
It was cool. All the other people were doing it. . . . We were just
playing at it, same as I was playing at being a drug dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 52, Lindstrom acknowledges how naive that sounds and how she
threw away a life that many would describe as the American ideal.
</P>
<P>
   She had a successful husband and three healthy kids; she worked
part-time at &UR; her husband's medical office, directed a school play,
helped run a service station.
</P>
<P>
   Like anyone who lives along the border, Lindstrom occasionally
saw people carrying suspicious loads on their backs. She'd report
them to drug agents.
</P>
<P>
   But when she chanced on two bundles of dope in an arroyo, she
decided to leave the stuff and see what would happen. Days passed.
Cows ate most of the dope. Lindstrom took the remainder to her
brother. Easy money.
</P>
<P>
   She began watching for other stashes. She was friends with
several Border Patrol agents and listened for scuttlebutt, knowing
that drug runners often stash their dope before getting busted or
running back to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would walk my dogs the next morning and look for things they
(agents) missed,'' she says. ``It was fun. I never thought of the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Lindstrom says she and Callahan teamed up. They
weren't drug users or big-time dealers, she insists, just
opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had a political thought in my head,'' she
says. ``That's why I didn't realize that what I was doing was so
serious. . . . It was a game, a bad game.'' &QL; 
UNEQUAL JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Lindstrom and Callahan went to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom is convinced that federal prosecutors were trying to
make an example of a drug ring that involved a federal lawman, a
dentist and a housewife.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were awful to me,'' she says. ``They wanted to break
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She served most of her 2{-year sentence at a Phoenix prison for
women, working yard maintenance for 12 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the bathroom when they say. You stand in line to
eat. The only way you can know what it's like is to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at a 20-acre ranchette on the Mexican line, Lindstrom
lives with her parents, an invalid uncle, chickens and dogs. It is
a peaceful place where she thinks of prohibition as the great
conspiracy. Marijuana kills no one, she says, but alcohol and
tobacco are lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me what the most dangerous drug is,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   If people fear crime, Lindstrom argues, they should hate a drug
war that increases the value of narcotics, empowers the
narco-cartels and makes criminals of harmless users.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't legislate morality. I wouldn't use cocaine if it was
available in Safeway,'' she says. ``But there are some people who
will use it whether it's legal or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindstrom ridicules the idea of prison as an antidote to drugs,
pointing to her husband and her brother as examples.
</P>
<P>
   Bartel, a former drug dealer, served no time behind bars. Today,
he's a productive member of society.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan will spend 27 years in a federal penitentiary, away
from his kids, producing nothing but anti-government essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll spend $23,000 a year to keep him there,'' Lindstrom
says. ``You can't warehouse people and say, `Well, but we're doing
good in this country.' Empty lives. Empty boxes. Empty Christmases.
Just people sitting around, waiting for their time to be up.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lindstrom takes solace in her own grown children. One son
works for the Cochise County Attorney's Office and ran for justice
of the peace. The other, a college football player, tried for a pro
contract. Her daughter is a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   None use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem today,'' she says, ``is most parents don't stay
home to tell their children. . . . I'm not saying I'm the greatest
mother in the world. I certainly made mistakes, but . . .'' &QL; 
SECOND THOUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Former prosecutor Abrams, 52, shares a law office next to a
Texaco station on the Naco Highway in the drug smuggling hub of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   His walls are adorned with letters of recognition from his days
with the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams changed sides in the drug war 10 years ago during a
midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He moved from Phoenix to the border and began to see not just
the misery caused by drugs but the impact of America's enforcement
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one screwed-up nation,'' Abrams says. ``I mean, `the
drug war'? What is that? A social problem. . . . The drug war
benefits few people and creates more tragedies than identifiable
victories.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls running into Callahan's ex-wife at the local market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke into tears. I said, `I'm sorry, so sorry. Not for
prosecuting him. I'm sorry for the whole bloody mess.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam, innocent casualties were listed as ``collateral
damage.'' Abrams wrote a screenplay about similar victims in the
drug war, then agreed to collaborate on the book with Lindstrom and
Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen impoverished Mexicans sucked into the smuggling
vortex, dragged away from weeping families while kingpins remained
hidden, protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossing the drugs is a business where people are used and
thrown away by drug lords,'' Abrams says.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Parentless kids become gang-bangers. More lives are
wasted. More drugs pour into America.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, enforcement agents risk their lives for nothing,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many become robots _ working to keep a job, collect a check.
Some grow jaded, breaking the law to make cases. A few sell out,
taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It corrupts everything,'' Abrams says. ``There's a tremendous
amount of cynicism in law enforcement, and it's well-placed.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams admits he has reservations about legalizing hard drugs
such as cocaine or methamphetamine. But that may be the lesser of
evils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to err on the side of legalization because I
think the costs to society are less,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head and says Americans have surrendered their
legacy of freedom to the gods of drug control. He says the nation
has embraced unjust sentencing laws, racketeering statutes that
violate property rights, searches based on ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason cars get stopped down here,'' Abrams says,
``is because the people driving 'em have brown skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is intertwined,'' he adds. `Yet we have one
solution. It's called jail. And do you know who makes out? The
people who build jails.'' &QL;

SLOCUM LEAVES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC assistant coach Shawn Slocum has resigned to return to Texas
A&AMP;M and work with his father, Aggies head coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, 34, coached linebackers and special teams the past two
seasons for USC, after spending the previous seven years at Texas
A&AMP;M. He will coach linebackers for the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Slocum wanted to return his family to
Texas and had just built a home in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   He is the fourth USC coach to leave the staff since the end of
the season. Offensive line coach Steve Greatwood was fired;
quarterbacks coach Ken O'Brien refused a reassignment to tight ends
and resigned while wide receivers coach Mike Wilson entered private
business.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum's departure means that USC has openings for a tight-ends
coach and linebackers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Although Slocum was USC's only special teams coach, he was
expected to split duties with new wide receivers coach Dan Ferrigno
next year, after the Trojans' special teams performance faltered
during a 6-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   Of a more immediate concern to USC is how Slocum's departure
will affect the recruitment of linebacker Amon Gordon of Mira Mesa
High in San Diego. Gordon has listed USC as his leader but now says
he is unsure, and is scheduled to visit Miami this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett will make a home visit this week to
Gordon and his roommate, Mira Mesa quarterback Teyo Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Among those believed to be interested in the job is former USC
linebacker Riki Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Welch finished: Offensive lineman Matt Welch has ended his
playing career because of recurring shoulder injuries and will take
a medical redshirt, which means his scholarship will not count
against the team's total of 85. Welch, who also played tight end,
had one year of eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta commits: USC has secured a commitment from offensive
lineman Carlos Acosta of Moorpark Community College. Acosta played
at Thousand Oaks High School and is the Trojans' 16th commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Who's eligible? Cornerback Eric Reese may be declared
academically ineligible this semester, which would result in his
missing spring practice. Reese's status should be determined by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   No track? Wide receiver Kareem Kelly is not working out with the
track team and is unlikely to run for the Trojans this season,
because of time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The other football players who double as track athletes --
Marcell Allmond, Lucais MacKay, Sultan McCullough, Darrell Rideaux
-- are all working out with the track team.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford commits: Los Alamitos High quarterback Mike Sanford Jr.,
the son of former USC assistant coach Mike Sanford, has orally
committed to Boise State University.

SO FAR, QUIET WEEK FOR MARTIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES -- It has been a quiet week, so far at least, for
Casey Martin and his cart at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said nobody ``has gotten in his face'' about riding a
cart on tour, but that could change. Opinions appear to be mixed
among this week's professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for anybody else,'' said last year's Hope
winner, David Duval. ``To me, is it a big deal that he's playing?
No, he earned his way out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to (qualifying) school, finished in the top 15 on the
Nike Tour and earned his spot. As far as the other stuff with the
cart and the court, I have no say in the matter. I haven't thought
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out here and it's no different seeing him out here than
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III, on the other hand, didn't want to talk about it
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better than I don't comment on that subject,''
he told reporter.
</P>
<P>
   (box) Glen Day, who is just two shots behind first-round leader
David Toms, played in last week's Sony Open in Honolulu despite the
fact he doesn't like the course, Waialae Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is just not good for me,'' he said. ``I like to hit
it left to right, and you've got to hit right to left there. It's
just, you know, some courses just aren't for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why did he go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because my wife (Jennifer) said she wanted to go to
Honolulu,'' he said. ``Just like any good husband, I said, `Yes
ma'am.' ''

MURRAY EXPECTS MORE FROM KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the post-game euphoria of Tuesday night's 5-3 victory --
just their third in 14 games -- Kings coach Andy Murray was
surprisingly subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was not talking up Ziggy Palffy, who had two goals and an
assist in his first dominant game in six weeks. Or Luc Robitaille,
who had two power play goals to give him 20 for the 12th time in 13
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did not play well late in the game, let in a couple
poor goals and was whistled for eight penalties.
</P>
<P>
   And though he wouldn't say it at the time, Murray knows that
won't do tonight against the Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars, who
have not lost to the Kings in their last 20 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Murray obviously wants to downplay the streak. Only two of the
games are on his record, a 4-1 loss Jan. 3 and a 3-2 overtime
defeat on Nov. 24. Both games were in Dallas. This will be the
Stars' first visit to Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we've played better games that we've lost,'' Murray
said about beating Buffalo. ``I liked some things, but there were
several areas that still need work.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's workout at Iceoplex, Murray met the team and
together they outlined why the Stars have played them so tough.
</P>
<P>
   -- Early leads, like the two-goal advantage in the first period
of the 4-1 loss Jan. 3 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the best at playing with a lead,'' said captain Rob
Blake, who skipped Wednesday's practice nursing a sore groin.
``They get in front and control the tempo. They never let you back
in.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Big name players. Both Mike Modano (concussion) and Brett
Hull (groin) have been nursing injuries, but will be back.
</P>
<P>
   -- Goaltending. Ed Belfour has a 2.18 goals against average in
36 games. That is fifth best in the league, as are his 17
victories. The Kings say they need to adjust a few things. Of the
eight pen alties Tuesday, three came late, giving the Sabres a
chance to come back . All there were in the Buffalo end, meaning
the Kings didn't take them to stop Sabres scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Injury updates: Palffy, who played so well against Buffalo, was
held out of Wednesday's practice as a precaution against his sore
lower back. He continued rehab and is expected in the lineup
tonight. ... Jozef Stumpel (knee) is ahead of schedule. He has
started skating and the club hopes he will be ready for the next
road trip, which begin s Wednesday in Dallas. ... Glen Murray
(chest bruise) is skating, but no t involved in contact drills
because he is still very sore. ... Donald A udette (ankle sprain)
still is probably two weeks away.

USC NEEDED THE REST 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been eight days since USC's emotional victory over UCLA,
but Trojans coach Henry Bibby welcomed the layoff as a chance for
his team to catch its breath and regroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives guys that have played a lot of minutes time to
recover,'' Bibby said. ``The stretch we go through now will have a
bearing on us, if we don't watch what we do in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, practices are not as tough because guys are playing
so many minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   With five starters averaging more than 30 minutes a game, Bibby
said he is still not worried about fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a problem,'' Bibby said. ``A day between
games is ample enough time to get your legs back again.''
</P>
<P>
   No repeat: One thing the Trojans (10-5, 3-0) are trying to a
void is a repeat of last year's tailspin, when they lost six
straight conference games after a 2-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything like last year,'' forward Sam Clancy
said. ``We're trying to win all our home games, and split our road
games but our goal is not to lose two in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy doesn't anticipate any prolonged losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing as a team a lot better than at any time last
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House vs. Trepagnier: The featured matchup in today's game will
occur when USC's Jeff Trepagnier tries to contain Arizona State
guard Eddie House, the leading scorer in the Pacific-10 Conference
at 24.4 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to run him around a little bit and try to
get him tired,'' House told the Arizona Republic. ``I think I'll
take away from his offen se by him focusing so much on guarding
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby admitted that there are only so many options in stopping
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you play a guy who shoots 35 times is not looking to
pass a lot ?'' Bibby said. ``Is he ever looking to pass? Only when
he's double-teamed or out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you play him. He poses a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   House did not enjoy great success last season against the
Trojans. He was 4 for 18 from the field in two games and scored 16
points.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked recruit: Arizona State freshman point guard Kyle Dodd
has just three turnovers in his past seven games. Dodd, who attende
d Brea-Olinda High, was interested in USC, but was dropped from
consideration by the Trojans and committed to the Sun Devils.

RELIGION A TABOO TOPIC ON THE JOB? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix city employees can go too far when talking about God at
work.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Richard Behn discovered when he was suspended after
telling co-workers that salvation through Jesus is the only way to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the groundskeeping supervisor is suing the city, saying it
violated his rights of free speech and freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The case adds to the national debate over what kind of religious
conversation is appropriate in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   If the message comes from, or seems to come from, the
government, then it's wrong, said Marci Hamilton, a New York law
professor and expert on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can talk about personal convictions, she said, until
it becomes harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But that line is blurry.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace religious discrimination charges are rising, according
to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. From 1992 to 1998,
complaints jumped about 29 percent, from 1,388 to 1,796.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state laws require employers to reasonably
accommodate employees' religious beliefs unless that imposes an
undue hardship. A prayer break, for example, is a reasonable
request.
</P>
<P>
   But when faced with religious discrimination claims, courts
often favor the employer, said Richard Foltin, legislative director
for the American Jewish Committee in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it's not particularly problematic to
have an employee once say, `I'd like to talk to you about my
faith,' '' Foltin said. But the workplace becomes a ``hostile
environment'' when one person's right to free speech runs into
another's right to be free from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The city wouldn't comment on Behn's suit, but has a policy
against a hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   As an evangelical Christian, Behn says he has a duty to tell
others about his faith, following a higher call from God.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Behn was suspended for one day for discussing his
religion with those he worked with and supervised at Maryvale
Baseball Park.
</P>
<P>
   He was told to stop sharing his faith and giving religious
literature to those who requested it, although he had been doing it
for 15 years, said his attorney, Bryan J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Behn's supervisors said his ``preaching on the job'' created an
uncomfortable work environment, court documents say. If he
continued, he could face further discipline, including termination
or reassignment to a less desirable position.
</P>
<P>
   Behn appealed through city administrative channels and lost.
Tuesday, he filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a right to be religious on the job,'' Brown said. ``He
was talking about his own religious experiences. He was inviting
people to church.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a lawyer with the American Family Association Center
for Law &AMP; Policy in Tupelo, Miss., a center that specializes in
cases involving Christians' civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Chapple Camacho, spokeswoman for the Phoenix Parks,
Recreation and Library Department, said Wednesday that the city had
not seen the lawsuit and had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants named in the lawsuit _ David Johnson,
northwest district parks supervisor, and Rob Harman, parks facility
supervisor at Maryvale Baseball Park _ did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks Department has a policy encouraging employees to
respect each other's beliefs. The city says Behn violated that
code, court documents say.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said that same code actually supports Behn's views.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are called to respect everyone. Sexual orientation is
included,'' Brown said. ``If I'm talking about my relationship with
another man, Richard Behn must tolerate that. If he is talking to
another employee about his relationship to Jesus Christ, that will
put him out in the desert counting cactuses.'' &QL;

   BEIRUT _ Will Israel withdraw from all of the Syrian Golan
Heights? Not part of it. Not one third this year and another third
next year. But all of it _ and at once?
</P>
<P>
   This is the only question which stands between a peace treaty
and a state of continued belligerency for Syrian President Hafez
el-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Last time this simple equation was presented to the Americans,
six years ago, CNN announced that President Assad had thrown ``a
spanner in the works'' of the peace process _ as if the demand for
the return of internationally-recognized Syrian territory was an
act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, still adhering to U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 and
still insisting upon the return of all Golan _ with its precious
water sources _ President Assad is accused by Israelis of
``intransigence.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the old cliches are being trotted out. When Farouk
al-Sharaa, Assad's soigne foreign minister _ the impeccably-groomed
former head of Syrian Arab Airlines _ met the Israelis at the
Shepherdstown talks in West Virginia, we were informed that the
``peace process'' was ``back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment al-Sharaa presented the Americans and Israelis
with Syria's 34-year-old demand for a return of all Golan, the
world was told that Syria was ``playing hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't Syria ``compromise?'' Why not an Israeli-Syrian
peace first, and an Israeli military withdrawal afterwards? Why not
allow the Jewish settlers on Golan to remain on Syrian land? And
why not an Israeli military early-warning station on the Heights to
guard against a surprise Syrian assault?
</P>
<P>
   No suggestion, you may notice, of a Syrian early warning station
to guard against Israeli attack.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that the Syrians decided to postpone, ``sine
die,'' the talks which U.S. President Bill Clinton would like to
crown his ``peacemaking'' presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Publication by the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz of the U.S.
working-paper on the negotiations shows that the Syrians had
already agreed to substantial arrangements on a post-withdrawal
peace, including bilateral trade and tourism, open frontiers and an
exchange of ambassadors _ even before a commitment on Golan
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis still want to ``compromise'' on that retreat.
And the Syrians, after watching the humiliation of PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat, won't budge.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, from the Arab perspective, is it difficult to see why. The
PLO leader, dazed by the sudden respect of his American enemies and
humbled by the apparent willingness of Israel to give him a state,
agreed to a treaty which he fondly believed would be ``a peace of
the brave.''
</P>
<P>
   What he got _ and the Syrians watched this theatre of the absurd
with increasing rage _ was a Bantustan: a desiccated Palestinian
``entity'' without borders or rights, an Israeli refusal of an Arab
capital in any part of Jerusalem, the enlargement of Jewish
settlements on Palestinian land, and the refusal to accept any 1948
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Assad therefore sent al-Sharaa to Virginia with strict
instructions to avoid the Arafat trap.
</P>
<P>
   Golan, captured during the 1967 Six-Day War, was Syrian. There
would be no compromise, no future agreements based on present
trust, no timetabled withdrawals which the Israelis could delay or
abrogate as they have on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A close reading of the American working-paper _ leaked by the
Israelis to the indignation of the pro-Israeli Americans _ shows
that both Syria and Israel are still in dispute over the total
Golan Heights land area which was illegally annexed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Syria wants a withdrawal to the boundary existing on June 4,
1967, at the start of the Middle East Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   This conforms to U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 which
calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from land taken during
the war, in return for the security of all states (including
Israel) in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians are now archly demanding that the Americans
``guarantee'' the Israeli withdrawal and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright _ who usually sounds like an Israeli
spokesperson on such matters _ has predictably replied that America
can act as a ``substitute'' for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Few doubt that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would like to
get out of Golan _ without such a withdrawal there can be no
peaceful Israeli retreat from the blood-spattered mire of Lebanon _
but the Americans, as usual, prefer to play the role of lamb when
Israeli interests are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's domestic opposition appears to be growing. But one thing
Assad doesn't have to worry about _ with his nine separate internal
security agencies _ is internal opposition. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although six Republicans and two Democrats are
contesting the primaries, there are just four who are judged to
have any serious chance of winning the presidency 10 months from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most recent polls indicate that there may be only
two: Vice-President Al Gore and the Governor of Texas, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many obstacles in this knockout game of Who Wants
to be a President? These and other questions could trip any one of
them at any time between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS: Soft drugs have pretty much ceased to be an issue but
hard drugs remain a political no-no.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has admitted a drink problem in his youth and
says he has not used drugs for 25 years, but is silent on events
before that. If it emerges he did use cocaine, it could be fatal to
his prospects; if the evidence related to the past 25 years, he
would be in real difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   THE DRAFT: Of the four main contenders, only John McCain, a
professional soldier at the time, has an unimpeachable record on
the draft question.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam, but only for four months and as a
(heavily protected) reporter, suggesting a degree of special
treatment _ he was the son of a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Bill Bradley both met their draft requirements in the
U.S., hinting at privileged treatment.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN: McCain has been painfully frank about his past
womanizing, blaming himself for his divorce from his first wife and
denying that his five years as a Vietnamese PoW helped to explain
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The other three all profess enduring fidelity to their wives.
But after Monica, adultery seems unlikely to rule out any
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY: McCain was absolved of any wrongdoing in a minor banking
scandal, but still reproaches himself for having allowed the
``appearance of impropriety.'' He uses the experience to illustrate
the pernicious effect of the political funding system, where big
donors may expect their candidate, once elected, to give them
special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be vulnerable if anyone demonstrates that donations
to his campaign for governor appeared to spawn special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore remains vulnerable for dubious fund-raising practices in
the 1996 election, and for the acceptance of foreign money and
fund-raising from the White House _ both against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is accused of lobbying for privileges for big
pharmaceutical companies that donated to his Senate campaigns but
there has been no suggestion of impropriety. It simply does not sit
well with his calls to end big company donations to political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   LYING: So far, none of the candidates has been caught in
anything more serious than a mild burnishing of his record (George
Bush on his tax-cutting, Al Gore on ``inventing'' the Internet,
among others).
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH: Election campaigns demand huge reserves of stamina.
Gore, Bush and McCain have furnished doctors' statements _ and
McCain most of his medical records _ to prove they are in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, had to admit to a heart problem, and while
doctors say that millions of Americans suffer a similar condition _
an irregular heartbeat _ with no impairment of their capabilities,
it cast a shadow on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CONCLUSIONS: Two of these potential obstacles _ drugs and the
draft _ are peculiar to the Sixties generation and were arguably
neutralized by the election of Bill Clinton, despite his admission
that he smoked (without inhaling) and despite his avoidance of the
draft that could have taken him to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Another two may have been neutralized by Clinton's sins in
office _ womanizing and lying (to the American public, if not quite
in a court of law).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Clinton presidency is thought to have ``raised the
bar'' on personal failings for future candidates and presidents,
although it is arguable that a president without Clinton's charm
and political talents would not have survived the admissions he had
to make.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a problem. Any candidate who was proved to have
taken bribes or enriched himself from his political activities
would probably have to count himself out of the running. Dubious
fund-raising, though, does not count.
</P>
<P>
   Poor health will also eliminate a candidate, if not at the
primary stage, then in the election proper.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest liability for a candidate is undoubtedly hypocrisy.
This, not womanizing, is what felled Gary Hart. It is also what
saved Clinton: he may have lied, he was certainly disingenuous but
at no point was he seen as hypocritical. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although six Republicans and two Democrats are
contesting the primaries, there are just four who are judged to
have any serious chance of winning the presidency 10 months from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most recent polls indicate that there may be only
two: Vice-President Al Gore and the Governor of Texas, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many obstacles in this knockout game of Who Wants
to be a President? These and other questions could trip any one of
them at any time between now and Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   DRUGS: Soft drugs have pretty much ceased to be an issue but
hard drugs remain a political no-no.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has admitted a drink problem in his youth and
says he has not used drugs for 25 years, but is silent on events
before that. If it emerges he did use cocaine, it could be fatal to
his prospects; if the evidence related to the past 25 years, he
would be in real difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   THE DRAFT: Of the four main contenders, only John McCain, a
professional soldier at the time, has an unimpeachable record on
the draft question.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam, but only for four months and as a
(heavily protected) reporter, suggesting a degree of special
treatment _ he was the son of a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Bill Bradley both met their draft requirements in the
U.S., hinting at privileged treatment.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN: McCain has been painfully frank about his past
womanizing, blaming himself for his divorce from his first wife and
denying that his five years as a Vietnamese PoW helped to explain
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The other three all profess enduring fidelity to their wives.
But after Monica, adultery seems unlikely to rule out any
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY: McCain was absolved of any wrongdoing in a minor banking
scandal, but still reproaches himself for having allowed the
``appearance of impropriety.'' He uses the experience to illustrate
the pernicious effect of the political funding system, where big
donors may expect their candidate, once elected, to give them
special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be vulnerable if anyone demonstrates that donations
to his campaign for governor appeared to spawn special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore remains vulnerable for dubious fund-raising practices in
the 1996 election, and for the acceptance of foreign money and
fund-raising from the White House _ both against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is accused of lobbying for privileges for big
pharmaceutical companies that donated to his Senate campaigns but
there has been no suggestion of impropriety. It simply does not sit
well with his calls to end big company donations to political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   LYING: So far, none of the candidates has been caught in
anything more serious than a mild burnishing of his record (George
Bush on his tax-cutting, Al Gore on ``inventing'' the Internet,
among others).
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH: Election campaigns demand huge reserves of stamina.
Gore, Bush and McCain have furnished doctors' statements _ and
McCain most of his medical records _ to prove they are in good
health.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, had to admit to a heart problem, and while
doctors say that millions of Americans suffer a similar condition _
an irregular heartbeat _ with no impairment of their capabilities,
it cast a shadow on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CONCLUSIONS: Two of these potential obstacles _ drugs and the
draft _ are peculiar to the Sixties generation and were arguably
neutralized by the election of Bill Clinton, despite his admission
that he smoked (without inhaling) and despite his avoidance of the
draft that could have taken him to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Another two may have been neutralized by Clinton's sins in
office _ womanizing and lying (to the American public, if not quite
in a court of law).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Clinton presidency is thought to have ``raised the
bar'' on personal failings for future candidates and presidents,
although it is arguable that a president without Clinton's charm
and political talents would not have survived the admissions he had
to make.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains a problem. Any candidate who was proved to have
taken bribes or enriched himself from his political activities
would probably have to count himself out of the running. Dubious
fund-raising, though, does not count.
</P>
<P>
   Poor health will also eliminate a candidate, if not at the
primary stage, then in the election proper.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest liability for a candidate is undoubtedly hypocrisy.
This, not womanizing, is what felled Gary Hart. It is also what
saved Clinton: he may have lied, he was certainly disingenuous but
at no point was he seen as hypocritical. &QL;

   PARIS _ France Telecom is working on a jacket with a built-in
mobile telephone, which it hopes to issue experimentally this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker and microphone will probably be hidden in the sleeves;
front and sleeve buttons may double as keyboard push-buttons.
</P>
<P>
   There remains one small, technical problem. How do you wash or
dry-clean such a jacket or suit, without ruining the telephone?
</P>
<P>
   The research agency of France Telecom, the Centre National
d'Etudes des Telecommunications, believes that such clothes will be
all the rage in three to ten years' time. The prototype, to be
produced this summer, will help to overcome other remaining
difficulties, such as cost.
</P>
<P>
   Would the talking suit owner of the future be able to transfer
the equipment from one piece of clothing to another? Or would he or
she have an entire talking wardrobe?
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom is cooperating in the research with a company
called i-wear, which specializes in the development of electronic
and telephonic clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects under consideration include clothes with
transmitters to allow the wearer to be tracked by satellite
(applicable to prisoners on parole or unfaithful husbands?).
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term ideas include: sports clothes which measure speed
and distance; evening wear which changes color when it is subjected
to bright lights or loud music; and overcoats capable of checking
their own pockets to make sure that their owner has left nothing
behind. &QL;

<P>
   The art of stand-up comedy is the new weapon in the battle for
corporate success.
</P>
<P>
   Jongleurs, a British comedy-club chain, is offering lessons to
executives who think that a sense of humor might give them a
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Kempinska, Jongleurs' co-founder, said modern bosses are
discovering that there is more to comedy than knowing a few jokes.
``We're moving into an era where ideas are paramount. Stand-up just
gives you a chance to think in different terms _ how to turn words
and ideas around in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   A workshop series will be launched this month after a pilot
session by one of Jongleurs' regular comics proved a hit. Jim
Andrews, managing director of Thinc! Digital, an interactive media
business, was one of the guinea pigs and now plans to send some of
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed it _ it was great fun,'' he said. ``I was a
bit tentative initially. I couldn't imagine myself standing up on a
stage with a two-minute comedy sequence. But I found it really
liberating.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot workshop with a mixed group of professionals began
with exercises designed to encourage trust and make the
participants ``open up,'' such as mimicking walking down the road
and bumping into people.
</P>
<P>
   They moved on to writing material, taking ordinary situations
and exaggerating them to draw out the ridiculous, then performing a
routine to the rest of the group. Practicalities included learning
how to use a microphone properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of presentations to clients and you do it in a
linear way. But this made you think laterally,'' Andrews said.
``There was this mix of people who had never done anything like it
before. But by lunchtime we were all really into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies send people on challenges and adventure things
_ that's one form of exhilaration. This is another way of getting
people together and focused and excited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The session leader, Dominic Holland, a professional stand-up
comedian for eight years, said he felt quite sorry for the group
initially. ``Obviously it was terrifying. Public-speaking is
difficult anyway, but making a speech with the intention of making
folk laugh is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end, I did feel that they had enjoyed themselves
and done something they hadn't done before. It gave them a
different look, a different perspective. And they gained in
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he did not think any of the participants should give up
their day jobs, yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't funny, but I wouldn't expect them to be,'' he
said. ``Even Eddie Izzard is cited as being terribly unfunny for
the first year of his career.'' &QL;

OKLAHOMA STATE RIDES DESMOND MASON TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Okla. _ Arriving for a frothy showdown of Big 12
leaders last night, Texas' 14th-ranked Longhorns were confronted by
a packed house of screeching Oklahoma State supporters at
Gallagher-Iba Arena, officially numbered at 6,381.
</P>
<P>
   But really, the 12th-ranked Cowboys (14-1, 3-0) needed only one
of them ... Desmond Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating anew why his name adorned a variety of preseason
All-America checklists, Mason almost single-handedly shot the
Longhorns (11-5, 3-1) out of a share of the conference lead with a
30-point performance that led to a 73-65 Cowboys victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much the way Cowboys coach Eddie Sutton laid it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach emphasized that this was a really big game,'' said
Mason, who shot his way out of a slump in which he had scored 20
points and gone 8-for-31 from the field in three games against
Division I foes. ``He said I was probably going to play 40 minutes,
and he needed me to be focused for every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mason produced 40 extremely focused minutes, adding six
rebounds, two blocks, an assist and a steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one thing is it was Texas, and you have to get pumped up
or they'll run over you,'' he said. ``And being from Texas
\RWaxahachie\S myself, it always means a lot to me and seems to be
one of my better games. For two days in practice, I took about
1,000 shots, and it paid off. I'd like to play them more often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns, who lost to a ranked team for the third time
(they have also beaten three), would probably pass on that idea.
Their first clue about the course of the evening came after they
went on a 10-0 run to take a 17-10 lead in the first half. Over the
next four minutes, Mason outscored them 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Mason had 17 of the Cowboys' 29 points, although
the Longhorns held a 30-29 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It would be their last. Mason opened the second half with eight
unanswered points, launching the Cowboys to an eventual 54-41 lead
with 6:36 remaining. Texas eventually closed it to four on Darren
Kelly's 3-pointer with a minute remaining but could get no closer.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Mason's performance, Sutton said, ``That's the best
game I've had from any player since I've been back at Oklahoma
State.''
</P>
<P>
   So good, in fact, that teammate Glendon Alexander, who finished
with 17 points, admitted to being a bit awed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've ever become a spectator during a
game,'' he said. ``But he looked, so good I just stood back and
watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas got 24 points from Chris Mihm and 13 each from Gabe
Muoneke and Kelly, but coach Rick Barnes noted that it wasn't
enough to offset one hot Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terrific,'' Barnes said, ``but the kind of player he
is, you knew he was going to break out pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The game got away from Texas during a 10-point swing in the
second half when the luckless Longhorns watched two layups, two
follow shots and a 3-pointer rim out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't fall during that stretch, and it hurt,'' said
Mihm, who refused to blame the loss on the pressure of back-to-back
battles with ranked teams. Texas beat Oklahoma on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year,'' he said, ``you're supposed to be ready
for stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm also ducked questions about whether he would return to
Texas next year or opt for the NBA draft after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I am a member of the University of Texas, and
that's all that matters,'' he said. ``It's unfair to my teammates
to talk about anything else.''

REP. SKELTON SEES NEED TO REVAMP OVERSEAS BASES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri returned from a trip
to Asia and the Pacific this week, convinced of the need to retain
and possibly revamp America's military operations there.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton, from Lexington, is the ranking Democrat on the House
Armed Services Committee and he made the 11-day trip to Guam,
Australia and Singapore with three other committee Democrats. It
was paid for with money from the group's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stability in the region can only be maintained by a continued
U.S. military presence,'' Skelton told reporters Wednesday. ``Both
U.S. and foreign officials emphasized this to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia, for example, could not have performed its recent
mission in nearby East Timor without American help in
communications, intelligence and lift operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States might want to station more troops in Guam and
Australia for training and exercises, Skelton added. Those troops
could be transferred from Japan and Okinawa, where he said such
training is becoming more difficult because of local regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to believe that such a redeployment is
imminent, but we do think it is prudent to think in advance so that
such a move could be made in orderly fashion,'' Skelton said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation also met with agricultural officials in Australia
and Singapore. The countries import American goods and Skelton
believes the potential exists for an even larger market there.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, the Skelton group went to a chamber of commerce
function also attended by Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, who
was there on a trade promotion mission.

SCULPTURES RENDERED BY AREA ARTISTS RECALL DAY OF NORMANDY
INVASION 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   Two sculptured beach obstacles, recalling the obstructions
placed by the German army along the French shoreline to impede the
1944 Normandy invasion, have just been completed for the National
D-Day Memorial in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Custom Metal &AMP; Fabrication of Olathe assembled the objects
according to the design of Baldwin City, Kan., sculptor Matt Kirby
and the research of Paul Dorrell, director of Kansas City's Leopold
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Custom Metal employees loaded the obstacles for an
initial trip to Baldwin City. There they will remain outdoors for
several weeks, acquiring the appropriate sheen of rust and weather.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will be off to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The beach obstacles are the latest objects for the memorial to
be finished by area artists. Sculptor Jim Brothers of Lawrence
already has shipped several bronze statues of soldiers to the
shrine, which is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are roughly 7 feet long in each direction and have
been rendered 25 percent larger than the originals placed by the
Germans. Representatives of the American Normandy Cemetery in
France sent photographs and drawings to guide the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the project still proved complicated.
</P>
<P>
   At first, representatives of the D-Day memorial considered
ordering the beach obstacles in bronze. But those would not have
offered sufficient contrast to the bronze soldiers that already
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Stainless steel was another option. But while stainless steel
can be darkened with a blow-torch, it is difficult to achieve a
uniform color, Dorrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby and Dorrell then decided on a variety of dark steel that
will rust to a certain point but then stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of World War II, you think of black-and-white
photographs and rusting metal,'' Kirby said.
</P>
<P>
   These obstacles, once rusted just so, will evoke that distant
time.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby already has been getting compliments about the obstacles,
especially from those old enough to remember the originals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be involved in a project like this,'' Kirby
said. ``My dad is impressed.''

JUDGE REDUCES JURY AWARD TO WOMAN HURT AT RAIL CROSSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Jackson County judge on Wednesday reduced by more than half
the $160 million jury award to a Sedalia woman severely injured in
a rail crossing accident, but it remains among the highest such
awards nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Charles Atwell cut the verdict to $75 million but
upheld the jury's finding of punitive damages against the nation's
largest railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Railroad Co. did not tell state officials about
the dangerous crossing near Warrensburg, where plaintiff Kimberly
Alcorn was injured on Aug. 29, 1997, the judge wrote, and the
company waited for the government to pay for installing lights and
gates. Union Pacific itself did ``virtually nothing'' to protect
the public, Atwell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn's $160 million jury award was among the 10 highest in the
United States last year, according to Lawyers Weekly USA, and was
the largest verdict ever to a single plaintiff in a rail-crossing
accident. Lawyers said the previous record damage award in Missouri
was about $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn is a 34-year-old mother of two who was a passenger in a
car hit by an Amtrak train traveling about 70 mph. She suffered
multiple broken bones and permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   According to evidence, state officials had warned Union Pacific
in fall 1996 that brush and terrain blocked the view at the
crossing by about 90 percent. A few months later, a passenger train
killed a 22-year-old man at the crossing, four months before Alcorn
was hit. An Amtrak assistant engineer testified that he had almost
hit five vehicles at the crossing, including a propane truck.
</P>
<P>
   At trial last year, jurors awarded Alcorn $40.4 million in
actual damages and found Union Pacific at fault for 75 percent and
Amtrak at fault for 25 percent. Jurors also found that Union
Pacific alone should pay $120 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, the attorney for the railroads, argued after the
verdicts that punitive damages were improper. He also said the
large verdicts showed ``inflamed passion and prejudice'' by the
jurors, and he requested a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Atwell reduced Alcorn's actual damages to $25
million and the punitive damages to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Union Pacific spokesman said that the verdicts were still
excessive and that the railroad would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak also will appeal, said spokesman Cliff Black. The driver
of the car carrying Alcorn should have watched for the train, Black
said, and railroad companies are not required to upgrade the
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the railroad's responsibility to accomplish highway
engineering projects,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific and other railroads almost always wait for
government subsidies to pay $100,000 to $200,000 to install lights
and crossing gates at crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County jurors in the Alcorn case said they wanted to
force Union Pacific to pay to upgrade signals at dangerous
crossings. A Union Pacific expert testified at trial that lights
and crossing gates could stop up to 90 percent of the nation's
crossing accidents, which killed 431 persons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn's attorney, Grant Davis, said that the verdict, even
after being reduced, set new levels of damages and was a prelude to
more like it. Railroads should start to pay for signals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more cost-efficient to do the right thing,'' Davis said.
``The days of railroads killing hundreds of people at crossings
each year without accountability are coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he and his client would be willing to reduce the
punitive damages if Union Pacific would use the money to put lights
and gates at Missouri crossings.

HATCH FINDS AN ELECTORATE THAT MAY BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Note: This is the seventh in a series of reports about the
presidential candidates in Iowa, the first major contest in the
2000 primary season. )
</P>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ When you're in last place, as the polls here
put Sen. Orrin Hatch, you can spend an easy hour or two with the
youngsters at Wallace Accelerated School.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the second president this week!'' a first-grader told
the Utah Republican. Principal Maggie McGill explained that
Democrat Bill Bradley had zipped through three days earlier, and
whoa, you should've seen all the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in last place, you'll take any question that a
cafeteria full of third-graders can muster. Did you do homework in
school, Mr. Hatch? (``I wish I did more.'') What's the difference
between Republicans and Democrats? And do you really, really want
to be president?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, I do,'' he deadpanned. ``I wouldn't be going through
this misery if I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen grown-ups in the room laughed. And Hatch, who has 19
grandchildren, was quick to clarify that talking to kids isn't
misery, of course, but the travel and debates and time away from
family can be ``very, very tough _ as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Something about this presidential race is not as it should be,
in the four-term senator's opinion: How can one of Capitol Hill's
most productive conservatives _ who has the most political
experience by far in this GOP field of six _ wind up lost on the
national media's radar?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eastern liberal media _ they've written me off, basically
because I don't have a lot of money,'' said Hatch, 64, as he left
the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out there know that the major media are trying to lead
them by the nose, telling them how to vote _ it's either (George
W.) Bush or (John) McCain. That's nonsense. And when I mention that
to voters, they say, `Doggone it, you're right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch entered the race late, about seven months ago. He carried
name-recognition and a resume that included sponsorship of scores
of bills, from patent-law reform to protections on the vitamin
industry.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Washington credentials may not be what the
Republican electorate is searching for, said Bruce Gronbeck,
professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, for the last 25 years, it's been pretty easy for a
candidate to run against Washington, especially if it's the party
out of office,'' Gronbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orrin Hatch is running an awfully low-profile campaign, almost
as if he's trying to position himself in a safe corner to pick up
the pieces if George W. destructs,'' he said. ``No catchy phrases.
Staying away from the Jesus issues. He's trying to be an eminently
reasonable, issues-centered politician.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, blue-suit conservative and bishop in the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, Hatch said, ``I do believe in helping
people who would help themselves if they could.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator himself rose from a childhood of selling live
chickens door-to-door. He landed a scholarship to Brigham Young
University and now sits as chairman of the Senate's powerful
Judiciary Committee, where in 1991 he staunchly defended U.S.
Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas against sexual-harassment
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got experience money can't buy,'' he says. ``Steve Forbes
is a fine man, but before you run for president, don't you think
you should be elected to something?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Hatch surprised both aisles in the Senate when he and
Democrat Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts co-sponsored a $24 billion
program to get states to provide health insurance for children of
low-income working parents. Hatch surprised them again when he and
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, teamed up to craft
anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only candidate who has a proven record of getting both
sides together,'' Hatch said. ``The most famous duo in Washington
right now is the Hatch-Kennedy duo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch proposes getting rid of the capital-gains tax and all
federal estate and gift taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He upholds the Second Amendment. Instead of taking action
against firearms makers and legitimate dealers, Hatch vows to crack
down on criminals who use guns: 10 years in prison for a felon
possessing a gun, 20 years if the gun is fired and a life sentence
if somebody gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   He's probably the most vocal member of the GOP pack when it
comes to addressing Clinton administration scandals. He says, ``I'm
going to bring morals back to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   As for campaign-finance reform, Hatch claims to be a living
example, asking individuals to chip in at least $36 _ not that he
wouldn't love a lot more. He chose $36 because, on the day he
announced his campaign, Texas Gov. Bush had already raised $36
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a million people each gave me 36 bucks, I'd win this
thing,'' he said. Even Pierre Salinger, the press secretary to
Democratic presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, mailed Hatch
$36.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's raised a total of about $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch isn't used to losing elections, or even being involved in
a close race. His toughest Senate re-election fight came in 1982,
when he captured 58 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a car phone on Wednesday, Hatch said he'd be
content to finish anywhere but last in Iowa. And if a campaign
funded ``not by fat cats, but by skinny cats'' can catch fire, what
a terrific thing for politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not up here driving through five inches of snow in
northern Iowa for nothing,'' he said. ``But if people examine all
the candidates and decide they don't want me for president, I can
live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The schoolchildren in Des Moines liked Hatch so much, several
surrounded him and asked for his autograph. ``To Jennifer,'' he
wrote for the girl who escorted him down the halls. ``You're a good
person. Always do what's right. Love, Orrin Hatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Feerick, a campaign volunteer from Minneapolis, said under
his breath, ``Too bad they can't vote.''

AMERICAN CENTURY ALLOWS NONTRADITIONAL FAMILY MEMBERS ON HEALTH
PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Century Investments took a brave step this month in
providing a new health insurance benefit to its employees _ so
brave that its underwriter declines to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The new benefit at the Kansas City-based mutual fund, brokerage
and investment company allows workers to include one nontraditional
household member in their employer-subsidized health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't have or need to include a spouse in their
coverage, the new Plus One plan lets them include a sibling, an
in-law, a domestic partner or even a live-in nanny in their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo to American Century for recognizing that ``family'' means
different things to different people at different times.
</P>
<P>
   American Century employees cannot include both a spouse and a
``nontraditional'' adult dependent. It's a choice. Therefore, the
company's overall health insurance costs aren't expected to rise
more than 1 to 2 percent, according to actuarial studies.
</P>
<P>
   Plus One may be in the vanguard of health insurance changes, but
it's not unique. Bank of America also allows employees to include a
dependent adult instead of a spouse in their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   One American Century employee has signed up his father-in-law,
who didn't have any health-care coverage. Another worker included
her sister, who is living with her and serving as her children's
nanny.
</P>
<P>
   American Century's benefits manager, Susie Rawlings, said the
company intended to do this for several years but was stymied by an
inability to find an underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Even underwriters that had been involved in insuring domestic
partners were nervous about this largely untested coverage and
didn't want publicity until there was a financial history.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the program has eligibility requirements. In the
first month, only 40 of American Century's 3,000 employees signed
up for it. But the company deserves credit for understanding that
employees do not live cookie-cutter lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the most pressing ``family'' need _ the one that most
affects a worker's peace of mind and ability to work _ deals with
the medical needs of someone other than a spouse or child.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, in many dual-income families, both husband and wife
have health insurance through their own employers. If a wife
doesn't need to put her husband on her policy, she may want to add
another adult (perhaps an adult child) who lives in the household
but has no group insurance.
</P>
<P>
   American Century, which is on Fortune magazine's ``100 Best
Companies to Work For'' list, eventually found an insurance partner
to underwrite its Plus One plan. I can't tell you who it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, trailblazing has uncertain outcomes, and it's easier
to lie low until public opinion and financial results are known.
Staying anonymous is a safe, conservative choice.
</P>
<P>
   But kudos to American Century and Bank of America for providing
and publicizing a benefit that will help attract and keep workers.
That's how companies get on ``best places to work'' lists.

KANSAS BILL WOULD REQUIRE POLICE TO LOG RACE OF MOTORISTS THEY
STOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ The Kansas Legislature is stepping into a simmering
national debate over whether police officers pay closer attention
to minorities when deciding to make traffic stops and other routine
searches.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill proposed Wednesday, Kansas law enforcement agencies
would have to gather and disclose information about the racial
characteristics of drivers they pull over. The goal is to determine
whether officers treat minority motorists differently than white
motorists _ a practice commonly called racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced racial profiling exists in Kansas and other
states,'' said Rep. David Haley, a Kansas City, Kan., Democrat who
helped prepare the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Proof, he acknowledged, is elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to find out if there's a problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about racial profiling have been asked for years.
Minority drivers, convinced they're more susceptible to speeding
tickets than non-minorities, may use another term _ DWB, driving
while black.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies often deny they do things that way.
Frequently, however, hard statistics aren't available to show what
really goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The bill before the Legislature would provide some answers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Highway Patrol doesn't oppose the bill, said Sgt.
John Eichkorn, a spokesman for the patrol. In fact, he said, he
wants to see data about Highway Patrol traffic stops just as Haley
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to have that information,'' he said. ``We don't
believe there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill reflects a growing nationwide controversy, as
allegations crop up in state after state about minority drivers
being stopped allegedly because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   The issue drew prominent attention in New Jersey, where
minorities charged that state police practiced racial profiling
along the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Connecticut have passed laws that require
police to track the racial and ethnic backgrounds of motorists
stopped by officers, and other states are considering such
measures. No similar bill has surfaced in the Missouri General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Laws on the issue have been proposed in Congress. And in June,
President Clinton, who called the practice of racial profiling
``morally indefensible,'' ordered federal law enforcement agencies
to compile statistics on the race of those singled out for routine
searches, such as traffic stops and border inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has even crept into the campaign for the Democratic
nomination for president. On Monday, Vice President Al Gore and
former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley exchanged sharp words about the issue
during a debate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Eichkorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol said troopers do not take
race into account when they decide to pull over a driver for
speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the patrol studied people it arrested for drug
offenses in 1997 and 1998. About 14 percent were black, while half
the others were white and half were Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill proposed Wednesday, authorities would have to
record information about the race, color, ethnicity, gender and age
of those stopped for traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   Also required would be information about the location of the
traffic stop, the nature of the alleged violation and the
disposition of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies such as the Highway Patrol, city police
departments and county sheriff's offices would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, they would have to send traffic-stop data to the
Kansas attorney general, who would then review the data and report
to the governor and Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol already gathers at least some of the
information required by the bill. But the information isn't
computerized and easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike O'Neal, a Hutchinson Republican who is chairman of the

   It's not certain whether racial profiling occurs in Kansas, he

<P>
   ``I haven't heard it's a problem,'' said O'Neal, who confers

<P>
   Cost probably will be cited as a reason not to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol, already operating on a tight budget, would
have to assign staff to computerize traffic-stop data.
</P>
<P>
   Local police departments, depending on what data they collect
about their traffic stops, would also face additional costs,
perhaps substantial.
</P>
<P>
   State officials will study how much the bill would cost. The
expense estimates, O'Neal predicted, ``will choke a horse.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The more he listened to NFL owners recommending former Washington
Redskins general manager Charley Casserly, the more impressed Bob
McNair became.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending a record $700 million to bring the NFL back to
Houston, McNair knew he couldn't afford to make a mistake when
hiring someone to run the football side of his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, who spent 22 seasons (1977-98) with the Redskins
before new owner Daniel Snyder fired him last preseason, wowed
McNair with his preparation, organization and dedication during
several telephone conversations and two long interviews in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When Casserly was introduced as the executive vice
president/general manager of the NFL's latest expansion entry at a
news conference Wednesday, it was easy to see how McNair could be
so impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll start to work tomorrow,'' Casserly said after signing a
five-year contract. ``We want to get this thing up and running as
soon as possible so we can start scouting. Houston will be at the
(Indianapolis scouting) combine (Feb. 24-28).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to hire a couple of administrative assistants and two
secretaries, plus a couple of interns. We have to get the computers
up and running so we can monitor league activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, 50, is a workaholic whose passion and enthusiasm for
football are contagious. Although he was involved at every level on
the personnel side of the Redskins operation, including negotiating
contracts and serving on NFL committees, his specialty is scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My challenge to Charley is to hire the best scouting staff
possible,'' McNair said. ``I agree with Charley on the importance
of scouting. We're long-term thinkers, and we know it's going to
take some time to get the team where we want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly announced Wednesday that the unnamed team will be a
member of the BLESTO scouting combine, rather than National.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts of NFL scouts expire after the draft, which means
Casserly will have to wait until late April at the earliest to
begin hiring his. Depending on who is available, Casserly can fill
every scouting position, or he can keep a couple vacant until after
the 2001 draft.
</P>
<P>
   McNair and Casserly are talking about the size of the scouting
staff and how many directors they will have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we want to start scouting right away is that
statistics show that 70 percent of the players drafted each year
are cut within four years,'' Casserly said. ``Ten percent of those
cut continue playing with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means 80 percent of this year's draft will be cut, and
we're going to have a shot at them, either because they've been cut
or they become unrestricted free agents when their contracts
expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go anywhere and everywhere. People around the
country are going to get sick of seeing scouts from Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair was the main reason Casserly signed with Houston rather
than agree to formal interviews with the Steelers and Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob's committed to running a first-class organization, and he
wants to build a winner,'' Casserly said. ``His philosophy is to
spend a lot of money to get the best possible people. We're not
going to waste money, but we know that you get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to be knocking down doors to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly plans to use the draft and free agency to build the
team. He has a huge advantage with an expansion team because he can
start from scratch with the salary cap at a time when most teams
are limited severely by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take advantage of both, but the foundation is
still the draft,'' he said. ``But it would be wrong to ignore the
free-agent market.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Redskins, Casserly experienced success and failure in
the draft and free agency, but he left Washington in such
outstanding shape that it won the NFC East this season and advanced
to the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the way I left the Redskins,'' he said. ``I
left them with an outstanding quarterback (Brad Johnson) and three
No. 1 picks (this year). Hey, I'd like to take over a team like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he knew he was going to be looking for a new job once
the Redskins' sale to Daniel Snyder was completed in the offseason,
Casserly's objective to do what was best for the team never
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew every day I went to work, I was fired,'' he said.
``When Dan Snyder officially took over the team, it was a matter if
I left then or in six months. I wanted to go then, so I could look
for another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other NFL personnel people, Casserly cautions fans about
getting so excited that they think Houston's expansion team will
have the early success of Carolina and Jacksonville rather than
stumble out of the gate like Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fundamental difference in that there won't be as
many quality players available,'' Casserly said. ``When the
Panthers and Jaguars were starting, teams hadn't really figured out
free agency. Now, teams are doing a better job of signing their
best players to long-term deals.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said Wednesday that the general manager was the most
important hire, followed by the head coach and quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to think seriously about hiring the head coach a
year from now,'' Casserly said, even though the team doesn't start
playing until the 2002 season. ``Bob will hire the head coach with
input from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I have the same philosophy. Our first choice is to
have someone who's been successful as a head coach in the NFL or as
a head coach in college. I don't think there's any such thing as an
offensive head coach or a defensive head coach. The No. 1 thing I
look for is leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the quarterback, you shouldn't force the issue. If
you have a chance to draft a franchise quarterback, I think the
ideal situation is to also sign a veteran quarterback who'll be
like a coach on the field. If there's not a quarterback worth that
pick, trade the pick or draft another player.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT'S about starting from the ground up and having someone at your
side who knows what it's like to get dirt under his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Just like you know.
</P>
<P>
   It's about starting with nothing, not even a name, and having
someone nearby who shares your vision of beauty even when others
see only a blank canvas.
</P>
<P>
   It's about taking chances and realizing that for every one
victory there will be two setbacks, but having someone nearby who,
like you, trusts his instincts because that's what has carried him
this far.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Bob McNair borrowed $2,000, leased a delivery
truck and opened his first business. Today, he is a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Charley Casserly, then a schoolteacher, knocked
on legendary Redskins coach George Allen's door until his knuckles
ached. He finally earned a job with the Redskins as an unpaid
intern in 1977 and lived at the YMCA for $8 a night. Today, he owns
three Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why it didn't take McNair long to make Casserly
the first general manager of Houston's new NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In Casserly, McNair sees something that bears a strong
resemblance to what he sees in the mirror every day. Casserly is
McNair's alter ego of sorts, someone who has done everything in
football that McNair has done in business.
</P>
<P>
   This match should work, but don't call it a match made in
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It's a match made from so many shared experiences scratching in
the dirt and clawing to the top of their respective fields. McNair
and Casserly share not just the same dream but remarkably similar
backgrounds. And already there seems to be a trust forming between
the two that you'd never find in a resume.
</P>
<P>
   Such relationships are vital within any NFL franchise, but
perhaps more so with one that doesn't yet have so much as a chin
strap to its name, whatever that name might be.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust and incompatibility have splintered so many owner-GM
relationships before, including Casserly's with Redskins owner
Daniel Snyder last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew every day I went to work, I was fired,'' Casserly said
of his final Redskins experience. ``When Dan Snyder officially took
over the team, it was a matter if I left then or in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   To McNair's good fortune, Casserly left then and was available
now. Casserly never clicked with Snyder, the brazen one they call
``Kid Owner'' in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But such should not be the case with Casserly's new boss. Like
McNair, Casserly is meticulously organized. When Casserly arrived
at McNair's office almost two weeks ago for his first face-to-face
meeting with Houston's NFL owner, he had under his arm detailed
manuals that outlined every aspect of his plan for building
Houston's team.
</P>
<P>
   From draft strategies to future free-agent possibilities,
coaching prospects and philosophies on building the football
organization, Casserly outlined his vision for McNair.
</P>
<P>
   McNair was blown away by Casserly's attention to detail. He then
made some calls to NFL insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Among those singing Casserly's praises were former Redskins
coach Joe Gibbs, former Jets coach Bill Parcells, Giants owner
Wellington Mara and Steelers owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming response was that Charley demands respect in
the NFL,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, like McNair, also is less than flashy but hardly
bland. He answers questions directly and prides himself on
professionalism, preparedness and checking his ego at the door.
</P>
<P>
   He won't wow you with pizazz. But if the McNair-Casserly plan
works, he won't have to.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hard-working, direct style that carried Casserly from
intern to Super Bowl and had the Saints and Jets also courting his
services this month.
</P>
<P>
   It was Casserly who hired Norv Turner for the Redskins in 1994,
then promptly discarded older players as he began overhauling the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly certainly made some draft mistakes along the way, most
notably selecting quarterback Heath Shuler out of Tennessee. And
ultimately, he fell out of favor with the new kid owner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Redskins were again in the playoffs this season, and it
was Casserly who acquired quarterback Brad Johnson, running back
Stephen Davis, receiver Michael Westbrook and cornerback Champ
Bailey. Casserly's deals also brought Washington three No. 1 picks
in the upcoming NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The man knows what it's like to start with nothing but a dream.
So does McNair.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the start of a beautiful friendship.

A FIRST STEP FOR MARTIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIAN WELLS _ To his immense relief, Casey Martin didn't shoot
the temperature on a warm, windless Wednesday at the Bob Hope
Classic. He didn't whiff with his 3-wood at the first tee or push
any shot farther right than Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's first official round as a card-carrying member of the
PGA Tour was a solid, if not scintillating, 4-under-par 68 at
Indian Wells Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   He missed only two fairways, but struggled with greens that were
harder to read than the fine print in a contract. His confidence
over putts deserted him, which is par for any course in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   On the back nine, Olin Browne, who played directly behind
Martin, used the occasion of one of the interminable, inevitable
logjams that dragged out Wednesday's round to ask how his fellow
pro was faring.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Martin had missed a three-foot par putt on his second
hole and too many birdie attempts to mention, Browne nodded
sympathetically. ``Join the club,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browne, between swigs of water, explained it takes a few days to
adjust to the vagaries of the greens on the different courses and
that rookies such as Martin, who are seeing the tournament layouts
for the first time, are at a marked disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Great. That's all Martin needs; another handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's quandary is that time is like golf's more hardened
traditionalists: It is decidedly not on his side.
</P>
<P>
   His right leg has been rendered so brittle as a result of a
congenital circulatory problem that constricts blood flow, his
doctors worry one day he is going to take a step and his leg will
snap like a twig. With Martin, it's not a question of if he's going
to lose his leg but when.
</P>
<P>
   Given how rushed he feels to groove his game, it's a small
wonder Martin didn't drive his cart into the foursome in front of
him on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's fighting a time bomb of sorts,'' said Martin's
father King. ``He wants to have positive experiences early because
he knows, realistically, he's not going to be out here a long time
no matter how he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It'd be bad enough if the only sound Martin heard was his own
physiological clock ticking. But he also has to try to tune out all
the strident voices of people who are quick to nit-pick his
performance, holding every missed putt or imperfect swing against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are quick to critique Casey,'' King Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't just an overprotective father talking. We heard it
ourselves, following Martin around outside the gallery ropes.
</P>
<P>
   When he drove a couple feet left of the fairway on his second
hole, someone said the way he sprays his shots, it's a good thing
he gets to use a cart.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin missed a two-foot birdie putt on his third hole, one
man remarked to another that he doesn't appear to have the putting
stroke to succeed at this level.
</P>
<P>
   On it went for nearly five hours, this eyeing of Martin's game
through some invisible magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   All we can say is being rich and retired must mean never having
to consider how your own work would have held up under the same
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame more people _ besides the reporters who made up the
majority of his gallery _ didn't check out Martin's PGA Tour debut.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard not to slip into a sympathy limp, watching Martin
lumber the 92 steps from the 10th green to the 11th tee. The fact
is, between green and tee, golf remains for Martin a good walk
spoiled by his obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few holes where Martin could have sat his aching
leg down in his cart after hitting off the tee. He chose instead to
stand and engage in small talk with his playing partners. To a man,
they later would describe Martin, 27, as a gentleman and a joy to
be paired with.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy to win over his fellow touring pros.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour can be as cruel and cliquish a place as high
school. It is an environment where friendships often are forged or
forgotten on the basis of one's ranking on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   There are players who get bent out of shape when someone else
gets a better courtesy car. We shudder to think how they feel about
Martin being a media magnet before he posts a top-10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, for his part, is doing his best to throw the media off
his scent. He shifted uncomfortably when surrounded by reporters
after his round and said it makes him uneasy getting the amount of
attention ``that only a handful of guys have to deal with and most
of them are exceptional at the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin dearly wants to belong. His father's most fervent hope is
he is given a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how much it means to him to be accepted in this
setting,'' King Martin said. ``My biggest hope for him is he can
get to the point where he's really not an outcast, even though he's
suing the PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's 68 was a step in the right direction. A few more rounds
like that and his ball-striking will be what people remember, not
his disability. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving to open the radio airwaves to hundreds of
small broadcasters, the federal government is planning to approve
rules to allow educational, religious and community groups to run
inexpensive low-power FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of the nation's largest broadcasters, the
Federal Communications Commission is expected on Thursday to adopt
licensing rules that will permit the addition of noncommercial
stations with broadcasting circles as much as seven miles in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say the rules, proposed a year ago, hold
great promise to transform the airwaves at a time when the rise of
broadcasting conglomerates has sharply reduced the diversity of
voices. Such low-power station licenses have not been issued for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will bring many new voices to the airwaves that have not
had an outlet for expression, and it happens at a time when the
radio business has consolidated in very dramatic fashion,'' said
William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struck by the outpouring of interest on this issue
as I've talked to people around the country,'' he added. ``From
cops and clergy and community groups of all kinds. Local
governments, Indian tribes and a whole range of subcultures, such
as the Creole community in Florida, zydeco fans in New Orleans, and
others who would love to have an outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest broadcasters have fought to block the rules
through intensive lobbying and legislation, asserting that the
so-called micro-radio stations could create interference for
established stations in the form of static or distorted signals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the National Association of Broadcasters, the
industry's trade group, failed to delay the commission's vote, it
issued a statement vowing to ``aggressively seek ways to undo the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the association said on Wednesday that they were
considering seeking a court order to strike down the new rules.
``In our view this comes down to one issue: interference,'' Dennis
Wharton, a spokesman, said. ``If tens of thousands of people cannot
hear their hometown radio station, it's hard to understand how this
benefits the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has come up with a way to confound the law of
physics,'' he added. ``We've documented in an unassailable case
that this will result in additional interference on already crowded
airways.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC studies have concluded that the airwaves in the nation's
three biggest markets _ New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ are so
crowded that the commission cannot issue any licenses for 100-watt
stations, which could cover a broadcast area seven miles in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the FCC are studying whether smaller 10-watt
stations, with a range of two to four miles, could be licensed in
those markets.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said FCC studies had convinced him that the new rules
would not lead to any significant new interference. He said that
some broadcasters had told the commission that they were as
concerned about losing their own listeners as about interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't see this as a threat,'' he said of the
broadcasters. ``As I envision this, the broadcasters will have a
whole new pool of talent they can incubate, and since these will
all be noncommercial stations, there will be no threat that they
will be going after the same advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   While normally a formidable lobbying force, the National
Association of Broadcasters, which represents the nation's largest
broadcast networks and station groups, was beaten at the commission
by a grass-roots coalition of churches, schools, musicians,
municipalities and ``pirate'' radio stations that billed itself as
a kind of civil rights movement intending to democratize the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of the FCC's move, who produced their own
engineering studies showing no significant interference would
result, included musicians like Bonnie Raitt and the Indigo Girls,
the U.S. Catholic Conference and the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 colleges and universities have licenses to operate
10-watt stations under rules that were repealed more than 20 years
ago but permitted these stations to continue broadcasting. About
140 colleges have stations that are unable to broadcast on FM
frequencies because of current restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the spectrum available for low-power
stations would not be parceled out through auctions, as frequencies
for the larger stations are. Instead, FCC officials will award
licenses based on a group's ties to the local community the station
would serve.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rules do not go as far as many supporters of
low-power radio had sought, supporters expressed excitement. ``This
clearly will be the most significant opportunity in decades for
community groups, educational institutions, religious organizations
and local governments,'' said Michael Bracy, executive director of
the Low-Power Radio Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said it was impossible to know how many
station applications would be submitted, though they and industry
experts predicted at least many hundreds, and possibly a thousand
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has received tens of thousands of letters seeking
low-power radio rules, including ones from the New School in New
York, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III of the Abyssinian Church of
Harlem, students from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and
Kevin McGaughey, the principal of Brookland High School in
Brookland, Ark., a town of 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any stations serving our community alone,''
McGaughey said today from Brookland. ``I'm just looking for an
opportunity to bring the school and the community closer
together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since an antenna tower _ the most costly item for a high-power
radio station _ is not required for broadcasting at 10 or 100
watts, the new stations can be established for as little as $1,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to defuse the issue of radio interference and avoid
court challenges, the commission scaled back its original proposal
to license stations broadcasting with a maximum of 1,000 watts,
which could broadcast over 18 miles. Though the government had also
initially contemplated commercial and noncommercial stations, the
final rules will permit only noncommercial stations. And they will
require at least three frequency intervals on the radio dial
between a low-power station and another station, rather than the
two intervals initially suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has decided to take a very conservative technical
approach,'' said Cheryl A. Leanza, deputy director of the Media
Access Project, a Washington group that promotes diversity of the
airwaves. ``This proposal cannot be criticized for harming the
broadcasters.''

SONICS GETTING SMARTER, BUT SO ARE ABSENT FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning six games in a row, including triumphs over the Spurs
and Lakers, has left the Sonics just a couple of games behind their
1996 pace that took them to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Always eccentric and occasionally electric, this group has one
thing going for it that is not often said of most NBA teams: Week
by week, the Sonics seem to be getting a little smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer foolish shots. More defensive awareness. Better use of
talent. They have yet to lose to a team with a sub-.500 record.
</P>
<P>
   The points are mentioned as a public service because eyewitness
accounts of these developments are increasingly rare.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have the NBA's fourth-worst attendance (15,474
average).
</P>
<P>
   That's just the paid count. KeyArena's empty-seat acreage
indicates a lot of ticketholders can't give their tickets away.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example was Tuesday, when the club claimed 13,326 in
paid attendance, a figure that looked generous by about 2,000.
While Cleveland at 16-21 is hardly a glam outfit, it does have
Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The former Seattle hero heard applause and heckles that barely
qualified as a smattering. The event had the zip of an Al Gore
concert.
</P>
<P>
   The decline isn't unique to Seattle. NBA attendance is down
nearly 10 percent. But when a place accustomed to sellouts suddenly
finds itself barely ahead of bottom feeders Vancouver (15,391),
Golden State (15,317) and the L.A. Clippers (15,217), the Sonics
are in serious hurt.
</P>
<P>
   As if that insult weren't enough for the franchise, embarrassing
national injury was added Tuesday when the Supreme Court let stand
a $7.4 million judgment against the Sonics and owner Barry Ackerley
for being a grinch of an employer.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerley refused to pay overtime to a group of Sonics ticket
sellers, who were fired around Christmas 1994 for pursuing their
rights. At the trial in Seattle federal court, the jury said club
management's ``conduct was malicious or in reckless disregard'' of
the former employees' rights, and made Barry, as well as his son,
Bill, personally liable, along with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of ex-Ackerley employees around town undoubtedly cheered
the news that someone finally got a piece of a guy whose
belligerence and litigiousness is his civic legacy. But the massive
hit charged against the Sonics' corporate entity, Full House
Entertainment, cannot bode well.
</P>
<P>
   While it will be claimed that the damages have nothing to do
with the team, the fact is the basketball operation seems destined
to lose money for a second consecutive year, following the lockout
debacle that reduced the 1998-99 season to 25 home games, as well
as no playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Losing money again, for a franchise that has delivered more
consistent sports entertainment than any other in the market, is
the sign of bad management, locally and nationally, as well as a
decaying product.
</P>
<P>
   The management problem is not just employee-rights abuse. The
Sonics and all NBA teams operate under a new collective bargaining
agreement. The downside includes giving long-term, guaranteed
contracts at maximum values to young veterans vulnerable to flops
for non-health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   That was the riskiest aspect of last summer's $87 million deal
for Vin Baker following an abysmal season. Although Baker has
picked up his game considerably, his occasional disappearances
haunt the Sonics because so much is invested in him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rules allowed president Wally Walker no real choice.
Each one of Walker's peers would have made the same decision. But
that doesn't reduce a basketball follower's sense of grievously
misplaced reward.
</P>
<P>
   When fans see the Sonics pick up free agents such as Billy
Owens, a mediocre player who can't even stay in shape to earn his
millions, the disaffection is compounded. When a popular,
successful, colorful coach such as George Karl is cashiered for
reasons not obvious to the average customer, alienation takes root,
and doesn't go away with a one-point win over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the capper comes when teams raise ticket prices to witness
this distortion of what was once America's hottest game.
</P>
<P>
   The league's average ticket price increased this season 13.8
percent to $48.37, excluding suites, according to Team Marketing
Report of Chicago. That's American sports' highest, outstripping
the gouge from the NHL ($45.70) and NFL ($45.63).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' average price is $64.60, behind only the Knicks and
Lakers. Although the Sonics dispute a part of the calculation, that
doesn't change the jaw-dropping fact that middle-class fans are
being asked to pay $60 to see the current NBA, particularly after
its surreal underbelly was exposed by the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout gave labor-cost certainty to the owners, and
guaranteed lifetime security to players. The fans received neither
cost certainty nor the security the game would go on as it once
did.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sonics on the KeyArena floor are getting smarter and
better, the franchise and league have gone the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The one perversely redeeming aspect is that fans have finally
registered their feelings the only way available to them _ by
becoming non-fans.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Since the collapse of the Japanese ``bubble'' economy,
many Japanese businessmen have taken a beating, but none quite so
literally as Akira Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was the owner of a small restaurant and an
electrical business in Tokyo. But falling business and debts forced
him to seek alternative means of making money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hareruya, 36, spends his nights in Tokyo's seediest
district, Kabukicho, as Japan's first human punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   For 1,000 yen (roughly $10), anyone who wishes can physically
assault him for one minute. Depending on the weather, he makes as
much as 30,000 yen ($300) a night.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evenings, just before 9 p.m., Hareruya takes up his
regular position next to a famous theatre in Kabukicho. A friend
holds the stopwatch to time the designated minute. Another helper
is on hand in case excited or over-refreshed punters get out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Hareruya, a former professional boxer who once ranked 17th in
Japan, dons his gloves and protective mask, and plays the recorded
message that announces his presence: ``Hit me as much as you want!
Rest assured I never hit back... Roll up, roll up.''
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour the first customer arrives, a drunk who
proves incapable of penetrating Hareruya's parrying hands. The
second man is more of a challenge _ like 90 percent of punters, he
is an amateur martial artist, keen to test his skills on a live
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first customer is the most important,'' says Hareruya.
``Once one person has done it, then everyone wants to have a go.
Sometimes I have 15 people queuing up in line.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the human punching bag works as a freelance
electrician. His current commission is a discotheque called Club T,
which he is rewiring.
</P>
<P>
   Business has never been Hareruya's strong point, hence his
disastrous accumulation of debts. ``I'm too kind, that's my
problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too generous. When it comes to business I'm just stupid,
and in the end the debts got so bad that I couldn't support my wife
and kids. The restaurant and the electrics weren't enough, so I
decided to go back to my old skill, which is boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend evenings, when the money and alcohol flow most freely,
are the busiest time of the week for the human punching bag _ one
Saturday, he took on 55 punters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stayed here all night,'' he says, ``I could get a hundred
customers. But it's impossible _ you get so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., or earlier, he retires to an all-night noodle shop to
nurse his bruises. In general, his headgear and footwork protect
him from injury, but in the space of a year he has been to hospital
twice, once with a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've only been knocked down twice, both times by martial
arts experts, and no one has ever KO'd me,'' he says, rather
proudly. ``This is the legend of Akira Hareruya: he never gives up
and he never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to pay off his debts, Hareruya works seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   At first he kept his new line of work a secret from his family,
but they saw a feature about him on television. ``When my kids
found out what I was doing they cried,'' he says. ``They still cry
when I speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he lives for most of the time with a friend, and
rarely goes home. The last time he saw his wife was on their
wedding anniversary, six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday, the human punching bag received a visit from
the local police. ``They ask me if I have a permit, and obviously
I'm not going to get a permit for something like this,'' he says.
``So they ask me to leave, and I pack it in for that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police know me and, because I cooperate, they know I'm all
right. They only act when they've had a complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Brazilian football team Palmeiras lost one-nil
to Manchester United in the final of the Toyota Cup, held in Tokyo.
The streets were full of football fans, some of whom patronize
Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was a good fighter,'' said Hareruya. ``Bam! Bam!
he came in hard. But he was no match for Akira Hareruya.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it rained and Hareruya stayed in. He spoke on the
phone to his wife who told him, as she always does, that they have
no money. ``I told her, `Please be patient. I will do my best.' I
told her I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to his children, who cry when they speak to him.
``Please stop this, Dad. Take care of yourself.'' &QL;

   TOKYO _ Since the collapse of the Japanese ``bubble'' economy,
many Japanese businessmen have taken a beating, but none quite so
literally as Akira Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was the owner of a small restaurant and an
electrical business in Tokyo. But falling business and debts forced
him to seek alternative means of making money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hareruya, 36, spends his nights in Tokyo's seediest
district, Kabukicho, as Japan's first human punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   For 1,000 yen (roughly $10), anyone who wishes can physically
assault him for one minute. Depending on the weather, he makes as
much as 30,000 yen ($300) a night.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evenings, just before 9 p.m., Hareruya takes up his
regular position next to a famous theatre in Kabukicho. A friend
holds the stopwatch to time the designated minute. Another helper
is on hand in case excited or over-refreshed punters get out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Hareruya, a former professional boxer who once ranked 17th in
Japan, dons his gloves and protective mask, and plays the recorded
message that announces his presence: ``Hit me as much as you want!
Rest assured I never hit back... Roll up, roll up.''
</P>
<P>
   Within half an hour the first customer arrives, a drunk who
proves incapable of penetrating Hareruya's parrying hands. The
second man is more of a challenge _ like 90 percent of punters, he
is an amateur martial artist, keen to test his skills on a live
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first customer is the most important,'' says Hareruya.
``Once one person has done it, then everyone wants to have a go.
Sometimes I have 15 people queuing up in line.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the human punching bag works as a freelance
electrician. His current commission is a discotheque called Club T,
which he is rewiring.
</P>
<P>
   Business has never been Hareruya's strong point, hence his
disastrous accumulation of debts. ``I'm too kind, that's my
problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too generous. When it comes to business I'm just stupid,
and in the end the debts got so bad that I couldn't support my wife
and kids. The restaurant and the electrics weren't enough, so I
decided to go back to my old skill, which is boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend evenings, when the money and alcohol flow most freely,
are the busiest time of the week for the human punching bag _ one
Saturday, he took on 55 punters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stayed here all night,'' he says, ``I could get a hundred
customers. But it's impossible _ you get so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 a.m., or earlier, he retires to an all-night noodle shop to
nurse his bruises. In general, his headgear and footwork protect
him from injury, but in the space of a year he has been to hospital
twice, once with a broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've only been knocked down twice, both times by martial
arts experts, and no one has ever KO'd me,'' he says, rather
proudly. ``This is the legend of Akira Hareruya: he never gives up
and he never dies.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to pay off his debts, Hareruya works seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   At first he kept his new line of work a secret from his family,
but they saw a feature about him on television. ``When my kids
found out what I was doing they cried,'' he says. ``They still cry
when I speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he lives for most of the time with a friend, and
rarely goes home. The last time he saw his wife was on their
wedding anniversary, six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Monday, the human punching bag received a visit from
the local police. ``They ask me if I have a permit, and obviously
I'm not going to get a permit for something like this,'' he says.
``So they ask me to leave, and I pack it in for that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police know me and, because I cooperate, they know I'm all
right. They only act when they've had a complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Brazilian football team Palmeiras lost one-nil
to Manchester United in the final of the Toyota Cup, held in Tokyo.
The streets were full of football fans, some of whom patronize
Hareruya.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was a good fighter,'' said Hareruya. ``Bam! Bam!
he came in hard. But he was no match for Akira Hareruya.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it rained and Hareruya stayed in. He spoke on the
phone to his wife who told him, as she always does, that they have
no money. ``I told her, `Please be patient. I will do my best.' I
told her I was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to his children, who cry when they speak to him.
``Please stop this, Dad. Take care of yourself.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cathee Shultz doesn't have a normal healthy
interest in death. She is, you might say, a little obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   She corresponds with serial killers. She collects autopsy
photographs of car wreck victims. She has a dead Afghan for a pet
dog (stuffed, of course).
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, death has also _ if you'll pardon the
expression _ been her livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Together with her artist husband, J.D. Healy, she has run a
creepy little outfit called the Museum of Death, offering a
showcase for such collected spoils as antique mortician's tools,
Charles Manson's baseball bat, an electric chair specially
constructed for a cover photo on Death Row Magazine, and a montage
of body bags in every color of the rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall thing is to make people happy to be alive,''
Shultz likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Until Halloween night last year the museum was based in a former
mortuary in the heart of downtown San Diego _ a rather offbeat
attraction among the trendy bars and restaurants of the city's
heavily renovated Gaslamp Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was a particularly creepy mortuary, one that
coexisted for a long time with a brothel up on the next floor, and
one where a former employee, still believed to haunt the premises,
committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, the bullet
popping out of an eye and lodging in the roof beams.
</P>
<P>
   Until Halloween, Shultz and Healy went about their business and
as only they know how. They were in negotiations to buy a Bible
belonging to Andrew Cunanan, the gay serial killer best known as
the man who bumped off Gianni Versace.
</P>
<P>
   They kept an eye out for possible additions to their Freak Farm,
a display of deformed animals, both living and dead, including an
eight-legged piglet and a two-headed turtle they call Heckle and
Jeckle.
</P>
<P>
   But then something a little unexpected happened. Not quite a
bump in the night, although there certainly were a few knocks on
the door. Something that some of the more uneasy members of the San
Diego community might have said they had coming to them. Or maybe
it was sheer bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the autumn, Shultz had been looking forward to an
auction of items from the Heaven's Gate suicide cult, the 39 people
who became convinced that the Hale-Bopp comet of a couple of years
ago was calling them to heaven and promptly did away with
themselves in a large house in the San Diego suburbs by overdosing
on barbiturates sweetened with vodka and apple sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz and Healy already owned a few choice items from the
tragedy _ various pairs of Nike sneakers, a collection of purple
shrouds, a bottle of phenobarbital and a small container of apple
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, they were hoping to bid for one of the 19 bunk
beds where the cult members perished. (They eventually bought a
white one for $130).
</P>
<P>
   In her enthusiasm, Shultz talked to various journalists about
her plans for a special Heaven's Gate exhibit, complete with male
and female mannequins mimicking the cult's black uniforms and
``Away Team'' patches.
</P>
<P>
   And that was where the problem began.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity reached the ear of the museum building's
proprietors just as they was contemplating a sale to take advantage
of the Gaslamp Quarter's rising prices. And they were not at all
sure a Museum of Death generated the right kind of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a number of comments from various different people
that this occupancy in the building was detracting from its
value,'' John Day, a partner in the company that owns the building,
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And so Shultz and Healy were evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Being positive, forward-thinking people, it wasn't long before
they had an alternative game plan. Where could a self-respecting
Museum of Death move to? There was, of course, only one answer: to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on Jan. 1, in the shell of a defunct Mexican restaurant
on Hollywood Boulevard, the museum was resurrected. Being in
Hollywood, it is naturally bigger and better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz is friends with Kenneth Anger, author of the definitive
scandal catalogue ``Hollywood Babylon,'' and hopes to up the
celebrity death element quite considerably, though she is not
revealing specifics for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one might think of the tastefulness of it all, the
ghoulish couple cannot be accused of lacking a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Although only in their mid-30s, they already have plans for
their own demise. Shultz wants to be mummified and put on display
in her own museum. Healy wants to be pickled in a jar of
formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   As Shultz says: ``You need to shock people to get their
attention in our society. Death isn't bad. We all do it.'' &QL;

 By PHIL REEVES  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When it comes to turf, Israelis are usually good
with maps, knowing precisely where to pinpoint the battle lines and
disputed occupation zones. But here's a place that they are not so
sure about.
</P>
<P>
   Some say its inhabitants live on a flat stretch along the
Mediterranean coast running north from Tel Aviv to Herzliya. Others
say it is a long, thin triangle, which stretches out from these
centers up into the soft slopes of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They are, perhaps, both right. For ``Silicon Wadi,'' as it is
called, is not so much about geography, as an economic phenomenon _
namely, the evolution of Israel's high-tech industry to become
second only to the Californian valley after which it is named.
</P>
<P>
   The computer high-tech industry in Israel is on fire, fueled by
a stream of well-educated young recruits, equipped with expertise
from time spent in the Israeli army's intelligence or its
engineering corps, and aided by a tide of venture capital, drawn in
by the whiff of crisp new cyber-dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A collection of mouth-watering rags-to-squillions
stories.
</P>
<P>
   For example: when it was founded in 1991 CommTouch, an e-mail
services company, comprised three people operating out of a
farmstead north of Tel Aviv; today it is a public company, with 200
employees, and a valuation of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder, Nahum Shafman, 52 _ whose career has taken him from
Israel army paratrooper, university lecturer, and programmer to
multimillionaire entrepreneur _ went on to set up another company,
``DealTime.com,'' an electronic commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   Although less than two years old, it has already 100 employees
and has nailed $25 million in venture capital. In November it
expanded to the UK and elsewhere in Europe. ``This is only the
beginning,'' Shafman says.
</P>
<P>
   This performance is more than matched by Check Point Software,
founded six years ago by three young men who, fresh out of military
intelligence, began by getting together in their basement near Tel
Aviv for brainstorming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a Internet security company, which is in the top
80 of the world's largest software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mirabilis, whose instant message Internet chat
system was founded by four hippy-ish young men in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 _ after its ICQ site had become the first most visited
Internet Web site (after Yahoo! Netscape and Microsoft), they sold
to America Online for $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   AOL was not sure whether it would make any profits from this
acquisition; it did know, though, that ICQ had what the trade calls
``eyeballs'' _ namely 12 million users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis have compensated for the country's small size,
hostile surroundings, and intense atmosphere with an incredible
propensity for travel,'' marvelled the Jerusalem Post at the time.
``The borderless anonymity of the Internet has been another natural
outlet for Israeli wanderlust.''
</P>
<P>
   The more fertile the Silicon Wadi has become, the more money it
has attracted, generating still more start-ups, still more shekels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, there was only one venture capital company in
Israel,'' said Michael Eisenberg, of Israel Seed Partners in
Jerusalem. ``Getting in to see them was like climbing Mount
Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, venture capitalists have flocked in,
bees to the techno-honeypot.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have invested some $300 million in Israeli
high-tech companies. ``And we are going up, up, up,'' said
Eisenberg, ``We have huge amounts to go.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575, OR CONTINUE TO 750) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Some of Israel's aptitude for computers has been put to more
exotic use than the mere pursuit of lucre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Nir Zigdon, 14, a schoolboy from Tel Aviv, became an
Israeli hero after wiping out an Iraqi site on the Internet,
claiming it contained ``horrible statements about Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so by sending the Iraqis an e-mail in which he claimed to
be a Palestinian who had produced a virus that could wipe out
Israeli Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   This idea so appealed to the Iraqis _ or, so the story goes in
Israel _ that they were lured into opening an infected electronic
attachment which young Nir had sent with his message. This
contained a site-gobbling virus.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his exploits even overshadowed those of another
brilliant young Israeli cyber-delinquent _ 18-year-old Ehud
Tenenbaum, otherwise known as The Analyzer _ who sparked a
worldwide FBI hunt by hacking a path into the Pentagon, NASA, and
the U.S. Navy's research center on submarine warfare. &QL;

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When it comes to turf, Israelis are usually good
with maps, knowing precisely where to pinpoint the battle lines and
disputed occupation zones. But here's a place that they are not so
sure about.
</P>
<P>
   Some say its inhabitants live on a flat stretch along the
Mediterranean coast running north from Tel Aviv to Herzliya. Others
say it is a long, thin triangle, which stretches out from these
centers up into the soft slopes of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   They are, perhaps, both right. For ``Silicon Wadi,'' as it is
called, is not so much about geography, as an economic phenomenon _
namely, the evolution of Israel's high-tech industry to become
second only to the Californian valley after which it is named.
</P>
<P>
   The computer high-tech industry in Israel is on fire, fueled by
a stream of well-educated young recruits, equipped with expertise
from time spent in the Israeli army's intelligence or its
engineering corps, and aided by a tide of venture capital, drawn in
by the whiff of crisp new cyber-dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The result? A collection of mouth-watering rags-to-squillions
stories.
</P>
<P>
   For example: when it was founded in 1991 CommTouch, an e-mail
services company, comprised three people operating out of a
farmstead north of Tel Aviv; today it is a public company, with 200
employees, and a valuation of $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder, Nahum Shafman, 52 _ whose career has taken him from
Israel army paratrooper, university lecturer, and programmer to
multimillionaire entrepreneur _ went on to set up another company,
``DealTime.com,'' an electronic commerce company.
</P>
<P>
   Although less than two years old, it has already 100 employees
and has nailed $25 million in venture capital. In November it
expanded to the UK and elsewhere in Europe. ``This is only the
beginning,'' Shafman says.
</P>
<P>
   This performance is more than matched by Check Point Software,
founded six years ago by three young men who, fresh out of military
intelligence, began by getting together in their basement near Tel
Aviv for brainstorming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a Internet security company, which is in the top
80 of the world's largest software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mirabilis, whose instant message Internet chat
system was founded by four hippy-ish young men in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 _ after its ICQ site had become the first most visited
Internet Web site (after Yahoo! Netscape and Microsoft), they sold
to America Online for $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   AOL was not sure whether it would make any profits from this
acquisition; it did know, though, that ICQ had what the trade calls
``eyeballs'' _ namely 12 million users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis have compensated for the country's small size,
hostile surroundings, and intense atmosphere with an incredible
propensity for travel,'' marvelled the Jerusalem Post at the time.
``The borderless anonymity of the Internet has been another natural
outlet for Israeli wanderlust.''
</P>
<P>
   The more fertile the Silicon Wadi has become, the more money it
has attracted, generating still more start-ups, still more shekels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, there was only one venture capital company in
Israel,'' said Michael Eisenberg, of Israel Seed Partners in
Jerusalem. ``Getting in to see them was like climbing Mount
Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last five years, venture capitalists have flocked in,
bees to the techno-honeypot.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have invested some $300 million in Israeli
high-tech companies. ``And we are going up, up, up,'' said
Eisenberg, ``We have huge amounts to go.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575, OR CONTINUE TO 750) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Some of Israel's aptitude for computers has been put to more
exotic use than the mere pursuit of lucre.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 Nir Zigdon, 14, a schoolboy from Tel Aviv, became an
Israeli hero after wiping out an Iraqi site on the Internet,
claiming it contained ``horrible statements about Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so by sending the Iraqis an e-mail in which he claimed to
be a Palestinian who had produced a virus that could wipe out
Israeli Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   This idea so appealed to the Iraqis _ or, so the story goes in
Israel _ that they were lured into opening an infected electronic
attachment which young Nir had sent with his message. This
contained a site-gobbling virus.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his exploits even overshadowed those of another
brilliant young Israeli cyber-delinquent _ 18-year-old Ehud
Tenenbaum, otherwise known as The Analyzer _ who sparked a
worldwide FBI hunt by hacking a path into the Pentagon, NASA, and
the U.S. Navy's research center on submarine warfare. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The house on Caine Street is no ordinary B and
B. It is not on any San Francisco accommodation agency's list. It
is not in an obviously touristy part of town. There is no sign
outside to advertise its services.
</P>
<P>
   Even the neighbors aren't too sure what goes on there, although
they have an idea it is pretty damn weird.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed a B and B with a difference, as a few of the
house rules make clear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not carry your whips on your hips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Put toys in a bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No loud screaming anywhere anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not touch another person or their toys or their slaves
unless invited.''
</P>
<P>
   As the establishment's owner, a nice-looking middle-aged lady
called Elizabeth, explains to the curious or the simply baffled, B
and B stands not for bed and breakfast _ there is no breakfast _
but for bed and bondage.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly a hotel, of sorts, but one that caters
exclusively to sadomasochist fetishists.
</P>
<P>
   The guests, who come from as far afield as Germany, Switzerland
and South Africa, aren't interested so much in a good base from
which to explore the West Coast's most beautiful city (although
some of the higher rooms do boast good views).
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they come for the Gothic blood-red and purple drapes,
the S and M artwork on the walls, the regular ``scene'' parties and
_ most of all _ the house's basement dungeon with its chains,
crosses, medieval torture devices and cupboard full of sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may look like your grandmother but I'm also kinky. I'm a
sadist. I enjoy inflicting strong sensations on people,'' says
Elizabeth with a big friendly smile. ``Pain is not really bad. It's
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city as tolerant as San Francisco, that's a credo that
has to be followed with a certain discretion. Hence the house rules
_ which also forbid alcohol or drugs on the premises, nudity on the
patio, or anything else that might upset the neighbors or lead to a
criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth loves what she does, but she is also determined nobody
should be coerced into doing anything they feel uncomfortable with.
In her house, rule number one is that No means No.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is: we are not threatening your lifestyle, but we
also don't want you to threaten ours. This is not for everyone. But
it hasn't been declared illegal or taxable by Uncle Sam, or not
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest house, which for legal purposes operates as a private
club, has four bedrooms decked out in a variety of styles, from The
Chamber, with its dark wooden panelling, to The Penthouse, which
has a king-sized water bed and hooks all over the ceiling beams.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow wooden staircase leads down to the Dungeon, which not
only looks like the set of a kinky porn movie, it frequently serves
as the set for kinky porn movies.
</P>
<P>
   A deep-blue circular sheet is thrown over a Catherine Wheel
suspended from the ceiling by thick black chains. On the other side
of the room, an X-shaped St. Andrew's Cross bristles with hooks
where a ``dominant'' can attach his or her ``submissive'' with
fleece-lined leather handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the twice-monthly parties take place (complete
with discount scheme for regular visitors known as a Frequent
Flogger Program). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also where Elizabeth keeps her prized collection of
custom-made whips, canes and a whole host of household and
industrial objects, such as a paddle-ball bat, a wooden pizza tray,
an abalone pounder and an oversized pair of photographic developing
tongs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the toys are custom-made by such local firms as the San
Francisco Whip Company and another S and M supplier called Happy
Tails. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth herself got into the ``scene'' through her second
husband more than 20 years ago (in her first marriage, she played
the role of the traditional housewife and hated it).
</P>
<P>
   After holding parties for years, she bought the house on Caine
Street in 1992 and opened for business the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, she says, has vastly expanded the reach of the S
and M world; her own Web site, called Differences, has 3,000
subscribers from across the world. She herself ``plays'' with a
number of partners, including a Swiss doctor and a policeman from
Wyoming..
</P>
<P>
   Although hers is the world's first known S and M guesthouse, the
phenomenon is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   A fetishist couple in Seattle has opened a room in their house,
as has a professional dominant from Massachusetts with a sideline
interest in cooking gourmet breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene is getting positively upper-middle class now,''
Elizabeth muses. ``We getting gentrified, like everything else.'' &QL;

 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Over 20,000 cats a year are being stolen in France, many
of them ending up as baby's shoes or luxury slippers.
</P>
<P>
   French animal lovers believe that the cat rustling is the work
of professionally organized gangs, who work in almost complete
impunity. Police say they have little time to devote to such a low
profile crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is feared that some of the cats are being stolen to provide
helpless victims to train attack dogs or to amuse their sadistic
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, it is known, are being taken for their fur. A raid
on a tannery in Deux Sevres in western France discovered 1,500 cat
skins, which were being used to make baby's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Vesgien, a cat lover who is herself a magistrate and
president of an association which campaigns for a better legal
status for pets in France and other EU countries, said: ``These
offenses are more and more common and can lead to acts of torture
and terrible acts of barbarity, even if many people seem to find
the whole thing funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move heaven and earth for a stolen car or painting but, in
these cases, nothing is done.''
</P>
<P>
   A Socialist member of parliament and veterinarian, Genevieve
Perrin-Gaillard, is to press for new tougher laws on the

<P>
   PARIS _ Over 20,000 cats a year are being stolen in France, many
of them ending up as baby's shoes or luxury slippers.
</P>
<P>
   French animal lovers believe that the cat rustling is the work
of professionally organized gangs, who work in almost complete
impunity. Police say they have little time to devote to such a low
profile crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is feared that some of the cats are being stolen to provide
helpless victims to train attack dogs or to amuse their sadistic
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Many others, it is known, are being taken for their fur. A raid
on a tannery in Deux Sevres in western France discovered 1,500 cat
skins, which were being used to make baby's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Vesgien, a cat lover who is herself a magistrate and
president of an association which campaigns for a better legal
status for pets in France and other EU countries, said: ``These
offenses are more and more common and can lead to acts of torture
and terrible acts of barbarity, even if many people seem to find
the whole thing funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move heaven and earth for a stolen car or painting but, in
these cases, nothing is done.''
</P>
<P>
   A Socialist member of parliament and veterinarian, Genevieve
Perrin-Gaillard, is to press for new tougher laws on the
identification of cats and dogs in France in an attempt to give
police and judicial authorities more weapons against pet rustlers.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1989 law, all cats and dogs have to be tattooed with
their identity before they can be sold, or given to another person,
but this law has proved impossible to enforce.
</P>

JACKSON WAKES UP KOBE, LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unstoppable or unwatchable, the Lakers are showing
themselves to be a remarkably versatile bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Their 16-game winning streak is a fading memory. Their latest
significant trend, a pair of losses in a recent three-game span.
</P>
<P>
   And for their signature moment Wednesday night -- coach Phil
Jackson giving a very public verbal whipping to young Kobe Bryant
for a critical fourth-quarter turnover, as the Lakers tripped over
themselves while grap pling with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant responded, the Lakers regained their balance, and a
win even tually did follow. There just wasn't much in the 95-86
victory for Jackson, or18,997 fans at Staples Center, to get
excited about.
</P>
<P>
   And on the heels of Monday's home loss to Seattle, there was new
reason to worry about the Lakers' collective health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're diseased,'' Jackson mused. ``We're not at ease
right now. We've got to figure out how we want to play as a
basketball team and get cohesive again. We had real good cohesion
and it worked great for us . We have to get back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   They had it, at least, for stretches of the fourth quarter, when
the La kers -- who trailed for most of three quarters -- outscored
the Cavaliers 28-13. Even as they pulled away, however, there was
tension.
</P>
<P>
   After finally regaining the lead, 83-79, midway through the
fourth, Bryant got too fancy, losing his dribble to Bobby Sura.
Brevin Knight cashed in the turnover for an 18-foot jumper at the
other end, prompting a Laker timeout and a Jackson lecture.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his most animated moments as Laker coach, Jackson
bellowed at Bryant, who furrowed his own brow as he yelled back.
But the intense exchange was short and to the point, and quickly
forgotten, as Bryant scored four of the Lakers' last 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted it to register with him,'' Jackson said of his
tirade. ``That we don't want to have this happen. We've gone
through this a couple times, where situations can get critical in
ballgames, that's something we don't need to have happen. But Kobe
played a fine game tonight. Stat-wise, there's a lot of things out
there to be said about his game.''
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring was the six turnovers, but Bryant also had 25
points (on 6-of-15 shooting) and 13 rebounds, four assists and two
blocked shots .
</P>
<P>
   And one earful of a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryant: ``I told him, I said, look, I try to make a play
sometimes , and I know it doesn't come out, it doesn't happen the
right way sometimes, but I'm out there, trying my heart out. And he
said it's cool, just put it behind you, just move on to the next
play, buckle down and win t his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant did, but the criticism stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it hard,'' he said. ``I was ticked off. That's your
natural reaction, man. You want to go out there and you want to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made his point, though. ``He's here to teach, I'm here
to learn ,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   In the undercard, Shaquille O'Neal took turns abusing undersized
Cavs centers Mark Bryant (6-foot-9), Kornel David (6-9, 230) and
Andrew DeClercq (6-10) and finished with 27 points and 23 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's calling card is former All-Star forward Shawn Kemp,
but it was the Cavaliers' zippy guards that kept the Lakers
off-balance all night. Rookie Andre Miller dashed and drove for 20
points, Knight got 15 and Sura had nine. Kemp, meanwhile, fouled
out in the fourth with just 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers, who trailed by as many as 15 points in the
second half, proved once again they can win with one good quarter,
even while shooting 34.6 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   But they have gone more than a week since their last solid win,
and faces are growing longer as the Lakers try to rediscover their
magic touch. They'll need it soon -- the Portland Trail Blazers
arrive Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain,'' said Glen Rice, who finished with 17
points on 3-for-13 shooting. ``We're going to try to find the
answers tomorrow.''

OCEAN DATA SUGGEST SHIFT IN WEATHER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Fresh hints of a long-term shift in Pacific sea temperatures
that might affect West Coast weather for the next 20 years or more
were reported Wednesday.
<P>
   Studying the latest satellite pictures of the Pacific,
scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena noted
the outlines of a ``giant horseshoe pattern'' of warm ocean water
beginning to dominate the entire western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern, part of a mysterious phenomenon known as the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, tends to be much longer-lasting but
more subtle than the well-known El Nino and La Nina events, which
can have powerful weather-warping effects.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bay Area, a new phase in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
would mean a generation of more frequent, longer-lasting La Ninas
and dryer, cooler winters. It would mean more stormy weather
further north and in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   For the Southwest, it would probably mean drier than normal
weather, while the Southeast could have warmer weather and more
hurricanes. Storms and snowpack would increase in the Northwest and
Rocky Mountain states. Northern states would have lower winter
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, nobody knows what might trigger a shift from one
phase to another, or even how to tell whether a shift has occurred
until years after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might fade away by summer,'' said Tom Murphree, a climate
scientist at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it easy to gauge just how the long-term pattern plays out
one season to the next.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that we are now in an extended La Nina, an event that
occurs in the equatorial Pacific but affects weather in both
hemispheres. It is indirectly tied to cooler-than-normal water
sitting along the California coast, for example, a factor cited for
this year's lower-than-average rainfall and light snowfall in
California's Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how long the current patterns might continue.
</P>
<P>
   Most climate experts expect La Nina to begin breaking up soon.
But if the past year proves to be the start of a new phase in the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, what had seemed to be a fleeting event
could linger well into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have less than 100 years of observations to go on, so
the timetable amounts to little more than a guess. Moreover, each
cold or warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation can have
numerous La Ninas and El Ninos within it, further complicating
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Bill Patzert, oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said the most recent satellite data suggest that
``there is much more than an isolated La Nina occurring in the
Pacific Ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest data were based on satellite readings of the Pacific
made from December 30 through January 8 by the U.S. French
TOPEX/Poseidon satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Water temperatures are inferred from sea surface heights, which
the satellite can determine with astonishing accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sea surfaces were found to be in a range three to nine inches
lower than normal, associated with cooler-than-normal water, all
along the Pacific coast of Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists are paying especially close attention to the
so-called ``giant horseshoe'' of warmer water, which appears to
have been expanding for the past year, dominating the northern,
western and southern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Taken as a whole, the data appear to be consistent with the
beginnings of what is technically known as a cold or ``negative''
phase in the Pacific Oscillation. But it's far too soon to be
certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about something that takes a decade, and you
are looking at a snapshot of data taken over a matter of weeks or
months,'' said David Battisti, atmospheric sciences professor at
the University of Washington. ``You really can't conclude anything
from this snapshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the long-term climate variability from Northern
California to Alaska is explained by shifts in the decadal
oscillation, he noted, making the phenomenon a favorite topic of
research.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1970s to the mid-'90s, warmer-than-normal water
conditions prevailed off the West Coast, while seas were colder
than normal in the Central and northern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   That was the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
``The pattern does look different now,'' Battisti said, although he
emphasized that the ``pattern'' could just as easily be a fluke.

DUCKS SURPRISE STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN   
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks waived a veteran, brought up a pair
of kids and held a players-only meeting Tuesday. One win since the
New Year and a fading shot at the playoffs facilitates changes.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off perhaps their worst performance of the season, the
Ducks played with the urgency and passion needed to win. They
battled for loose pucks, played with toughness, paid attention to
the game plan and for the first time in 17 tries won a game with a
third-period rally. Paul Kariya, who pointed the finger at himself
for not playing well during the doldrums, scored twice in
three-goal third as the Ducks beat the injury-riddled Dallas Stars
3-1 Wednesday in front of 13,723 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's wrist shot from the slot gave the Ducks a 2-1 lead with
13:19 left in the game, but that's not the goal that embodied the
Ducks' second win in 11 games. Instead, it was his hustle that
created his open net goal with 0.1 seconds remaining that the
tell-tale sign of why the Ducks won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a night where we needed some strong leadership, and we
certainly got it from Paul,'' Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg said.
``He was outstanding, especially in the third period when you need
your best players and captain to step up, and he certainly did for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya left the ice with under a minute to play after getting
hit in the face inadvertently with a stick. He returned, blood
dribbling down his face, to outrace Dallas' Brett Hull and dive to
knock the puck into the open net. It capped the Ducks' first win
when trailing after two periods. They were 0-15-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played our system very well (and) we stayed patient,'' said
Kariya, who has a team-high 22 goals. ``The main thing was just to
be a team ag ain. We had gotten away from that. Things weren't
going well and guys got off the program. It happens. We had to get
back to playing a team game .''
</P>
<P>
   And while the roster moves and meeting may provide nothing but a
short-term fix, it certainly beats the alternatives. ``I think
we've been working hard but had no results so it's been frustr
ating,'' Ducks goalie Guy Hebert said after his 21-save
performance. ``I think we're just sick of losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's scoreless drought reached 128 minutes, 56 seconds
before Antti Aalto beat Dallas goalie Manny Fernandez on a
bad-angle backhander 1:08 into the third period to tie it 1-1.
Momentum swung fully toward the Du cks less than a minute later Joe
Nieuwendyk was knocked from the game with a separated right
shoulder thanks to a crunching check by Jeff Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: After waiving left wing Jim McKenzie on Tuesday, the
Ducks recall ed left wing Maxim Balmochnykh, 20, and defenseman
Vitaly Vishnevski, 19 , and both made their NHL debuts against the
Stars. ...Ducks winger Stu Grimson is out three to four weeks with
a broken left hand.

HERITAGE, HATE AND HAUTE DOGS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let's talk about severed heads, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco and in Columbia, S.C., there are heated debates
over two unrelated (as far as I know) symbols.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, it's the Confederate flag that flies over the
state Capitol. Protesters want the flag brought down. They say it's
a symbol of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   In S.F., the symbol in question is the Doggie Diner head on
Sloat Blvd. The Board of Supes can't decide whether to chop down
the head or sanctify it.
</P>
<P>
   It's important what symbols fly over a city. They say a lot
about the character of the city upon which they cast their shadows.
</P>
<P>
   As for Doggie, this much is certain: It has to stay, even if the
burger joint, which is not a Doggie Diner, gets bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   It really doesn't matter whether or not the head is granted
landmark status. What matters is that the Doggie symbolizes a
quirky San Francisco spirit, and it makes people feel good. It's
fun to look at. Please leave it up.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the property owner said the head is ``an
extraordinarily mediocre example of modern art.'' Hey, just what
the city needs: An attorney who's an art critic.
</P>
<P>
   Best solution: Let the property owner raze the burger hut if he
agrees to allow the erection of a suitable monument at the base of
the Doggie pole.
</P>
<P>
   NOW, ABOUT that flag.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the rebel flag say it's not a symbol of hate, but
of heritage. Confederate soldiers fought for freedom, their
struggle was noble and should be remembered. Sure, they killed some
folks, but hey.
</P>
<P>
   Two states north, in Virginia, there's a much quieter debate
over how to preserve the memory of Nat Turner, the slave who led an
1831 slave revolt in which 57 people were slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine had a recent (12/13/99) story about the
controversy over Turner's place in history. Author Tony Horwitz
found that while many blacks see Turner as a freedom fighter and
true folk hero, the two historical museums in Southampton County,
where the incredible event took place, barely have a trace of Nat
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   One museum has Turner's sword, but it's kept locked up, out of
view. Because, I guess, it's a symbol of hate, not heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was executed and his corpse chopped up and distributed
among white families. His skull wound up at Wooster College in Ohio
but has since vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The moral: Heritage is in the eye of the beheader.
</P>
<P>
   MORE SYMBOLIC STUFF: The Giants' new Pac Bell Park's address
will honor the franchise's greatest player and his uniform number _
``24 Willie Mays Plaza.'' Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   A problem: Not only is the ballpark on the odd-numbered side of
the street, it's on King Street. So technically the address is 1
King St.
</P>
<P>
   So the city is quietly cooking up a special permit to cut
through the technicalities and allow the Giants to honor the Say
Hey Kid.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF KIDS and cultural heritage: The Giants should launch
a campaign to teach every boy and girl ballplayer in the city the
basket catch.
</P>
<P>
   It was Willie's trademark, that and losing his cap while chasing
flies. Mays caught fly balls with his glove at belt-buckle level, a
shocking departure from the proper technique of holding the glove
near the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The basket catch was wrong, risky and a thing of simple beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it back.
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATED BY MUNI? So was the SFPD, so they went out and
assembled their own bus fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The P.D. needed buses for its Y2K readiness package, to
transport cops to hot spots. The police brass went to Muni, but ran
into some kind of Muni union problems.
</P>
<P>
   And one source tells me that the cops cooled on Muni drivers
after New Year's Eve a year ago, when a busload of officers ready
to roll sat cooling heels while the Muni driver took his dinner
break.
</P>
<P>
   So the P.D. bought 10 used SamTrans buses and sent 26 officers
to bus-driver training and now has its own fleet. Some of the buses
were used at Tuesday's funeral for two officers killed in a
helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it's comforting to know that in an emergency, the cops
won't be coming by Muni. They'll be riding the Fuzzbus.

   The bill puts California in the center of a highly charged,
big-money battle between independently owned brick-and-mortar
stores and large e-commerce retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, online retailers such as Barnesandnoble.com and
Borders.com do not charge California sales tax because their
Internet subsidiaries are based outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   But other online retailers _ such as Macys.com and
EddieBauer.com _ do charge sales tax because they do not use
separate out-of-state subsidiaries to operate their online
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't right. It creates a competitive disadvantage,''
Migden told The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Board of Equalization has not been consistent in
its enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's decided by whimsy or by individual standard,'' she said.
``It shouldn't be interpretive. It should be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a California retailer with an Internet subsidiary,
then it is a California business. They can't avoid sales tax in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision that requires
merchants to collect sales tax only in states where they have a
physical presence, or ``nexus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble have said that their
stores do not constitute nexuses for their Web divisions because
their Internet operations are separate subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Other Products Involved
</P>
<P>
   This situation is not unique to the book business. Examples of
other large companies with stores in California that do not collect
sales tax on their Internet sites include Gateway Computers,
CompUSA and KB Toys.
</P>
<P>
   A national panel charged with recommending an e-commerce
taxation plan to Congress is investigating these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said California should be in the middle of that debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the largest state in the union,'' she said. ``We are the
heartland of e-commerce. We are promoting an effort to create a
resolution. There will be debate. I'm not saying this is the only
resolution. But something has to be done to make it fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Taxation on the Internet has also become an issue for small
retail stores that have a hard time competing with Internet giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current state of affairs is totally unfair to
community-based business,'' said Andy Ross, president of Cody's
Books, a Berkeley independent. ``In every way, these chain
bookstores are all over California. They promote their dot-com
subsidies through their stores, and their stores on their Internet
sites. However, they fail to collect sales tax on Internet
transactions. It is harmful to main street and the shopping mall.''
</P>
<P>
   If it passes the Legislature, Migden's bill will get a chilly
reception from Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is opposed to taxing the Internet. We should give
this (issue) the opportunity to grow,'' said Michael Bustamante,
press secretary for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis signs the bill, the new law probably would likely &LR;   &LR; be
challenged in court by companies opposed to any expansion of
Internet taxes.

 CANDIDATES BOW AT HIGH TECH'S ALTAR  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there is any campaign stop that could be called
a favorite in this presidential contest, it is Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat or Republican, the next president will have visited the
Valley an untold number of times, raised millions of dollars there
and courted advice from its industrial titans.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason: Silicon Valley is the portal to the Digital
Age, which promises to alter American life as profoundly as the
Industrial Revolution did more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prominence of high tech as a transformative agent of
American society has become so obvious as to make any politician
foolish for not at least learning how to talk the talk, if not walk
the walk,'' said Jim Pinkerton, a domestic policy adviser in the
last two Republican administrations and a campaign strategist for
former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four leading contenders for president, Democrats Al
Gore and Bill Bradley and Republicans George W. Bush and John
McCain, has been so supportive of the industry that it is often
difficult to discern their policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apart from high-minded statements about embracing the
future, the candidates have yet to flesh out detailed positions on
everything from the growing immigration of skilled workers to the
Microsoft Corp. antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   The first president of the 21st century will make decisions that
will have a profound and enduring influence on the high-tech
industry and the development of the Internet. Issues now on the
table range from how homes will connect to the Internet to setting
standards on privacy. There will be many more critical issues that
no one can yet imagine.
</P>
<P>
   All but overlooked is the next president's power to tip the
balance of the federal judiciary, which will have the last word on
the vast body of commercial and regulatory law that will govern the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The old ideological divide that pitted Chamber of Commerce
Republicans against labor union Democrats has blurred into a new
libertarian strain from both parties that emphasizes markets and
plays down government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley, who is running to the left of Gore for the
Democratic nomination, declared in a major address this month,
``The market economy has triumphed, and governments everywhere are
finding that free markets engender free minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the zeitgeist that Ellen Stroud, spokeswoman for the
Silicon Valley lobbying group TechNet, said, ``What's good for
technology companies is good for America.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings to mind President Calvin Coolidge's famous
declaration in the 1920s, an era with many parallels, that ``The
business of America is business.'' And certainly none of the
candidates is quite so blunt. But all are unabashed in their
courtship of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports a ``duty-free cyberspace'' just as vociferously as
does Bush, and Bush argues for bridging the ``Digital Divide''
between rich and poor just as adamantly as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   All four advocate China's entry to the World Trade Organization,
one of the Valley's top priorities. All want looser controls on
computer exports and encryption technology, all support tax credits
for research and development, all want free trade, all are for
fixing primary education.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the issue of Internet taxes, where differences are
sharper, none advocates mining electronic commerce for revenue.
(McCain has made a permanent ban a campaign theme, forcing a
reluctant Bush to say he favors extending the current moratorium
for ``several'' years; Gore and Bradley say they do not want to tax
Internet commerce, but do not embrace a ban.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather, each has gone out of his way to position himself as a
leader who understands and appreciates the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   With just that symbolism in mind, the Republican National
Committee chose the Bay Area for its winter meeting. ``Things have
changed,'' said spokesman Mark Pfeifle. ``Now San Jose and Silicon
Valley have become the Main Street of the world. What's going on
there is more important to our futures than anything that's
happening on Wall Street or Pennsylvania Avenue combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats agree. ``I ultimately believe that whichever candidate
is seen as presenting the most modern economic vision that is going
to create opportunity in this new economy ... is going to be the
one who will win the presidential race in 2000,'' said Simon
Rosenberg, executive director of the New Democrat Network in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that the candidates fighting older battles
have been marginalized, political strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech existence brings with it a kind of open-minded,
secular, tolerant world view,'' said Pinkerton. ``If you walk
around Silicon Valley, half the people there are immigrants from
somewhere else. They're not necessarily white or Christian or
anything else. Technology is shaping people's perceptions in a much
different way than Americans are used to, and you can't be on the
wrong side of that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the industry is pleased. ``By and large, these
candidates are getting up to speed, and they're very supportive of
what we're trying to do, which is first do no harm,'' said Intel
Corp.'s Michael Maibach, head of government affairs for the Santa
Clara chipmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, detailed positions on the more controversial issues _
such as privacy restrictions or regulation of online pharmacies _
are often lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is stuck in bumper-sticker mode,'' said Adam
Thierer, a technology policy analyst for the conservative Heritage
Foundation. ``At this point, it's easier to say you're in favor of
high-tech deregulation and Internet freedom and be no more specific
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaigns move out of the farms and small towns of Iowa
and New Hampshire and into California, differences are expected to
sharpen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the appearance of a rough new centrism, the appetite for
libertarianism goes just so far in both parties, whether it is a
predeliction for economic regulation among Democrats or social
regulation among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   A sticking point for Democrats, some argue, is their loyalty to
trial lawyers and labor unions that puts them squarely on the wrong
side of two issues dear to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry fought long and hard to pass legislation
limiting securities lawsuits, and its congressional allies
ultimately overrode President Clinton's veto. Gore's reluctance
last year to back another hard-fought bill limiting Y2K-related
liability angered industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the industry's most pressing priorities this year is to
increase the number of so-called H1B visas to admit skilled
immigrants, a move that unions oppose. The Clinton administration
is not backing more visas for now, and neither Gore nor Bradley has
specifically addressed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, by contrast, would eliminate the current cap altogether,
and Bush wants an increase, saying, ``We need to send a message of
welcome to earnest skilled workers from all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan
Institute, contends that Democrats are also ``really quite eager to
set standards and protocols for a lot of ordinary economic
discourse on the Web,'' citing the Clinton administration's move to
have the Food and Drug Administration regulate sales of
prescription drugs via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The weak spot for Republicans is their fondness for social
regulation, whether banning pornography and gambling from the
Internet or a general alliance with religious conservatives that is
anathema to the Silicon Valley ethos.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is touting a measure that would require schools and
libraries to use filtering software to screen out Internet
pornography, violence and other unwelcome content. Bush has avoided
that position, calling instead for encouraging a more wholesome
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech issues cut across the traditional partisan divide,''
said Mark Rozell, professor of politics at Catholic University,
``and it's a problem for many Republicans, because they want to
maintain the support of the business community, but many are being
pushed very hard to regulate the content of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, running for the GOP nomination, who
insisted that he wants to ``keep the government's mitts off'' the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hatch is sponsoring legislation that would clamp down on
Internet alcohol sales, a position that California's wine industry
contends would open the door to much wider regulation of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   And even Democrat Bradley voted in the Senate in 1995 for the
GOP-sponsored Communications Decency Act that banned the
transmission to minors of any material deemed ``indecent'' or
``patently offensive.'' The Supreme Court struck down the act 7 to
2.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates make an attempt ``to claim high-tech'' said David
Hart, associate professor of public policy at Harvard University's
Kennedy School, ``but when you get down to the nitty-gritty on some
of these issues, there are some pretty powerful (opposing) forces
out there _ on taxes you have state and local governments, on
encryption you have military intelligence and police, and on
immigration you have unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most far-reaching and overlooked technology
issue of the 2000 campaign _ one where ideological differences will
come into full flower _ is the next president's power to name
probably two and as many as four new Supreme Court justices, and
fill the ranks of the rest of the federal judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the judiciary is in a ``virtual balance'' between
judges appointed by Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Clinton
and Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush, said William
Kovacic, professor of antitrust law at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have almost an ideological divide between liberals and
conservatives, judges who have a strong case for government
intervention and those who are skeptics,'' said Kovacic. ``The next
president will tip the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   That could determine whether Microsoft is broken up.
</P>
<P>
   But far beyond that, for the high-tech industry and the millions
who use the Internet, the judiciary ultimately may set the course
of intellectual property, commercial and regulatory law _ including
new legislation _ for the Digital Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ability to pick judges,'' Kovacic said, ``is one
of the largest underestimated prizes in the November 2000 elections
when it comes to the business community and the design of legal
rules that affect them.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Rebel flag represents worst of Southern heritage
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many in South Carolina say the Confederate battle flag that
flies over the state capitol symbolizes racism. Many others say it
symbolizes southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And the difference would be...?
</P>
<P>
   This is an argument over a distinction without a difference, for
the only southern heritage the flag represented and represents was
the Civil War. South Carolina led the way in secession, attempting
with other southern states to break up the United States in order
to preserve a regional economy based on slavery, and a slavery
based on race.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Confederate apologists then and now, without slavery
there never would have been a Civil War. Period.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was struck at the end of that war and was not unfurled
again until it became the informal ensign of a post-Reconstruction
South that was forcing legal segregation on black southerners and
stripping them of their citizenship rights. It since has been taken
up by every clod who mistakes his whiteness for a state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   The battle flag was incorporated into the Mississippi state flag
in the 1890s to fly over the state's enactment of Jim Crow laws. It
was added to the Georgia state flag in 1956 as part of that state's
defiance of Supreme Court rulings outlawing racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   At least South Carolina is flying the flag more or less by
inadvertence. It was hoisted over the capitol in 1962 as part of a
national centennial observance of the Civil War. It was to have
come down at the end of that four-year period. But raised benignly,
it has been keep aloft perniciously _ a rallying standard for every
dewy-eyed Confederate romantic and racial bully in the state and
for many outside it.
</P>
<P>
   You want southern heritage? Try this: The South was a full
partner in the founding of the nation and the American revolution.
During Reconstruction it led the way in progressive social
legislation, not least by spreading public education. It was a
pillar of the politically venturesome New Deal. Its most decent
people, often at huge personal risk, overcame segregation. It has
produced some of the nation's richest literature. Its sons and
daughters have fought and served honorably in every American war --
including, yes, the Civil War, when they fought foolishly as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why on Earth would some folks _ no, let's be plain here: why
would some white people want to characterize their region by the
worst idea it ever had and the most tragic four years of its long
history? We know why, don't we?
</P>
<P>
   There's another upside to southern heritage, too _ the civility
for which the region has been rightly known. That's fading but
survives in reasonably hardy remnant.
</P>
<P>
   Black southerners have been trying to tell white southerners for
a hundred years that many bad things and no good ones have happened
to them under Confederate colors. They are frightened and
embarrassed and insulted by the battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Simple politeness alone ought to retire the flag to museums.

   COLUMN ON ROCKER
</P>
<P>
   BY:JIM MINTER
</P>
<P>
   C.2000 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me for venturing a bit deeper than my usual frustrations
with low-fat cooking, blossom end rot, fire ants, Japanese beetles
and being unable to reach a live human being on the telephone.
However, I don't want to be the only newspaper columnist in America
who failed to dive into the John Rocker affair.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in the history of journalism has so much been said and
written about so little. Who is John Rocker? Is he the secretary of
state or something? A member of Congress? Head of some powerful
organization? A college professor? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   He is a name that in certain times of the year appears at the
tail end of a baseball box score. Beyond mindless entertainment,
what he has to say, one way or the other, amounts in public issue
to not much more than a spit into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Of all that I've read in the newspapers and heard on television,
Furman Bisher and Andy Young are the two who haven't gone off the
deep end. Bisher, The Atlanta Journal's ``senior sports
columnist,'' examined precisely what Rocker said to the Sports
Illustrated reporter. What he said wasn't as inflammatory as the
reaction. How many Braves fans, for example, have not entertained a
suspicion that the laid-back, board room demeanor of the team's
overpaid superstars has not contributed to World Series failures?
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Constitution, Andy Young, who once created his
own controversy with a reference to ``smart ass white boys,''
suggested that ``The 100 Percent Wrong Club, Atlanta's oldest black
sports club, should honor John Rocker for bringing his reactionary
attitudes into the open where they can be addressed in the Atlanta
style - with humor, truth and reconciliation.'' (Humor, truth and
reconciliation should be in bold capital letters).
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' Young continued, ``similar insecurities and fears
are just beneath the surface in many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of us also tend to run off at the mouth without real
meanness or hatred. Count me in. Although I certainly don't hate
teenagers, my granddaughter being one, I'm inclined to mumble
uncomplimentary remarks about ``idiot teenage drivers.'' In
traffic, I've been known to cuss ``old fools,'' of which I am one.
</P>
<P>
   When kids see snowy white heads behind steering wheels they
refer to them as ``Q-tips.'' The label is somewhat derogatory to
elderly drivers, but not without a touch of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta is adapting to the new experience of Third World
immigration, particularly workers from south of the border. Many
speak, or read, little English, if any at all. They are unfamiliar
with streets and highways. They are here because they are poor, and
being poor, they chug along on expressways in dilapidated cars and
pickup trucks, trying to figure out where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that many decent citizens, in the heat of rush hour
traffic, have referred to such drivers in uncomplimentary terms
that while innocuous within the confines of a private automobile,
would not wash in a national magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a sportswriter in another life, I can guess how
Rocker was helped to present himself as the most bigoted Georgian
since the late J.B. Stoner. I know how a large ego new to the
limelight can be encouraged to make outrageous statements to fit a
supposed macho image. I also know that a reporter, within ethical
boundaries of good journalism, can ask: ``Look fellow, do you know
what you are saying? Do You really mean that?'' The answer is part
of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my tenure as ambassador to the United Nations in the
1970s,'' Andrew Young wrote, ``the New York press even goaded me
into a series of headlines that served only to make my work more
difficullt. And there was not the pressure of 60,000 sports fans
shouting at me. I know what it's like to be taunted, and it's not
hard for me to walk a mile in John's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know John Rocker, and have no desire to make his
acquaintance. One reason I got out of sportswriting shortly after
major league sports came to town was becaue I didn't like dealing
with smart-ass professional jocks. Over the years my regard for the
species has dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   I do know somebody who knows John Rocker very well. This person,
who is far from being a racist and a bigot, tells me that offstage
he is a nice enough fellow. He may be. Most people are.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante journalism scares me, even when practiced in what
practitioners think is a good cause. It can do more harm than a
popoff professional athlete who has learned to throw
100-mile-an-hour strikes but not how to keep his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in his right mind falls for the baseball commissioner's
ploy of shipping Rocker off to be examined by a psychologist in
Baltimore. If the Braves want to cure what ails John Rocker, the
smartest thing they can do is send him to dinner with Andy Young.
If that happened, the Braves would have a better pitcher, Mr. and
Mrs. Rocker would have a better son, and Atlanta would be a better
community. I'd bet on it.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Castro flourishes as a victim
 &HT;    For release Jan. 23, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Every once in a while, I pause to take note that Fidel
Castro has won another round, either with the United States or the
Cuban exiles in this country. He is a remarkable man in his own
tyrannical way. He has managed to position himself as the enduring
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 41 years of U.S. embargo, Castro has used that act
to rally his people. He blames all wrongs on the United States and
his gullible people believed it then and believe it now.
</P>
<P>
   With each crisis that has developed between the cross-straits
countries, Castro has emerged a victor. In the early 1960s, when
exile Cubans were making nominal military forays on the island's
coast, Castro turned out to be the big winner when his Soviet
benefactors insisted, as a price for withdrawing their missiles
from the island, that exile incursions be barred by the U.S.
government. Exiles never have forgiven John Kennedy for giving that
assurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariel Boatlift of the early 1980s was another Castro
victory _ of sorts. While it is true that about 100,000 truly
disenchanted people managed to flee the island then, Castro also
used the occasion to dump many of his criminals and criminally
insane onto Florida's shore.
</P>
<P>
   The signs coming from Havana that a capitalist-based economy is
beginning to emerge, compliments of participating countries such as
Canada and Spain, show that our embargo (and prestige) is futile.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that Canadians and Europeans by the thousands go to
Cuba on vacation but only once. Outside the hotel, the environment
is not one tuned to tourists. Nevertheless, millions of dollars
have poured into Havana by foreign companies, while the U.S. sits
on the outside, not just looking in but trying to get compensation
for what was taken away without payment by the Castro revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The latest drama around the six-year-old Elian Gonzalez may be
as big a victory for Castro as any of the others. His emissaries
have gone to the pope and to European capitals to plead that their
little Elian be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   He has rallied the Cuban people to march by the hundreds of
thousands demanding the return of Elian. Cuban flags, on both sides
of the Straits of Florida, are as abundant as are mosquitoes in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Fidel tells his people, the United States is a bogey man
who has kidnapped one of his children. Even polls in the United
States show an overwhelming majority in favor of the child's
return. But, I suspect Castro would not like that to happen just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   He's enjoying the moment. Any grumbling in Cuba about human
rights, economics or quality of life is set aside for the moment.
Everyone's out in the streets waving flags or photos of Elian. The
few perennial dissenters who have not yet been jailed feel awfully
alone today.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is the shrewdest and most durable of all dictators. He
successfully purged his country of dissenters -- either by firing
squad, prison, or emigration -- got the U.S. to impede exile
counter-revolutionary activity, brought the pope into Havana as a
stage prop, enticed the Baltimore Orioles to come down, play and
shake hands, all the while showing zero tolerance for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   He has become more than a thorn in our side. As his resilience
continues, and as exile frustration builds, the argument over Elian
tears at the pollsters, editorialists and political activists in
the United States. There were no demonstrations in Havana against
the return of the child; not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   And when the United States eventually, and properly, returns
Elian to his father, Fidel will have won another victory _ not
based on his own policy but on U.S. policy that hasn't known what
to do about Castro for more than four decades.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Rebel flag represents worst of Southern heritage
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many in South Carolina say the Confederate battle flag that
flies over the state capitol symbolizes racism. Many others say it
symbolizes southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And the difference would be...?
</P>
<P>
   This is an argument over a distinction without a difference, for
the only southern heritage the flag represented and represents was
the Civil War. South Carolina led the way in secession, attempting
with other southern states to break up the United States in order
to preserve a regional economy based on slavery, and a slavery
based on race.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Confederate apologists then and now, without slavery
there never would have been a Civil War. Period.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was struck at the end of that war and was not unfurled
again until it became the informal ensign of a post-Reconstruction
South that was forcing legal segregation on black southerners and
stripping them of their citizenship rights. It since has been taken
up by every clod who mistakes his whiteness for a state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   The battle flag was incorporated into the Mississippi state flag
in the 1890s to fly over the state's enactment of Jim Crow laws. It
was added to the Georgia state flag in 1956 as part of that state's
defiance of Supreme Court rulings outlawing racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   At least South Carolina is flying the flag more or less by
inadvertence. It was hoisted over the capitol in 1962 as part of a
national centennial observance of the Civil War. It was to have
come down at the end of that four-year period. But raised benignly,
it has been keep aloft perniciously _ a rallying standard for every
dewy-eyed Confederate romantic and racial bully in the state and
for many outside it.
</P>
<P>
   You want southern heritage? Try this: The South was a full
partner in the founding of the nation and the American revolution.
During Reconstruction it led the way in progressive social
legislation, not least by spreading public education. It was a
pillar of the politically venturesome New Deal. Its most decent
people, often at huge personal risk, overcame segregation. It has
produced some of the nation's richest literature. Its sons and
daughters have fought and served honorably in every American war --
including, yes, the Civil War, when they fought foolishly as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why on Earth would some folks _ no, let's be plain here: why
would some white people want to characterize their region by the
worst idea it ever had and the most tragic four years of its long
history? We know why, don't we?
</P>
<P>
   There's another upside to southern heritage, too _ the civility
for which the region has been rightly known. That's fading but
survives in reasonably hardy remnant.
</P>
<P>
   Black southerners have been trying to tell white southerners for
a hundred years that many bad things and no good ones have happened
to them under Confederate colors. They are frightened and
embarrassed and insulted by the battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Simple politeness alone ought to retire the flag to museums.

<P>
   Magnetic resonance imaging is good for medical diagnosis because
it peers well into wet stuff, and people are mostly water.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to Haskell Beckham, a polymer scientist at Georgia
Tech, that mri might also be perfect for looking at his own
interest _ wet carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham and his colleagues have been trying to understand how
carpets dry after they're dyed. Using a high-powered mri machine
and watching in real time, Beckham found that moisture in a carpet
flows into the backing through the centers of individual tufts of
fiber, even against gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we can see where the moisture is, and then
we can design carpets that are much easier to clean,'' Beckham
says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FIRST LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten billion years ago, the infant universe convulsed with
activity. Small, chaotic, yet intensely bright galaxies suddenly
came alive.
</P>
<P>
   These strange objects blazed as brightly as our Milky Way,
although they were less than one-fifth its size.
</P>
<P>
   A new supercomputer simulation shows why: Collisions between
giant gas clouds _ the precursors of galaxies _ violently collapsed
the material into clusters of hot, energetic, newborn stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As two of these (gassy) galaxies collide, the clouds of gas
stream together, producing a very high density of gas at the
center,'' explains cosmologist James Bullock of Ohio State
University, who analyzed the simulation along with Tsafrir Kolatt
of the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``From a little bit
of gas, you get a whole lot of stars and a very bright galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   These interactions churned out as many as a thousand new stars
each year in the early galaxies. A typical galaxy now births just
one new star per year.
</P>
<P>
   The computer model is helping astronomers make sense of the many
faint blobs of light that dot the most sensitive deep-space images
from the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at these objects, we are seeing massive galaxies
being assembled out of smaller parts. And so what we are really
seeing is the structure of the universe forming,'' Bullock says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BENDABLE LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light could be better than electricity to make a computer run
faster and more efficiently, but light is also much more difficult
to control.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have long lusted after a material that could
manipulate light the way silicon chips organize electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that light propagates too easily,'' says Sajeev
John, a physicist at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But he and his colleagues say they have found a solution. They
</P>
<P>
   poured silicon into a tray full of glass balls and used acid to
dissolve the balls, leaving an array of spherical holes.
</P>
<P>
   Then they coated the holes in liquid crystals, whose
light-scattering properties change in the presence of an electric
field. The resulting structure should allow the scientists to
control the path of light and to reprogram it at will.
</P>
<P>
   John hopes to use this material as the basis for light-powered
computers, which he believes could be on the market within a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING THE SKINNY ON TV &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teen eating disorders are often blamed on the endless parade of
skinny actresses on television. Still, there are so many cultural
factors to consider that it is nearly impossible to make the
charges stick.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard anthropologist Anne Becker may have found some proof in
the Fiji Islands, where television first arrived just four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than four-fifths of Fijian women are overweight by American
standards but, until recently, it didn't seem to bother them.
Fijians have traditionally glorified larger proportions and worried
more about being too thin than about getting fat, Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight months after Western TV shows were introduced in
Fiji via satellite, however, she found that the number of teen-age
girls who vomited to control their weight increased fivefold, along
with a general rise in abnormal attitudes toward eating.
</P>
<P>
   Her surveys revealed that Fijian girls who clock the most hours
of TV (``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' are especially
popular) are half again as likely to feel fat and a third more
likely to be on a diet than their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see they're much bigger than these rich, successful
Americans. Add to that a culture attuned to weight changes, and the
results are disastrous,'' Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBOT WATCH: RADIOACTIVE WALL CRAWLER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there's one place robots make sense, it's in a nuclear
facility, where inspections are essential but potentially lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Enter robicen III, a tank-climbing machine built by Joan Savall
and his colleagues at the University of Navarra and CEIT, a
research center, both in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   This little robot grabs the outsides of storage tank walls with
its four suction-cup feet and uses cameras and ultrasonic sensors
to inspect welds and detect cracks. Its left foot and right foot
are attached to an axle that slides back and forth and swivels to
make turns.
</P>
<P>
   Robicen III fixes its front foot and back foot to the tank,
lifts the left and right feet, and then slides them forward and
seals them again to the tank. It then unsticks the front and back
feet and pulls itself forward.
</P>
<P>
   Each foot is hinged so that the robot can grab onto the curved
portions of a tank.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For decades, heart disease has been the No. 1 killer in the
United States. But the underlying cause of heart disease has eluded
its pursuers. High cholesterol levels, for example, have never
correlated well with heart disease. Most heart attacks happen to
people with normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   And while medical researchers understand how cholesterol builds
up in a damaged patch of artery, they've never proven that
cholesterol itself does the initial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it doesn't. A rogue theory of heart-disease
progression holds that another player is at work. The suspect is
homocysteine, a byproduct of protein breakdown that can damage
blood vessels and provoke the cascade of events that leads to
plaques and clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine theory has recently won the grudging acceptance
of the medical establishment, and homocysteine is now recognized by
the American Heart Association as a potential risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of homocysteine's treachery even has a hero. Kilmer
McCully was a promising young graduate of Harvard Medical School in
the 1960s when he heard about a rare disease called homocystinuria.
Researchers knew little about the disease except that it produced
high levels of homocysteine in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Victims often died in childhood of vascular complications such
as heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   McCully wondered if there could be a connection between these
unusual fatalities and high homocysteine levels. When he examined
tissue from two child victims, he noted the characteristic plaques
of arteriosclerosis. Strangely, however, the plaques were not
associated with any fat deposits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he wrote a paper proposing that homocysteine might
influence the development of heart disease in the population at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was published in a good journal by reputable people, and it
was sort of ignored,'' McCully says.
</P>
<P>
   McCully decided to follow his hunch anyway. In his lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he did studies on animals
and tissue cultures to test how homocysteine interacts with other
substances in the body and with the linings of veins and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine comes from the breakdown of an amino acid called
methionine, which is abundant in meat and dairy products. McCully
discovered that the homocysteine molecule is metabolized by enzymes
that act in concert with B vitamins: B12, which comes from meat,
seafood and dairy products, and B6 and folic acid, which are both
abundant in vegetables and whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that patients with homocystinuria had genetic defects
that disabled these enzymes. But he reasoned that a B-vitamin
deficiency in an otherwise healthy person could shut down the
enzymes as well. In fact, homocysteine could be concentrated in the
blood of anyone who ate a lot of animal protein and didn't get
enough B vitamins to process it completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCully found out that such an accumulation could be bad news
for blood vessels. His experiments and many others since then have
shown that homocysteine can damage cells in the vascular linings,
interfere with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and
promote blood clotting. That damage is a first step in the scarring
and hardening of arteries; the deposits of fat and cholesterol that
build up over these scars are often the last step in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, because homocysteine is transported
in low-density, or ``bad,'' cholesterol, it could be playing a
crucial role in the cardiovascular problems associated with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more McCully learned about homocysteine, the more convinced
he became of his theory. But he was trained as a biochemist and
pathologist, not as a clinician. Although he could decipher
homocysteine's mechanism of action, he wasn't equipped to undertake
the human trials that might have validated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the establishment,'' he adds, ``felt that until it was
proven in patients, (the theory) probably was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong'' wasn't the half of it. When McCully first made his key
observations, the cholesterol model of heart disease was wowing
cardiologists. There was no need for an alternative theory. And for
a decade or so, McCully was one of only a handful of scientists who
appreciated the complicated biochemistry of homocysteine
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he couldn't find funding for his medical
research and wound up working as a pathologist at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Providence, R.I. (where he has remained). But
he persisted in publishing modest studies funded by a
better-established colleague's grant.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a decade ago, results from some of the first major
long-term studies of heart disease began to trickle in. To
McCully's surprise, many included data on homocysteine. To everyone
else's surprise, the data revealed significant correlations between
homocysteine and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of almost 15,000 physicians, for example, those whose
homocysteine levels were highest had more than three times the risk
of heart attack as those whose levels were lowest.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing 50-year study of the population of Framingham,
Mass., an examination of more than 1,000 seniors found that
homocysteine levels corresponded to clogging of the arteries in the
neck. About 80 trials have suggested that elevated homocysteine is
associated with hardening or blockage of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine hypothesis suddenly became respectable.
McCully's colleagues cite several reasons for the theory's belated
acceptance. In addition to the cholesterol prejudice, there's the
fact that, until recently, measuring homocysteine levels was
costly, difficult and time-consuming. But the latest homocysteine
blood tests are fast and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that there's a desperate need for a long-term
study to evaluate whether lowering homocysteine levels will in fact
help to prevent heart disease. But they say that even if the
connection holds up, homocysteine won't entirely eclipse the other,
more familiar, risk factors such as age, weight, smoking, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `Well, I'll take folic acid and eat whatever I
want and I'll be protected,''' says Craig Scott, a cardiologist at
the University of Pennsylvania. High homocysteine levels don't
guarantee a heart attack, he says, and low levels won't rule one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do recommend folic acid for all my patients,'' Scott
says. ``It's something that everybody who's at risk for coronary
disease should consider doing as an adjunct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately such recommendations may scuttle efforts to prove
once and for all the merits of the homocysteine hypothesis. Federal
guidelines introduced in 1998 increased the amount of folic acid
that must be added to enriched grain products; that increase,
together with the growing popularity of B vitamins in cardiology
clinics, might eliminate any heart conditions caused by vitamin
deficiency and homocysteine surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results from the Framingham study, for example, show
that the new fortification program has added an average of 100
micrograms of folic acid to subjects' daily diets, resulting in a
sizable lowering of homocysteine levels, Krauss says. ``That's
going to make it difficult to do the studies that need to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCully, it's perhaps the final irony in a bittersweet
career.

<P>
   For decades, heart disease has been the No. 1 killer in the
United States. But the underlying cause of heart disease has eluded
its pursuers. High cholesterol levels, for example, have never
correlated well with heart disease. Most heart attacks happen to
people with normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   And while medical researchers understand how cholesterol builds
up in a damaged patch of artery, they've never proven that
cholesterol itself does the initial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it doesn't. A rogue theory of heart-disease
progression holds that another player is at work. The suspect is
homocysteine, a byproduct of protein breakdown that can damage
blood vessels and provoke the cascade of events that leads to
plaques and clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine theory has recently won the grudging acceptance
of the medical establishment, and homocysteine is now recognized by
the American Heart Association as a potential risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of homocysteine's treachery even has a hero. Kilmer
McCully was a promising young graduate of Harvard Medical School in
the 1960s when he heard about a rare disease called homocystinuria.
Researchers knew little about the disease except that it produced
high levels of homocysteine in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Victims often died in childhood of vascular complications such
as heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   McCully wondered if there could be a connection between these
unusual fatalities and high homocysteine levels. When he examined
tissue from two child victims, he noted the characteristic plaques
of arteriosclerosis. Strangely, however, the plaques were not
associated with any fat deposits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he wrote a paper proposing that homocysteine might
influence the development of heart disease in the population at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was published in a good journal by reputable people, and it
was sort of ignored,'' McCully says.
</P>
<P>
   McCully decided to follow his hunch anyway. In his lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he did studies on animals
and tissue cultures to test how homocysteine interacts with other
substances in the body and with the linings of veins and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine comes from the breakdown of an amino acid called
methionine, which is abundant in meat and dairy products. McCully
discovered that the homocysteine molecule is metabolized by enzymes
that act in concert with B vitamins: B12, which comes from meat,
seafood and dairy products, and B6 and folic acid, which are both
abundant in vegetables and whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that patients with homocystinuria had genetic defects
that disabled these enzymes. But he reasoned that a B-vitamin
deficiency in an otherwise healthy person could shut down the
enzymes as well. In fact, homocysteine could be concentrated in the
blood of anyone who ate a lot of animal protein and didn't get
enough B vitamins to process it completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCully found out that such an accumulation could be bad news
for blood vessels. His experiments and many others since then have
shown that homocysteine can damage cells in the vascular linings,
interfere with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and
promote blood clotting. That damage is a first step in the scarring
and hardening of arteries; the deposits of fat and cholesterol that
build up over these scars are often the last step in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, because homocysteine is transported
in low-density, or ``bad,'' cholesterol, it could be playing a
crucial role in the cardiovascular problems associated with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more McCully learned about homocysteine, the more convinced
he became of his theory. But he was trained as a biochemist and
pathologist, not as a clinician. Although he could decipher
homocysteine's mechanism of action, he wasn't equipped to undertake
the human trials that might have validated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the establishment,'' he adds, ``felt that until it was
proven in patients, (the theory) probably was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong'' wasn't the half of it. When McCully first made his key

   It occurred to Haskell Beckham, a polymer scientist at Georgia

</P>
<P>
   Beckham and his colleagues have been trying to understand how
carpets dry after they're dyed. Using a high-powered mri machine
and watching in real time, Beckham found that moisture in a carpet
flows into the backing through the centers of individual tufts of
fiber, even against gravity.

   Ten billion years ago, the infant universe convulsed with
activity. Small, chaotic, yet intensely bright galaxies suddenly
came alive.

<P>
   These strange objects blazed as brightly as our Milky Way,
although they were less than one-fifth its size.
</P>
<P>
   A new supercomputer simulation shows why: Collisions between
giant gas clouds _ the precursors of galaxies _ violently collapsed
the material into clusters of hot, energetic, newborn stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As two of these (gassy) galaxies collide, the clouds of gas
stream together, producing a very high density of gas at the
center,'' explains cosmologist James Bullock of Ohio State
University, who analyzed the simulation along with Tsafrir Kolatt
of the University of California at Santa Cruz. ``From a little bit
of gas, you get a whole lot of stars and a very bright galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   These interactions churned out as many as a thousand new stars
each year in the early galaxies. A typical galaxy now births just
one new star per year.
</P>
<P>
   The computer model is helping astronomers make sense of the many
faint blobs of light that dot the most sensitive deep-space images
from the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at these objects, we are seeing massive galaxies
being assembled out of smaller parts. And so what we are really
seeing is the structure of the universe forming,'' Bullock says.

<P>
   poured silicon into a tray full of glass balls and used acid to
dissolve the balls, leaving an array of spherical holes.

   Then they coated the holes in liquid crystals, whose

field. The resulting structure should allow the scientists to

   Teen eating disorders are often blamed on the endless parade of

factors to consider that it is nearly impossible to make the
charges stick.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard anthropologist Anne Becker may have found some proof in
the Fiji Islands, where television first arrived just four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than four-fifths of Fijian women are overweight by American
standards but, until recently, it didn't seem to bother them.
Fijians have traditionally glorified larger proportions and worried
more about being too thin than about getting fat, Becker says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight months after Western TV shows were introduced in
Fiji via satellite, however, she found that the number of teen-age
girls who vomited to control their weight increased fivefold, along
with a general rise in abnormal attitudes toward eating.
</P>
<P>
   Her surveys revealed that Fijian girls who clock the most hours
of TV (``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' are especially
popular) are half again as likely to feel fat and a third more
likely to be on a diet than their peers.
</P>

   ``They see they're much bigger than these rich, successful
Americans. Add to that a culture attuned to weight changes, and the
results are disastrous,'' Becker says.

   This little robot grabs the outsides of storage tank walls with
its four suction-cup feet and uses cameras and ultrasonic sensors
to inspect welds and detect cracks. Its left foot and right foot
are attached to an axle that slides back and forth and swivels to

</P>
<P>
   Robicen III fixes its front foot and back foot to the tank,
lifts the left and right feet, and then slides them forward and
seals them again to the tank. It then unsticks the front and back

   For decades, heart disease has been the No. 1 killer in the
United States. But the underlying cause of heart disease has eluded
its pursuers. High cholesterol levels, for example, have never
correlated well with heart disease. Most heart attacks happen to
people with normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   And while medical researchers understand how cholesterol builds
up in a damaged patch of artery, they've never proven that
cholesterol itself does the initial damage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because it doesn't. A rogue theory of heart-disease
progression holds that another player is at work. The suspect is
homocysteine, a byproduct of protein breakdown that can damage
blood vessels and provoke the cascade of events that leads to
plaques and clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine theory has recently won the grudging acceptance
of the medical establishment, and homocysteine is now recognized by
the American Heart Association as a potential risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of homocysteine's treachery even has a hero. Kilmer
McCully was a promising young graduate of Harvard Medical School in
the 1960s when he heard about a rare disease called homocystinuria.
Researchers knew little about the disease except that it produced
high levels of homocysteine in a patient's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Victims often died in childhood of vascular complications such
as heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   McCully wondered if there could be a connection between these
unusual fatalities and high homocysteine levels. When he examined
tissue from two child victims, he noted the characteristic plaques
of arteriosclerosis. Strangely, however, the plaques were not
associated with any fat deposits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he wrote a paper proposing that homocysteine might
influence the development of heart disease in the population at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was published in a good journal by reputable people, and it
was sort of ignored,'' McCully says.
</P>
<P>
   McCully decided to follow his hunch anyway. In his lab at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he did studies on animals
and tissue cultures to test how homocysteine interacts with other
substances in the body and with the linings of veins and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Homocysteine comes from the breakdown of an amino acid called
methionine, which is abundant in meat and dairy products. McCully
discovered that the homocysteine molecule is metabolized by enzymes
that act in concert with B vitamins: B12, which comes from meat,
seafood and dairy products, and B6 and folic acid, which are both
abundant in vegetables and whole grains.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that patients with homocystinuria had genetic defects
that disabled these enzymes. But he reasoned that a B-vitamin
deficiency in an otherwise healthy person could shut down the
enzymes as well. In fact, homocysteine could be concentrated in the
blood of anyone who ate a lot of animal protein and didn't get
enough B vitamins to process it completely.
</P>
<P>
   McCully found out that such an accumulation could be bad news
for blood vessels. His experiments and many others since then have
shown that homocysteine can damage cells in the vascular linings,
interfere with the constriction and dilation of blood vessels, and
promote blood clotting. That damage is a first step in the scarring
and hardening of arteries; the deposits of fat and cholesterol that
build up over these scars are often the last step in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, because homocysteine is transported
in low-density, or ``bad,'' cholesterol, it could be playing a
crucial role in the cardiovascular problems associated with high
cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   The more McCully learned about homocysteine, the more convinced
he became of his theory. But he was trained as a biochemist and
pathologist, not as a clinician. Although he could decipher
homocysteine's mechanism of action, he wasn't equipped to undertake
the human trials that might have validated his suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the establishment,'' he adds, ``felt that until it was
proven in patients, (the theory) probably was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong'' wasn't the half of it. When McCully first made his key
observations, the cholesterol model of heart disease was wowing
cardiologists. There was no need for an alternative theory. And for
a decade or so, McCully was one of only a handful of scientists who
appreciated the complicated biochemistry of homocysteine
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, he couldn't find funding for his medical
research and wound up working as a pathologist at a Veterans
Affairs hospital in Providence, R.I. (where he has remained). But
he persisted in publishing modest studies funded by a
better-established colleague's grant.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a decade ago, results from some of the first major
long-term studies of heart disease began to trickle in. To
McCully's surprise, many included data on homocysteine. To everyone
else's surprise, the data revealed significant correlations between
homocysteine and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of almost 15,000 physicians, for example, those whose
homocysteine levels were highest had more than three times the risk
of heart attack as those whose levels were lowest.
</P>
<P>
   In an ongoing 50-year study of the population of Framingham,
Mass., an examination of more than 1,000 seniors found that
homocysteine levels corresponded to clogging of the arteries in the
neck. About 80 trials have suggested that elevated homocysteine is
associated with hardening or blockage of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The homocysteine hypothesis suddenly became respectable.
McCully's colleagues cite several reasons for the theory's belated
acceptance. In addition to the cholesterol prejudice, there's the
fact that, until recently, measuring homocysteine levels was
costly, difficult and time-consuming. But the latest homocysteine
blood tests are fast and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that there's a desperate need for a long-term
study to evaluate whether lowering homocysteine levels will in fact
help to prevent heart disease. But they say that even if the
connection holds up, homocysteine won't entirely eclipse the other,
more familiar, risk factors such as age, weight, smoking, blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `Well, I'll take folic acid and eat whatever I
want and I'll be protected,''' says Craig Scott, a cardiologist at
the University of Pennsylvania. High homocysteine levels don't
guarantee a heart attack, he says, and low levels won't rule one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do recommend folic acid for all my patients,'' Scott
says. ``It's something that everybody who's at risk for coronary
disease should consider doing as an adjunct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately such recommendations may scuttle efforts to prove
once and for all the merits of the homocysteine hypothesis. Federal
guidelines introduced in 1998 increased the amount of folic acid
that must be added to enriched grain products; that increase,
together with the growing popularity of B vitamins in cardiology
clinics, might eliminate any heart conditions caused by vitamin
deficiency and homocysteine surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results from the Framingham study, for example, show
that the new fortification program has added an average of 100
micrograms of folic acid to subjects' daily diets, resulting in a
sizable lowering of homocysteine levels, Krauss says. ``That's
going to make it difficult to do the studies that need to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCully, it's perhaps the final irony in a bittersweet
career.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Deborah Kara Unger, sipping tea in the garden at
Hollywood's Chateau Marmont Hotel, might think she's well
disguised. She's wearing a bulky suede jacket and her blond hair is
pulled back in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, all is fine. A bird flaps through the bushes.
Butterflies flutter about the bougainvillea. Everyone ignores her.
</P>
<P>
   Then an eager producer lands tableside, reminding her that they
met once in Toronto. Unger is polite, yet looks blank. The man
protests: He seems to think it was a memorable meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoopsie,'' says Unger as he walks away.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Unger doesn't enjoy being approached by strange men.
Although the actress, 33, has the image of an icy femme fatale _
mainly from her roles in ``Crash'' and ``The Game'' _ and although
she has appeared in a handful of nude scenes, she points out that
she is actually rather shy. So shy, she says, that she was a virgin
until she was 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are disappointed when they meet me,'' she
says, snapping out the words. ``Those people are usually silly and
they're usually male, and they can go back to the silly Web sites
they create about me. It feels like such a violation.''
</P>
<P>
   True, Unger is about to appear in two more films in which she's
not completely virtuous: In ``Sunshine,'' set during the 1959
Hungarian revolution, she plays Ralph Fiennes's married love
interest, and in ``Signs and Wonders,'' she's the mistress who
breaks up Stellan Skarsgaard's marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Hurricane,'' which recently opened, she plays a
Canadian activist fighting to free American prizefighter Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter from jail, where he languishes after being
framed for three murders.
</P>
<P>
   Director Norman Jewison was impressed when Unger, who was drawn
to the story intellectually and emotionally, flew in from Hungary
to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She showed up at my apartment in New York on a day when I was
reading two other actresses,'' Jewison remembers. ``She said,
`Please excuse the bags under my eyes.' And she really touched me.
As I got to know her, I realized she has an edginess to her, but
she also has a sensuous side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to go to work every day and not have to be some
sort of depraved vixen,'' says Unger, who was also elated by
watching Denzel Washington play Carter. ``He was exercising muscles
metaphorically that he hasn't exercised for a very long time. It's
inspiring to spend time around somebody who's that great an
emotional athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, Unger, who grew up in Canada, the daughter
of a doctor and a political activist, has not found herself
particularly inspired since she first landed in Hollywood eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no resonance to fame,'' she says. ``It's so valueless.
So there's a lot of sadness in this town. God bless the loneliness
of those people. It's hard to address what's ontologically valuable
when you're running from your shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who attended the Australian National Institute of
Dramatic Arts _ the alma mater of Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis and
Mel Gibson _ claims she's not running from anything; for her, she
says, acting is a means of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But as a child of divorce, she admits, she's had trouble
figuring out where her real home is. And psychotherapy wouldn't be
much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell me that going to a shrink brings any
retribution for your past _ so just get on with it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That was her attitude even as a teen-ager, when she finished
school a year and a half ahead of her peers. She was also
precocious in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very large mammary glands,'' she says of herself at 12.
``I looked like the teacher's mistress. But I ended up being
valedictorian, which was my retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger is not now _ and never has been_ anyone's mistress. But
after just ending a 3 1/2-year relationship with a producer, she's
hungry for love. And no, she doesn't mean wild sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with dim lighting and a very intimate
missionary position,'' Unger says. ``The missionary position and
candles. Nouveau sex. The journey back to blushing, I think, is a
fabulous one.''

<P>
   ``It was nice to go to work every day and not have to be some
sort of depraved vixen,'' says Unger, who was also elated by
watching Denzel Washington play Carter. ``He was exercising muscles
metaphorically that he hasn't exercised for a very long time. It's
inspiring to spend time around somebody who's that great an
emotional athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, Unger, who grew up in Canada, the daughter
of a doctor and a political activist, has not found herself
particularly inspired since she first landed in Hollywood eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no resonance to fame,'' she says. ``It's so valueless.
So there's a lot of sadness in this town. God bless the loneliness
of those people. It's hard to address what's ontologically valuable
when you're running from your shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger, who attended the Australian National Institute of
Dramatic Arts _ the alma mater of Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis and
Mel Gibson _ claims she's not running from anything; for her, she
says, acting is a means of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But as a child of divorce, she admits, she's had trouble
figuring out where her real home is. And psychotherapy wouldn't be
much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell me that going to a shrink brings any
retribution for your past _ so just get on with it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That was her attitude even as a teen-ager, when she finished
school a year and a half ahead of her peers. She was also
precocious in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very large mammary glands,'' she says of herself at 12.
``I looked like the teacher's mistress. But I ended up being
valedictorian, which was my retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Unger is not now _ and never has been_ anyone's mistress. But
after just ending a 3 1/2-year relationship with a producer, she's
hungry for love. And no, she doesn't mean wild sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with dim lighting and a very intimate
missionary position,'' Unger says. ``The missionary position and
candles. Nouveau sex. The journey back to blushing, I think, is a
fabulous one.''

<P>
   Here's a dilemma for the 21st century: You're a TV starlet with
a PG reputation who's yearning to go R. What's a girl to do?
</P>
<P>
   If pinup calendars and Playboy centerfolds used to be the
answer, today there's another way to for the countless litters of
sex kittens running around Hollywood to get the message across. If
you're willing to risk going risque, men's magazines are more than
happy to snap you _ topless or in lingerie, if you please _ and put
you on the cover, followed by an inside interview.
</P>
<P>
   A little T&AMP;A, followed by a Q&AMP;A, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an abundance in Hollywood of girls at the same
level,'' said Elizabeth Schulte, special projects editor for
Details. ``We get bombarded with requests. Once a girl has a series
on WB, I get a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that sells best for us is to show famous or
up-and-coming girls who are identified with a certain role and
image, and then get them a little sexier than what the public's
used to,'' said Jim Kaminsky, co-editor of Maxim. ``Take (December
cover girl) Lara Flynn Boyle. She plays a buttoned-down character
on `The Practice,' but I think she wanted to let people know she's
very pretty and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The holy grail of the men's magazine covers is to get a girl
who's interested in changing her image in a sexier light,'' said
Andy Clerkson, editor of Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Melissa Joan Hart syndrome. The popular young star
of the hit TV show `Sabrina the Teenage Witch' drew both extensive
criticism (including threats of being fired) and widespread
attention for her appearance on Maxim wearing little and striking
numerous provocative poses.
</P>
<P>
   A few brickbats aside, this new marriage of convenience is
proving to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. These
fledgling young starlets get seen before the ravenous eyes of
hundreds of thousands (sometimes over a million) of young men,
including casting directors and entertainment executives.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jack Wright, executive editor of Gear, his March
issue will feature a prominent actress who's ``much bigger than
Melissa Joan Hart,'' and who hopes to shed her sweet,
girl-next-door image.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fed up with the treatment on the other magazines that
continued the goody-two-shoes image,'' Wright said. ``So we came to
her rescue _ the cover image will be a huge leap from the character
she plays on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, chivalry isn't Wright's main motive. Magazines often
find their newsstand sales soaring _ Maxim delivers approximately 1
million at newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's too still early to determine whether this month's
Details cover girl, Selma Blair (of ``Cruel Intentions'' and
``Zoe'' fame), will sell more than January stunner Mena Suvari (the
dream girl of ``American Beauty''), magazine editors say Alyssa
Milano, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar can be
counted as reliable best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as magazines vie for the same pool of actresses to get
undressed, editors say they differentiate themselves in the way
they depict them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Maxim, you basically cut off the head and attach a new
one on the same bikini-clad body,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But while vamping the girls up (sometimes, at their insistence)
will certainly sell more copies, opinions vary as to how far they
should go. While an editor might fight to get the young lady in
lingerie or swimsuits, the publicist might offer her in a halter
top or other semi-revealing, but semi-respectable, outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases they (publicists) understand what we're trying
to do very well, and they let us do want we want,'' Kaminsky said.
``Other times it requires a negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, publicists try to fight the sexiness,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Details, under editor Mark Golin, has been trying to
strike a balance between showing beautiful actresses in a sexy
manner to increase circulation, but not too far-out to alienate
upscale fashion advertisers, as well as publicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Details, it's about a latent sexiness,'' Schulte said.
``Our reader has a little more class. With a lot of these girls,
this is the second or third cover and they're just starting out in
their careers. With a blatantly sexy pinup, it could ruin their
careers. They can get pigeonholed in a category as a pinup girl
instead of an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's about how comfortable the client is,'' said
Leslie Sloane-Zelnik of BWR in New York, and the publicist for such
actors as Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Shannen Doherty
and Gretchen Mol. ``I love all of the magazines, I think they're
great for different projects. But while I thought the Lara Flynn
Boyle cover was very sexy, it was also bit scary and maybe a little
overboard. It was a bit Playboy-ish. If the actress wants to do
that, then it's up to her.''

 &HT;    Yet another teen about to hit the road
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ One more child purportedly under my
supervision is about to enter the driving world. The rock 'n' roll
stepson turns 16 in March, and his new ride is sitting in the
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new ride, of course. Unless you're a car dealer and
thus privy to discounts that those of us not in the business don't
get, buying a new car for a 16-year-old makes about as much sense
as naming cats. Young drivers, at least the ones who have come out
of my household, tend to run into inanimate objects not long after
getting a license.
</P>
<P>
   It's best that they drive something that won't look much worse
with another dent in it. Let them practice on something cheap and
battered before actually ponying up money for something shiny and
new.
</P>
<P>
   In the stepson's case, the ride is a 1987 Dodge Dakota truck
with about 80,000 miles on it, well-maintained by its owner but
showing the normal cosmetic wear of a 13-year-old vehicle. One
would have thought we had bought the boy a brand-new BMW by the way
he reacted. That's the way nearly all of us feel about the first
vehicle we were able to call our own. I bet if you walk up to 100
people and ask them the year and make of their first car, 99 would
be able to tell you _ even people who can't remember their wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   My first car was a 1954 Dodge, and I was the third generation of
Borders males to drive it, starting first with my grandfather. I
loved that car, which could hold eight comfortably. It was in great
shape for being 17 years old, and I soon paid to have the
upholstery redone and put in lime-green shag carpet. (This was the
'70s, so I'm forgiven.)
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, after a few years, the automatic transmission died, and I
couldn't find a replacement and stupidly sold the car for scrap. My
brother a few years ago found a magazine advertisement in a
used-book store for the exact same car, down to the color and
hyped-up ``Powerglide transmission.'' If I ever find a version of
this car, I'm buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the stepson has great plans for the truck. New paint
job, all black. Lifters, or whatever you call those things that
jack it up high. Fat tires. A huge stereo system, which certainly
is a necessity since the cab is all of 5 cubic feet. Whatever. Keep
working at Denny's and save your money, I say. We bought the ride;
fixing it up is on his dime, though his grandparents sprung to redo
the interior _ all in vinyl, wisely. Teen-age boys spill soft
drinks, chips and Lord knows what else on the average of once every
three minutes. If I had it to do over again, I would have covered
his entire bedroom in naugahyde and put in a floor drain so you
could just hose it off every week or so.
</P>
<P>
   I had nothing to do with teaching him to drive, leaving it in
the hands of professionals and his mother, who seems to have aged a
bit in the past few months while riding shotgun as he drove around
town. My nerves are shot after teaching one ex-wife and two
daughters, and having an ancillary role in teaching a couple of
other kids. I rode with him the first time the day we bought the
truck. It could have been worse, but I got a charley-horse in my
leg stomping down on a nonexistent brake pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Lest one think we take this driving stuff too cavalierly, let me
hasten to add that I have been lecturing him regularly as I take
him to school on the vagaries of other drivers: How you can't trust
that someone is really turning just because they have on a turn
signal. Why you always look both ways before going through an
intersection, even if the light is green. Wear a seatbelt at all
times. Etc. I hope some of it has sunk in, but you never know. He
passed driver's education so he's state-sanctioned. There is only
so much you can do except worry, of course, which never ends.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be gone like the wind once he gets his real driver's
license, home for meals and sleep. That is the reality of turning
16, the first hard turn into adulthood and independence, though
there are plenty of curves along the way. Let's just hope he stays
on the road.

 &HT;    A look at tax rhetoric, from read my lips to so help me God
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Something about a Bush running for president and
talking about economic policy _ particularly taxes _ sends a
nervous tingle down the spine. It's kind of like watching someone
attempt a two-and-a-half backward flip off the high diving
platform. Will he survive?
</P>
<P>
   In a New Hampshire debate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, after
saying it's important to cut taxes both in good times and bad, was
asked, ``Is this no new taxes, so help me God?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only no new taxes _ this is tax cuts, so help me
God,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was unmistakable. In 1988, Bush's dad pledged, in
accepting the GOP presidential nomination: ``Read my lips: No new
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, President Bush acquiesced to a tax increase.
Two years after that, he was beaten for re-election by a Democratic
campaign with this slogan posted on the headquarters wall in
Arkansas: ``It's The Economy, Stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush had learned a painful lesson about the political
appeal of feel-good tax policy during his first run for the
presidency, against former California Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1980.
Reagan had shifted in the late 1970s from calling for spending cuts
_ ``Frankly, I'm afraid this country is going to have to suffer
two, three years of hard times to pay for the binge we've been
on,'' he said as late as 1978 _ to so-called ``supply-side
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   The supply-side theory, derided as ``the economics of joy'' by
the late Herbert Stein, chairman of Richard Nixon's Council of
Economic Advisers, let Reagan say he could increase defense
spending, cut taxes and still balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called it ``voodoo economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan won anyway, and the elder Bush quickly forgot the voodoo
tag when asked to be Reagan's running mate. In 1984, as the federal
debt escalated, Bush defended Reagan in a debate with Democratic
vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   When Reagan took over in 1981, Bush said, inflation and interest
rates were very high. ``This president turned it around, and I've
been with him every step of the way,'' Bush said. ``And of course I
would continue those kinds of programs because it's brought America
back. America's better off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, as Reagan was retiring, an increased federal debt and
continuing budget deficits made it seem Bush had been right in 1980
with his ``voodoo economics'' label. Bush won anyway, for what some
have come to call Ronald Reagan's third term.
</P>
<P>
   A recession began in 1991, and in 1992, the contention by
Democrat Bill Clinton and Independent Ross Perot that Bush just
didn't get it about the economy helped knock him out of the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 2000 _ a time of budget surplus _ and the
younger Bush's tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's carefully packaged to appeal to the traditional
Republican electorate, while letting Bush say he's helping ordinary
people'' by dropping the rate in the lowest tax-bracket from 15
percent to 10 percent, said Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas
at Austin government professor who specializes in the presidency.
``It's an effort to make real the `compassionate conservative'
tag.'' And that helps its appeal in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GOP rival John McCain's attitude toward use of the
projected budget surpluses leans toward that of Democrat Bill
Bradley, who talks about fixing the roof while the sun is shining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much in favor of tax cuts for middle-income and
lower-income Americans,'' McCain said during the recent Michigan
debate. ``I believe we must save Social Security, we must pay down
the debt, we have to make an investment in Medicare. For us to put
all of the surplus into tax cuts, I think, is not a conservative
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley and Vice President Al Gore continue to talk
about shoring up Social Security and spending a considerable amount
of the surplus in expanding health care. Even though Bush says his
proposal leaves money for Social Security, if he beats McCain, he
can expect to hear talk of irresponsible trickle-down economics
that would punish everyone who doesn't drive a luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either Gore or Bradley is going to be able to hammer him on
that,'' Buchanan said, ``and his claim that this helps the middle
class is going to seem empty.''

 &HT;    It's time for summer brides to find that perfect dress
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Take the average bride-to-be: excited to
be getting married, giddy in love, prone to sentimental daydreams,
with vague romantic notions about her wedding day and her bridal
gown.
</P>
<P>
   But put her in a bridal boutique and what does she see? White. A
whole avalanche of it, bows and beads and ruffles and veils. It can
be a little overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be, though, say bridal boutique owners. The
trend this season is toward simplicity, and if a bride gives
herself enough time to get a gown, it should fulfill all her
fairy-tale fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less has become more,'' said Janet Lally of A Formal Affair
and Tuxedo Co. ``We're not seeing too much lace or ruffles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of dresses are getting much simpler,'' said Gayle
Nesbitt of Le Palais Boutique. ``They're not wanting all the beads
and things. Simple is elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular shape for this season is an A-line dress with
natural fitted waistline, she said. Judy Panozzo of Victoria Rose
Bridal Parlor said strapless dresses are gaining popularity, as
well as dresses with spaghetti straps or tank top-style bodices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most girls that walk in here are saying simple, simple,
simple,'' Nesbitt said. ``They like the corset-look bodice, fitted
with nice seams.''
</P>
<P>
   Embroidery is becoming very popular, Lally said. Some dresses
have flowers, butterflies and other simple designs embroidered in
white, ivory or light pink.
</P>
<P>
   Satin remains the most popular dress fabric, particularly
Italian satin, which isn't as shiny as regular satin, Lally said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing some chiffons, too, but the girls like something a
little more sophisticated and drapey, something that hangs
beautifully,'' Panozzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Most brides still choose traditional white gowns, though brides
frequently are choosing dresses in ivory and shades between white
and ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Tiaras are very popular with brides-to-be, though not the
towering princess sort. Simple tiaras in gold or silver, and
sometimes rhinestones, with fingertip veils are popular, though
Nesbitt said some brides are choosing floor-length veils. Panozzo
said many brides are opting for veils with satin piping.
</P>
<P>
   Nesbitt said varying lengths of trains still are popular with
brides, though a bride should make sure the train is bustled or
there is some way she can carry it so it doesn't get stepped on at
the reception.
</P>
<P>
   As for footwear, ``to me, that's a bride's personality,'' Lally
said. ``I'll have some wear sneakers, I've had one wear Tevas, and
you see cowboy boots, combat boots. That's where their personality
comes out. I have one bride who's going barefoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, brides should begin looking for their gowns at least
six months in advance of the wedding, Panozzo said, because it can
take three months to order the dress and get it to the boutique,
then another six weeks for the seamstress to make alterations. All
three bridal boutique owners said they've done gowns in less time,
sometimes as little as a week, but such situations are very
stressful and a bride might have to settle for less than what she
wants.
</P>
<P>
   When trying on and choosing gowns, a bride should bring with her
someone who will give her an honest opinion and help her choose a
gown that not only suits her coloring and body type, but her
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they bring along a friend that's going to want the bride to
try on styles they would wear, that's not going to work,'' Lally
said. ``Generally a bride brings her mom and a bridesmaid. If you
bring too many girls then everybody's got an opinion and it gets
too confusing for the bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Panozzo advised not buying dresses on the Internet because ``it
may be cheaper, but you need services when you buy a wedding gown.
You need alterations, you need the dress pressed, you need a bridal
bag so you can transport it without getting it dirty. If you have a
problem with a dress you order on the Internet, you can't correct
it, it's your problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lally said the dress should be fitted for a bride as close to
the wedding as possible, pressed several days before the wedding
and hung somewhere it won't wrinkle or be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   And then a bride can go back to her giddy smiles and starry-eyed
daydreams. Assuming everything is OK with the cake, of course.

 &HT;    Hiaasen still skewering state with his `Sick' characters
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The title of Carl Hiaasen's latest satirical crime
novel is ``Sick Puppy,'' but the term just as easily could apply to
the Miami Herald columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen has populated his plot with some of the most repulsive
characters imaginable. Not surprisingly for the environmentally
concerned author, the worst ones are real estate developers and
their ilk. Shoat, the lobbyist in ``Sick Puppy'' (Knopf, $25),
shoots crippled big game animals at the Wilderness Veldt
Plantation, another character collects recordings of 911 calls and
sets them to music, and another has a fetish for Barbie Dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Hiaasen says, ``the lobbyist in `Sick Puppy' is an
amalgam of six different lobbyists. Each of them could have been a
villain. They have no social conscience and, for a novelist, that
makes an appealing villain. They'll go wherever there's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old Fort Lauderdale, Fla., native was a teen-ager
when he formed a hatred for developers and corrupt politicians who
were, as he put it, ``raping'' his state. ``I watched the
bulldozers move into my neighborhood. One day there was a piece of
forest where you could ride your bike, and the next day there's
concrete. You see every place you went as a child turned into a
shopping mall or a condominium complex. Finally you say, `Enough is
enough. I'm going to fight back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen retaliated with a torrent of words. After spending a
couple of years at Emory University and graduating from the
University of Florida in 1974, Hiaasen wrote for a small Florida
newspaper and then landed a job at the Herald as an investigative
reporter. Soon he was writing a twice-weekly metro column and
transforming some real-life situations into best-selling crime
novels such as ``Tourist Season'' and ``Striptease.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you ever get threats from the people you write about in
your novels?
</P>
<P>
   A: They never recognize themselves. It's the people who aren't
in the novels who think they are. I have a character, Skink, who is
an ex-governor who went off the deep end and became a hermit. I've
had several ex-governors suggest to me that they are Skink.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've done quite well financially with your novels. Why do
you continue to write a column twice a week?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many days I ask myself that question. The column is a very
appealing platform. If you write a book, it's nine months before
it's published. In the newspaper column, you can respond very
quickly and be in the paper the next day. You can keep the
spotlight on issues you think are important. It also keeps me
plugged into the real world. The temptation for any novelist is to
become isolated. The newspaper work fuels the novels and keeps me
angry enough to keep writing novels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are so many of your characters bizarre and over-the-top?
</P>
<P>
   A: Really, I don't have to exaggerate much. It's very hard to
compete with what's happening on the street. Whatever you invent as
a novelist, whatever you think is twisted and warped, it will
eventually come to pass. In the new novel, Mr. Gash collects 911
tapes and he plays them in his car and sets them to music. These
are (tapes of) people who are getting stabbed and burned. In Miami,
every night on the news we get treated to the horrifying sounds of
somebody losing their life because their 911 tapes have been
released. I figure it's only a matter of time before somebody
compiles these and puts them on tape. It's not too far from
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have a favorite character that you've created?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's gotta be Skink. Originally he was in a novel called
`Double Whammy.' He's this ex-governor, Vietnam War hero, who
discovers the state is completely crooked. Constantly frustrated,
he just walked out and went into the woods and eats roadkill and
doesn't come out unless I need him. I get so much mail about him,
people who wish there were a dark avenger like that. We all have
been going down a beautiful stretch of highway and see some guy in
the car ahead of you throw a hamburger wrapper out of the car.
We've all had the urge to run him down and teach him a lesson, but
we don't do it. Skink and my other characters act on these
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been skewering developers and corrupt politicians in
your books and columns for more than 15 years. Do you think you've
made any difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: You want to say there's been progress. I get mail from kids
who are passionate about these environmental issues. You touch
somebody and even if it's just one out of a hundred letters, you
feel you're making a difference in the world. That's what keeps you
going. You have to hope.

 &HT;    Montreal's affordable secrets well worth uncovering
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Sacre bleu!
</P>
<P>
   That's the reaction some people might get if they take a trip to
Montreal. Even with the favorable exchange rate, Montreal can be
hideously expensive _ unless you know where to get the bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is certainly worth the trip. It's a large, clean city
that has an air of Europe about it. It's easy to get around, has a
lot of sites worth seeing and a thriving nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting there: It costs about $350 for a ticket to Montreal,
but I got two tickets for that price through priceline.com, and
other Internet deals should also yield big savings. And Air Canada
makes the trip very comfortable. The Columbus, Ohio-to-Toronto leg
offers beverage/snack service. On the one-hour flight from Toronto
to Montreal (as well as the return) the airline also served a
``snack'' of _ get this _ a sandwich, salad, cookies and soft
drink, the kind of amenities that put airlines in the United States
to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you bring your birth certificate or passport; a
driver's license doesn't prove citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where to stay: Montreal has a slew of hotels, but beware. Some
aren't as opulent as American travelers are used to, and the big
chains are pricey. I generally dislike downtown accommodations,
especially in a city like this that has a clean, reliable and cheap
mass transit system. An alternative: Search the Internet for bed
and breakfasts (see the Web address below). The Au Gite Olympique,
for example, is a two-minute walk to the subway, just 10 minutes
from downtown and offers sparse but clean rooms for reasonable
rates. And with bed and breakfasts you can cut bargains for lengthy
stays. I paid $76.50 a night Canadian (about $52 a night American,
depending on the exchange rate).
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting around: Once in Montreal you can buy a Metro
(subway/bus) card for $12.25 Canadian. That's good for unlimited
rides for a week. You can also buy a three-day tourist pass for
$12. There's no better buy. The bus system is also a terrific way
to see any of Montreal's thriving neighborhoods because buses make
their way through Ontario, Saint-Catherine and Sherebrook streets,
just to name a few of the major boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   _ What to see: As in any big city, there are loads of
attractions that can cost an arm and a leg. But you can also tailor
your trip so you don't spend a bundle. For example, you could do a
tour of the city's churches, incredible structures built in the
1800s with architecture that takes your breath away. The best
example: The Notre-Dame Basilica in Old Montreal (Place de Armes
metro stop) is one of the most spectacular churches you'll ever
see. Some churches give guided tours for a small fee (Notre-Dame
charges $2) and others ask for a donation for a self-guided tour.
Consult any of the readily available travel books for a list of the
other churches throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   And if you like to walk, there's plenty to see. Start with the
Underground City _ incredible shops and cafes, all underground and
in the heart of downtown (Place de Arts, Peel and McGill metro
stops). Walk through Chinatown, Little Italy, the Latin Quarter,
Old Montreal, the Gay Village. Simply walking _ and seeing the
sites along the way _will take a lot of time, and you'll get
exercise in the meantime. For example, an approximately two-mile
walk down Saint-Catherine Street took two and half hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eating: This is the area that ``chews'' up the biggest part of
the budget. You have to add about 30 percent to the cost of the
meal to cover the provincial and federal tax and the customary 15
percent tip (some Montreal restaurants automatically add the
``service'' fee to your bill.) A beer or glass of wine will cost
about $6 and mixed drinks more, and it's not uncommon to spend $100
at Montreal's better restaurants. So you need to do you research
ahead and find places that won't break the bank. Among them: Da
Giovanni's, an Italian restaurant near McGill, where an
all-inclusive meal can be had for as little as $10.99. The dishes
with cream sauce are better than the red sauces, which shouldn't be
a surprise in a French-speaking province. Another way to cut costs:
Eat at the many cafes in the Underground City. You'll find enough
to fit any taste for dishes under $7 Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   _ Useful Web site: www.tourism-montreal.org/ offers information
on accommodations, hotel specials, travel packages, sightseeing
hints, bargains, a calendar and more. You can also call the
province's tourism department toll-free at (800) 363-7777.

 &HT;    Supermodels back in 'Vogue' _ and 'W'
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For the last couple of years,
supermodels have fronted fashion magazines about as often as
professional wrestlers. Striking poses in their place: Starlets and
singers such as Cameron Diaz, Lauryn Hill and Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the celebrity-drenched, enormously successful
InStyle magazine is partly to blame, but there's also been a
shortage of true uber-mannequins since Christy, Claudia and Linda
sauntered out of the photo studio. Simultaneously, fashion and
fashion photography went through a minimalistic phase in which
models were required to be little more than glorified clothes
hangers.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Gisele Bundchen, a 19-year-old Brazilian who some say is
scoring one for supermodeldom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's brought us out of that brief but boring period,'' says
James Scully, an editor with Harper's Bazaar. ``Gisele has made
everything swing the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a triple play unusual these days, Gisele decorates the
January covers of Harper's, Vogue and W. On the Harper's cover, a
heavy-lidded Gisele sports a Gucci python-print dress. For W, she
looks sophisticated and sleek in Donna Karan. For Vogue, she dons
more Gucci python for a smirky shot with model Carmen Kass.
</P>
<P>
   (Gisele is one of those rarities: A woman who photographs better
when she doesn't smile. Her December '99 Vogue cover, in which she
bares a perfect row of teeth, was less than flattering _ by
beautiful-and-stick-thin standards, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Vogue seems particularly enchanted with the 5-foot-11, 115-pound
stunner, naming her its Model of the Year for 1999. In addition to
the December cover, she shared space with Kate Moss, Lauren Hutton
and Iman on Vogue's November cover. The magazine points out that in
the ``last days of the 20th century, pretty much everybody in the
world wants (Gisele) to look good on his or her behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   That was undeniably true when designers showed off their Spring
'99 collections in New York last fall. Gisele strutted for every
last big name: Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, Tommy Hilfiger,
Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Versace, and on and on, more often than
not in the coveted first or last spot in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after she stepped off spring runways, Harper's Bazaar
tapped Gisele for its January issue (she also fronted the magazine
last summer).
</P>
<P>
   ``She conveys health and sexuality, which we haven't seen in
quite awhile,'' Scully says. ``It's been awhile since we've seen a
girl with breasts and hips.'' Gisele is no ``waif,'' like
supermodel Kate Moss. One fan site clocks her curves at 36-24-35,
and Vogue says she is making flat chests passe.
</P>
<P>
   Scully thinks Gisele will become the kind of model who moves
magazines off the racks by virtue of her mug alone. ``She has the
potential to become a personality,'' he says. ``There's more to her
than just her looks. She radiates a confidence that we haven't seen
in awhile. ... She will be the next Cindy.

know where to get the bargains. Montreal is certainly worth the
trip. It's a large, clean city that has an air of Europe about it.

hardly a ``beach town''; rather, an old Southern community that

here, out of the stream of time. (Hulbert, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   ANGELAS-ASHES _ Frank McCourt's autobiographical Angela's Ashes
is a remarkable book, rich in colorful, colloquial language,
detailing his destitute family's meager existence with a clear eye
and unexpected passages of genuine humor. A movie version was both
inevitable and unfathomable. Yet director-adapter Alan Parker has
done an exceptional job bringing the cherished bestseller to the
screen. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post). 35.

   MOVIES-CRADLE _ Movie review: ``Cradle Will Rock.'' Tim Robbins'
tale of American theater and reds. It's more a rant than a movie.

</P>
<P>
   CRADLEWILLROCK _ Like impassioned Depression-era composer Marc
Blitzstein, who wrote a folk opera that led to the demise of the
government's Federal Theatre Project employment program, film
director-screenwriter Tim Robbins has deeply felt, left-wing
political views and sees the world in shades of black and white.
Like scowling Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, whose Rockefeller
Center panorama depicted the entire world's political struggles,
Robbins attempts too much in his message-laden movie Cradle Will
Rock, but his fervent overreach still manages to be exhilarating
entertainment. (Erstein, Palm Beach Post). 40.

that's marked the festival for 21 years. (Longino, Atlanta Journal

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Ian Frazier, in his new book ``On the Rez''

whose sympathy for the Indian becomes a kind of personal search.
Frazier wants to BE an Indian; he wants, in particular, to be a
member of the Oglala Sioux, one of the Great Plains tribes that
joined almost on impulse one day in the summer of 1876 to defeat
Custer in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. (Skube, Atlanta

attracts millions of fans. We just didn't know they could read.
This week, however, Mike Foley's autobiography, ``Have a Nice
Day,'' is solidly pinned in the No. 5 spot on the New York Times
best seller list between Frank McCourt's ```Tis'' and David
Maraniss' Vince Lombardi bio, ``When Pride Still Mattered.'' In

   ``It's often hard to find something fashionable to wear when
you're disabled,'' says Kurt Rieback, co-owner of Professional Fit
Clothing in Burbank, Calif. ``We cater to people with physical
challenges. The goal is to give customers a chance to enjoy more
dignity and confidence in their dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt and his partner, Tom Pirruccello, join a growing cadre of
entrepreneurs across the country tuning into the needs of 54
million Americans who have difficulty buy clothing off the rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about dignity,'' says Tom. ``Stylish clothes help build
self esteem, and pave the way for smoother social interactions.
</P>
<P>
   CHOICES BUILD SELF IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   As Christopher Flynn, a quadriplegic for 10 years explains,
``Wearing jeans instead of sweats is a personal choice, and that's
what people with disabilities really want. If I go to a nice event,
I don't want to wear sweats and Ug boots. I'd like to wear jeans
just like anyone else, or dress pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt and Tom had clothes modified for Christopher, including
several pairs of jeans. A larger zipper and an elastic waistband
allow easier dressing, and a longer inseam means more comfort while
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just makes me feel better in the morning,'' says
Christopher. ``Because when I get up, I realize that I'm not going
to wear the same old clothes, you know, sweat pants again. The new
clothes give me options, and that's a huge difference in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple alterations like placing Velcro tabs on shirts while
still keeping the buttons on the outside help create a more natural
look. Small openings strategically placed in pants or shirts to
accommodate feeding tubes and drainage bags improves the fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was the administrator of a home for people with
developmental disabilities,'' explains Tom, ``I didn't like seeing
clients going around in muumuus, sweats, and shapeless garments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some had a tendency to wear polyester clothes that didn't
match. Maybe the inseams of the pants would be off, maybe higher,
maybe lower. And that's really uncomfortable. Plus, how do you
think people feel in ill-fitting, boring clothes day after day?
It's demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   FOCUSING ON ABILITIES
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously being in a wheelchair makes me different,'' says
Christopher. ``But I can try to fit in with everyone else by being
able to wear similar clothes, and by going to the same places. Then
I don't focus on the fact that I have limitations. I feel like I
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   A polar fleece jacket with a Velcro closure in the back made
Christopher's life easier, for example. ``From the front, it looks
like any other jacket,'' he says. ``But it's designed with wider
armholes, and has a longer zipper. The jacket is just the right
length so I can wear it comfortably while I'm sitting in a
wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   People who spend a great deal of time in a seated position often
prefer shirts or blouses with longer backs and shorter fronts.
Pants with a higher back also tend to be more comfortable, while a
low front waist band and longer inseam keep pants from cutting into
the body.
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING CROWDS AT THE MALL
</P>
<P>
   ``Navigating a shopping mall can be hard in a wheelchair,'' says
Kurt. ``It's also difficult for blind people, and those with mental
retardation or any number of disabilities. ``That's why we make
house calls.''
</P>
<P>
   With racks of Hawaiian shirts, khaki cargo pants, denim jeans,
and designer dresses, Kurt and Tom travel around to nursing homes
and all kinds of group living facilities. Bringing their wares
directly into the privacy of the living room and even the bedroom
when necessary, the two apparel pioneers try to make shopping fun
for residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers sometimes tell us their favorite colors so we can
coordinate and personalize their own individual look,'' says Tom.
``Blind people enjoy feeling and choosing their own fabrics, and
we'll help them with the colors. I really enjoy this job because
the customers appreciate us coming so much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not as glamorous as the bikini business,'' says
Kurt, who once sold swimsuits. ``But every day, I get to see how
happy these clothes make people. There's much more meaning in it.''

 &HT;     By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cuban President Fidel Castro says the American
people ``will react with a spirit of justice'' to the Elian
Gonzalez case. Castro may be
</P>
<P>
   wrong on many things, but he's right about this one. Recent
polls show that a majority of Americans want the 6-year-old boy
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   You have seen the vivid spectacle of righteous indignation being
orchestrated by some Cuban-American groups, led by the
Cuban-American National Foundation, and you've heard conservative
politicians shamelessly shouting ``Amen!'' in order to curry their
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Be skeptical. Although they're trying to appeal to the emotional
bias in all of us toward helpless kids, I doubt they have a genuine
interest in the human tragedy at the core of this issue. They see
poor Elian as a pawn.
</P>
<P>
   I've felt this way for weeks, but figured I was pretty much
alone on the issue until I saw the polls and learned that here in
San Francisco there are some folks taking to the streets and
saying, hey, not so fast. Maybe the kid should go home.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Committee to Return Elian Home to Cuba held a
protest at the San Francisco office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge was Gloria La Riva, a longtime newspaper
printer and political progressive of Mexican origin who has met
Castro five times in her capacity as national coordinator of
International Peace for Cuba Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The keep-Elian-in-the-U.S. crowd, she told me, is ``arguing the
merits of a government, not the child's needs,'' and _ inexcusably
_ showing little concern for the boy's mental state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't done anything to help him. He should be having
continual care,'' La Riva said.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government seems to be inclined to do the
right thing here _ that is, send Elian home _ it has been
procrastinating. The boy should have been sent back weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's unclear when he'll go (assuming he does).
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the government has made declarations, asserting
its jurisdiction over the child,'' La Riva said, ``we feel they've
delayed greatly in making and enforcing their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting document has been prepared by a University of New
Mexico sociologist, Nelson Valdes, entitled, ``Ten Reasons Why
Elian Gonzalez Should Be United With His Father.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keeping Elian violates at least two signed accords between
Washington and Havana designed to discourage unsafe voyages from
Cuba to the United States. They apply in this case and show clearly
that Elian should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1980 international accord on child abduction signed by the
United States requires the prompt return of abducted children.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, remember, was taken from Cuba by his mother (who died
crossing the sea) without the consent of his father or Cuban
officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 10th and last reason offered by Valdes is perhaps the most
compelling: ``Human decency, family love and common sense,'' he
says, ``dictates that this child and his father should be
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Delvis Fernandez of Hayward, Calif., is the president of the
Cuban-American Alliance Education Fund, a nonprofit organization
promoting relations between Cubans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez claims the Cuban-American groups that have gotten the
most attention in this matter aren't representative of the nation's
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing about our community is that we're frozen in the
Cold War days,'' he said. ``President Reagan was pretty much
responsible for developing this organization (of anti-Castro
Cubans), the Cuban-American National Foundation, and it has become
an industry in Miami. They are basically calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the average Cuban-American believes the child
should be with his father. When you talk to people privately, it's
a no-brainer. Despite the dislike many Cuban-Americans have for
Castro and the Cuban government, they say that's the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sad is that for over 40 years we've been fighting
Castro and there are people who are desperate and would reach out
to any issue, at any cost, to turn it into an anti-Castro weapon.
The tragedy is this boy has been turned into a poster child.''

&HT;     ILL-ADVISED ADVICE ON MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the latest politician to hop aboard the
anti-gay marriage bandwagon, Gov. Cecil Underwood wants the West
Virginia legislature to print the following on all marriage license
application forms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is designed to be a loving and lifelong union between
a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   A staff member explained that banning same-sex marriages is ``a
moral issue'' for Underwood. ``He just believes in family values
and family traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, a Republican, is hardly the first American politician
to speak so authoritatively about the institution of marriage, what
it was ``designed'' for, when and by whom. Much of Congress weighed
in on the subject in 1996, when it passed _ and President Clinton
signed into law _ the ``Defense of Marriage Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of their thinking was Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who
opined:
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional family has stood for 5,000 years. Are we so
wise today that we are ready to reject 5,000 years of history? I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some religious folks insist that modern marriage, as we
know it in the United States, was crafted (like everything else in
the world) by God, reviewable history tells us differently. No
architect, divine or mortal, ever sat down and designed marriage.
It has evolved over the millennia, adapting to and changing for
specific cultures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, though Gramm may not have heard (and conservative
Christians rarely mention it), the kind of official marriage that
existed during the times of the Old Testament isn't around anymore.
(Thank God.) Back then, and for centuries after, marriage wasn't
designed to be a loving and lifelong union between a man and a
woman. It was designed to be a productive and lifelong contract
between a father or brother and a husband for ownership of a
female.
</P>
<P>
   A breakable contract.
</P>
<P>
   Among the grounds then for dissolution of marriage was a woman's
inability to produce children within five years. If her husband
chose, he could send her back to her family as defective goods and
break the contract. Of course, women weren't allowed to employ such
an escape clause; infertility was believed to be all their fault.
</P>
<P>
   As millions of peasants and other socially inconsequential types
could have attested, official marriage stood for centuries as a
privilege reserved for people who had money, property and/or a name
to pass along. The nobodies were expected to just occupy a hut
together and raise their kids.
</P>
<P>
   But let's give Underwood the benefit of the doubt and figure he
meant to say, ``Modern marriage as we know it in the Western world
is designed to be a loving and lifelong union between a man and a
woman.'' Isn't it unfair (and misleading) to put that on a license
application?
</P>
<P>
   Design or no, about half the marriages in our country still do
not make it into the lifelong category. These days, a little more
than 50 percent of children live in family configurations that are
not the traditional mom, dad and kids.
</P>
<P>
   This may be sad or simply an inevitability of post-industrial
society, but it is reality.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is the widespread incidence of spousal abuse,
infidelity and just plain ``irreconcilable differences,'' all of
which can turn a loving union into a nightmarish one that only a
masochist would choose to stay in.
</P>
<P>
   If some politician wants to imprint a truthful and useful piece
of information on applications for marriage licenses, wouldn't
something like this make more sense?
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning: No matter how much in love you are today, you have a
one-in-two chance of ending up in a divorce court and possibly
despising the woman/man to whom you now join in official matrimony.
But if you work really hard and made a halfway decent choice in a
partner, you MIGHT stay together for the rest of your life. Good
luck.''

&HT;     SUCCESSFUL BOSSES KNOW THE VALUE OF GOOD EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are a boss with a bunch of unhappy, underachieving workers.
</P>
<P>
   You need help. Where's the first place to look?
</P>
<P>
   Try the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor that affects workers' happiness is the
quality of their immediate supervisor. If your employees aren't
cutting it, part of it may be your fault. And it may be YOUR boss's
fault, too. Companies spend a lot of effort recruiting managers,
then throw it all away by not training them adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 things every boss should know:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be a role model. You won't inspire employees if you have
sloppy work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your office isn't the place where ideas go to die.
Don't make workers ask you a question three times to get a
10-second answer. If you're too swamped to respond to a suggestion
or look over a report anytime in the next week, say so.
</P>
<P>
   Some bosses think working long hours is part of being a role
model, but it can backfire if workers take your efforts for
granted. They'll shrug and think that's what is expected of
managers _ or worse. Maybe they'll think you don't value your time
or you're a workaholic or your simply have no life. They may look
down on you instead of up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Long hours also backfire when a special project comes up. If
you're normally at the office 40 hours a week, you can suddenly
start working more to impress upon people how important the project
is, and how you're all in this together.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many managerial jobs require long hours, and you want
subordinates to know you're working hard. But for the
non-workaholics to respect you, they have to respect how you live
your life, not just how you do your job. If your job demands long
hours, think about quietly taking some work home so that you at
least maintain the illusion of having a life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus on your best people. It's easy to get bogged down
handling troublesome employees, but the best bosses spend more
energy helping their top workers get even better.
</P>
<P>
   With a good boss's help, a mediocre employee will turn into a
prettier shade of mediocre. But a good employee might turn into
something spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume they're inspired by the same things that motivate
you. Maybe you love the fancy title and huge paycheck, but your
employee might cherish recognition or opportunities for promotion
or extra time off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review performances frequently. You don't need a
paperwork-filled affair, but talk about job performance with each
worker at least four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that you're managing people, not just employees. In
``First, Break All the Rules,'' authors Marcus Buckingham and Curt
Coffman describe one question for managers from a Gallup survey:
``You have a talented employee who consistently shows up late for
work. What would you say to this employee?''
</P>
<P>
   Some managers would shrug it off or give a warning or fire the
worker, but the most effective bosses shared one response: ``I
would ask why.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Use criticism and praise effectively. Make criticism
constructive, and give it as soon as possible after the mistake
happens. Work with the employee to see if there are ways to prevent
the same mistake from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Don't criticize people in front of others. The anger and
embarrassment will be remembered long after the criticism is
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Offer a lot more praise than you do criticism, especially when
you can point to specific things the employee has done. And make
the praise sincere; employees can tell when you're blowing smoke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't inadvertently build stress. If you send an employee an
e-mail on Friday that says, ``I need to see you Monday at 10,'' you
create the possibility of a paranoid weekend. You know what the
topic will be and how significant it is _ or isn't. But the worker
has no clue.
</P>
<P>
   That note could lead to hours of pondering and lots of water
cooler conversations. Did I do something wrong? Is my budget being
cut? Am I being laid off?
</P>
<P>
   When a couple of workers screw up, don't send a note telling
everyone to clean up their act. Not only are you causing stress for
those who did nothing wrong, but you're wasting their time _ all
because you're too weak of a manager to talk to the problem
employees individually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make workers feel their opinions count. Survey employees
before you make major decisions. If that's not practical, explain
why.
</P>
<P>
   If you've already made up your mind, but haven't announced your
decision, don't patronize workers by asking for their opinions.
They'll see through the charade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Realize that ``face time'' can blow up in your face. One way
to kill creativity is to micromanage, to tell people not only what
they should do, but how they should do it. Be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Give employees goals, but let them to figure out how to get
there. Some people do their best work in a cubicle (or so I'm
told). Others do better at home or in the field or even in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   If you evaluate people based on how many hours they spend in the
office rather than their results, you're a lazy manager.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand that behind every counteroffer is a mistake. If
your competition lures away a valued employee, it means one of
three things: Your company can't compete, you didn't network enough
or you were unfair to her in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   If you network and you know what matters to each employee,
you'll already be offering your top people the most you reasonably
can. If a competitor offers more money or a greater opportunity and
she is ready to take it, keep in mind that things will never, ever
be the same.
</P>
<P>
   If you counteroffer and she stays, there is potential for
resentment on all sides. Other workers can resent what happened or
ask for more money. You might resent having your budget stretched
tighter than you're comfortable with. And the employee might feel
as if you were underpaying her for years before you found the extra
money for the counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be clear about how much (or how little) you value diversity.
``Diversity'' is a great employer buzzword, but if all you're
trying to do is jam people of different races and sexes into the
same corporate mold, that isn't diversity.
</P>
<P>
   True diversity involves having a wide range of perspectives,
which encourages creativity within the company and challenges the
old ways of doing things. If all you're looking for is
different-colored faces, you're talking about representation, not
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't give in to your own insecurity. Hire the most talented
people you can, even if it makes you less indispensable. When they
have good ideas, don't try to steal the credit. If you make a
mistake, admit it and move on.
</P>
<P>
   Great bosses don't just bring out the best in people; they have
people who bring out the best in them.

&HT;     OLD-SCHOOL BLUES ARTIST IS TOTALLY MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HECTOR SALDANA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jonny Lang, one of the leading modern blues performers on the
music scene today, is in some ways totally traditional.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old grimaces when he plays lead guitar, growls when
he sings, and his idea of R&AMP;B is at odds with the hip-hop variety
of Sean ``Puffy'' Combs.
</P>
<P>
   But a long-faced, serious Eric Clapton-style blues disciple he
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   For one, he doesn't mind hanging out with the three brothers who
make up the youth rock group Hanson. Plus, he likes listening to
James Taylor CDs on his tour bus. He has a quirky sense of humor,
is apt to check into hotels using the alias Douglas Fir, and he's
not the hard-living sort, either.
</P>
<P>
   His true nature is quite different from what his poster-boy good
looks exude.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he's a homebody, content to kick back when he is not on
the road, at his home near Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he hits a town and checks out bands. Last week at
a Jackson, Miss., tour stop, he caught alternative rockers Tonic,
but more important, he got in a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring my own clubs. I'm not too bad. I don't really suck,
but I kind of suck,'' he joked in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly golf game is his way of relaxing when he's not
promoting ``Wander This World.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not golfing on the road, Lang will likely be in his
hotel room, finger-picking his acoustic guitar. ``I never get sick
of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lang remains unfazed about meeting and working with some of the
biggest music stars in the world. In 1999, he played 11 dates with
the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is really possible to get close to Mick and the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, they're really nice guys,'' he said, not exactly the
usual description of the big, bad Stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm into the Stones. Mick was the guy I got to talk to the
most. He's just a really nice guy. They're not rock star-y at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lang did not join Keith Richards' infamous, late night
hotel room jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I just talked to Keith a couple of times. He's a wild
man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lang dismisses the ``age thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's hard to tell if people are being nice or if
they truly respect you, or whatever. It really doesn't matter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success (he has sold more than 1.5 million albums),
he still encounters people who think he is too young to sing the
blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to try to fight it. I set people straight when they're
ignorant. I've come to the conclusion that I really don't care,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to be in the recording studio in April. Lang says he
never has a plan going into the studio and ``just likes to go in
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I go beyond being a guitar player or just a guitar
band,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not worry about misconceptions about him, nor
does he worry about being pegged as a nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything too detrimental. I've never heard,
`Jonny's a smack addict,''' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever fantasize about making a shocking record? ``Not
really, mostly because I don't think people can be shocked anymore.
After Marilyn Manson, I don't think there's anything else to be
scared about.''
</P>
<P>
   Who does he like in the biz? ``I'm telling you, I really like
Hanson. I think they're really talented, and their next record is
great. They actually invited me to play on it,'' he said of the
recording by the Hanson brothers (Taylor, Isaac and Zac), all
younger than Lang.
</P>
<P>
   He is dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next record is just killin'. It's just rock,'' he said.
``They kind of stepped out of being commandeered by the record
label so much, and being teeny-bopper guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really nice guys, and they're so professional,'' Lang
said. ``Like in the studio, they never argue with each other.
They're just kind of, one guy has an idea, and it's `OK, let's try
that.' They're real pros and they know what they're doing and have
a great sense of musicality.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Lang lately listens to James Taylor's ``Hour
Glass'' _ the most listened to album on the bus lately _ and Stevie
Wonder's ``Music of My Mind'' ``I'm really into Dave Matthews Band.
I really like those guys,'' Lang added.
</P>
<P>
   He likes Beck, too, but is a bit lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I could sit to, and just close my eyes and
sit down and listen to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, he almost never listens to the blues, ``except for
maybe B.B.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang's approach to blues guitar solos ranks him among the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space sounds better than the notes played sometimes,'' he
said, a trick he learned from heroes B.B. King and the late Albert
Collins.

   TEXASDEMS _ As they trudged through Iowa and New Hampshire this
week, Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Bill Bradley may
have missed an important development in Pasadena, Texas: Ceole
Speight has started wearing a campaign button.Speight, an AFL-CIO
employee, was undecided for months. But after hearing about Gore at
the Texas AFL-CIO convention in Austin this week, Speight finally
picked her pin: Gore 2000. Her choice may be emblematic of larger
trends in Texas, which will hold its presidential primary on March
14. Several months ago, as Bradley surged in the polls and the Gore
campaign lurched toward a much-needed overhaul, the Texas race
looked like a toss-up. But Gore has since solidified his position
with organized labor, Hispanics, and other traditionallly
Democratic constituencies, and now he looks tough to beat in the
Lone Star State. (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman). 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The temperature is frigid. It's shockingly cold
and dry, as you'll find out from that jolt of static electricity
each time you shake a hand or plant a kiss. Here is a list of
seasonal tips for surviving the chill.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   AT HOME
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a heating pad on that critical 4-inch length of frozen
pipe leading to your toilet. The blow dryer is the indispensable
thawing tool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Line up winter clothes for younger school-age kids from top to
bottom (hats, scarves, coats, gloves, heavy socks, boots) the night
before. Pack the snow pants in a backpack if they are required by
after-school program. Otherwise, you might be scrambling for that
lost glove or hat, the kids will miss the bus, and you will be
forced to go out in the cold yourself and drive them to school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crank up the furnace and put on shorts and a T-shirt. Pull a
lawn chair out of the basement, sit in it, kick back with a
tropical drink and read a trashy novel. You'll swear you're on
vacation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow your large fluffy dog on the bed to snuggle.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BODY PROTECTION
</P>
<P>
   _ Lotion, Static Guard and lip balm. Don't leave home without
'em.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clothes dryer anti-cling sheets will pat flyaway hair back in
place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going to the gym is tough enough without the prospect of
pulling on clothes that have been freezing in the car all day: Warm
them under the hand dryer or a hair dryer for 10 to 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   _ A batch of hot toddies warms your insides _ just remember to
stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   AUTOMOBILE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   _ One way for drivers to keep hands warm: Take two pairs of
gloves with you. Sit on one set; wear the other. When your hands
get cold, put on the pair you were sitting on and warm up the pair
you were wearing the same way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Well-intentioned car owners who wash their salt-caked vehicles
in an attempt to eliminate road salt's corrosive effects can
prevent troublesome door freeze-ups with a few simple advance
procedures: Make sure your car's interior is warmed up fully; spray
your door locks with a standard lubricant such as WD-40, using the
thin nozzle extender so that the spray penetrates the locks. This
displaces moisture. Repeat every week or two in sub-freezing
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Also, spray the rubber gaskets inside your car door with a
standard furniture polish, to prevent them from sticking to the
metal door jamb.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   EMBRACE THE WEATHER
</P>
<P>
   _ Young kids and New York Air National Guard members who have
completed Arctic survival training know a great way to combat
temperatures that drop below zero: snow shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The snow acts as a kind of thermal blanket, providing a fun
place to play along with proven protection against murderous wind
chills. Such shelters are an antidote to cabin fever, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Air National Guard's pilots and crew members who graduate
from ``Cool School'' on pack ice over the Arctic Ocean near the
North Pole learn a variety of building styles _ from digging caves
in drifts to cutting snow blocks and fashioning igloo-style abodes.
</P>
<P>
   Kids can get the same benefits with low-tech digging, piling and
shaping a snow enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   A tip before you get started. Dress in layers and shed a few
outer layers while digging and making the snow shelter. Profuse
sweating is dangerous in sub-zero temperatures. Take frequent
breaks to prevent overheating. And drink plenty of water to guard
against dehydration. (Melting snow by keeping a drinking water bag
on the outside of a thermal shirt is a ``Cool School'' favorite.)
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to leave an entryway and vent hole in your snow shelter.
Make sure your enclosure is far enough from the road to prevent
getting hit by a snow plow. Make it large enough to allow some
movement inside. (Note: Snow caves are probably not a good idea if
you're claustrophobic.)
</P>
<P>
   _ And finally: Fall on the ice, get up, repeat 20 times. You may
warm up or you may just go numb, but either way you won't feel the
cold.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rush of bitter feeling over the flying of the
Confederate battle flag brings to mind my visits to Moscow in
Soviet times. Often I would arrange to stay in a hotel room, once
occupied by Vladimir Lenin, that afforded a fine view of the huge
flag that fluttered behind the Kremlin wall.
</P>
<P>
   Television people call that scene across Red Square an
``establishment shot.'' On a chilly night a decade ago, many
Russians wept when they saw the communist hammer-and-sickle symbol
come down, to be replaced by the same tricolor flag that flew there
in czarist times.
</P>
<P>
   The state flags of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi all bear the
diagonal cross of St. Andrew, the martyred patron saint of Russia,
of Scotland and of the Confederacy. (The combination of the
Christian crosses of St. Andrew and St. George make up the British
Union Jack.)
</P>
<P>
   There are scholars who study the symbolism behind these flags,
which were first widely used a millennium ago in the Crusades. The
overall pursuit is known as vexillology, from the Latin vexillum or
``banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the media, the current crop of presidential
candidates have reluctantly become obliged to also ponder the
meanings that lie behind the display of these flags _ particularly
the Confederate battle flag that flies over the state capitol in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson has further widened the controversy by
urging contestants in the 2000 Super Bowl, to be played in Atlanta,
to lodge a televised protest over the 44-year-old makeup of the
Georgia state flag, which also incorporates the Confederate icon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not at all surprising that some folks decry the display of
such flags, especially at official sites, as an abhorrent reminder
of slavery and as a racist challenge. Nor is it surprising that
other folks cherish these flags as a precious link to their
mythologized past, what the narrator of ``Gone With the Wind''
termed ``our way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Flags carry lots of freight. Until modern times, unarmed
soldiers would often march into battle carrying only a tattered
standard in an effort to buck up their frightened comrades.
Nowadays, a majority in Congress favors making it a crime for
anyone to burn the U.S. flag.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican candidates say that a flag's official display
should be viewed merely as a state issue that does not bear on
their quest for the White House, they are ducking their
responsibility in pursuit of votes.
</P>
<P>
   When Democratic candidates denounce these displays as racist or
when Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party hopeful, defends them, they too
are ignoring the complexities of the problem in order to preserve
their standing with their political base.
</P>
<P>
   Serious candidates should be seeking ways to bring polarized
people together, to heal the wounds that divide them and to
negotiate compromises. That process is called leadership. It's a
valuable asset for any occupant of the Oval Office.

 &HT;    WILL GLOBAL TECH TRENDS MAKE PRESIDENTS LESS IMPORTANT?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares to deliver likely his
last State of the Union address Thursday, officially slipping into
the twilight of his time in office, many believe the presidency
itself might be on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, some say, perhaps even government itself, is
losing its steam as an engine of influence, hopelessly outpaced by
the thundering convergence of technology, borderless information
flows and the rise of the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Government at all levels is only beginning to reckon with these
shifts, which old models of law and regulation sometimes struggle
to control even at the margins, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these changes, though, the presidency too has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Long regarded as the most powerful institution in the world, the
presidency arguably has assumed more authority and reach than at
any time in its history.
</P>
<P>
   While no one can doubt the growing impact of the Internet,
Silicon Valley and Wall Street on the daily lives of all Americans,
only the president can rally truly global resources around American
ideals to combat the timeless ills of poverty, war and the quest
for equality.
</P>
<P>
   As the world moves increasingly toward becoming a single
interconnected village, it is that unique ability to build and
harness a worldwide consensus that is widening the circle of
presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency will remain as important as it is or will
become more important,'' said presidential scholar Michael Nelson,
professor of political science at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' said Emory University's Robert Pastor, ``the
office does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The taproot of presidential power is the Constitution, which
designates the chief executive, the only official elected in a
national vote, as the sole representative of all the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever authority is conferred by elections in a democracy is
conferred by the whole country on the president,'' said Nelson.
``Nobody else can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   That conferred authority reflects the state of the nation, and
it would be hard to argue that any country in history has possessed
the military, economic and political pre-eminence that this country
now holds.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, even the closest U.S. allies are a full generation
behind American defense capability. During last year's air war
against Serbs in Kosovo, the United States kept secret from its
NATO allies the highly effective stealth portion of the campaign,
essentially conducting a war within a war.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the United States kicked out a record $9.5
trillion worth of goods and services last year, far more than any
other country in history and accounting for more than one-fourth of
the entire world's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   And politically, the United States stands as a beacon to
countries caught up in the global move toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the nation's greatest strength as a global power lies
in its ability to build an international consensus around values
and interests important to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's watch, that ability has been almost constantly on
display as he has patched together multinational responses to war
in the Balkans, despotism in Haiti, economic crises in Mexico,
Russia, Indonesia and South Korea, and humanitarian disasters in
Turkey and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions for putting together coalition-type action _
the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade
Organization among them _ are hardly tools of American policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States commands a dominant, in some cases
decisive, position in each of those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the president, far more than Congress, that determines
how the United States wants those institutions to be structured and
to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is a clunky institution of 535 people that can't
negotiate as a unit with global corporations or entities,'' said
Alan Ehrenhalt, editor of Governing magazine. ``It's the president
who is capable of making deals with global institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the president, indeed, who appoints envoys to those
institutions, negotiates the treaties that bind them and delivers
the public and private counsel that helps guide them, leaving the
indelible imprint of American priorities on every major initiative
they undertake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means, for example, that we can advance our interests in
resolving ethnic conflicts, in helping address the problems of AIDS
in Africa, of contributing to the world's economic development, of
promoting human rights,'' said Pastor, editor of a new book, ``A
Century's Journey,'' that elaborates on the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are American interests,'' said Pastor, ``and through the
United Nations Security Council, we can leverage our power to
encourage other countries, and these international institutions, to
advance them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars argue that global shifts are undermining the
authority of all sorts of traditional institutions, even while
making it possible for non-traditional groups to step in and assume
important new roles.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams, for example, used e-mail
to generate a worldwide grassroots consensus for her International
Campaign to Ban Landmines. Her high-tech end run around White House
policy makers left Clinton virtually alone among world leaders in
not supporting the ban, which runs counter to Pentagon strategy in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's presidency, the Internet has gone from an
obscure tool of the Pentagon and academia to potentially the most
powerful communications medium in the history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, moreover, has both accelerated and come to
symbolize a much broader set of economic, political and social
changes sweeping the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly $7 trillion worth of goods and services will be sold
across borders this year as workers from some of the poorest
countries in the world bid for a growing share of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Currency traders move an estimated $1 trillion around the
world each day, making decisions about the futures of markets and
entire national economies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly 4 billion people, two-thirds of the Earth's population,
now participate in some form of democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   Put it together, and the world is undergoing a populist
revolution of historic proportions. More and more it is people, not
governments, that are taking control of the issues affecting their
lives, as politicians often appear to be watching from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects, political systems are increasingly at the
mercy of technology,'' said presidential scholar Michael Genovese,
political science professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it probably will do is make central governments less
important and, therefore, presidents less important,'' said
Genovese, author of 11 books on the presidency, including the
forthcoming ``Power and the American Presidency,'' to be published
this summer by the Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in the next 20 years,'' Genovese said, ``we will
increasingly see an institution, the presidency, that is less
significant and less powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Others counter that the presidency is, by design, resilient to
moments of great change. That, in fact, is part of the genius of
the founding fathers, said Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 20 years that I've been teaching political science, a
recurrent prophecy is that the presidency is being weakened by this
or that,'' said Nelson. ``It just doesn't seem to happen.''

&HT;     AIR EXEC MAY WORK MAGIC WITH HAPLESS WIZARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Washington Wizards, who haven't sold out a
home game in two seasons, should start peddling tickets to
practice. Air Executive will be there, pushing, prodding, going
where no team owner has gone before. To the hoop. To the boards.
Into players' faces, under their skin.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan was a merciless boss to his teammates on the
Chicago Bulls, always blistering someone.
</P>
<P>
   What will he be like now that he is really, formally,
officially, the boss?
</P>
<P>
   This will be a fascinating saga, and only two things look
absolutely certain. One, Nike will try to market a shoe for the
occasion. And two, Jordan, as always, will be one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the fun, though, if he were a trendsetter.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Kevin McHale, the Timberwolves' general manager,
has been known to step onto the court and tutor Kevin Garnett and
Joe Smith in the art of the low post. But he isn't a co-owner,
doesn't operate in the rarefied air of the Turners, Steinbrenners,
Reinsdorfs and Huizengas.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan just joined that club, as a junior member.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's going to fraternize with the help. Or, more likely,
terrorize them.
</P>
<P>
   The only other NBA owner with that sort of nerve is the
Energizer Bunny in Philadelphia, Pat Croce, who made his money as
an uber-personal trainer. Magic Johnson, when he had a small slice
of the Los Angeles Lakers, could have tried the hands-on approach,
but he wasn't the head of basketball operations, as Jordan is in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan says he wants to stare down players, to learn whether
they have the innards of real competitors. He wants to challenge
them, to let osmosis do its thing. This is his chance to show, or
at least the NBA's chance to see, that Jordan didn't excel because
of his vertical leap, his speed or his shooting touch. A lot of NBA
guards have his physical ability. Some have more. No one has his
desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell, in his day, might have come close. He imparted it
to his Boston Celtics teammates, just the way Jordan did to the
other Bulls, making champs of Steve Kerr, of Horace Grant, of Luc
Longley and Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can he do the same with Mitch Richmond, Juwan Howard and
Rod Strickland, even if he dresses only for practice? The word on
those three is that they are the Wizards' albatross, consuming the
salary cap and converting all that money into loss after
disappointing loss.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a reason they are making so much money. At one
point, not
</P>
<P>
   too long ago, Howard was considered a prize, famously coveted by
Pat Riley. There has to be some of that potential left in him. It
couldn't all have been a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Put Howard in practice with Jordan and his pride alone should
elevate his game instantly. Jordan is the gold standard to young
NBA players, but only the Wizards will get to measure themselves
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important is this: Very few people can tell the cosseted
youngsters in the NBA that they aren't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Riley can. Phil Jackson can. Jordan can tell them that they
stink, and rather than sulk, they'll try to prove him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell them to stand on their heads, pinch their noses and
bark out loud and they'll probably do it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Strickland has rescinded his let-me-out pleas and said
he wants to work under Jordan. The Wizards may still find a way to
unload him, because Jordan has executive powers and he will surely
wield them as aggressively as he played every game.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the biggest problems in the NBA is the persistent
game of musical rosters. A player isn't happy? Trade him. You'll
probably get another cranky guy in return, but at least you look
like you're doing something.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals rarely work. On good teams, players fear being
traded. On good teams, management doesn't scheme to jettison its
best-paid players. It worries about how to hold onto them.
</P>
<P>
   When dumping players looks like the only way out, a club is
trapped. Jordan can pluck the Wizards out of their predicament just
by being who he is, just by being around.

   Everyone, it seems, is jumping into the Net these days _ and
teens are no exception.

<P>
   Parents will be happy to know that some of the time teens spend
on-line is devoted to school-related research. But when work is
done and it's time to play, where do teens go? Here are some of the
sites that those in the know are likely to have bookmarked:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; bolt.com &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think of this as an ivillage.com for teens. Bolt has managed to
create an on-line community for the young that even AOL might envy
_ and it seems to have been built mostly through word of e-mouth.
Though Bolt provides teens with free e-mail and voice mail, the
real draw is that the site is constantly offering fun free stuff,
forums on interesting subjects and links to other cool sites.
 &UR; gurl.com &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the big sister a teen always wanted. She gives great
advice and top-secret ``girlie'' info, she introduces you to her
friends and she takes you shopping. Created by young (although not
</P>
<P>
   teen) women, gurl.com features everything from gynecological
information to sports lessons. It provides the tools for visitors
to build their own home pages, and it runs open forums in which
they can sound off on teen-related issues. The tone is smart, savvy
and funny without being preachy.
 &UR; cdnow.com &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For teens, music and the Web are a perfect match. That's why
CDNow is so popular. In addition to allowing visitors to sample and
buy the latest releases, the site enables them to pursue their
passions in music. You can find information about Ricky Martin in
hundreds of places on the Web, but where else can a fan of an
obscure band such as Gay Dad find news and information about that
group as well as other fans to hook up with?
 &UR; alladvantage.com &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What could be better than spending an afternoon surfing the web?
How about getting paid to do it? That's right, AllAdvantage
actually pays people for their surfing time. The catch (you knew
there had to be one) is that you have to agree to add to your
screen a special viewbar that displays banner ads as you move from
site to site. It's not a bad deal, though, because AllAdvantage
creates a ``member profile'' for you designed to bring you
advertising that matches your interests.

<P>
   No, I don't understand the name, but then, I'm not part of the
target audience for this site: teens (and adults) who are into
video games. Billed as the ``true voice of today's gamer,'' Happy
Puppy offers info, updates, tricks and everything else a video-game
junkie needs to survive. If you want to know whether it's worth it
to fly to Japan to score a Sony Playstation 2 (it won't be
available in America till the fall), check out Happy Puppy.

   So much of the clothing available on the web looks like what

designs from Manhattan boutiques, giving trend-forward teens from
other cities a chance to sport the very latest styles. NetSetGoods
is a teen's candy store with products a girl or guy would love to
own but isn't likely to come across in his or her local mall.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's the San Francisco dilemma: how to love thy
neighbor without angering thy neighbors. I'm not sure there is a
way to open a homeless shelter without causing a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   But here's how to cause a very big ruckus indeed.
</P>
<P>
   First, tell people you're opening a shelter in their
neighborhood, no matter what they think about it. Be perceived as
arrogant, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Second, don't house the homeless already in the neighborhood,
but bus in new homeless people, young ones with a propensity for
drug use and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Third, lay a guilt trip on the liberals of the neighborhood for
caring more about the life savings they've invested in their homes
than the lives of runaway kids they've never met.
</P>
<P>
   This is the bad start the Metropolitan Community Church got off
to more than a month ago when the Rev. Jim Mitulski decided to
house 20 (now 10) ``gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer and
questioning youth'' at the church's branch on Church Street in Noe
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a community uproar, a petition against the
shelter signed by hundreds of merchants and residents, and final
approval of the shelter (with $54,290 in funding for three months)
by the city's Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, following a debate
that moved gingerly through a minefield of neighborhood concerns,
gay politics and homeless advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten young people now have a place to get out of the rain, get
showers and get counseling, and things probably will be as placid
as they ever were in Noe Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But if this is what it takes to put a temporary roof over the
heads of the rest of the 14,000 homeless people in San Francisco,
God shelter us all from the storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got a reaction like this when I was passing out pot to
protest the ban on medical marijuana,'' Mitulski told me before
Christmas when the uproar started.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of minister Mitulski is. He's a self-described
``'70s kind of guy,'' a social activist and you-know-what
disturber. He seemed surprised by the fuss he caused, and said he
didn't mean to seem arrogant in his dealings in Noe Valley. His
idea, he said, was to follow the teachings of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sure way to get in trouble. You get in even more
trouble if you imply that your neighbors in the city of St. Francis
are behaving ungenerously toward the needy.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, Mitulski's public relations man tried to get
me interested in the issue. (Yes, Mitulski has a PR man, and he
isn't the only minister in town who does.) In my years in San
Francisco I've lived in three houses within a few of blocks of the
proposed shelter, and I was torn.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer live in the neighborhood, but I have old friends and
neighbors who feel the shelter was rammed down their throats by
Mitulski and Supervisor Tom Ammiano, who sponsored the funding
package.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I priced some homes in Noe Valley and couldn't
afford them. I had to ask myself honestly: If I put everything I
had into a house on Church Street, how would I feel if I found out
a bunch of homeless kids, possible hustlers and drug users, were
going to be my new neighbors?
</P>
<P>
   I had to say I wouldn't be happy, even though I'm familiar with
the good people and good works of the Metropolitan Community
Church. I especially wouldn't like to be guilt-tripped about my
unhappiness, or have it implied that I'm prejudiced against those
who are ``gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer or questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing the right thing for homeless people,
we're all questioning.
</P>
<P>
   I asked my wife, who generally is disgusted or frightened by
homeless people, what she thought. She surprised me by asking what
difference 10 mixed-up kids would make in the neighborhood,
especially if they were adequately controlled, as the MCC has
promised. She reminded me of some of the Noe Valley neighbors we
had.
</P>
<P>
   There was the redneck with the wrecked cars in his yard, the
teen-ager who shot herself to death, the homeless guy in the
schoolyard, and the dope peddlers who did business there on
weekends. There were Mother Teresa's nuns, the kid who covered
everything with graffiti, and the eccentric but charming
millionaire who had valet parkers running all over the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was a neighborhood that looked a bit like a suburb, but it
was part of a real city where dividing lines are hard to find. For
personal reasons, I had to leave Noe Valley and would be the last
to tell its residents what to think. But, after all this fuss, I
doubt those 10 kids are going to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mitulski seemed chastened by his experience, and
willing to get off to a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope what comes out of this is a program that's a success, a
tribute to Noe Valley, and can be replicated in other
neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As I left City Hall, Sister Bernie Galvin, the tireless
campaigner for housing for homeless people, was practically
bouncing up and down with frustration by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just recently, the mayor was saying churches should do more
for the homeless, and now we have this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the churches already do much more than their share,
and churches are located in residential neighborhoods. Loving thy
neighbors takes boundless sensitivity when some have $600,000
Victorian homes and some have wet cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   A national failure in housing and mental health care has led to
a city's police holding action and a needless confrontation between
a liberal church and its liberal neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Ten kids are out of the rain for three months at a cost of
$54,290 and a lot of bad feelings. There must be a better way.

&HT;     BILL WOULD ALLOW MOTHERS TO ABANDON NEWBORNS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A bill that would give unwanted newborns a
second chance at life by allowing their mothers to legally abandon
them is winning praise from social workers, public safety
employees, as well as both opponents and supporters of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced Wednesday by state Sen. James Brulte and Assemblyman
Ken Maddox, both Republicans, the legislation would allow mothers
with unwanted babies 30 days or younger to drop them off at police
or fire stations, social welfare offices, child protective agencies
or county hospital emergency rooms with no questions asked and no
threat of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The only national survey, conducted by the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services based on searches of news reports, found
that of 65 babies abandoned in 1991, eight died. In 1998, the
number jumped to 105, and 33 were found dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law gives babies a second chance,'' said Maddox, who
began looking into legislation after hearing about a baby left in a
garbage container in October. The boy was discovered by two
employees of a Walnut Creek dental clinic. The boy has been put up
for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Brulte acted at the prodding of a San Bernardino County woman
whose organization recovers the bodies of unwanted babies and gives
them dignified burials.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers and groups on both sides of the abortion debate
say the bill has a good chance of getting the bipartisan support
both legislators are hoping for when hearings begin as early as
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Although most groups had not seen the specific legislation,
which mirrors a Texas law that became the first of its kind in the
nation last September, they indicated it could save babies' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very encouraged that legislators are considering
dealing with this heartbreaking issue, and offering a safe haven
for women who would allow their babies to be put up for adoption
rather than discarded,'' said Jan Carroll of the California
Pro-Life Council.
</P>
<P>
   The state chapter of Planned Parenthood agreed, although a
spokeswoman echoed the views of other child advocates who pointed
out that the legislation was not a solution to unwanted children.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this comes far after the fact, when intervention should
be earlier, we don't want women to be further stigmatized by
criminalizing the abandonment,'' said Kathy Kneer, of the state
chapter of Planned Parenthood in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the real issue is making sure everyone knows their options
in a timely way,'' Kneer said. ``We need to start at the front end
of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12,000-member National Association of Social Workers also
may support the legislation. Denny Ah-Tye, who serves on the
association's child welfare committee, said he would recommend
endorsement from the group's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had this when I was doing adoptions 20 years ago,''
said Ah-Tye, a social worker with the San Joaquin County child
protective services division, noting that if mothers had not feared
prosecution, some might not have abandoned children in fields.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, billboards have sprung up in the Houston area _ where
11 babies were found in a nine-month period _ asking women not to
discard their newborns and telling them where to go for help.
</P>
<P>
   Ah-Tye said getting out information sensitively is as important
as passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox said he hopes the bill ultimately will include money for
publicity and public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Moran, legislative advocate for the Sacramento-based
California State Firefighters Association, a professional trade
organization that represents 27,000 employees, said the proposal
sounds positive, but would need scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people assume fire departments have 20 to 30 guys
working at one time,'' he said, ``but some have three people on
duty. What happens if you get a call and someone's dropped a baby
off?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``we don't want to have abandoned
babies. That's just horrible. We've done worse things than having
to change a diaper.''

CROWS SOARING HIGH ON `LIFE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Eds.: An umlaut is needed over u in Immergluck) 
 
By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a stumper of a ``Jeopardy'' category that Alex Trebek can
add to the big board: Band Members.
</P>
<P>
   _ For $200, name any member of Counting Crows other than lead
singer Adam Duritz.
</P>
<P>
   _ For $400, name a person in the Dave Matthews Band other than
the title singer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the curse of being part of the supporting musical cast, as
opposed to a band leader, and dates back to when big bands were
named for frontmen like Tommy Dorsey and Harry James.
</P>
<P>
   In rock, unless a player is a member of the Beatles, the Rolling
Stones or the Spice Girls, he's just a supporting player. Some
musicians can't take that sort of ego check and seek out their own
above-the-marquee status _ Geri Halliwell, Joey McIntyre and former
Go Go Jane Wiedlin, for example.
</P>
<P>
   For others, like Counting Crows guitarist Dan Vickrey, it's a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being recognized has its perks and downsides, but personally
it would be weird if I got noticed,'' Vickrey said by phone from
his Los Angeles home. ``To be able to eat at restaurants without
being interrupted, it's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a humble response, but if there was ever a case for band
members getting the same recognition as their lead vocalist, it's
Counting Crows.
</P>
<P>
   Since the group formed in 1990, Duritz has been providing
grainy, winsome prose about people who are needed or in need.
Without Vickrey's and David Bryson's guitars, Charles Gillingham's
keyboards, and percussion by bassist Matt Malley and drummer Ben
Mize, however, the words would be just poetry on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Matthews and the band Blues Traveler, Counting Crows
provides one of the largest, layered, improvisational rock-band
experiences currently touring.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are likely to hear favorites like ``Rain King'' lapse into
a chorus of Bruce Springsteen's ``Thunder Road'' or a bluesy,
nearly unrecognizable rendition of the signature hit ``Mr. Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   That's if the Crows stop getting complaints from fans who want
to hear the original upbeat version as played on the group's debut
album, ``August &AMP; Everything After.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call what people say about the slow version (of
''Mr. Jones``) exactly feedback,'' Vickrey laughed. ``People want
to hear the song they recognize, but Adam has to sing it, and for a
long time he didn't like how it felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Purists will be happy to know that lately, the band has been
playing the uptempo ``Mr. Jones'' with greater frequency _ a
reflection that Duritz and the band are loose, happy and content
with the success of their album ``This Desert Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Look further back in history and you'll see that the live
mutations of ``Mr. Jones'' have always served as the Crows' mood
ring. The group's jubilant, early party versions were symbolic of a
young band whose first big break was filling in for Van Morrison at
the 1993 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction _ a group whose first
album went to No. 4 on the Billboard charts and didn't leave the
list for 93 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Months earlier, even Duritz was a virtual unknown. Counting
Crows was a San Francisco phenomenon who had spent several years on
the Bay Area circuit before winning the BMI New Music Showcase in
February 1992 and getting signed by David Geffen's DGC Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Counting Crows put my entire show on the map. They had
offers from 12 labels the day after their performance,'' says
showcase organizer Nadine Condon. ``Adam's unique voice helped
invent the AAA (Adult Album Alternative) radio format.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``August &AMP; Everything After'' hit paydirt, the Crows
gleefully did the whole ``it'' band circuit: ``Saturday Night
Live,'' opening for the Rolling Stones, and using their muscle to
get favorite college radio artists like Alex Chilton and Buffalo
Tom to tour with them.
</P>
<P>
   Duritz has called ``August &AMP; Everything After'' the ``mopey
album'' and its follow-up, ``Recovering the Satellites,'' the
``recovering from being mopey'' album. It was a slow healing. The
second album was three years in creation, and the songs were an
L.A. rock fable of being grated across the celebrity scrub board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovering the Satellites'' wasn't nearly the commercial
success of the Crows' debut, and the metronome on ``Mr. Jones''
started slowing considerably. By the time the band released its
live double-album, ``Across the Wire: Live in New York,'' it had
become a melancholy harmonica jam with an ironic bit of the Byrds,
``So You Want to Be a Rock &AMP; Roll Star,'' opening the first verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The live album was a snapshot of where we were at that moment
in time and was generally for the fans,'' Vickrey said. ``I think
Adam's state at the time comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jones''' return to its original tempo may have to do with
the group enjoying its first official renaissance. Well-rested
following a holiday break, the band is resuming its tour for the
well-received ``This Desert Life.'' Last week the album was resting
at No. 41 on the Billboard 200 after 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Crows had entered their Los Angeles home studio with
absolutely no songs written and came out months later with an album
that sounds neither mopey nor in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of producer Dave Lowery _ moonlighting from his
job as Cracker's vocalist _ the first single, ``hangingaround,'' is
the first loose band jam since ``Mr. Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the studio with nothing was more stupidity than
anything. I was thinking, `God, this could take years,''' Vickrey
said. ``It happened to work out well, which says a lot about the
current personality of this band.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour has already been to Europe and will continue in North
America and Australia through this year.
</P>
<P>
   Opening for the band on the tour is Joe 90, a junior guitar-jam
ensemble signed to Duritz's label, E Pluribus Unum. Joining
Counting Crows for its set is guitarist and longtime friend David
Immergluck, who played mandolin on the original studio recording of
``Rain King.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point no one in Counting Crows is a nobody, whether fans
know their names or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good push-and-pull between music and vocals right
now and are very confident with each other,'' Vickrey said. ``That
started in the studio and has continued to be the case on the
road.''

`FOSSE' REVUE DELIVERS THE OLD RAZZLE-DAZZLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``Fosse.''
</P>
<P>
   One word says it all.
</P>
<P>
   It summons up the man, the career, the choreographic style of
one of the major figures in American musical theater and dance.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fosse (1927-87) danced in nightclubs and movies, on Broadway
and television.
</P>
<P>
   As director and/or choreographer, he guided some of Broadway's
biggest hits, including ``The Pajama Game,'' ``Damn Yankees,''
``Redhead,'' ``New Girl in Town,'' ``Sweet Charity,'' ``Pippin,''
``Chicago'' and ``Dancin'.'' He directed the films ``Sweet
Charity,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``Lenny'' and ``All That Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   He won numerous Tony Awards for his Broadway work, an Emmy for
the TV special ``Liza With a Z'' ... and an Academy Award for his
direction of ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse's dance style may be the most instantly recognizable of
any choreographer. Among its many signature traits are dancers in
skin-tight black; close-knit groups edging across the stage; cocked
derbies; the elbows-out, knees-in posture; the isolated movement of
an enticing finger, rolling shoulder or waggling hip.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect usually is sensuous, ironic and insinuating.
Jazzy. Sexy. Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse'' is Broadway's current hit made up of numbers from his
shows and films.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Winner of the 1999 Tony Award as best musical, the revue is making
its Houston debut in a touring company playing through Jan. 23 at
Jones Hall.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I think he was brilliant,'' said Ann Reinking,
co-director and co-choreographer of ``Fosse.'' ``His contribution
was huge. He never stopped working. When I came to work on this
project, I was impressed by the wealth of material we had to choose
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinking not only performed in many of Fosse's shows but was
also for some years his partner. She choreographed the hit revival
of ``Chicago'' in his trademark style as an homage.
</P>
<P>
   Reinking spoke by phone between breaks in London rehearsals for
``Fosse's'' opening there Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's somewhat complex credits, ``Fosse'' is conceived
by Reinking, Chet Walker and Richard Maltby Jr., directed by
Maltby, with Fosse's choreography re-created by Walker and Gwen
Verdon serving as artistic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Verdon is the ultimate Fosse interpreter, having starred in
``Damn Yankees,'' ``New Girl in Town,'' ``Redhead,'' ``Sweet
Charity'' and ``Chicago.'' For many years, the director and his
star also were married.
</P>
<P>
   It was Verdon who initiated the project, according to Reinking.
Verdon started a dance lab in New York, at which dancers could
learn Fosse's style while participating in reconstructions of his
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   During that two-year process, Verdon showed the work to agents
and producers. Garth Drabinsky, then chief of Toronto-based Livent
Inc., became interested in producing a show built on Fosse's
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Reinking, who had participated in helping reconstruct dances
from shows she had performed, was hired by Drabinsky as ``Fosse's''
co-director/co-choreographer as the show moved into a lengthy
workshop phase before its world premiere in Toronto in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough choosing from the 45 or so numbers that Gwen had
re-created,'' Reinking said.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are short pieces from Fosse's early nightclub and
film work, and signature numbers from `50s and `60s shows (``Steam
Heat'' from ``Pajama Game'' and ``Big Spender'' from ``Sweet
Charity''), Fosse seems skewed to his work of the 1970s and '80s _
and usually to the more overtly sexy numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse'' faced the same dilemma as 1989's ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway,'' another retrospective built around a famed
choreographer's career. Could numbers created for a book musical be
as effective in a revue format, detached from their original
contexts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to choose numbers that could be lifted out and hold
their own without needing to know the story,'' Reinking said
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps understandably, the show most heavily represented is
``Dancin','' Fosse's plotless, all-dance revue of 1978, which he
choreographed to existing music from varied sources. That's also
the reason there are several numbers Fosse choreographed for TV
variety shows.
</P>
<P>
   If some of Fosse's major Broadway productions (``New Girl in
Town,'' ``Redhead'') are largely unrepresented, that's partly
because the numbers were too plot-oriented to work in the revue
format. Reinking said that the ``Fosse'' team also decided to avoid
having other dancers do any of Verdon's big numbers _ even such
seeming Fosse musts as ``Whatever Lola Wants'' from ``Damn
Yankees'' and ``If My Friends Could See Me Now'' from ``Sweet
Charity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't find anyone who could do them as well in her
style,'' Reinking said. ``It's hard to go up against a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Reinking feel it's an oversimplification to define the
Fosse style solely in terms of hip-swinging sexiness?
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a man terribly interested in innocence, the loss of
innocence and everything in between,'' Reinking said. ``Because of
his better-known later shows, many people would be surprised he
choreographed innocent numbers like ''Real Live Girl`` (from
''Little Me``). His work's not just sexy. ''Big Spender`` has
sexuality, but I find it more comedic than sensual. It's more about
looking tired!
</P>
<P>
   ``What separated him from someone who might be just as good a
craftsman was that Bob dealt with paradoxes. He was always playing
at least two things at same time. His movement could be elegant yet
funky, sensuous yet witty.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinking's next project, a new musical based on Friedrich
Durrenmatt's ``The Visit,'' will place her amid a dream team of
Broadway talent: composer John Kander, lyricist Fred Ebb,
librettist Terrence McNally, director Frank Galati and as star,
four-time Tony winner Angela Lansbury in her long-awaited return to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be creating musical staging as opposed to hard-driving
dance in the Fosse style, a nice change. And I am so eager to work
with all these people that I couldn't pass it up.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, ``The Visit'' will try out in Chicago in
fall 2000 and open on Broadway in early 2001.

&HT;     CITY WANTS STATE HELP FOR DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ City officials say it could cost up to $1 million
in police overtime and other expenses to handle the crowds expected
in Albany to protest the trial of four New York City police
officers accused of killing an unarmed man.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings said he has asked the state Office
of Court Administration to reimburse the city for overtime costs
incurred during the trial. Jury selection begins on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Activists, members of the clergy and lawmakers from New York
have promised to lead busloads of protesters to Albany for the
trial of four white police officers accused of fatally shooting
Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old West African immigrant, last February
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fairness to my taxpayers and this city, I would think they
would make the appropriate accommodations,'' Jennings said
Wednesday. ``There are extenuating circumstances, and we had
nothing to say about the change of venue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings also said he plans to push for cameras to be allowed in
the courthouse during the Diallo trial. Under current state law,
cameras are banned from all trial courtrooms. The cable network
Court TV has a motion pending in state Supreme Court to allow
television cameras into the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said he hopes the proceedings would at least be
broadcast via closed-circuit television to a large venue, such as
the Empire State Convention Center, because the Albany County
Courthouse cannot accommodate the crowds of people expected at the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds could put a serious strain on the city's finances if
Albany is not reimbursed by the state for all or part of the
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Without the additional expense of the trial, the city expects to
spend $1.6 million in police overtime this year, $400,000 of which
would be reimbursed by private companies that hire off-duty
officers to provide security.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers have estimated their numbers could reach as
high as 15,000 people a day throughout the trial, but Jennings on
Wednesday said he does not expect that many.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, Deputy Mayor Philip Calderone and City Treasurer Betty
Barnette _ the city's highest ranking African-American elected
official _ said they are determined to send a message that Albany
will not allow the Diallo trial to overtake or divide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minority elected officials are very concerned that this
not turn into a black versus white issue or us versus them or
downstate versus upstate,'' Barnette said. ``We are just as
committed to justice as anyone, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge ordered the trial moved to Albany, saying the officers
could not get a fair trial in the Bronx because of all the
publicity surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy
</P>
<P>
   _ are charged with murder and reckless endangerment in the Feb.
4, 1999, shooting of Diallo. Diallo was in the vestibule of his
Bronx home when he was hit by 19 of the 41 bullets fired by the
officers who said they believed the man was armed and dangerous.

   NEW-MUSIC-SOLOISTS (Undated) _ Ensembles that play only new

   THEATRICAL-WRITER (New York) _ One afternoon about three years
ago, Claudia Shear got the type of call young writers dream about.
Thus began a most unlikely creative partnership, between James
Lapine, the respected Broadway director and writer, and Ms. Shear,
the manic comic actress whose autobiographical play, ``Blown
Sideways Through Life,'' became an unexpected off-Broadway hit in
1993. The result of their three-year collaboration is ``Dirty
Blonde,'' an affectionate look at the lives of Mae West and two of
her most ardent admirers. By Jesse McKinley.

<P>
   AIDS-ART (Undated) _ The history of American art at the end of
the 20th century is at least in part the history of AIDS. Despite
all this, AIDS went all but unmentioned in the recent rash of
retrospectives. One reason is simply that, with the successful use
of expensive palliative drugs since the late 1990s, the disease has
lost its aura of emergency for middle-class whites in the United
States. This is not the case, however, for the rest of the world,
where the devastation from AIDS has assumed hurricane force. And
that fact is evident in ``Bodies of Resistance,'' an exhibition at
Real Art Ways in Hartford organized by Visual AIDS. By Holland
Cotter.

the outlet mecca of Manchester Center with its designer shops of

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Regis Philbin
in a scene from ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In case you've been on an extended tour of the Himalayas for the
past couple of months, an epidemic is raging through the land _
more insidious than Pokemon, more virulent than the flu.
 &HT;    It's Quiz-Showitis, and it's making the television industry very
nervous.
 &HT;    Imagine you're Leslie Moonves, president and CEO of CBS, and you
wake up one morning to find that the folks over at ABC have
virtually abolished their entire nightly schedule, filling their
prime-time airwaves with an imported British quiz show based on
multiple-choice questions a 3-year-old could answer. Sample: ``What
color is an Oreo cookie?''
 &HT;    Naturally, you're delighted _ clearly, the decision-makers at
one of your chief competitors have gone stark, staring mad.
 &HT;    You're still rubbing your hands in glee when the ratings come in
... showing that, in its summertime trial run of two weeks, ABC's
``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'' raked in a staggering 14 million
viewers a night.
 &HT;    Thereafter, the news just gets worse: A November sweeps series
of ``Millionaire'' and then a January run _ which attracts a
whopping 33.7 million viewers _ turns ``Is that your final
answer?'' into, heaven help us, the first catch phrase of the new
century and, oh yes, turns television programming on its head.
 &HT;    If you're Moonves, there's only one thing you can do: Jump on
the bandwagon just as quickly as you can, even though you know you
shouldn't. You have to react quickly because, if you don't, ABC
will win every ratings sweep into the next millennium.
 &HT;    Talking to a January meeting of television critics in Pasadena,
Calif., Moonves is almost apologetic in announcing his plans to
dive into the game-show fray with a new CBS show, ``Winning
Lines.'' And, just in case game shows stay hot, the network also
plans to revive the 1960s-vintage ``The $64,000 Question'' and
``What's My Line?'' as soon as possible.
 &HT;    ``I'm not in favor of it,'' Moonves admits. ``I made a statement
a few months ago that every half-hour of a game show that's on the
air means 100 people are out of work, and by that I mean writers,
producers, directors.
 &HT;    ``And if it expands from three to five to seven nights _ which,
judging from these numbers, it very well might _ I don't
necessarily think it's good for television.''
 &HT;    Garth Ancier, president of NBC's entertainment division, agrees.
Though he and veteran NBC producer Fred Silverman quickly decided
to drag the scandal-plagued 1950s series ``Twenty-One'' from the
network vaults, dust it off, dumb it down and stick Maury Povich in
front of those soundproof booths, Ancier is no game-show fan.
 &HT;    In fact, he compares quiz shows to crack cocaine.
 &HT;    ``It's an addictive substance that gives you high ratings but
may not in the long term be good for you,'' Ancier says.
```Millionaire' has changed everything. It's probably the most
significant program change in the history of television.''
 &HT;    And indeed, with the jagged music, the hyped-up tension and
their sweaty pallors, ``Millionaire's'' contestants do bear more
than a passing resemblance to victims of a controlled substance.
 &HT;    Over at the Fox network, whose contender in the game-show stakes
is ``Greed'' _ give them, at least, points for honesty _ Sandy
Grushow, chairman of the network's entertainment group, faces the
unpleasant task of defending a show whose contestants climb ``the
tower of greed'' as host Chuck Woolery challenges, ``Do you feel
the need for greed?''
 &HT;    Apparently they do _ successful ``Greed'' contestants can go
home with $2 million.
 &HT;    Grushow didn't give ``Greed'' a big buildup to the assembled
critics, and doesn't mince words explaining why.
 &HT;    ``These sessions are really designed to put our best foot
forward and show you the stuff that we feel you're going to get the
most excited about,'' he says. ``Obviously, we're the second game
show in the marketplace and we'd rather be first. We love the
numbers, but this network historically has been about taking risks
and being innovative, and we wanted to be out there first.''
 &HT;    So if nobody wants it _ except, of course, ``Millionaire'' host
Regis Philbin and the folks at ABC _ why is it happening? Why has
``Millionaire'' turned the networks into mindless copycats, and how
do they account for the phenomenon?
 &HT;    Philbin himself says the reason is simple.
 &HT;    ``Every American dreams of becoming a millionaire,'' he says.
``Now you can do it _ on TV and in one night.''
 &HT;    For Nancy Tellem, president of CBS' entertainment division, it's
about our culture.
 &HT;    ``It has money, the questions are so accessible that my
8-year-old, my 11-year-old and my 15-year-old can answer most of
them,'' she says, ``and I think people feel good about it.''
 &HT;    Maury Povich, who will host ``Twenty-One,'' thinks it's really
about family values.
 &HT;    ``You're talking about a show that, for the first time, young
people and their parents can watch together,'' Povich says, ``and
you get the entire family around the television set, the way it was
when these game shows were popular in the '50s.''
 &HT;    Silverman thinks ``Twenty-One'' is like social promotion in high
school: Answer the dumb question and pass on to the next level. He
says he never even considered keeping the show's original format,
in which intellectual heavyweights wrestled with amazingly arcane
questions.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he says bluntly. ``We rejected it because we didn't
think it would work. We looked at those old tapes, and they were
really boring _ you really had to be a Ph.D to answer those
questions.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Ancier insists with a straight face that the
attraction of game shows is educational.
 &HT;    ``I'm not kidding,'' he says. ``When they held focus groups for
`Wheel of Fortune,' which is simpler to play than `Twenty-One' or
`Millionaire,' people said they watched it because they wanted to
learn new phrases. That was the No. 1 reason our focus groups gave:
They want to get smarter.
 &HT;    ``And I think they like the idea of being able to see somebody
else become rich,'' he adds. ``People say, `I could have been a
millionaire. I could answer all those questions.'''
 &HT;    It was Michael Davies, a transplanted Brit, who was responsible
for shipping ``Millionaire'' across the Atlantic. He plans to
follow it up with another long-running British staple,
``Mastermind,'' which captured the English imagination by the
difficulty of the questions posed.
 &HT;    By the time the show lands on American soil, however, it's
likely that the questions will be more high-school freshman than
postgraduate.
 &HT;    Television executives are reluctant to speculate how long the
game-show mania will last. It may even turn out to be a one-show
phenomenon, with only ``Millionaire'' itself surviving.
 &HT;    But if the trend lasts beyond a couple of seasons, it poses
long-term risks for the industry. Sitcoms will need to draw huge
numbers to compete. Shows that appeal to smaller groups will go
under quickly, and _ one blessing _ the wall-to-wall nightly news
magazines are already biting the dust, because game shows are even
cheaper to produce.
 &HT;    And if that comes to pass, when the boom inevitably fades,
networks could find themselves with gaping holes in their schedules
and nothing in the pipeline to fill those holes.
 &HT;    Could ABC, whose complete reliance on ``Millionaire'' makes it
especially vulnerable, live to regret it if, a couple of seasons
down the line, the show fades out and leaves nothing else that's
been developed for the network?
 &HT;    Over at CBS, Leslie Moonves smiles.
 &HT;    ``God,'' he says, ``I hope so.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's  &UR; NEW &AMP; NOTABLE capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``YUKON ALONE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John Balzar (Holt, $25) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable is a sucker for adventure stories, particularly _
given a certain publishing orgy of late _ any story that does not
take place on Mount Everest or involve bodies that will never be
found. We were happy to discover that the Yukon can be just as cold
as Everest and is not nearly so trendy. In fact, the sled dog race
called the Yukon Quest was established 15 years ago by traditional
mushers in answer to the increasingly chic Iditarod, which has
given rise to competitors (Balzar calls them ``big names in dog
mushing'') who dress like race-car drivers and have dog handlers in
matching uniforms. Not so the mushers of the Quest. They are an
odd, scruffy lot, and their race is an odd, lonely ordeal: 1,023
miles from Canada's Yukon Territory to Fairbanks, Alaska, in the
long darkness of February. Balzar spent months among these people
to profile the 1998 Quest for the ``Los Angeles Times.'' His book
is about a place where priorities are different and life is
demanding, and both are what you make of them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SUNDANCING'' &QL; 
By John Anderson (Spike, $12.50) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a behind-the-scenes story of the Sundance Film Festival,
and it isn't pretty. It is crowded, commercial, competitive and
very, very important to the independent filmmakers who come to
Sundance like pilgrims to a glitzy, overproduced mecca of their
dreams. They come in search of success, something that became
associated with Sundance after 1989, when Steven Soderberg's film
``sex, lies and videotape'' changed the face of both the festival
and the independent film itself. Anderson, film critic for
``Newsday,'' went to Sundance last year and spent lots of time
listening to people talk about it _ everyone from actors, writers
and directors to journalists, publicists and even a police officer
who impounded Clint Eastwood's car (``He was very personable, a
very nice person to visit with. He had his picture taken with us
and seemed to be enjoying himself.''). We must make do with the
implied presence of Robert Redford, whose reticence is notorious
and who is, one director says, like a ``phantom'' at his own
festival. Not surprisingly, he and the Sundance Institute declined
to be involved with this book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``MONSTER'' &QL; 
By Jonathan Kellerman (Random House, $25.95) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman is a psychologist. That gives him the upper hand in
this thriller, which begins in the exercise yard of a hospital for
the criminally insane. Kellerman's recurring character, Alex
Delaware, himself a psychologist, has come with Detective Milo
Sturgis to search for clues in the brutal slaying of Dr. Claire
Argent, who worked among the strange and frightening inmates of the
hospital. These men are incarcerated for life, having killed people
for no logical reason and with particularly disgusting and
blood-splattering abandon. How then could one of them have been
involved in a murder that occurred on the outside? You begin to
suspect the answer to this question around about Page 79, but then
suspense is not the strong suit of this book. That honor belongs to
its portrayal of these seriously dangerous men, their taste for
violence and their relationships with the people who treat them.
Delaware and Sturgis discover that Argent's murder has roots in a
dreadful crime committed nearly two decades earlier. We relive
every gory detail of it and more. Enjoy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LIFE STORIES'' &QL; 
Edited by David Remnick (Random House, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light the candles, practice the song, the ``New Yorker'' is 75
and Remnick wants you to make a fuss. By way of encouragement, he
has edited two delectable volumes. This is a collection of
profiles, biographical pieces for which the magazine is justly
famous. Included, among others, are Lillian Ross' look at Ernest
Hemingway, Truman Capote on Marlon Brando, Roger Angell on
baseball's Steve Blass, Calvin Trillin on Edna Buchanan, Henry
Louis Gates Jr. on Anatole Broyard, A.J. Liebling on Floyd
Patterson, and Susan Orlean's hilarious profile of a show dog
called Biff Truesdale. Remnick's second offering is ``Wonderful
Town'' (Random House, $26.95), a collection of short stories set in
New York and published over the years in the ``New Yorker.'' A
partial list of contributors: Philip Roth, Woody Allen, James
Thurber, John Cheever, John O'Hara, Deborah Eisenberg, John Updike,
Dorothy Parker, William Maxwell, E.B. White, Saul Bellow, S.J.
Perelman, Vladimir Nabokov, Lorrie Moore . . . we could go on and
on. Excuse us while we locate our matches and don our paper hats. &QL;

&HT;     ADVICE FOR VERTICLE CLIMBS: TAKE IT EASY ON THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN WECHSLER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEENE VALLEY, N.Y. _ Less than 30 feet up the ice face, and
already I could feel the burn.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to be aware of your body when the temperature is in
the 20s, the wind is blowing snow sideways and you're clad in
numerous layers of fleece and Gore-Tex. Nevertheless, as I stood
there gripping ice tools, I slowly became aware that the strength
in my arms was rapidly fading. My swing was weakening, and I could
barely make a dent with my ax in the bullet-proof ice. My glasses
were fogging. My feet, perilously clinging to the ice face by the
sharp front points of a pair of crampons, seemed ready to skate
off. There was a good ledge _ a rest position _ about 10 feet above
my head, but I knew I wouldn't make it. Earlier in the day, a
fellow climber had described how his arms were once so exhausted he
thought his biceps would burst into flame. I knew how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tension!'' I yelled down to my belayer _ the person on the
ground who controls the rope _ and he tightened the rope attached
to the harness at my waist. I let my body fall off the cliff, onto
the rope, and dangled there, holding my useless arms behind my back
to help blood flow. The burn had claimed another victim.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, I spent the day climbing at the popular and
difficult Pitchoff Mountain Quarry Wall, a 75-foot rock face
covered top to bottom in thick, sharp icicles. It was the second
day of the Fourth Annual Adirondack International Mountainfest, and
I was taking a course with the legendary Don Mellor. More than 100
climbers took part in various seminars over the weekend, paying for
sessions led by world-famous climbers such as Greg Child and Mark
Synnott, whose first-ascents of mile-high cliff faces have been
documented on television and in National Geographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Mellor, a schoolteacher from Lake Placid, who has
climbed only in the Northeast. Nevertheless, he is known here as
the ``Dean of Adirondack Climbing,'' and has put up more than 100
first ascents in the Adirondacks in the past 20 years. He is the
author of ``Climbing in the Adirondacks,'' the only guide to rock
and ice routes in these mountains. The guide is in its third
printing.
</P>
<P>
   He is also, apparently, a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   The title of his course was ``Steep Climbing for the Weak and
Chicken-Hearted.'' The theme was this: ice climbing is hard and
scary, and the best way to climb safely _ the best way to avoid the
burn _ is to climb as efficiently as possible. Mellor's goal was to
teach us how to rest in unusual ways while clinging to a vertical
ice face, so we could enjoy climbing instead of suffering through
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever works, do it,'' he told the class early on, advising
us to ignore long-practiced style rules like ``don't use your
knees,'' ``always keep your ankles down'' or ``always have three
points of contact on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are absolutely no rules to climbing,'' he said. ``Just
climb!''
</P>
<P>
   Ice climbing is far less subtle than rock climbing, its
warm-weather equivalent. You use two ice axes, wicked devices with
short handles and a jagged, curved pick that you drive into the
ice. The axes also have wrist leashes, which you hang off to rest
over-gripped fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Climbers also wear plastic or very stiff leather boots and
crampons with front points, a set of spikes that allow a climber to
stand on ice in many different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Ice climbing is certainly more dangerous than ascending rock.
Pieces of ice are constantly knocked down. In certain areas,
avalanches are a possibility. Frostbite or hypothermia is always a
threat. And there are other dangers _ a few years ago, while
climbing a popular low-angle slab at Chapel Pond, Mellor found
himself in the air when the ice he was on exploded. The water
beneath had built up enough pressure so that as Mellor climbed, a
plate of ice cracked off and blew him into the air. Luckily the
beginner at the other end of the rope held his fall. Last winter, a
climber was killed rappelling near that same route.
</P>
<P>
   While rock-climbing has been extremely popular for more than 20
years, ice climbing really came of age in the 1990s. Technological
improvements such as aggressively shaped ice axes and crampon
points have helped climbers ascend routes never before thought
possible, even on faces without ice (using a perilous technique
known as dry-tooling).
</P>
<P>
   (MORE MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEENE VALLEY, N.Y.: x x x known as dry-tooling). &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mellor began climbing in the old days, teaching himself by
reading alpine pioneer Yvon Chouinard's ``Climbing Ice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so dogmatic, it was unbelievable,'' he said. ``You had
to use a 77-millimeter ax, you had to bend your ankles. People are
still out there using those French terms. We just wanted to
climb.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mellor and his buddies began to ignore the advice of the
climbing ``gods'' and invented their own techniques. And now, he
was teaching them to us.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the cliff, after climbers had a chance to warm up (or in
my case, flame out), we gathered around the Dean for a lesson in
climbing without breathing hard.
</P>
<P>
   His technique was completely efficient. He centered his body
over his ice tool, taking advantage of every natural rest he could
find. If there was a block of ice at his back, he would bend his
knee and kick his heel in behind him, sitting down on the top of
his boot. At a ledge, he'd throw his knee over the lip and almost
lie down, letting his arms dangle. His feet almost never skipped
off the ice, his tool placements were straight and true and rarely
required more than one swing for a solid placement.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, he paused at almost every move. The idea
was to rest on the easy stuff, so when you reach the hard section,
you've still got energy left.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every possible rest, top off your tank,'' he said. ``People
who are not patient enough will climb through the easy stuff and
wonder why they can't get through the hard part.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was done, the snow had intensified. Wind poured
down from Cascade Pass and our jackets were coated with frost.
Nevertheless, I picked up a set of ice axes and tied into the rope
for one more trip up the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   The route I picked was steeper than the first, with fewer
footholds and some overhangs to surmount. Attempting to emulate
Mellor's techniques, I tried to let my body flow over the ice,
resting at every opportunity. At a tiny ice cave, I wedged my body
between the rock and the ice, keeping my arms free to dangle, as my
belayer shouted encouragement from below.
</P>
<P>
   And when the burn finally came, in all its fiery glory, I was
almost at the top, and I knew this weak and chicken-hearted climber
had learned a few things.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE STEEP COST ICE CLIMBING
</P>
<P>
   Interested in ice climbing? It's not cheap. Mountaineering boots
run from $300 to $450, a pair of crampons from $100 to $180, and
ice tools from $100 to $300 each (you need two). A helmet also is
mandatory, along with warm and waterproof (that is to say,
expensive) clothing. You can rent boots and crampons, but rentable
ice tools are hard to find. You also need a harness, rope and other
rock-climbing gear.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get started is to hire a guide (much safer than
trying to teach yourself, even if you are familiar with
rock-climbing rope techniques, plus the guides provide gear). Ice
climbing is available in both the Adirondacks and Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   In the Adirondacks, Adirondack Rock and River of Keene employs a
number of top-notch guides, including Don Mellor. He can be reached
at 518-576-2041.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is Adirondack Alpine Adventures, which has a series of
courses available for ice climbers of different abilities. Call
518-576-9881.
</P>
<P>
   In the Catskills, there's North America Guide Service, which
also guides in the Adirondacks. Call 914-687-2049. And there's
Mountain Skills, which stays more in the Catskills. Its number is
914-687-9643.

 BOOK REVIEW of:
 ``The Desert:  Further Studies in Natural Appearances'' 
 By John C. Van Dyke (Johns Hopkins, $16.95) 
 &HT;     By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C. Van Dyke's ``The Desert'' has been a classic since it
was first published in 1901. Beaten, frayed copies of the book's
many editions sell for good money in used bookstores to those
connoisseurs who appreciate Van Dyke's peculiar brand of
lunacy-genius.
</P>
<P>
   For Van Dyke _ an art critic and professor at Rutgers University
at the turn of the century _ was a master of over-the-top, purple
prose: descriptive enthusiasm as literature. He is so extreme, he
is brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the desert, in minute detail and in raptures of
syntax, he has few peers. He manages to take one tiny bit of
observation and make it seem, at any given micromoment, the whole
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Desert'' belongs in the library of every reader who loves
the dry areas of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   This new paperback edition is graced with a critical
introduction by Peter Wild, who makes quite clear that Van Dyke
was, in some ways, a fraud. Rather than the farsighted ecologist he
makes himself out to be, he was an effete Easterner, and probably a
bag man for robber baron Andrew Carnegie _ who is the dedicatee of
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyke pretended he had spent two years wandering the deserts
of Arizona, California and Mexico. In reality, he visited his
brother in California, traveled across Arizona on train and carried
a bribe from Carnegie to a former union agitator who had fled to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of Van Dyke's biography, he was a profound
observer of what he saw, and a brilliant writer.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to quote small bits of Van Dyke's special brand of
prose. It flows on like a great river, carrying all before it in
cascades of paean. You cannot swim against its current.
</P>
<P>
   When he talks about the adverse effect of human habitation on
the environment, he says, ``Even the grizzly, secure in the
chaparral of his mountain home, flinches as he crosses the white
man's trail. The boot mark in the dust smells of blood and iron.''
</P>
<P>
   In that simple phrase, ``blood and iron,'' he manages to imply
the entire 2,000-year history of war and technology that has been
the European legacy.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite sections of the book is Van Dyke's
description of the color of the air in the desert. He goes on for
pages describing minute distinctions in the cast of color the air
gives the landscape, and he manages to describe the effect so
accurately, that anyone who has spent time in the desert recognizes
the truth of Van Dyke's eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   In the chapter ``Desert Sky and Clouds,'' he describes the
stratus clouds: ``This veil of sheet-cloud might be called a
twilight cloud, giving out as it does its greatest splendor after
the sun has disappeared below the verge. It then takes all colors
and with singular vividness. At times it will overspread the whole
west as a sheet of brilliant magenta, but more frequently it blares
with scarlet, carmine, crimson, flushing up and then fading out,
shifting from one color to another; and finally dying out in a
beautiful ashes of roses. When these clouds and all their
variations have faded into lilac and deep purples, there are still
bright spots of color in the upper sky where the (cirrus clouds)
are receiving the last rays of sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular objection to purple prose comes from the inexact and
hyperbolic verbifications of inferior scribes, who use the fancy
words in place of having something to say. But when a baroque
literary sensibility, such as Van Dyke's, meets a genuine subject,
the verbal fireworks are, in fact, more accurate, and more moving,
than any calculated understatement. &QL;

 RESENDING THIS STORY 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't like Bill Bennett. I think he is a very unpleasant man.
In fact, every time I see the former education secretary and ``drug
czar'' on ``Face the Nation'' or ``Larry King Live,'' his smug,
unctuous face makes my blood boil.
</P>
<P>
   There are few faces that scream out louder: sanctimonious prig.
</P>
<P>
   He makes his pronouncements about cultural values with an
insulting certainty, speaking as if he had personally been up on
Mount Sinai getting the tablets from Jehovah. His dicta are as
irritating as those of any name dropper. And if the name he drops
is God's, it is all the more obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   It is his certainty that bugs me more than anything else. It is
a quality that inhabits a certain kind of male: A certainty that
whatever position he takes is the true one, simply by virtue of his
taking it. It is a very male thing, and reminds me once again that
testosterone is a hallucinogen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he makes me so angry is that the cause he has
latched onto is an important one. Our values need to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But his version of them is deeply distorted by that inflexible
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett knows what the virtues are we should maintain: He has
made a list. In his ``Book of Virtues,'' he includes self
discipline, compassion, responsibility , friendship, work, courage,
perseverance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a measure of Bennett that humility is not among these
virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these seem obvious and inarguable. Others less so. And
in reality, such categorical expectations cannot be convincingly
maintained. There are times when loyalty conflicts with honesty,
times when faith conflicts with compassion. If you are a Sufi
mystic, self discipline may be just the opposite of what you
require. Perseverance is sometimes merely stupidity. Sometimes
diplomacy outranks honesty, for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   And work, as Bennett outlines it, smells suspiciously of the
Victorian principle espoused by such moralists as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Ford, who made millions because other people worked long
virtuous hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opposite is truly the virtue. At least Henry Thoreau
made a convincing case in ``Walden.'' ``We are made to exaggerate
the importance of what work we do,'' he wrote. ``But men labor
under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
soil for compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already work like dogs. It is the quality of their
leisure that needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the individual virtues on Bennett's list that I
take exception to, but the list itself.
</P>
<P>
   For too often, we think of virtues as being something as simple
as a list: A series of words.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, for Bennett in his book, ``involves rules and precepts _
the dos and don'ts of life with others.'' In other words, we are
good because we do what we are told.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterates his position in his followup book, ``The Moral
Compass,'' by asserting, ``Moral education must involve following
rules of good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, virtue is etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this view trivializing, and worse, I suspect
that it is propounded merely to perpetuate an economic and
governing system that makes it possible for Bennett and people of
his economic and educational advantage to live comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible lists of virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church lists the Theological Virtues of
Faith, Hope and Charity; the Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice,
Temperance, and Fortitude; and the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Bennett considers poverty a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the list in Laurie Anderson's song, ``Forgetting'':
``Bravery, Kindness, Clarity, Honesty, Compassion, Generosity,
Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Clarity is the least often observed.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever list we observe is ultimately forced upon our
lives in the style of Procrustes. We are not meant to think about
them, but to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rules are always insufficient. There are always
circumstances that require our disobeying.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, for instance, wrote in his ``Marriage of Heaven
and Hell'' how Jesus of Nazareth broke each of the 10 Commandments,
ennumerating them, one by one. Jesus was good, Blake says, because
``Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blake, Jesus's impulses were good impulses. The rules were
dead and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up in one of his ``Proverbs of Hell:'' ``One rule for
the lion and ox is oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett and his followers sum up the good in another phrase
from one of Blake's villains, the shortsighted god, Urizen: ``One
command, one joy, one desire,/ One curse, one weight, one measure,/
One King, one God, one Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As if everyone were a uniform cog in one of Ford's
mass-production lines.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has happened is a change in the meaning of the
word ``virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant different things at different times. If it now
means righteous behavior, it once meant something less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, and later the Romans _ who gave us the word _
virtue meant to be yourself in the utmost. That is, if you were a
soldier, to be brave and fight skillfully; if you were a scholar,
to read deeply and widely.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had his own virtue: to be who he was with every
fiber of his being. Presumably, if you were a villain, you were
virtuous to the extent that you did the most evil.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses was virtuous for his ability to lie; Achilles for his
ability to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   The best modern equivalent of the term might be
``authenticity.'' Being true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtue'' didn't take on its acrid sanctimoniousness until the
Victorian age, when it was used to approve of behavior that
furthered the goals of Colonialism and jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Victorians, virtue meant not having sex. It's a long way
from Achilles to Elsie Dinsmore.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``values,'' that is bandied about so glibly by
politicians now, has also undergone such a change.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to be used by conservative politicians to mean those
narrow and ethnocentric strictures that make life comfortable for
them. ``Values'' means THEIR values. They are something you inject
like a flu shot into your children in hopes it will keep them out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is little that is as basic to our sense of our own
humanity than our values. The question is vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   But before the term was belittled by politicans, our values were
those things we felt had intrinsic worth. They are called values
because we VALUED them; they were things you could count on, like
solid currency. They were not an abstract yardstick to measure
behavior, but rather the very concrete reality on which we built
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   For something to count as a human value, it has, above all, to
be true. Anything else will prove false in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Our values are those things we take as the rock-bottom basic
truths that experience gives us, that we can count on and therefore
can act in the world with the expectancy that particular behaviors
will result in particular outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our values are not written down on paper
somewhere, but found in the world around us, the world we
experience, the lives we live. And instead of turning out to be as
vaporous as the words of a list, values are as solid as the oak
tree that grows in the yard. Indeed, they may be the oak tree. Or
the birds roosting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our values include what we believe our families to be, our
awareness of cause-and-effect in the natural world, our sense of
outrage when injustice is aimed at us _ or at someone we share
sympathy with.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in the American South, whether you are White or
Black, the red dirt is one of your values. If you live in New
Jersey, pizza is part of your value system. These are never merely
words, but the truth of the universe you inhabit, as you are given
the ability to see them.
</P>
<P>
   If a so-called value handed down to us is proven false by
experience, we must either forsake the value or live an inauthentic
life. Many of the values Bennett would foist on us no longer ring
true. Perhaps some still do. But we must find them out for
ourselves. It is one of our life's tasks. &QL;

 RESENDING THIS STORY 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: STORY ALSO MOVING IN THE ``K'' CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't like Bill Bennett. I think he is a very unpleasant man.
In fact, every time I see the former education secretary and ``drug
czar'' on ``Face the Nation'' or ``Larry King Live,'' his smug,
unctuous face makes my blood boil.
</P>
<P>
   There are few faces that scream out louder: sanctimonious prig.
</P>
<P>
   He makes his pronouncements about cultural values with an
insulting certainty, speaking as if he had personally been up on
Mount Sinai getting the tablets from Jehovah. His dicta are as
irritating as those of any name dropper. And if the name he drops
is God's, it is all the more obnoxious.
</P>
<P>
   It is his certainty that bugs me more than anything else. It is
a quality that inhabits a certain kind of male: A certainty that
whatever position he takes is the true one, simply by virtue of his
taking it. It is a very male thing, and reminds me once again that
testosterone is a hallucinogen.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he makes me so angry is that the cause he has
latched onto is an important one. Our values need to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But his version of them is deeply distorted by that inflexible
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett knows what the virtues are we should maintain: He has
made a list. In his ``Book of Virtues,'' he includes self
discipline, compassion, responsibility , friendship, work, courage,
perseverance, honesty, loyalty and faith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a measure of Bennett that humility is not among these
virtues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these seem obvious and inarguable. Others less so. And
in reality, such categorical expectations cannot be convincingly
maintained. There are times when loyalty conflicts with honesty,
times when faith conflicts with compassion. If you are a Sufi
mystic, self discipline may be just the opposite of what you
require. Perseverance is sometimes merely stupidity. Sometimes
diplomacy outranks honesty, for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   And work, as Bennett outlines it, smells suspiciously of the
Victorian principle espoused by such moralists as Andrew Carnegie
and Henry Ford, who made millions because other people worked long
virtuous hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opposite is truly the virtue. At least Henry Thoreau
made a convincing case in ``Walden.'' ``We are made to exaggerate
the importance of what work we do,'' he wrote. ``But men labor
under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the
soil for compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans already work like dogs. It is the quality of their
leisure that needs improving.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the individual virtues on Bennett's list that I
take exception to, but the list itself.
</P>
<P>
   For too often, we think of virtues as being something as simple
as a list: A series of words.
</P>
<P>
   Virtue, for Bennett in his book, ``involves rules and precepts _
the dos and don'ts of life with others.'' In other words, we are
good because we do what we are told.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterates his position in his followup book, ``The Moral
Compass,'' by asserting, ``Moral education must involve following
rules of good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, virtue is etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I find this view trivializing, and worse, I suspect
that it is propounded merely to perpetuate an economic and
governing system that makes it possible for Bennett and people of
his economic and educational advantage to live comfortable lives.
</P>
<P>
   There are other possible lists of virtues.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church lists the Theological Virtues of
Faith, Hope and Charity; the Cardinal Virtues of Prudence, Justice,
Temperance, and Fortitude; and the Evangelical Counsels of Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt Bennett considers poverty a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the list in Laurie Anderson's song, ``Forgetting'':
``Bravery, Kindness, Clarity, Honesty, Compassion, Generosity,
Dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these, Clarity is the least often observed.
</P>
<P>
   But whichever list we observe is ultimately forced upon our
lives in the style of Procrustes. We are not meant to think about
them, but to obey them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rules are always insufficient. There are always
circumstances that require our disobeying.
</P>
<P>
   William Blake, for instance, wrote in his ``Marriage of Heaven
and Hell'' how Jesus of Nazareth broke each of the 10 Commandments,
ennumerating them, one by one. Jesus was good, Blake says, because
``Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Blake, Jesus's impulses were good impulses. The rules were
dead and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   He sums it up in one of his ``Proverbs of Hell:'' ``One rule for
the lion and ox is oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bennett and his followers sum up the good in another phrase
from one of Blake's villains, the shortsighted god, Urizen: ``One
command, one joy, one desire,/ One curse, one weight, one measure,/
One King, one God, one Law.''
</P>
<P>
   As if everyone were a uniform cog in one of Ford's
mass-production lines.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has happened is a change in the meaning of the
word ``virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   It has meant different things at different times. If it now
means righteous behavior, it once meant something less rigid.
</P>
<P>
   For the Greeks, and later the Romans _ who gave us the word _
virtue meant to be yourself in the utmost. That is, if you were a
soldier, to be brave and fight skillfully; if you were a scholar,
to read deeply and widely.
</P>
<P>
   Each person had his own virtue: to be who he was with every
fiber of his being. Presumably, if you were a villain, you were
virtuous to the extent that you did the most evil.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses was virtuous for his ability to lie; Achilles for his
ability to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   The best modern equivalent of the term might be
``authenticity.'' Being true to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtue'' didn't take on its acrid sanctimoniousness until the
Victorian age, when it was used to approve of behavior that
furthered the goals of Colonialism and jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   For the Victorians, virtue meant not having sex. It's a long way
from Achilles to Elsie Dinsmore.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``values,'' that is bandied about so glibly by
politicians now, has also undergone such a change.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to be used by conservative politicians to mean those
narrow and ethnocentric strictures that make life comfortable for
them. ``Values'' means THEIR values. They are something you inject
like a flu shot into your children in hopes it will keep them out
of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is little that is as basic to our sense of our own
humanity than our values. The question is vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   But before the term was belittled by politicans, our values were
those things we felt had intrinsic worth. They are called values
because we VALUED them; they were things you could count on, like
solid currency. They were not an abstract yardstick to measure
behavior, but rather the very concrete reality on which we built
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   For something to count as a human value, it has, above all, to
be true. Anything else will prove false in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Our values are those things we take as the rock-bottom basic
truths that experience gives us, that we can count on and therefore
can act in the world with the expectancy that particular behaviors
will result in particular outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, our values are not written down on paper
somewhere, but found in the world around us, the world we
experience, the lives we live. And instead of turning out to be as
vaporous as the words of a list, values are as solid as the oak
tree that grows in the yard. Indeed, they may be the oak tree. Or
the birds roosting in it.
</P>
<P>
   Our values include what we believe our families to be, our
awareness of cause-and-effect in the natural world, our sense of
outrage when injustice is aimed at us _ or at someone we share
sympathy with.
</P>
<P>

Black, the red dirt is one of your values. If you live in New
Jersey, pizza is part of your value system. These are never merely
words, but the truth of the universe you inhabit, as you are given

BACK TO THE `50S WITH `FELICITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review; Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings) 
(af) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The haircut probably started it. Keri Russell, the young star of
the WB network's ``Felicity,'' cut her hair last year, just in time
for the new season. That glorious head of voluminous golden backlit
hair. (If you are older and unfamiliar with ``Felicity,'' think
back to the week Mia Farrow turned up on ``Peyton Place'' with her
hair scissored away.)
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators were so upset about Ms. Russell's new style
that they suspected it was affecting the show's ratings. The only
setting that cut would work in, they may have said aloud, would be
the 1950s, when all the chic young women were getting the ``Italian
boy'' do. So naturally they decided to turn ``Felicity'' into a
'50s drama on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To be specific, they turned it into ``The Twilight Zone.'' Which
is a completely off-kilter idea for a one-hour drama about earnest,
lovesick, beautiful college students in New York. But the
all-black-and-white episode is so expertly done that it is almost
fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   It may not capture the ``Twilight Zone'' magic, but it does a
great job of paying homage.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity (Ms. Russell) is at work at the coffee shop when the
strangeness begins. A well-groomed, thin-lipped woman walks up to
the counter and addresses her: ``I don't mean to intrude. Only I
saw you staring at that boy at the table.'' When Felicity says,
``May I help you?'' the woman answers, ``I think I might be able to
help you.''
</P>
<P>
   And she hands Felicity a card for a place called the Clinic:
``Help for the lovelorn,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the woman is on target. Wearing a hat and
noticeable jewelry, she's just a little more dressed up for
everyday than women are in 2000. Her language is a little more
formal and a little more polite, in the ways of four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then the voice-over introduces the story: ``Witness Felicity
Porter. In many ways your typical 19-year-old college sophomore.
Studious, dedicated, kind. Felicity Porter, who serves coffee and
pastries to nameless patrons.'' It ends, ``Felicity Porter, making
a phone call that will change her life forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not Rod Serling's voice _ it's a woman's, in fact _ but it
has the tingly-eerie rhythm and tone of Serling's unforgettable
introductions to the old series.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity goes to the Clinic, where, she assumes, the treatment
will be some sort of psychotherapy or hypnosis to help her get over
her romantic troubles with Noel (Scott Foley) and Ben (Scott
Speedman). But something is very wrong, and by the time the harshly
lighted blond nurse brings out a syringe the size of a rolling pin,
Felicity is running for her life. Then things get even stranger.
</P>
<P>
   She finds herself talking to a man in the college library who
isn't really there.
</P>
<P>
   Her tape recorder calls her name in the middle of the night,
even though there's no tape in it. When she takes a night job in
the biology lab where the cadavers are kept (naturally), one of the
deceased starts talking, warning her of what really lies ahead for
her at the Clinic. (Let's just say it's a drastic approach to
dealing with a broken heart.)
</P>
<P>
   Most horrifying of all, people she knows, trusts and loves have
been transformed in some horrible way. Even Noel. You can tell when
he says, with an odd lack of affect, ``If that's what you want,
we'll report the Clinic to the police.'' Right after that, he takes
off his shirt, and he and Felicity have a strange Stanley Kowalski
and Blanche DuBois moment. Maybe a preview of the show's next
homage?
</P>
<P>
   An hour is a little too long for this sort of game. (The writers
end up tacking on a second mystery to keep the plot going.) They
once tried expanding the original ``Twilight Zone'' to an hour, too
(in 1963); that idea lasted half a season.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the hour, the exposition hits just the right note
and the camera angles are perfect copies of what ``The Twilight
Zone'' used to do. The students wear period clothing, but very
subtle period. Felicity's friend Elena (Tangi Miller) is reading
The New York Gazette with the headline ``Russia Fires Rocket Toward
Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Felicity's tape recorder is a modern compact model, not the
bulky reel-to-reel kind you'd have seen in the ``Twilight Zone''
era.
</P>
<P>
   It's just enough to keep viewers off balance, wondering if this
is supposed to be 1960 or 2000, just as the characters wonder if
the things that are happening are real or part of a dream. And even
if ``Felicity'' had gotten everything else wrong, W.G. Snuffy
Walden and Danny Pelfrey's plot-enhancing music would have been
worth tuning in to hear. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Flanigan, an antiques dealer in Baltimore,
recently offered a tip to aficionados of early-19th-century Boston
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walked into a booth of Empire furniture at an antiques
show, and you weren't wearing your reading glasses so you couldn't
read the labels, you could pick out the Boston pieces,'' he said.
``All you would have to do is pretend you were at a cocktail party
and were looking for the most conservative but highly refined
person there. He wouldn't be shouting or loud. He'd be well
educated and well bred. That's the Boston piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanigan's advice was in response to the show on Boston
neo-Classicism at the Hirschl &AMP; Adler Galleries in New York through
Feb. 5. The show has spawned a new parlor game: trying to determine
how furniture made in Boston between 1800 and 1840 differs from
contemporaneous pieces made in New York, Philadelphia and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   American neo-Classical furniture was inspired by models that
emerged in France after the 1750s. The French prototypes were
dignified and restrained, with simple geometric forms, spare
ornamentation and a preference for linear, flat decoration. Under
Napoleon such designs became known as the Empire style. In England
they were termed Regency.
</P>
<P>
   Friday begins Americana week in the city and the Winter Antiques
Show, which runs through Jan. 30 in Manhattan. Auction houses are
including neo-Classical pieces in their Americana sales Friday and
Saturday and a few special gallery exhibitions are going on as
well.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of specialists in early 19th-century
American furniture and they offer some clues about how to
distinguish Boston furniture from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pick out a piece made in Boston from a mile away,'' said
Carswell Rush Berlin, a private New York dealer who specializes in
high-style neo-Classical American antiques. ``Boston furniture is
more conservative than New York, Philadelphia or even Baltimore at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin has an upholstered armchair, a pair of pier tables, a
sewing table and a gueridon, or pedestal table, made in Boston in
his stand at the Winter Antiques Show. ``Wood and carving are very
important,'' he continued. ``The quality of the wood is almost
always outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hays of Christie's added: ``There's a purity and simplicity
to Boston furniture that doesn't exist in New York or Philadelphia.
There is a beauty in that simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americana sale at Christie's Friday includes a Boston
drop-leaf mahogany dining table with tapering cylindrical supports
that rest on splayed saber legs. Made around 1810, the handsome,
solid table has only one kind of decoration: tight ring turnings on
the supports. It is expected to sell for $20,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Sack, dean of Manhattan's Americana dealers, could almost
have been describing that piece: ``Boston neo-Classical furniture
is not flamboyant,'' he said. ``It's understated. The furniture
makers concentrated on superb grains and woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanigan put it another way: ``You see tremendous control. There
are no exuberant edges. Carving is tight. In Boston, decoration is
not emphasized. It's always subsidiary to the form.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Feld, the president of Hirschl &AMP; Adler, organized its
show, ``Boston in the Age of Neo-Classicism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston furniture, you don't see a lot of painting and
gilding as you do in Philadelphia and New York,'' he explained.
``Instead, you see mahogany veneers of extraordinary quality, often
displayed in matchbook fashion. Boston furniture is as identifiable
as a pot of Boston baked beans.''
</P>
<P>
   In style Boston furniture is more English than French. ``Boston
cabinetmakers were more into English pattern-book design,'' Feld
said. ``They used classical motifs and had a style of carving that
was more William IV than French.''
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts with New York furniture, which Berlin described
as being more fashion-forward and influenced by the French.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Carey, of F.J. Carey III Antiques in Ambler, Pa., has
several Boston pieces for sale in his warehouse. ``Bostonians were
Anglophiles,'' he said. ``In Pennsylvania we had German and French
cabinetmakers in the early 1800s, so there were more design sources
to pull from. Boston did not have as many immigrants from different
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey advised studying secondary woods in furniture. ``In
Boston, it might be chestnut, white pine or tulip poplar,'' he
said. ``In New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore it could be ash.''
All the cities imported mahogany and rosewood, added.
</P>
<P>
   David Dunton, a dealer with Boston furniture from Woodbury,
Conn., pointed out that only Boston furniture makers made
flattened, often ebonized ball feet.
</P>
<P>
   Who buys neo-Classical furniture these days? ``Maybe one out of
1,000 visitors is a potential buyer,'' Berlin said. ``Selling this
period is hard because the market is very thin. The market says
earlier styles like Hepplewhite are more valuable, but I find them
less interesting. On the other hand, my pieces, relatively
speaking, are more affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   The record price for a piece of neo-Classical American furniture
sold at auction is $704,000, paid for a stamped Charles-Honore
Lannuier marble-top pier table at Christie's in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Like other dealers, Berlin goes beyond the famous makers of the
period _ Anthony Quervelle of Philadelphia and Lannuier and Duncan
Phyfe of New York. He is studying John and Hugh Finlay of Baltimore
and Allison, Deming &AMP; Bulkley of New York, among others. ``One of
the exciting things about this period is that we don't know
everything yet,'' he said. ``There are still a lot of dots left to
connect.''
</P>
<P>
   ANIMALS' ESSENCE
</P>
<P>
   There are several fine lots of Chinese export porcelain in
Sotheby's ``Important Americana'' sale Friday and in Christie's
``British Interior'' sale on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly striking lot at Christie's is a pair of teal
stag head wall trophies. About 21 inches high, the 19th-century
heads have white eyes with black-glazed pupils and white teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese knew how to get the essence of an animal without
being slavishly realistic,'' said Becky MacGuire, Christie's expert
in Chinese export. ``These must have been made for a grand hunting
lodge or schloss somewhere in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   In China, the deer is an auspicious animal, symbolizing wealth
and longevity. ``Only deer can root out the sacred fungus
associated with one of the immortals,'' Ms. MacGuire said. ``This
blending of Eastern reverence for deer and the Western trophy
tradition is rare.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimate for the pair is $6,000 to $9,000. The last set of
great porcelain stag heads, from the collection of Thomas Mellon
Evans, sold at Christie's in June 1998 for $75,000.

<P>
   The notion of old friends gathering to make music often gives
rise to all-American cliches about hoedowns and bluesy jam
sessions. But these two new relaxed collaborations reach widely
forward instead of backward.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Garner and Rick Brown are accomplices in marriage as well as
in music, and the freedom palpable on ``Still'' comes from
long-held trust. The tracks range from the nervous New York punk of
``Bomb Squad'' to the languor of ``Swimmingly,'' sung by Ms. Garner
in a voice that descends like a cloud of seduction.
</P>
<P>
   Several friends and fellow postpunk veterans help the couple
explore a sometimes abstract but always engaging soundscape dotted
with signs of their previous travels through country and art rock.
</P>
<P>
   One such friend is the guitarist Tara Key of Antietam, who
forges a musical alliance on ``Dark Edson Tiger'' with Rick Rizzo
of Eleventh Dream Day.
</P>
<P>
   The two wield their guitars gingerly on this instrumental album,
exploring nuances of feedback and sustain. Again, old pals
(including Brown and Ms. Key's husband and bandmate, Tim Harris)
flesh out the duo's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   These albums are homey in the best way; their makers are
comfortable enough to let their minds run free.

   THE DEMOCRATS: RUNAWAY SLOGAN
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is taking Bill Bradley's campaign slogan
and turning it to his own advantage. ``It Can Happen,'' the Bradley
homage to idealism and outside chances, has morphed into Gore's
more assertive ``It Will Happen.'' The new slogan is emblazoned on
the back of another new prop in the Gore campaign, a big, cushy
bus.

   THE MIDWEST: FROM ELEPHANTS TO DONKEYS

<P>
   Complaining that the party has become too conservative, two
high-profile Republicans in Minnesota have defected to the
Democratic Farmer-Labor-Party. State Auditor Judy Dutcher disclosed
in a letter to Republican Party officials on Monday that she would
be switching to the Democrats, a party she described as ``more
accepting of divergent points of view.'' A week ago, the former
state Senate minority leader, Dean Johnson, switched to the
Democrats after a dispute over gay rights.

   NEW ENGLAND: THE $5 CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Cummings, director of a nonprofit educational group in
Portland, Maine, has become the first candidate to qualify for
public financing under Maine's new ``clean elections'' system.
Under the system, Cummings, who is running for the Maine House of
Representatives, had to gather 50 contributions of $5 each to show
the breadth of his support, and to pledge to accept no other
donations. In return, he is eligible for about $4,400 in state
money to run his campaign, a sum that could triple if an opponent
vastly outspends him, said John Brautigam, a leading Maine advocate
of campaign finance reform. Cummings said some people offered him
more than the allowable $5, and ``it's the first time in my life
when I've turned away money.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTH: FLAG FIXATION
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, a Democrat, used his State of
the State speech Wednesday night to add a sense of urgency to the
Confederate battle flag debate, imploring lawmakers to reach a
compromise that would move the flag off the Capitol dome to a spot
elsewhere on the Statehouse grounds. The flag dispute is diverting
the state's attention from more urgent issues, he said.

JERI RYAN GOES TO THE MAT IN `TSUNKATSE'

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Jeri Ryan in
a scene from ``Star Trek: Voyager.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The time is right for Seven of Nine.
 &HT;    Back when Jeri Ryan joined the cast of ``Star Trek: Voyager''
during its fourth season, the actress most feared that Seven might
become too human too quickly. Now, with each passing episode, Seven
edges closer to regaining the humanity she lost upon Borg
assimilation.
 &HT;    ``I'm three years into the character, and she's absolutely ready
to explore her human side,'' Ryan says. ``You don't want her to
become stagnant as a character.
 &HT;    ``And it's not been a rapid change,'' the actress adds. ``We've
done a few episodes where she's been pretty perplexed and had to go
back to her Borg structure in order not to feel so uncomfortable
with the emotions around her.
 &HT;    ``We've just done an episode called `Collective,' and there you
have Seven put in charge of some Borg children we've brought aboard
the ship,'' Ryan adds. ``She has a real hard time with these kids
being so disorderly and unpredictable.
 &HT;    ``Watching her deal with the emotional aspects of the kids'
personalities, watching her have to go back to Borg structure and
routine just to stay sane, that's fun,'' she says. ``It's fun to
see where Seven is now, compared to where she was when she came on
board.''
 &HT;    But we're getting light years ahead of ourselves here _
`Collective'' won't air until Feb. 16. The reason for this
conversation with Ryan is actually ``Tsunkatse,'' a sweeps episode
that will beam into living rooms on Feb. 9.
 &HT;    The action-packed hour features guest spots by ``Deep Space
Nine'' favorites Jeffrey Combs and J.G. Hertzler. And, in a bit of
unapologetic UPN synergy, ``WWF Smackdown'' wrestling icon The Rock
turns up as well.
 &HT;    ``The crew is on shore leave, and everybody but Seven and Tuvok
(Tim Russ), who have no interest in recreation, is pretty excited
to be on this planet,'' Ryan says, speaking by telephone from her
mother's home in the Los Angeles area. ``Chakotay (Robert Beltran)
and Torres (Roxann Dawson) discover this sport called tsunkatse,
which is sort of a gladiator-type fighting event, with lots of
people coming into an arena to watch.
 &HT;    ``Seven and Tuvok, who went off on an away mission, are captured
and Seven is forced into playing the sport,'' she says. ``You soon
realize that the people who are doing the fighting are not there by
choice.''
 &HT;    Chakotay and several other Voyager crew members discover that
fact for themselves when they see Seven step into the arena. As her
crewmates endeavor to save her, Seven must deal with the
machinations of Penk (Combs), the ruthless tsunkatse promoter who
salivates at the money to be made through a death match featuring
Seven.
 &HT;    ``Fighting is very much against Seven's nature because, for the
last three years, she has tried to stifle her aggressive side,''
Ryan says. ``And now she is forced to be violent and aggressive in
order to survive and save Tuvok.
 &HT;    ``I can't tell you too much more without giving it all away.''
 &HT;    Ryan says she's generally pleased with season six of
``Voyager,'' and she waxes enthusiastic about several Seven-heavy
episodes, including ``One Small Step'' and another upcoming hour
involving the Borg kids.
 &HT;    Even when she's away from the set these days, ``Voyager'' isn't
far from Ryan's side: She and producer/writer Brannon Braga are
romantically involved.
 &HT;    ``It's not a secret,'' Ryan says. ``We are dating, and we're
very happy.''
 &HT;    As the conversation draws to a close, the actress reiterates her
opinion that Seven continues to be a well-developed character.
 &HT;    ``She's done a lot,'' the actress says. ``She's been a mom,
essentially. She has made friends among the crew and, through Naomi
Wildman (Scarlett Pomers), she's learning how to play and lighten
up a little bit.
 &HT;    ``She's really gone through most of the stages of life at this
point,'' Ryan says. ``And that's great.''
 &HT;    One thing she hasn't done yet, however, is to explore her sexual
side.
 &HT;    ``We've had guys with crushes on her _ the Doctor (Robert
Picardo) and Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) both were attracted to her _
but she hasn't had a real romance,'' Ryan admits. `I understand,
from inside sources I might know, that could change at some point
this season.
 &HT;    ``And that will be exciting.''

`THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR': A SHAKESPEAREAN SITCOM FIT FOR A
QUEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The plot of ``The Merry Wives of Windsor'' is simple.
An aging, seriously overweight man gets it into his head that two
attractive married women in town have eyes for him, and he decides
to make their lives complete by sleeping with them. Separately. The
women's husbands hear about this plan, and one of them puts on a
disguise in order to find out just how interested the wives are.
When the women themselves hear about it, they decide to have a
little fun with the old guy. Meanwhile, almost every other man in
town wants to marry young Anne Page, who is apparently the Liv
Tyler of 14th-century Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare is said to have written this comedy in two weeks as
a sort of spinoff from ``Henry IV'' (Elizabeth I had liked Falstaff
so much in Part I and Part II that she wanted to see him again),
and it's never been considered his finest work. At times the
``let's play a trick on the boys'' plot seems almost sitcomish. But
when it's done right, ``The Merry Wives of Windsor'' can be an
adorably silly evening's entertainment. The Pearl Theater Co. has
done it right.
</P>
<P>
   The director, James Alexander Bond, has taken such a modern-day
approach to the play's humor that you might suspect him of having
updated Shakespeare's language or attitudes, but apparently he
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Falstaff (Dan Daily) really did write to Mistress Page (Carol
Schultz, who reads the letter aloud): ``You are merry, so am I; ha,
ha!'' The women even foresee photocopying (``a thousand of these
letters, writ with blank space for different names''). Page (Jay
Russell) really does tell Ford (Ray Virta), someone whose strange
behavior of late he thinks might warrant constant watching: ``You
are not to go loose any longer. You must be pinioned.''
</P>
<P>
   If those lines don't strike you as funny, they are when
delivered by this cast. The production _ which is three hours long
with two intermissions _ gets laughs from lines like, ``She has
brown hair and speaks small like a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The play has plenty of physical humor and elements of farce.
Falstaff is hidden in a basket filled with dirty laundry and
carried away by two servants, puzzled by their cargo's weight.
</P>
<P>
   Later Falstaff dresses as ``the fat woman of Brentford'' to make
his escape from the Fords' house. Men hide in closets. Townspeople
dress up like fairies. (Which allows Carol Brys, the costume
designer, to go wild with lovely fabrics and inventive
silhouettes.)
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast does itself proud in this briskly paced,
high-energy production. Shona Tucker is particularly funny as
Mistress Ford. Robin Leslie Brown, who was so good in the Pearl's
``John Gabriel Borkman,'' is a standout again, as the enthusiastic
Mistress Quickly. That's the character, of course, to whom Falstaff
says, ``Be brief, my good she-Mercury,'' but she rarely is.

BUSH AD IS SHARPEST YET ON MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his most pointed allusion to a rival to date, Gov. George W.
Bush began running a 30-second spot Wednesday in New Hampshire that
criticizes parts of a tax plan offered by his chief Republican
opponent, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. The commercial was taped on
Tuesday at a news conference in Pittsfield, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Bush: ``My opponent trusts the people of Washington to
spend money. I trust the people of New Hampshire to make the right
decisions for their families. If he says something I don't agree
with, I am going to point it out. I darn sure don't agree with
saying you're going to take $40 billion of employer-related
benefits and have people pay taxes on them _ think that is a
mistake. If you abolish employer-related benefits to pay for a tax
cut, it means working people will have to pay those benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Although McCain's name is never mentioned, the crux of
the spot is an assertion that his campaign vigorously disputes,
that a McCain proposal for cutting taxes by nearly $240 billion
includes a hidden increased cost to taxpayers of $40 billion. That
additional burden would be imposed, Bush claims, because the
proposal would end some deductions that employers now take on
tax-exempt benefits. In a detailed response, the McCain campaign
said Wednesday that the plan would eliminate or limit only
corporate deductions for expenses like employee parking, meals,
transportation, spa memberships and tickets to sports events. That
would result in less than $3.9 billion in revenues over five years,
it said. The plan, the McCain campaign added, does not impose taxes
on employee child care or health care benefits.

 &HT;    COALITION CITES POLLUTERS' PORK
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An alliance of private groups Thursday criticized
Congress for failing to halt seven ``environmentally harmful''
projects and subsidies costing hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Scissors coalition, which includes environmental and
budget watchdog groups, criticized lawmakers who voted last year
for subsidies for hard rock mining, oil and timber industries,
protections for the sugar industry, and research for fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of Congress squandered seven opportunities to slash
programs that threaten our environment,'' said Erich Pica, a
spokesman for Friends of the Earth Action, which participated in
the study of the congressional votes.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition found ``little progress'' toward ending subsidies
it opposes. ``Despite some victories in Congress, and an
administration that supports several Green Scissors
recommendations, wasteful government spending that is harmful to
the environment still runs rampant in Washington,'' concluded the
study.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of a handful key votes last year, only 11 senators
and eight House members rated a perfect score in fighting
``polluters' pork,'' according to the Green Scissors' scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   In the selected votes, the House considered programs with a
maximum cost of $831 million on seven separate votes. The study
included four selected votes in the Senate, with a maximum cost of
$732.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the vote study, the coalition issued its annual
list of 77 projects and subsidies that they charge damage land and
waterways and cost a total of $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The group added five new items to its hit list, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plans to increase federal subsidies to dredge harbors,
including the one at Savannah, Ga., so that they will be able to
accommodate new, larger tankers. The group warned of a costly
``race to the bottodies for crop insurance, which the group says
will encourage more farming in marginal areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deepening the Columbia River near Portland, Ore., at a cost of
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paving national forest roads at a cost of $405 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Navy plan to broadcast low-frequency sound waves into the
ocean to search for submarines. The sound waves could harm whales,
dolphins and other sea life, the group says.

`THE NEW SWEET STYLE:' A RUSSIAN DISSIDENT IN PURSUIT OF THE
AMERICAN DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia)  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Burn,'' the novel that made his name in the West in the
early 1980s, Vassily Aksyonov created a wild, kaleidoscopic picture
of life in the Soviet Union, chronicling the heady years of the
1960s when the country's intelligentsia still cherished hopes of a
political thaw, and the cruel dashing of those hopes with the 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia. The book's nervous surrealism captured
the strange Kafkaesque mood of those years, even as its jazzy,
improvisational style _ by turns ironic and meditative, slapstick
and somber _ suggested the precarious nature of life under the
watchful eyes of Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Aksyonov employs a similar blend of satire, phantasmagoria and
rumination in his latest novel, ``The New Sweet Style,'' a book set
largely in America. Although there is an engaging love story at the
heart of this tale, the book's postmodern pyrotechnics lack
conviction, as do Aksyonov's efforts to create a Tom Wolfe-style
portrait of America in the '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   His supporting cast of characters, meant to provide a panoramic
group portrait, consists of people who feel more like a collection
of cliches than real human beings or original satiric types: a
billionaire who wants to give all his money away; an ambitious
yuppie who succeeds in marrying his boss' daughter, and an
assortment of Hollywood movers and shakers who scheme and maneuver
and preen.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the problem is that Aksyonov does not possess the
intimate knowledge of this country that might fuel this sort of
satire. In part, the problem is that his surreal embroiderings on
reality are divorced from any larger vision of the world he is
trying to depict. Whereas ``The Burn'' used antic invention and
mythic allusions to create a darkly hued portrait of the yearning,
desperation and absurdity of life in the Soviet Union, ``Sweet
Style'' simply gives us a series of cartoonish snapshots of people
trying to pursue the American dream _ a predictable collection of
vignettes showing them trying to juggle a surfeit of freedom and
money and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Like Aksyonov, the picaresque hero of ``Sweet Style'' _ one
Aleksandr Zakharovich Korbach _ is a dissident whose notoriety in
Moscow avant-garde circles has drawn the wrath of Soviet officials.
Like Aksyonov, Alex is forced to leave the country in the early
1980s and winds up beginning a new life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Alex's adventures here, however, have the brightly colored _ and
often ludicrous _ quality of a comic book. He goes to Los Angeles
and, despite his impressive credentials as a theater director,
songwriter and actor, gets a job as a parking-garage attendant. To
make extra money he begins selling drugs on the side. When he gets
an apartment in Marina del Rey, he thinks, ``an idiot's dream has
come true, you finally live the way that people with their eternal
Soviet head colds imagine life abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   There are runs-in with a beautiful Soviet agent who threatens to
blackmail him, and worries about his ex-wife, who has moved to
Haiti and become a voodoo priestess. Yet as things happen in this
sort of novel, good luck soon turns the tide. Through a chance
encounter Alex meets a fabulously wealthy businessman named Stanley
Korbach who has determined that Alex is one of his long-lost
cousins. It's not long before Alex has become a director in
residence at a Washington university and has won a lucrative
contract to write a movie based on the life of Dante. After the
collapse of Communism in the Soviet Union, he will return to visit
Moscow, and travel to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   While Stanley is taking Alex under his wing, Alex is falling in
love with Stanley's daughter Nora, an archaeologist who has been
chosen to become one of the first women to go into space. Their
tempestuous romance, which will span decades in starts and stops,
provides this novel with its one compelling narrative strand, even
though it is burdened with heavy-handed comparisons to Dante's love
for Beatrice.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, most of the book's allusions to Dante feel
artificial and contrived. Although both Alex and Dante suffer exile
for their political beliefs, further parallels do not hold up: Alex
does not regard Nora as a source of inspiration for his work; their
love is carnal, not idealized; and Alex, for all his talents, does
not come close to creating a masterwork like ``The Divine Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Aksyonov's incessant authorial asides about the nature of
storytelling, they do little to enhance Alex's story. Rather, they
read like postmodernist garnishes used to rationalize the novel's
unwieldy digressions and improbable subplots. Aksyonov's more antic
inventions (like having Nora randomly dial a phone booth in a ghost
town and reach her long-lost love, Alex) also fail to become an
integral part of the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the innovations in ``The Burn'' and other earlier
Aksyonov works, such passages feel less like daring, formalistic
experiments than gratuitous bits of whimsy grafted onto a
less-than-successful picaresque story. &QL;

&HT;     SUPREME COURT TAKES UP ISSUES OF ABORTION AND GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, Jan. 23)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its historic role as arbiter of constitutional
conflict, the Supreme Court is preparing to plunge into a thicket
of controversy by deciding whether states have the right to ban
late-term abortions and whether gays have a right to serve in the
Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Both issues _ abortion and gay rights _ are so packed with
dynamite that the justices are bound to be denounced however they
may rule.
</P>
<P>
   If they decree that only federal law and not state law can
prohibit partial birth abortions, they will be damned by highly
vocal foes of abortion. If they rule that the states have the power
to prevent partial birth abortions, they will be attacked by the
equally vocal defenders of a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the justices will run into a rhetorical fire storm
when they rule on a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that the Boy
Scouts of America can refuse to permit a homosexual to serve as
scout master.
</P>
<P>
   Those two issues also will figure prominently is this year's
battle for the presidency. The Republican frontrunners, Texas
Governor George W. Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain, oppose
abortion, although not as fervently as some of their conservative
brethren such as Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor McCain is willing to pledge that, if he becomes
his party's nominee, he would select only a foe of abortion, as his
running mate. Both appear to understand that there is little hope
of winning congressional approval for a constitutional amendment
outlawing all abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats vying for their party's nomination _ Vice
President Al Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley _
support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four is a gay rights basher. But Gore and Bradley
have been especially vocal in support of gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Because the partial birth procedure is so gruesome, many
individuals who are not against all abortions oppose it. Under the
procedure, a woman's cervix is dilated so that the fetus, which may
be only a few weeks from birth, may emerge and be killed by
removing its brain tissue. The rest of the now-dead fetus is then
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The case that the high court will review involves Nebraska's
appeal of a lower court's declaration that the state law banning
late-term abortions is unconstitutional. Some proponents of
abortion rights fear that if late term abortions were banned, the
court would turn its back on its 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision
and ban all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who has
been a member of the high bench since 1972 and chief justice since
1983, the Supreme Court has been less controversial than it was in
the recent past. Today's court is not adorned with judicial
activists in the mold of William Brennan, Louis Brandeis, Hugo
Black, Benjamin Cordozo, Oliver Wendell Holmes or Chief Justice
Earl Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The justices now serving on the court tend to be more restrained
in their interpretation of the Constitution than some of their
predecessors who found hidden meanings in that document and painted
their decisions in broad, vivid brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during Earl Warren's 16-year tenure as chief
justice, the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public
schools, decreed that both houses of state legislatures be
apportioned on the basis of `one man, one vote;'' and declared in
the famous Miranda v. Arizona case that a person's confession
cannot be used against him unless he has been advised of specific
steps to avoid self-incrimination,
</P>
<P>
   It was during the chief justiceship of Warrren's successor,
Warren Burger, however, that the court in Roe v. Wade declared that
a pregnant woman has the right to choose an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Burger and Rehnquist are two of the four justices named to the
court by Richard Nixon. The other two were Harry Blackmun who wrote
the court's decision in Roe vs. Wade and Lewis Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, Rehnquist probably comes closer than the others to
meeting Nixon's ideal of a `strict constitutional
constructionist.'' In recent years, conservatives have sought the
appointment of jurists who would seek to adhere to the `original
intent'' of the Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth of the matter is that once an individual has been
granted lifetime tenure on the Supreme Court, that individual is no
longer bound by the political philosophy of the president who
nominated him or her.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, conservatives have been highly critical of the
Supreme Court. But back in 1937, Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to
enlarge the court so that it no longer would be under the control
of justices who sought to scuttle his New Deal programs, it was the
liberals who denounced the `nine old men'' who sat on the court.
</P>
<P>
   FDR failed to get congressional approval for his court packing
scheme, but by the time his presidency ended in 1945, he had
elevated Harlan Fisk Stone to chief justice and named the remaining
eight members of the court.

&HT;     PRINCIPLES VS. PRINCIPLED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA BASS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ The griping about politicians is in full
roar. We all know the litany: Politicians are venal. Politicians
are hypocrites. They never keep promises.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true _ and not surprising _ that politicians often
act like politicians, there's a much deeper problem voters have to
consider when choosing candidates. The problem of principles.
</P>
<P>
   We hear constant complaints that our politicians have no
principles. This is untrue; most politicians _ past and present _
have deeply held principles, and are sincere and steadfast in their
core beliefs throughout their political
</P>
<P>
   lives. So we'd better be certain we understand just what our
candidates really value and really believe in _ because it's likely
they'll act, for better or worse, on those values and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   A man who epitomizes what can go wrong when a politician acts on
principle is Daniel Webster (1782-1852). He was a heroic statesman,
so committed to principle he put his career on the line to avoid
civil war between the North and South. But he did so at a terrible
moral cost. And war came anyway. Born in New Hampshire and a
graduate of Dartmouth, Webster (like most politicians today) was a
lawyer; unlike most of those today, however, he continued his
private practice while in office.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer, he was brilliant, arguing (and winning) many
Supreme Court cases, including his most famous victory, McCulloch
vs. Maryland (1819), in which he proclaimed the supremacy of the
federal government over individual states _ a legal cornerstone of
our current system of national governance. (Although he is often
confused with another New Englander of the time, lexicographer Noah
Webster, the two were not related.)
</P>
<P>
   As a politician _ first a congressman from New Hampshire
(1813-17), then a congressman (1823-27) and senator (1827-41;
1845-50) from Massachusetts _ Daniel Webster was, in most matters
of state, about as principled as the political realities of his era
allowed him to be.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the issue of global trade. As sensitive a
topic then as now, globalization in the 19th century manifested
itself in an ongoing argument over protective tariffs. Early in his
career, Webster heartily opposed tariffs. Later, in a classic
political flip-flop, he supported them. Was it only coincidence
that this reversal made him extremely popular with the
manufacturers who had become his major donors?
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was one principle to which Webster remained loyal
throughout his mature political life. That was his dedication to
the Union. Indeed, one of the events we most remember him for is
his fantastic pro-Union speech of 1830, whose ringing conclusion _
``Liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable!'' _ made
him a Northern hero.
</P>
<P>
   The other event for which Webster is still remembered is far
less wonderful: his role in the Compromise of 1850. It was here,
with the expansion of slavery up for grabs in the Senate, that
Webster's full dedication to principles led him to turn his back on
morality.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that a firm rejection of the extension of slavery would
lead to a civil war, Webster repudiated his Abolitionist supporters
and deliberately offered an obnoxious proposal in order to save the
Union. And ``obnoxious'' is just the word.
</P>
<P>
   Webster not only contended that no new law was needed to halt
the spread of slavery, he also approved the repugnant Fugitive
Slave Act, which required the federal government to return runaway
slaves in the North to their masters in the South. His proposal was
accepted. The Union held.
</P>
<P>
   Webster died two years later, diminished in popularity but
confident that he had done the right thing by preserving the Union
at any cost. He never would know the fragility of his Compromise,
or that it would last only eight more years.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Webster was not just a consummate politician, but also a
man of principle. And it's equally clear that, while adhering to
his principles in the face of political peril, he did the wrong
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for us as voters in this election year is simple,
although not easy. We must take our candidates very seriously and
consider well the deepest principles they hold. More often than we
credit them for, politicians follow their principles. It's up to us
to elect those people who are not only principled, but whose
principles are right.

GREECE AND TURKEY MEET TO START `NEW ERA IN RELATIONS '
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ Four years after Greece and Turkey came to the
brink of war over their competing claims to a barren islet in the
Aegean Sea, their foreign ministers met here Thursday to sign a
series of accords and pledge themselves to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey called the accords ``a
successful beginning toward a new era in relations between our two
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These give me hope because I believe we can do many more
things together,'' Cem said. ``The new relationship will have
positive effects not only on Greece and Turkey, but will also have
positive results in better security, faster development and
democratization in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the accords signed Thursday regulates commerce between
the two countries by guaranteeing that investments will be
protected and that investors will not be subject to double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   The other four accords provide for cooperation in fighting
organized crime, preventing illegal immigration, promoting tourism
and protecting the Aegean environment.
</P>
<P>
   Before the signing ceremony, Foreign Minister George Papandreou
of Greece met with Turkey's prime minister, Bulent Ecevit. At the
meeting, Ecevit conveyed an invitation to his Greek counterpart,
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, to visit Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis faces national elections this spring. His government
must walk a fine political line, building a new relationship with
Turkey without seeming to compromise vital Greek interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move forward in the quickest way possible to solve
all issues that divide us, but I would suggest that we proceed with
the same caution and sensitivity which we have had in the last two
months,'' Papandreou said. ``Now we have to build on this, again
with caution but also with new optimism and dynamism.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers are expected to sign three more accords next month
when Cem visits Athens. They are also discussing new forms of
cooperation, ranging from limits on their military maneuvers in the
Aegean to the possibility of jointly hosting the European soccer
championships in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``The content of these agreements is not so important,'' said
Hikmet Cetin, a former Turkish foreign minister. ``What's important
is that people in Turkey, Greece and Cyprus now see that the two
governments can deal with each other in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece and Turkey have a long history of enmity, and relations
have been frigid for most of the last quarter-century, since
Turkey's dispatch of troops to Cyprus in 1974, which led to the
island's division into Turkish and Greek sectors. Since then,
Athens and Ankara have argued bitterly not only about Cyprus, but
also about rights to the airspace over the Aegean and the seabed
beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, the Clinton administration stepped in to restrain
Greece and Turkey from fighting over a 10-acre Aegean islet of
rocky outcroppings inhabited by goats, which Greeks call Imia and
Turks call Kardak.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry has persisted despite both countries' being members
of the NATO alliance. It has caused considerable strains within
NATO. The United States has sought repeatedly, though so far
unsuccessfully, to bring the two sides together.
</P>
<P>
   What successive American presidents failed to do was
accomplished last year through a series of unforeseen events.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, whose
guerrillas had been fighting the Turkish army for 14 years, was
captured in Kenya while under the protection of Greek diplomats.
The resulting scandal led to the resignations of Greece's hard-line
foreign minister and several intelligence officers who were
considered strongly anti-Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year, Turkey and Greece were both struck by major
earthquakes, and each country sent aid to the other. The quakes
became powerful reminders that the two nations share both geography
and destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Greece withdrew its objection to Turkish membership
in the European Union. As a result, the union named Turkey an
official candidate for membership, setting off a wave of jubilation
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is never going to be a better time than now to solve our
disagreements,'' Cetin said. ``You have a very reasonable
government in Greece. You've got an American president who's in his
last year in office and would love to see this done before he
retires. And you've got a Turkish leader who has always been tough
on the Cyprus issue, so no one can accuse him of selling out
Cyprus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through a great stage of symbolism in Greek-Turkish
friendship,'' Cetin continued. ``Now it's very critical that we
move quickly to the real tough problems, which are Cyprus and the
Aegean.''

GILBERT &AMP; SULLIVAN FANS WILL LOVE `TOPSY-TURVY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be hard to immediately think of a more unlikely
director for a splashy biography of Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan than Mike
Leigh, who made his name with a series of bleak kitchen-sink dramas
set in a culture-shocked contemporary England (``Naked,'' ``Secrets
&AMP; Lies'').
</P>
<P>
   But his new film, ``Topsy-Turvy,'' is a colorful tribute to the
most successful musical team of the late Victorian era _ less a
standard biography than a lively celebration of the duo, the spirit
of their music, and their unique contribution to the history of
musical theater.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in 1884, as the pair have already established
themselves with such hits as ``The Pirates of Penzance,'' ``HMS
Pinafore'' and ``The Sorcerer,'' and are just launching ``Princess
Ida,'' another financial hit but one that strikes some critics as a
rehash of their earlier work, and a signal of the wan of
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Composer Sir Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) _ ravaged by
kidney stones, creatively depleted and stinging from the stigma of
working in a ``low'' art form (what one critic calls
``topsy-turvydom'') _ decides to break up their phenomenally
successful collaboration and devote his time to composing operas
and other ``serious'' works of music.
</P>
<P>
   Lyricist William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent), in many ways the
leader of the team, is appalled by Sullivan's defection, and so is
the manager of the Savoy Theater (Ron Cook), where the G&AMP;S musicals
draw a steady queue. But nothing can change Sullivan's mind, and he
especially loathes Gilbert's libretto for a proposed new musical.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while visiting an exhibition of Japanese culture, Gilbert
suddenly gets the idea for ``The Mikado,'' Sullivan comes around,
and the rest of the film is a kind of simulated ``making of''
documentary that follows the cast and creators through the staging
of their greatest comic opera _ from early rehearsals to opening
night.
</P>
<P>
   At 160 minutes, it's a bit long and uneventful for anyone who is
not at least a moderate fan of these distinctive musicals, and
Leigh thinks nothing of recreating a full scene at random from
``Ida,'' ``The Sorcerer'' and ``The Mikado,'' or devoting a full
reel of film to depicting a group of actors fumbling through a
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the movie that G&AMP;S fans _ and there are legions of
them, with near-fanatical G&AMP;S Societies all over the globe _ have
been waiting for: much more authentic, flavorful and
psychologically shrewd than its only predecessor, Sidney Gilliat's
1953 ``The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously a big fan himself, Leigh has approached the subject
with immense respect for accuracy (with many of the scenes
recreated on the very stage of the Savoy Theater), an awe for the
genius of the G&AMP;S collaboration and a surprising _ considering his
rather understated and static earlier films _ visual flair.
</P>
<P>
   He's also gathered a uniformly excellent cast and coaxed a
stand-out performance from Broadbent (``Life is Sweet''). As the
petulant, practical and intensely driven W.S. Gilbert, he's so
quietly captivating that he would seem to have at least an outside
chance this time next month at his first Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the film was named best picture of the year by the
New York Film Critics Circle and shared the top picture honors with
``Being John Malkovich'' in the year-end awards from the National
Society of Film Critics. Both groups also named Leigh best
director.
</P>
<P>
   Topsy-Turvy. Directed and written by Mike Leigh. Cast: Jim
Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Timothy Spall, Ron Cook, Wendy
Nottingham, Kevin McKidd. USA Films. 160 minutes. Rated R for some
nudity.

`ANGELA'S ASHES' WILL BE A TREAT ONLY FOR LOVERS OF THE BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening moments of the film version of ``Angela's
Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's 1997 Pulitzer prize-winning memoir of his
harsh Irish upbringing, the narrator warns us this is going to be a
story of the most ``miserable childhood'' imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two-and-a-half hours, it continually one-ups itself
in misery. It positively wallows in abuse and ignorance and abject
poverty _ without offering, really, a single redeeming supporting
character. It's the first film I know of in which we get to see all
five of the top-billed actors vomit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's the point. People who love the book _ and
there are legions of them, because it's one of the publishing
phenomena of the past decade _ love it precisely because it's so
uncompromising in its quest to prove there's nothing as miserable
as a miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
</P>
<P>
   So the movie _ which was co-written and directed in an
uncharacteristically sedate manner by Alan Parker (``Midnight
Express,'' ``Evita'') _ does deliver fidelity to its source, and
McCourt's fans should relish it. But, for the rest of us, all this
misery crammed into 145 minutes makes for one rough sit.
</P>
<P>
   The story opens in Brooklyn, 1935, when, in an odd reversal of
the normal American emigrant experience, the McCourt family has
decided to return to Ireland, mostly because the father (Robert
Carlyle) is an ineffectual drunk who can't hold a job, even in the
land of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Limerick, they're taken in by the family matriarch and
we follow the upbringing of the oldest son and narrator Frank
(played by three different actors in various stages of his life) as
his family moves from one traumatic experience to another over the
years, and gradually disintegrates.
</P>
<P>
   Angela (Emily Watson), the chain-smoking mother, can't stop
having children, and they keep dying, one by one _ from sudden
infant death syndrome, malnutrition, unsanitary living conditions
(the family lives, for much of the movie, next to an open community
lavatory) and the various ailments associated with the
``dampness.''
</P>
<P>
   The father drinks up whatever money he earns, the mother
ridicules the father with her constant reminders that he's utterly
``worthless,'' and the Catholic Church _ which holds supreme power
in the community _ is unsympathetic and unhelpful and demeaning.
Everyone in the movie is abusive and prejudiced and harrowingly
ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chronicle of bullying teachers and mean-spirited priests,
of families reduced to begging and prostitution to survive, of
overflowing chamber pots spilling on the floor and little naked
children covered in flea-bites or their own excrement when their
mother can't get out of bed for weeks and their father is off on a
binge.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the movie unusual is that it doesn't balance its
misery with redeeming qualities or characters. It makes a
half-hearted try in that direction in Frank's quest to escape to
America, but it doesn't take. And there's no real humor, no visual
poetry, no great performances or uplifting moments. This is not ``A
Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' or even ``Dancing at Lughnasa.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, a great lesson for anyone who thinks
soul-devouring poverty is in any way ennobling, or that the earlier
decades of the century were the ``good old days.'' Like the book,
the movie is also likely to serve as effective therapy for Irish
Catholics traumatized by their upbringing and others who can't get
over their miserable childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But I felt brutalized by it. It ruined my day and I don't think
I'm a better person for having seen it. I don't think it's dramatic
art and I don't think _ in the end _ it's probably any more
accurate a portrayal of the universal Irish experience than its
cinematic polar opposite: the green fields and warm-hearted
characters of John Ford's ``The Quiet Man.''
</P>

`HELLHOUNDS ON MY TRAIL': BLUESMAN ROBERT JOHNSON IS RECALLED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more colorful legends surrounding Robert Johnson, the
Delta blues pioneer who died in 1938, is that he sold his soul to
the Devil at a crossroads in exchange for his musical mastery. And
if you listen to Johnson's original recordings, which profoundly
influenced the 1960s generation of rockers, most notably Eric
Clapton and the Rolling Stones, it is almost possible to believe in
such a transaction. Johnson's sliding acoustic blues riffs shiver
with fatalistic intimations of fire and brimstone, and his taut,
piercing tenor keens with a grim, fearful exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the legend, along with speculation as to the
whereabouts of that mythical crossroads and the cause of Johnson's
death (was he poisoned by a jealous husband; did he die of
pneumonia or syphilis?) are among the questions addressed in Robert
Mugge's earnest, absorbing documentary ``Hellhounds on My Trail:
The Afterlife of Robert Johnson.'' The movie focuses on a weeklong
tribute to Johnson presented in September 1998 by the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Part academic study, part concert film, the movie features some
wonderful performances of Johnson's music. Robert Lockwood Jr., his
stepson, offers a mournful ``Love in Vain,'' and the guitarist and
singer Chris Whitley delivers a sinewy, snarling ``Hellhound on My
Trail,'' a doom-ridden blues dirge filled with terrifying images of
hail and howling wind.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable performances belong to Rory Block; a vocal trio
made up of Tracy Nelson, Marcia Ball and Irma Thomas; and Bob Weir
of the Grateful Dead, working with bassist Rob Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   Like other documentaries by Mugge, who specializes in austere
celebrations of roots music, the movie is remarkable for its lack
of hyperbole. When various musicians who are interviewed discuss
Johnson's music, instead of heaping on the superlatives, they
analyze his hard-to-imitate slide technique and spiky off-center
beats.
</P>
<P>
   The word afterlife is a key to the film, which is not an attempt
at a biography of Johnson (the soundtrack includes none of his
original recordings) but an investigation of his legacy, with
special attention to the lucrative Robert Johnson industry that has
flowered since a handful of his recordings were reissued on a Delta
blues collection in 1961. The movie assumes the viewer has some
knowledge of blues and rock history. There is no discussion of
blues lineage or of how the music made its way north from the
Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven among the stirring live performances are excerpts
from a symposium on Johnson (featuring a clear-eyed keynote address
by the writer and music scholar Peter Guralnick) and visits to
Helena, Ark., and to the Delta. The movie's journalistic
centerpiece is an extended interview with Willie Coffee, Johnson's
childhood friend, who gently debunks the notion that he might have
made an actual Faustian bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Another central figure in the film is Stephen C. La Vere, the
self-appointed lawyer for the Johnson estate and a blues aficionado
who had a major hand in creating the Robert Johnson industry. After
traveling to the Delta and contacting various Johnson relatives, La
Vere took the guitarist's music out of the public domain and
demanded that the musicians who had recorded it begin paying for
it. Clapton, he notes approvingly, was quick to oblige. The estate
has since built up a reservoir of more than $1 million in
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is unrated, takes one odd tangent in its
investigation of a rare film that surfaced, which some believed
showed Johnson playing the guitar. In proving beyond a doubt that
the film was made in 1942, four years after Johnson died,
``Hellhounds on My Trail'' dispels that rumor. But to those who are
not privy to the machinations of the Robert Johnson industry, it
looks as if the screen time devoted to dispelling a rumor would
have been better spent elsewhere.

`PLAY IT TO THE BONE' DESERVES A 10-COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only extraordinary thing about ``Play It To the Bone'' is
that it may be the only boxing movie ever made by Hollywood that is
not an anti-boxing movie. It actually likes the sport, and finds a
Hemingway-esque nobility in the spectacle of two men pounding each
other into hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most die-hard ring fan is likely to be turned off
by the 100 minutes of bad humor that surrounds the film's one epic
fight scene. Indeed, none of writer-director Ron Shelton's sports
comedies (even the less-successful ones like ``Cobb'') has ever
fallen quite this flat.
</P>
<P>
   A long time labor-of-love for the former Seattle-resident
filmmaker that he spent much of the '90s trying to get off the
ground, the film is about two long-over-the-hill pugilist pals
(Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas) who get a last shot at the
big time.
</P>
<P>
   When the two middleweights scheduled to fill the lower card of a
Mike Tyson championship fight in Las Vegas are suddenly indisposed
by overdose and death, respectively, the desperate promoter (Tom
Sizemore) calls on the pair to substitute _ in only six hours time.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the movie takes place as they drive from L.A. to
Vegas in the company of their joint ex-girlfriend (Lolita
Davidovich) bickering with and insulting each other and everyone
else they encounter, and reliving their past hard-knocks in
flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Once the now-estranged friends finally get in the ring, this
dead movie takes on a ghoulish fascination _ and, finally, a kind
of life _ as Shelton goes all out to out-rage ``Raging Bull'' with
10 full rounds of the most bloody and brutal fight scenes
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   But almost none of the film's humor works. Banderas has a
winning moment or two, but Harrelson is almost too annoying to
endure, none of the other casting really clicks, and all the
characters seem stupid, unpleasant and about as charming as a
smelly gym sock.
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Shelton always walks a brave, fine line. When he
remains upright _ and has a star as likable and inoffensive and
effortlessly charming as Kevin Costner at his best _ in films like
``Bull Durham'' and ``Tin Cup,'' his daring work can be sublime.
</P>
<P>
   But when he falls, he falls hard. His gags can descend into an
excruciating litany of macho drivel _ anti-gay and sexist
one-liners, and the lowest variety of locker-room butt-slapping. In
this movie, he falls so hard he becomes, for the first time in his
career, genuinely offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Play It to the Bone. Directed and written by Ron Shelton. Cast:
Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Tom Sizemore,
Robert Wagner. Touchstone. 120 minutes. Rated R for language,
nudity and violence.

BOSTON ART REVIEW: POISED AND ELEGANT, LIKE THE BRAHMINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
 (bl)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one could accuse Boston of being a hotbed of the
avant-garde. From early on, its prominent citizens, many of them
arrivistes themselves, evinced a snooty disdain for the new in
their houses and furnishings, opting instead for conservative
environments that were dignified, elegant and ``tastey,'' as a
prominent Boston textile merchant, Nathan Appleton, put it.
</P>
<P>
   The solid but unchallenging objects they chose are on view in
``Boston in the Age of Neo-Classicism: 1810-1840'' at the Hirschl &AMP;
Adler Galleries. A small but choice survey of the fine and
decorative arts in that city at that time, it reveals how the
leading lights _ architects, furniture designers and upscale
citizens _ shunned the flamboyance of New York and Philadelphia for
objects that were ``restrained and tasteful, consisting of a
limited but aesthetically pleasing vocabulary of form and
ornament,'' writes Page Talbott, a historian of Boston furniture,
in the show's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, organized by Stuart P. Feld, president of
Hirschl &AMP; Adler and a specialist in the field of American
neo-Classical decorative arts, is dedicated to the American Wing at
the Metropolitan Museum in honor of its 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Said to be the first show ever devoted exclusively to this
period of Boston's artistic heritage, it includes furniture,
silver, lighting, glass, porcelain and metalwork, along with
paintings, drawings, sculpture and prints. But the emphasis is on
furniture: handsome, beautifully finished pieces in neo-Classical
style that, taken all together, seem to resemble the attractive
members of a rather staid family.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the furniture, Ms. Talbott points out, was as
homogeneous as Bostonians themselves, whose ancestry was
overwhelmingly British. Like a family, the furniture shares the
same characteristics, modeled on English and French precedents.
Pier tables, for instance, are likely to have flattened ball feet,
round veneered columns with ormolu capitals and bases, and applied
ormolu mounts in the French style. English pattern books provided
archetypes for the carving on neo-Classical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The lyre, a Greek symbol of music and poetry, was almost a
genetic motif, used in wall clocks, table supports, chair backs and
gilt ornamentation. A particularly soigne mahogany work table
(circa 1812-14) with rounded end drawers and an oval top _
attributed to the cabinetmaker Thomas Seymour _ has as its base a
pair of carved wood lyres framed by slim columns and actually
strung with metal. A fussy pair of upholstered mahogany side chairs
each has as a back a stylized, intricately carved lyre.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a visitor to Beacon Hill, home of Brahmins and
would-be's, would certainly not meet with rude surprises in decor.
At its best, such a setting might include items in the show like
the huge, haughty mahogany closed-door bookcase (1820-25),
influenced by English Regency furniture, whose dazzling effect lies
in the extraordinary display of matching veneers on its facade.
</P>
<P>
   It also could have encompassed the stunning mahogany gueridon,
or small-top table (about 1835), whose white marble slab is
supported by three graceful, arching legs set on a base. And the
gaming table (about 1815-20) with the checkerboard top of inlaid
marble and pull-out candle-stands supported by a mahogany trestle.
And the poised neo-Classical sofa (about 1820), whose delicately
carved mahogany frame _ upholstered in red silk brocade _ sits
confidently on winged-paw feet and turns at each arm in a charming
curve.
</P>
<P>
   Illumination for the upper-caste Boston home was chosen as
carefully as the furniture. Among the showier items in the
exhibition is a stately four-light Argand chandelier _ a lamp
fueled by a tank (usually of whale oil) and named for Aime Argand,
the Swiss chemist who invented it _ made in England by Thomas
Messenger &AMP; Sons about 1830. A bronze ring, suspended from the
ceiling by bronze rods, supports an urn-shaped lamp mechanism and
four glass lanterns from which cut-glass tinklers dangle.
</P>
<P>
   A more common source of light was the sinumbra table lamp,
so-called because it worked without casting a shadow, by means of a
flattened oval globe that topped a candlesticklike stem. An
arresting example here is one with a stem of black amethyst pressed
glass and a frosted-glass shade with delicate wheel-cut motifs,
possibly made by the New England Glass Co. of Boston about 1830.
Then there was the rarer ``student'' lamp, a burner with a shade
and glass chimney that juts out from a straight rod holding its
flattened fuel tank. A gilt brass pair was made between 1832 and
1835 by Henry N. Hooper of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Outstanding silver includes an ugly but dignified tea and coffee
service (about 1813) made for the Appleton family by Boston
silversmiths who emigrated to Philadelphia, Thomas Fletcher and
Sidney Gardiner. The four pieces are engraved with the Appleton's
crest of an elephant's head spouting a snake that wraps around its
trunk. The tea and the coffee pot have eagle heads for spouts, and
cast heads serve as handles for the covered sugar bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast is a graceful silver presentation urn (1816) in late
Federal style, made by the partnership of Jesse Churchill and
Daniel Treadwell and inscribed to a prominent Mason, Thaddeus
Harris (1768-1842). It is distinguished by a scalloped lid,
eagle's-head handles and dainty paw feet.
</P>
<P>
   Metalwork _ including an early patented alarm clock (1819-24) by
Simon Willard, mounted on a mahogany pedestal in the shape of a
lighthouse _ as well as mirrors, glass and porcelain objects add to
the show's luster.
</P>
<P>
   As for the group of paintings chosen to accent the furniture,
it's a mixed bag. A fine Gilbert Stuart portrait shows off the
charms of Mrs. Harrison Gray Otis (1809), a fashionable and
vivacious Bostonian whose gown sports a risque plunging neckline.
An intriguing group of miniatures includes a trio of relief
portraits (1810) of the Nahum Piper family, a rare endeavor in
colored wax on painted glass by Johann Christian Rauschner.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting portrait is that of one Elizabeth Trull
(1831) by Henry Cheever Pratt. Done in the elevated, high-flown
style known as Grand Manner, it depicts the subject in a perky red
bolero bodice with flared sleeves, standing next to a Chickering
piano with her hand on a sheet of music, evidence of her culture
and refinement. In her left hand she holds a peacock feather fan.
An operatic curtain behind her is open to reveal a glimpse of a
classical vista.
</P>
<P>
   Several landscapes (prints and paintings) show Boston as it
looked in that era. Thomas Cole's sweeping ``View of Boston''
(around 1837) gives a hint of the city at a distance across a
pastoral landscape. ``View of the City of Boston From Dorchester
Heights'' (1841) by Robert Havell Jr. brings it up closer, a
village with slews of church spires dominated by the state capitol.
Other paintings by Bass Otis, Robert Salmon, George Loring Brown
and Washington Allston keep pleasant company with the furniture.

`WIREY SPINDELL': PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS; AND HE'S A CREEP, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
(af) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Wirey Spindell. He's engaged to a beautiful woman named
Tabatha (Callie Thorne), whom he professes to adore and with whom
he shares a spacious, tastefully underfurnished apartment somewhere
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But Wirey (Eric Schaeffer, who also wrote and directed) is
tormented by the fact that, as he puts it, he can't make love to
the woman he loves. For her part, Tabatha is leery of marrying a
man unable to fulfill his conjugal duties. Can they work it out in
time for the wedding?
</P>
<P>
   If this question doesn't pique your curiosity or arouse your
sympathy, too bad, because for a very long hour and 41 minutes
Spindell would like to tell you the story of his life. ``My problem
is that I'm a man,'' he explains, by way of preface. This is a
slander against half the human race. His problem is that he's Wirey
Spindell. It's also Tabatha's problem. And if you see this movie,
it will be yours.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply that Wirey is a self-absorbed creep
whose emotions run the gamut from self-pity to passive aggression.
There have been plenty of good movies about self-absorbed creeps _
one or two of them directed by people other than Woody Allen. The
real problem is that the movie, rather than reflecting upon Wirey's
narcissism, simply reflects it. Being endlessly interested in
yourself is not the same as being endlessly interesting. ``Wirey
Spindell'' is as deep as the average male bellybutton, and its
contents are about as appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer's first feature, ``My Life's in Turnaround'' (1994),
upheld one of the core principles of American independent cinema in
the early and mid-1990s: that any young, heterosexual white man
with woman trouble, a career crisis and a credit card could make a
movie _ more often than not a movie about his woman trouble and his
career crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Like other films in this vein _ ``The Brothers McMullen,'' say,
or ``Kicking and Screaming'' _ ``My Life's in Turnaround'' got a
lot of mileage from its scruffy, seat-of-the-pants charm. And
Schaeffer's pluck and resourcefulness as a director, as well as his
manic, vulnerable onscreen presence, camouflaged the fact that the
movie was, at bottom, a fairly conventional (that is, a wildly
implausible) romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wirey Spindell,'' which follows Schaeffer's more ambitious,
less critically indulged subsequent efforts (``If Lucy Fell'' and
``Fall''), clings desperately to its romantic comedy plot in a
doomed effort to give coherence, and meaning, to its episodic
central narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Young Wirey, born to ``hippie parents'' in 1962, spends the
early part of his childhood living with his mother in a dark Upper
East Side apartment, tasting the pleasures of snack cakes and cold
milk, pilfered red wine, and precocious sex play. In junior high,
he flees to his father's house in Vermont, where he graduates to
hallucinogens and intercourse with his basketball coach's
19-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   His college years consist of more sexual experimentation and
more drug use, culminating in a broken heart and a trip to rehab
(though not in that order), after which Wirey returns to New York,
where he and Tabatha meet, as the saying goes, cute.
</P>
<P>
   At each stage of his life, Wirey is played by a different actor,
who has the privilege of intoning the film's increasingly verbose,
unstintingly pretentious voice-over narration. This device works
well enough with the 6- and 13-year-old Wireys (Zane Adlum and
Devin Matthews-Johnson, respectively), but Wirey from 17 through 25
is played by Eric Mabius, a pouty, pretty actor who looks nothing
like Schaeffer.
</P>
<P>
   Tabatha, who is played by Ms. Thorne throughout, must therefore
fall for a man whose mannerisms and appearance will change
completely, and not for the better, in the course of their
relationship. Maybe that's the real problem.

<P>
   It may be, of course, that everything that happens in ``Wirey
Spindell'' is based on a real-life event, except the ending, which
is ludicrously unconvincing even by the lax standards of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   But to say that this movie is true to life is only to say that
it's banal, boring and confusing. According to its publicity
material, the film was adapted from a novel Schaeffer wrote some
years ago, which was greeted with ``rejection letters and
return-to-sender postmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   This useful information allows me to end on a positive note.
``Wirey Spindell'' is a movie that will restore your faith in
American publishing. &QL;

`PLAY IT TO THE BONE': JUICY DIALOGUE IS UNDERMINED BY SHALLOW
PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Shelton's screwball boxing comedy ``Play It to the Bone'' is
so constrained by its formulaic plot that the movie's juicy,
freewheeling dialogue feels shoehorned into a story that makes more
sense mathematically than psychologically. If the movie (which is
predictable right down to the outcome of its climactic bout) had
been allowed to take one quirky left turn, it might have come
closer to matching the power of Shelton's baseball film, ``Bull
Durham,'' or his golf film, ``Tin Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   But the barrage of macho, sports-smart wisecracks slung by its
charismatic stars, Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas, barely
camouflage the weaknesses of a story built on some highly
questionable premises.
</P>
<P>
   This shallowness is unfortunate, since Shelton is one of the few
Hollywood filmmakers at home in the world of professional sports.
Each of his sports films (``Play It to the Bone'' is the fifth)
offers an insider's view of a world that shrouds itself in a
self-protective macho mystique. ``Play It to the Bone'' makes no
apologies for the low-down sleaziness of professional boxing, Las
Vegas-style. In its behind-the-scenes portrait of a world of
corrupt promoters, shady lawyers, lecherous hotel owners and
strutting high rollers, athletes are viewed as little more than
dumb trained animals to be patronized and outsmarted by the sharks
who profit from their sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' begins promisingly as it observes the
hysterical, inept negotiations of two slightly over-the-hill
fighters and best friends, Cesar Dominguez (Banderas) and Vince
Boudreau (Harrelson), living in Los Angeles, who are called upon to
fight each other as last-minute opening-act replacements at a
heavyweight title bout in Las Vegas. Although the money is good
($50,000 a man), what really motivates Cesar and Vince to accept
the offer is the chance to redeem their professional reputations
after failures that stalled their once-promising careers. Whoever
wins, they insist, must be contractually guaranteed a shot at the
middleweight title, although we're let in on the fact that their
contracts have built-in loopholes that make that prospect unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seriously delving into the absurdities of
professional boxing, ``Play It to the Bone'' quickly turns into a
brittle three-way buddies-on-the-road movie, which follows Cesar
and Vince from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in a car driven by their
biggest fan, best friend and mutual ex-lover, Grace Pasic (Lolita
Davidovich).
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film, when Grace breaks up with Cesar, her
boyfriend of six months, he jumps out of the car and dashes out
into a desert to vent his grief, returning minutes later
miraculously purged. At various points in the journey, Grace,
goading the fighters to do their best, warns each one that the
other is likely to win. She also privately reassures each one that
he was the superior lover. The notion that these three could
actually be pals given their romantic histories (Vince still cares,
in his way), flies in the face of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, Banderas' Cesar is the least defined. Born in
Madrid, Spain, he moved to the United States to become a
prizefighter and settled in Philadelphia, where his career ascended
until a disastrous match that its promoter (the same promoter
booking the Vegas bout) accused him of throwing. In Vince, a former
middleweight contender whose title bout ended in a draw, Harrelson
has another one of his lusty wild-man roles. Played by the actor as
an electrical spasm of macho impulsiveness, Vince has survived
years of drug and alcohol abuse and numerous car accidents. Since
the last nearly fatal car crash, in which he found Jesus (who
appears to him more than once in the film), he has calmed down a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   The movie brings up homophobia in professional sports by having
Cesar admit early in the journey that after his humiliating defeat
he experimented with gay sex. Pouncing on this information, Vince
declares more than once his shock that his best friend has turned
out to be a ``fag.'' But having brought up the issue, the movie has
no idea what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty, independent Grace, who throws two serious punches at
different characters in the film, is a refreshingly self-assured if
not very believable screwball heroine. An inventor of items like a
periscope for watching television while lying flat in bed, she
dreams of finding a high-rolling Las Vegas investor for her dubious
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' is so busy being cute and smart-alecky
that when Cesar and Vince finally enter the ring for a bout that
turns out to be long and exceptionally brutal, what should have
been an emotionally loaded battle has little resonance, despite the
insertion of flashbacks and hallucinations that portray the match
as a turning point in the fighters' lives. Are they fools or
heroes? Because the movie can't decide, neither can we. And without
an emotional payoff, ``Play It to the Bone'' ends up stranded in
serio-comic limbo.

`QUARRY': MAN, GOD, JUSTICE AND RACE RELATIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The immanence of guilt and the fallibility of mankind overarch
the knotted racial relations of South Africa in the provocative,
mysterious thriller ``Quarry.''
</P>
<P>
   Its title alone, suggesting either a place where building blocks
are excavated or prey that is hunted, bears witness to the
intriguing ambiguity that characterizes an excellent film willing
to grapple with daunting human and political complexities.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Damon Galgut adapted for the screen by
Marion Hansel, the film's director, and accompanied by an
insinuating score by Takachi Kaso that accentuates its unremitting
tension, ``Quarry'' unfolds in desolate landscapes inhabited by
restless, tortured souls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its characters bear generic names like the Man and the
Woman, and ``The Quarry'' begins and ends with images of men, one
white and later one black, on the run from the unknown and the
known.
</P>
<P>
   For all its susceptibility to symbolic interpretation and its
considerations of man, God, justice and the wrenching racial
relations of South Africa, ``The Quarry'' is never less than a
well-acted, first-rate venture into mystery and suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The characters include the Man (John Lynch), a white first seen
in guilty flight from some invisible pursuer. They include the
Reverend (Serge-Henry Valcke), a white minister who offers the Man
a ride and is murdered and buried in a quarry when the Man
violently rejects his homosexual overture. Adopting the identity of
the man of God, who is bound for a new post, the Man arrives in a
remote village and takes up the cleric's duties, ministering to the
parishioners and comforting the dying.
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival, his stolen car is broken into and his
possessions taken by Valentine (Oscar Petersen), an impoverished
young black man. The local police chief, the blond Captain Mong
(Jonny Phillips), who is having an affair with the Woman (Sylvia
Esau), a black in whose home the Man is boarding, arrests Valentine
for the theft and then links him through circumstantial evidence to
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Captain Mong's relationship with a black woman, he
countenances the beating of Valentine and holds him for trial. Even
when the Man, guilt ridden, speaks of black-white kinship in South
Africa and indicates that he is not what he seems to be, the
Captain chooses denial and silence over truth and justice.

 &HT;    Dark, epic and true to the popular book, `Angela's Ashes'
chronicles one family's travail
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angela's Ashes'' is so proudly, relentlessly wet that you may
need a raincoat just to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   In his best-selling memoir, Frank McCourt detailed his dirt-poor
childhood in Ireland with intimacy and sly humor. The movie version
stays faithful to the book's details, but it is epic-scaled and
somber. It proclaims its seriousness by giving us five different
scenes of people vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins in New York, where Irish immigrant Angela
(Emily Watson) is struggling to feed her many sons. Her pint-loving
husband Malachy (Robert Carlyle) tends to go out ``for cigarettes''
and fail to come back for several days. After a series of infant
deaths almost send Angela around the bend, her family in Ireland
sends them tickets home to the old country. Where things only get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Because it starts on such a grim note, the movie doesn't have
much room to build dramatically. It's not a story about a family
descending into unexpected hardship. Rather, it's a catalog of
travails that are distinguished mainly by their variety: hunger,
illness, alcoholism, typhoid, flooded floors, mattresses peppered
with fleas and sheep's heads served for dinner. It has its upbeat
moments: young Frank's skipping his dance lessons and having to
fake a few jigs for his family, or his discovery of language and
writing. But mostly it's a series of visits to the welfare line.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite parts
recreated on-screen. Others, who don't have the memory of McCourt's
lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might wonder what the fuss
is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Director Alan Parker (``Evita'') has never been a subtle
filmmaker. Look at ``Midnight Express'' or ``Fame.'' Even his
previous foray to Ireland, ``The Commitments,'' turned the story of
a small, scrappy band into a long music video. Parker leans on many
of his old tricks in ``Angela's Ashes.'' He lights the squalor
quite beautifully, giving even the rainiest scene a pearly luster.
But the emotional mood never changes much.
</P>
<P>
   A better choice of director might have been Ireland's own Neil
Jordan. But you could say that he's already made this movie, in a
way: his film of childhood torment and madness, the mesmerizing
``The Butcher Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Angela, Watson gives the movie its emotional core. She
suffers beautifully, but the role is too saintly to tap the wilder
acting skills she brought to ``Breaking the Waves'' and ``Hilary
and Jackie.'' Carlyle manages to make his drunken da' oddly
sympathetic, keeping the role from caricature. Unfortunately, he
disappears long before the final credits, and the movie suffers
from losing his energy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the three boys (Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael
Legge) who play Frank at 8, 13 and as a young adult, they're fine.
But you can't help noticing how little they resemble one another,
even though they play the same person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle. Rated R for sexual
content and language. 2 hours, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This finely made adaptation of the popular memoir
is almost too stately for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects:

 &HT;    Art, politics clash in Robbins' `Cradle'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bless his bleeding liberal heart. Tim Robbins has put his money
_ and more importantly, his art _ where his mouth is. ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' an overcluttered, overearnest movie, has one thing going
for it: integrity. Robbins and his star-laden cast could all be
making big bucks doing something, well, a little more overtly
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, their commitment and good intentions don't make this a
better movie. ``Cradle'' takes its title from Marc Blitzstein's
musical ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' which was famously staged in 1937
in an impromptu, to-hell-with-the government-censors performance
led by director Orson Welles and John Houseman.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins uses this event _ electrifyingly restaged in the film _
as the central thread in a series of interlocking stories
illustrating the collision of art and politics in Depression-era
New York.
</P>
<P>
   While fat-cat zillionaires like Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack)
discreetly buy masterpieces from Mussolini's swank, wheeler-dealer
former mistress (Susan Sarandon), Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones),
head of the Federal Theatre Project, which was Blitzstein's backer,
bravely stands up to a wrongheaded committee of right-wing
politicians who see her theatrical company as a hotbed of communism
and want it shut down. Blitzstein's (Hank Azaria) musical, you see,
with its pro-labor sentiments, is precisely the sort of thing that
makes the committee literally see red.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the large and generally excellent cast are Ruben
Blades as artist Diego Rivera, Joan Cusack as an adamantly
anti-commie informant, Bill Murray as an over-the-hill
ventriloquist who becomes her dupe, Cary Elwes as an effete
Houseman and John Turturro and Emily Watson as members of the
``Cradle'' cast who end up literally shouting their lines from the
balcony or the orchestra seats.
</P>
<P>
   The standouts are Sarandon, Jones and Vanessa Redgrave as a
wealthy patron with a bohemian streak. The weak link is Angus
MacFadyen as Welles, who fails to suggest the boy-wonder director
vocally or physically and, worse, never captures his self-centered
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Structured as a kind of historical smorgasbord, ``Cradle'' is
part ``Ragtime,'' part ``Nashville.'' And, while there are some
wonderful moments, the picture as a whole is didactic and often as
self-righteous as the smug right-wingers it attacks. Only in the
scenes where Flanagan tries to talk sense to insensitive men do we
get a feeling for the tension of the times. The rest is too
diffuse, too crowded, to engage even those in the movie audience in
sync with Robbins' politics.
</P>
<P>
   See it for the bits of history and for the performances, for its
energy and ambition. But remember going in that this is more of a
rant than a movie.``Cradle Will Rock''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Hank Azaria, Susan Sarandon and Ruben
Blades. Directed by Tim Robbins. Rated R for profanity and
sexuality. 2 hours,

<P>
   The verdict: Doesn't really rock along as you'd hope.

   It's big, it's bold, it's big. The sheer size of the latest Imax
offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience. Otherwise,
this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest state is
just one of those languid Discovery Channel-style nature flicks.

   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.

<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A

ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' R (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson
</P>
<P>
   and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   A finely made adaptation of Frank McCourt's popular memoir of
growing up in poverty and death in Ireland that's almost too
stately for its own good. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing their
favorite parts re-created onscreen. Others, who don't have the
memory of McCourt's lyrical prose whispering in their heads, might
wonder what the fuss is all about. (SM) 2 hours, 26 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness. (SM) At metro
theaters. 2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges as the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours,
50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
``Man'' moves swiftly for its first 90 minutes, but it slows down
to become a disappointingly conventional love story that isn't
really persuasive. The movie has a heart, but a flagging pulse.
(SM) At metro theaters. 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradle Will Rock'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria, Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Ruben Blades.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't. Tim Robbins' ambitious and energetic ensemble movie
is, on the whole, overdone, over-cluttered and overly didactic. The
movie presents the collision of art and politics in '30s New York,
especially as it applied to a famous to-hell-with-the-censors
staging of Marc Blitzstein's pro-labor musical, ``The Cradle Will
Rock.'' For all its ambition and good intentions, this is more a
rant than a movie. (ERG) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo'' R (profanity, gross-out humor,
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rob Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Choppy, cheap-looking and with dead spots like the Sahara, it
also has a surprising number of genuinely funny bits, most of them
slapsticky and gleefully rude. Rob Schneider plays Deuce, a fish
tender who moonlights as a ``manwhore,'' and, although he has never
been funny for more than three minutes at any previous time in his
career, he sustains a level of genial, tasteless humor. (Chris
Hewitt, Knight Ridder) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of the Affair'' R (scenes of strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jordan's somber, velvety and often sensual adaptation of
Graham Greene's novel explores love both physical and spiritual.
Considering the difficulty of conveying religious faith in film,
he's surprisingly successful in depicting both kinds of passion.
While the movie doesn't skimp on humid clinches and bared skin, it
also summons up the intangible mysteries of sacrifice and devotion
to a higher power. (SM) 1 hour, 49 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia/2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated. Music from Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   and Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, shop the mall, then go rent the
original. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity and content relating
</P>
<P>
   to drugs, sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent in the '60s at a
mental hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent
of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' As Susanna, Winona Ryder
steadies the movie and gives it its emotional center, but Angelina
Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath. (ERG) At
metro theaters. 2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Vicellous Reon Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington delivers his best performance in years as
pugilist Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender
wrongly imprisoned for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though
ably directed, the film contains some fabrications _ and invents
one key character, a Javert-like detective _ to tell this otherwise
compelling true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' R (profanity and sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joe Mantegna,
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody and Ben Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Warmed-over chicken soup. Barry Levinson's movie about coming of
age in a Jewish neighborhood in 1950s Baltimore is generally
well-acted and sometimes evocative. His anecdotal reminiscences
concerning the Kurtzman brothers don't convey much that's fresh or
surprising. But Joe Mantegna delivers an unexpected dignity and a
nuanced self-knowledge as the boys' numbers-running father. (ERG) 2
hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Robards Jr.,
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families, love and
forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with small
miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
``Magnolia'' is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of movie you
live through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. Among
the stellar acting talents: Tom Cruise, Jason Robards Jr. and
Julianne Moore. (SM) 2 hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' PG-13 (brief violent images,
</P>
<P>
   sexual content, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frances O'Connor,
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lee Miller and Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Rozema's take on Jane Austen's third novel adds dollops
of lesbianism, feminism and social consciousness to Austen's
19th-century tale of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor girl
shipped off to live with her wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park.
Rozema extrapolates bits of Austen's journals into Fanny's own
writing, melding character and author. Rozema didn't seem to trust
her material. (ERG) 1 hour, 52 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Friday'' R (profanity, drug use, sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ice Cube
</P>
<P>
   and Mike Epps.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb comedy. The best that can be said for this sequel to
``Friday'' is that, unlike the first flick, the characters don't
spend most of the movie sitting on the front steps yacking and
getting stoned. They go elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written,
it's a reminder that, while complex, mature and funny
African-American comedies are being made, there's always a market
for flatulence and dog poop jokes. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' R (violence, sexuality, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas,
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson
</P>
<P>
   and Lolita Davidovich.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining take on boxing. Antonio Banderas' Cesar, a
Madrid-born boxer, now lives in Los Angeles and has become best
pals with Woody Harrelson's Vince, a Texas-born fighter. The first
half of the film is a road movie, with Grace (Lolita Davidovich),
Vince's former girlfriend and Cesar's current lady, driving them to
Las Vegas; it soon becomes a love story. (Kevin Thomas, From Los
Angeles Times.) 2 hours, 5 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' PG-13 (profanity, disturbing images,
</P>
<P>
   sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,Youki Kudoh
</P>
<P>
   and Max von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty but chilly. Based on the best seller, Ethan Hawke plays a
newspaperman looking into slaying charges against a
Japanese-American. The case rekindles memories of internment during
World War II and Hawke's youthful romance with the suspect's wife.
Beautifully photographed to mask its thin plot, ``Cedars''
generates little passion and, frankly, is flatline drama. (SM) 2
hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis, Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of Tom Hanks,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A

 &HT;    Scouting out Oglala Sioux's ennobling past, long gone
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of the Noble Savage is as old as the Greeks, a
recurrent longing for a time when man lived in harmony with nature
and misery evaporated like the morning mist over a meadow. In our
own time, the Romantics sought in an imagined past refuge from
social instability and economic uncertainty. Rousseau, patron saint
of Romanticism, believed we are born pure as snowflakes but
corrupted by civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied with the present, we envy the freedom of the Noble
Savage in his loincloth. The term was coined in the 17th century by
John Dryden, who imagined ``guiltless men, that danced away their
time/Fresh as their groves and happy as their climes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Frazier, in his new book ``On the Rez,'' follows in a long,
often illustrious line of writers whose sympathy for the Indian
becomes a kind of personal search. Frazier wants to be an Indian;
he wants, in particular, to be a member of the Oglala Sioux, one of
the Great Plains tribes that joined almost on impulse one day in
the summer of 1876 to defeat Custer in the Battle of Little Big
Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm driving across a field near the town of Oglala on the
Pine Ridge Reservation and I see my friend Floyd John walking
across it the other way,'' Frazier writes, ``I stop, and he comes
over to the car and leans in the window and smiles a big-tooth grin
and says, `How ya' doin', wannabe?'''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't want to pray in a sweat lodge or dance in a sun dance
or go off into the desert in search of a vision. ``The power of
these ceremonies has an appeal,'' Frazier says, ``but I'm content
with what little religion I already have.'' What he wants is even
more spiritual: ``That self-possessed sense of freedom is closer to
what I want; I want to be an uncaught Indian like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier is utterly guileless. Nothing in the pre-Columbian past
could dissuade him, neither tribal warfare nor the winters that a
not-so-benevolent nature brings to the plains. A golden age was
once here, and Indians are the proud custodians of its memory,
pitiable figures now on isolated reservations like Pine Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   One can _ and probably should _ argue with the details, but the
spirit of his book stands on its own. The Indian is the native
American and unassimilated American, the conditions of his life
testimony to the wrongs done him.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Frazier befriended an Oglala Sioux named Le
War Lance, whose peregrinations had taken him from Hollywood to
Manhattan, with many a drink along the way, and back to the
reservation in South Dakota _ the rez. He introduced this bizarre
character in his 1989 book ``Great Plains.'' Now, moving with his
wife and children from Brooklyn to Montana, he hooks up with his
old friend again, and in ensuing months witnesses the tragedy as
well as the durability of life on the reservation. He tells us
poignantly of the pride the Oglala take in their girls' high school
basketball teams and of the solace they take from the white man's
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Both, sooner or later, end in sorrow. Frazier's story of SuAnne
Big Crow, star of the Pine Ridge High Lady Thorpes, is an affecting
paean to a young woman who was a hero among a people who had not
known a hero since Crazy Horse. She was not only a basketball star,
but, from all evidence, an unusually mature young woman whose
vision for her people extended beyond the court to the larger,
non-Indian world. An NBC Nightly News crew dropped by the week the
Pine Ridge team was going to the state tournament. None of that
caught the network's interest. Instead it filmed the familiar
story: the idleness, the bleakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undeniably,'' Frazier concedes, ``many sad facts of the
reservation can be told with bleakness as the text. But the NBC
story irritated people on Pine Ridge no end, especially SuAnne. She
talked to anyone who would listen about all the good on the
reservation that NBC had overlooked, and about the unfairness of
showing only the suffering and apparently hopeless side.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more than playing basketball, she wanted to change
outsiders' perceptions of Indians and instill in Indians the
courage they had lost.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in February 1992, at age 19, SuAnne Big Crow was
killed in an auto wreck, an everyday occurrence in the Black Hills
but a calamity that reverberated long afterward among those who saw
in her example hope and a way out.
</P>
<P>
   For most, there is no way out, and will not be. They live on the
memory of past glory. A picture of the Battle of Little Big Horn
adorns every Indian bar, Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in triumph, a
dying Custer amid the swarm of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors and the
panic of U.S. cavalry horses with empty saddles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a melancholy image. Frazier resists editorial comment and
provides instead the telling anecdote. ``On the reservation and
elsewhere in Indian country,'' he writes, ``you get used to seeing
images of the Budweiser brand. If you notice a speck on the
roadside up ahead and guess that it is an empty Budweiser case,
very often you will be right.''
</P>
<P>
   This country where the buffalo once roamed and the great Sioux
were free _ this is Bud country:
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes say they'd like to buy a whole beer truck
full of Budweiser and drink it dry. On the Standing Rock Sioux
Reservation in northern South Dakota, a man from the town of
Bullhead did. Some years ago the man received an oil settlement of
$30,000 and spent $25,000 of it on a Budweiser delivery truck
stocked with 300 cases of beer. He parked the truck beside his
house, which it was longer than, and had a nonstop party until all
300 cases were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   When the last bottle was upturned, the last drop of hope was
drained away with it. But there would be a long sleep, and
somewhere down the road more would turn up _ not a truck full but
enough for a night. They would be enough to get by, and to dreamily
imagine, perhaps, what it must have been like in the picture on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But this, too, is part of the tragedy of the rez. Past, present
and future have no connection with each other. SuAnne Big Crow, who
understood something of all three, is gone just like Crazy Horse,
and all that remains is the illusion of a freedom that never was.

 &HT;    Next best thing to barefoot: cool your heels in a bright pair of
feminine, sexy slides

<P>
   If you're bound for a resort vacation, pack along a pair of
barely there sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Considered one of the oldest types of footwear, sandals were
first made from woven palm leaves and grasses or treated hide.
</P>
<P>
   Today the term refers to any shoe that leaves a large part of
the foot bare. Slides and mules _ most fashion pros use the terms
interchangeably _ fit comfortably into this category. Both styles
bare the heels and come in various guises, including open-toed,
strapped and thong styles.
</P>
<P>
   Thongs are sandals held to the foot with narrow strips of
leather or fabric running between the first and second toes and
attached at either side. Mules generally cover the toes. And slides
are so named because they slide right on.
</P>
<P>
   Slides have been popular for the past several seasons, but never
before have they looked as feminine as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pretty and colorful with all types of trims,'' says
Sheila Kamensky, fashion director of Rich's stores, ``including
flowers and bows as well as colorful beads and rhinestones.''
</P>
<P>
   Most slides and mules are pancake flat, with a few rising on
half-inch-to-1-inch wedge, straight or curvy heels.
</P>
<P>
   Handbag designer Kate Spade recently debuted her line of shoes,
in which thongs and slides rule. ``I wanted simple, versatile,
nonserious shoes to take on a beach vacation,'' says Spade.
</P>
<P>
   Her styles include double-duty silk, canvas, leather and satin
sandals that can easily be worn with a T-shirt and a pair of capri
pants during the day or a silky slip dress at night.
</P>
<P>
   Other slides are made of spring's most popular fabric: denim.
Instead of wearing these with your jeans, you might want to wear
them with khaki trousers or a simple white dress.

`TWILIGHT ZONE' PUTS SPIN ON `FELICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An autographed photo of Rod Serling hangs in the office of J.J.
Abrams, co-creator and executive producer of ``Felicity.'' Judging
from Sunday's un-``Felicity''-like episode, he probably has a
glossy of Franz Kafka in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams thinks ``The Twilight Zone'' was and is the best thing
television ever introduced to the masses. In Sunday's special
presentation, a Kafka-esque anxiety-and-alienation fantasy titled
``Help for the Lovelorn,'' he pays homage to Serling's legacy with
a mesmerizing black-and-white tribute that accurately captures the
spooky spirit of the ``Zone'' while poking affectionate fun at his
own creation.
</P>
<P>
   Any ``Felicity'' fan knows that Felicity Porter, college
sophomore, is a card-carrying romantic whose heart is so out there
she needs fishing tackle just to get it back on her sleeve. Any
follower of ``The Twilight Zone'' knows the scariest thing in the
anthology series was always a product of the protagonist's own
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams and his partner, Matt Reeves, combine elements of the two
shows not only create a collectible stand-alone episode, but
something ``Felicity'' followers will love because it advances the
story in a way that probably couldn't be done conventionally.
Specifically, it gives us a peek inside the box that Felicity's
roommate, Meghan Rotundi (Amanda Foreman), guards ever so
jealously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help for the Lovelorn'' centers on Felicity's desire to get
past her failed relationships with Noel (Scott Foley) and Ben
(Scott Speedman). At the invitation of a mysterious woman, she
visits ``the clinic'' to undergo ``the procedure,'' guaranteed to
mend a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   But is the cure worse than the ailment? ``Zone'' fans know the
answer _ and that the real fun is in discovering the surprise at
the end. With help from director Lamont Johnson, a veteran of many
``Twilight Zones,'' Abrams and Reeves set the hook beautifully.
Most appealing is Johnson's use of shadowy close-ups that run
counter to the soft, long-lens style of ``Felicity,'' allowing
viewers to see characters in a different light. You might call it a
metamorphosis. No doubt Kafka would.
</P>
<P>
   Help for the Lovelorn. Special episode of ``Felicity'' evoking
memories of ``The Twilight Zone.'' Sunday on The WB. Parental
guideline rating: TV-PG.

 &HT;    Arrogance in Dixie leads to one of biggest protests in decades
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We had Alabama city buses in the '50s, North
Carolina diner stools in the '60s, yellow school buses in Boston in
the '70s. And, in the 2000s ...
</P>
<P>
   Cots in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After decades in search for a new symbol, people who know racism
to be a living American presence found one in Columbia, S.C.: cots,
sleeping implements of cloth and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a state boycott, protesters from out of state slept
on cots in church basements and on living room floors, any place to
avoid pumping a dollar into a state government that continues to
insult black people with an offensive symbol.
</P>
<P>
   An appealing twist. Once upon a time merchants of separatism
wouldn't have allowed any of the black protesters in South Carolina
to have stayed in their inns. The snub is on the other foot.
</P>
<P>
   All of this over the Confederate battle flag flying over the
South Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's protest drew 46,000 people, the largest march in
Columbia's history. It must have been a glorious day. And for a
glorious cause.
</P>
<P>
   A state government that rubs into the face of a large sector of
its population a symbol that offends so many so deeply _
generations deep _ deserves recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One can accept the fact that to many Southerners, the
Confederate battle flag is no symbol of racism or slavery but of a
proud heritage, and yet one can still not accept the flag being
flown over a state capitol. The flag has only flown there since
1962, and then only as an observance of a Civil War centennial. Of
course, we know what was happening in the '60s, what threats were
then perceived to the Jim Crow way of life. Had a new battle been
joined? And is it still waged?
</P>
<P>
   If so, observers should worry about whose side some of our
presidential candidates are on.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain, for whom South Carolina's primary is
considered one of a couple of do-or-die tests, said he considers
the flag personally offensive, but avoided controversy by following
up that it's a ``symbol of heritage'' and of soldiers who ``fought
honorably.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think either statement is arguable. Neither, though, is
it arguable that to black Americans the flag is a symbol of
oppression. That should be enough to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Steve Forbes have painstakingly avoided the
issue, leaving the Party of Lincoln on the wrong side of history on
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American flag heals us, and the Confederate flag divides
us,'' said Vice President Al Gore. Well put.
</P>
<P>
   The best statement came from Bill Bradley, who said the flag
``offends our common humanity, and it is not the future of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   So true. What does the future hold? Diversity, the American
essence.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's recent forecast of a population that doubles
in the next 100 years pointed out what's been known all along _
that whites will become outnumbered by combined minority groups
while retaining majority status.
</P>
<P>
   One imagines what the future holds for a major political party
whose politics preclude its standard-bearers from acknowledging and
addressing the hurt of a whole race of people. Throw in such
gambits as ``official language'' and immigrant-bashing ballot
measures, and one wonders when the weight of numbers will make this
type of politics a fatal flaw on the national scene. (Bush, to his
credit, refuses to play the immigrant-bashing game.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in national politics, it is heartening to see
46,000 people protesting an atrocious practice in South Carolina.
Some will say it's a little thing, that flag, that people should
concern themselves with big issues. Diner stools were small things,
too.

&HT;     THE LAW IS NO PATSY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During my years in law school, my favorite story
was the tale of a defendant who had killed his parents. When he
came to trial, he threw himself on the mercy of the court because
he was an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   That silly story was, I assumed, apocryphal, meant merely to
amuse credulous students.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays I'm not so sure. Maybe it really happened.
</P>
<P>
   In our litigious society, creative legal defenses are becoming
standard operating procedure, regularly raised to fend off
punishment for all sorts of alleged crimes. Such inventive
exercises don't seem to impress juries very much, but desperate
folks are bound to try desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of fanciful excuses first came to public attention
in 1978, when a San Francisco man who admitted killing Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk claimed he was overexcited
because he had been eating too many sugary foods, including Hostess
Twinkies. The so-called Twinkie Defense didn't catch on, except
with stand-up comics; he was found guilty anyway, although on a
reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-aged Florida boy recently pleaded not guilty to
threatening a student present at the shooting rampage at Colorado's
Columbine High School last April. The Florida boy admitted sending
the ominous e-mail message through an on-line chat room but blamed
it on ``an addiction'' to the Internet, saying he was so used to
the make-believe world of virtual reality he didn't understand the
impact of what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   This is reminiscent of a similar defense offered 20 years ago by
a teen-ager charged with murdering an elderly woman. He claimed to
be driven by ``television intoxication'' and couldn't tell the
difference between violence on the screen and the real thing. But
the jury didn't buy it and he was convicted anyway. Not
surprisingly, the ``intoxicated'' kid had the same lawyer the
``addicted'' kid does.
</P>
<P>
   Another howler is the case of an Arizona man who killed his wife
by stabbing her 44 times with a hunting knife and dragging her to
their swimming pool to hold her head under water to be sure she
wasn't breathing. A neighbor watched over a wall as he pulled on
gloves and motioned to his dog to lie down before he hauled the
body to the pool. Then he put on a fresh set of clothing and hid
the bloody ones he wore during the murder.
</P>
<P>
   His defense? He claimed to be sleep-walking and couldn't
remember a thing. The jury called that baloney and the judge gave
him life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual case is that of a 19-year-old Virginia woman who
placed her infant son in a microwave oven, programmed it to start
and cooked him to death. She contends she was in the middle of an
epileptic seizure and didn't realize her son was not a pot roast.
Her trial on a charge of murder is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In a much different context, a judge in Fairfax, Va., cut in
half a $350,000 jury award to Karen Santorum, the wife of Sen. Rick
Santorum, in a malpractice suit against a chiropractor whose
treatment she claimed worsened her lower back pain. In this case,
she was the plaintiff, not the defendant, and it was her chief
witness that provided the creativity.
</P>
<P>
   You might call it the Political Spouse Indispensability
Argument.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, a Republican from Pennsylvania, testified that a
big financial award was justified since the injury hurt his
prospects for re-election this year, forcing him to campaign alone
because his wife was in too much pain to help. The senator's whine
was a compliment to his wife's political usefulness but raised
doubts about his own independence. Senators are supposed to be able
to legislate, campaign and think for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The jury sympathized, but the judge was not similarly smitten
with Santorum's re-election problems. Perhaps the judge had heard
the senator is leading a congressional effort to limit the size of
malpractice awards for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. The law, as Charles Dickens' Mr. Bumble said in
``Oliver Twist,'' ``is a ass _ a idiot.'' But it's not as big a
patsy as some folks think.

SHORT ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD

<P>
   The Philadelphia Museum of Art has just received the largest
cash gift in its 115-year history. Raymond Perelman, a trustee
since 1975 and chairman of the museum's board, and his wife, Ruth,
have donated $15 million to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go toward the acquisition and renovation of the
Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co. building, a 1926 Art Deco
structure on a two-acre site across the street from the museum,
which it bought for $17 million in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Perelmans are the parents of Ronald O. Perelman, the
chairman of Revlon and a former president of the board of the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Harrity, the Philadelphia museum's chief operating officer,
called the gift unprecedented. ``We have enjoyed large gifts of art
over the years,'' she said. ``But not cash.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the new building, which will add 100,000
square feet of space, the museum's ``potential is mind-boggling,''
Raymond Perelman said. The city is contributing $2 million of the
building's purchase price. The museum is still doing feasibility
studies to determine the cost of renovations and the direction the
design will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is no longer an industrial city but a cultural
city, and the museum is its crown jewel,'' Perelman, 82, an
entrepreneur and lifelong Philadelphian said. He and his wife
collect modern art and own works by Picasso, Dubuffet and Miro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collecting is a relative term,'' Perelman said. ``I guess if
you put all our family's art together, then it would be a
collection. We don't buy as much as we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is channeling his energies into the museum. ``With
the expansion of the museum and the new performing arts center that
is being built here,'' he said, ``Philadelphia is getting on the
map culturally.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   London Inspiration
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery in London has asked 24 contemporary artists
from Britain, Europe and North America to choose works from its
permanent collection as inspiration for works of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encounters: New Art from Old,'' to run from June 14 to Sept.
17, is the first show of its kind at the National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be the largest, occupying all the temporary
exhibitions space in the Sainsbury Wing in addition to several
other adjoining galleries. The show is being organized by Richard
Morphet, a recently retired curator of modern art at the Tate
Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into a new century, we really wanted to make it
clear that the National Gallery's collection is a source of live
interest now and in the future,'' Morphet said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artists participating are painters, sculptors,
photographers and video artists, including many of today's
best-known names: Balthus, Louise Bourgeois, Anthony Caro,
Francesco Clemente, Karen Finley, Lucian Freud, Jasper Johns,
Anselm Kiefer, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, Cy Twombly
and Bill Viola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balthus is the oldest; he was born in 1908,'' Morphet said.
``Clemente is the youngest; he was born in 1952. So the show will
represent three generations of artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The works chosen are often unexpected: Johns, for instance, has
selected Manet's ``Execution of Maximillian'' (circa 1867-68).
</P>
<P>
   Balthus is getting ideas from Poussin's ``Sleeping Nymph
Surprised by Satyrs'' (1626-27), and Oldenburg and Ms. Bruggen have
selected Vermeer's ``Young Woman Standing at a Virginal'' (circa
1670). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Competes
</P>
<P>
   Trustees at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles have
acquired 120 works in the last year in an attempt to strengthen the
museum's permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is in large part a competitive one. The Los Angeles
museum is trying to keep up with the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, which in the last two years has acquired art worth more than
$125 million. (Officials at the Los Angeles museum won't say how
much the total of their acquisitions are worth.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's been a lot of activity in San Francisco
recently, and our trustees have taken note of it,'' said Paul
Schimmel, chief curator in Los Angeles. ``The acquisitions fall
into two separate groups. One is part of our ongoing acquisitions,
and the other is 17 works given in honor of our new director,
Jeremy Strick.''
</P>
<P>
   Strick began his job in July, replacing Richard Koshalek, who
became president of the Arts Center of Design in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works given to the Los Angeles museum in honor of
Strick's arrival are ``Steel-Zinc Dipole'' (1989) by Carl Andre; an
untitled 1983 drawing by Jasper Johns; a 1964 work on paper,
``Brass Tube (Galvanized Iron Tubes, Painted H-D Blue),'' by Donald
Judd, and ``Sea Painting II,'' by Brice Marden, from 1973-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marden is a classic early work,'' Schimmel said. ``The
Andre is a floor piece, and we only have small pieces by him. And
the Judd is an important work on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is also buying works recently featured in exhibitions
at the museum, including an untitled installation work by Robert
Gober that was commissioned for the museum in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Works by some controversial younger artists have also entered
the collection, among them a painting by Chris Ofili, the British
artist whose ``Holy Virgin Mary'' in the ``Sensation'' show at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art prompted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to try to
cut city support to the museum. A painting the Los Angeles museum
has just bought, ``Monkey Magic: Sex, Money and Drugs'' (1999),
depicts a monkey holding an urn from which three wads of elephant
dung, labeled ``sex,'' ``money'' and ``drugs,'' float upward on the
canvas. The work also incorporates acrylic paint, colorful glitter,
resin, pencil and map pins.

TWICE THE FUN FROM MURPHY

<TEXT>
<P>
   `BOWFINGER'
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy is spoiling us. Here, as in ``The Nutty
Professor,'' he multiplies the mirth by playing extra roles.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he's both an action-film superstar and a geeky
gofer hired by a bottom-feeder producer (Steve Martin) to
impersonate the star in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shaky shoot. Filming from a distance _ and without
permits _ Martin stages scenes with low-rent actors accosting the
unsuspecting superstar on the street or in restaurants. He then
stitches these into his alien-invasion premise.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a modern-day ``Ed Wood?'' It should. Martin's motley
troupe of nobodies has a sad-sack soulfulness, and his
``creativity'' is similarly twisted, grasping and pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has the dogged enthusiasm that Johnny Depp brought
to Wood, giving ``Bowfinger'' a jaunty can-do spirit to go with its
wackiness.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is funny as the underling who's embarrassed by nude
scenes and frightened by action stunts. His superstar character is
more of a Hollywood in-joke, with stabs at Tinseltown's fads, greed
and pretentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bowfinger'' has ample affection for movie-biz underdogs,
exalting the scrappy idealism of an indie with a dream.
</P>

`AN IDEAL HUSBAND' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ideal movie is more like it, if you enjoy Oscar Wilde's
drawing-room comedies _ not to mention performances by Rupert
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Here he plays an aristocratic playboy in London's high society
of the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   Wild complications arise when his former lover (Julianne Moore)
returns from the Continent to blackmail Sir Robert (Jeremy
Northam), a rising star in Parliament, for a long-buried youthful
indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   His secret is all that keeps Sir Robert from embodying the
perfection seen in him by his loving and loyal wife (Cate
Blanchett). Torn between living up to her high standards and doing
the honest thing, he turns to Lord Goring (Everett) for help.
</P>
<P>
   Society's rigid strictures of honor and decorum toss their lives
into turmoil, with intelligently comical, sophisticated and
sometimes soulful results.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is impeccable; if this had been released at year's end,
it would be getting Oscar buzz now.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is amusing but not as casually self-serving as he seems
with such lines as, ``To love oneself is to begin a lifelong
romance.''
</P>
<P>
   His co-stars have an almost fierce conviction, and the
Northam-Blanchett romance is truly touching.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds up your alley, prepare for an ideal rental.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 stars.

NO `PHANTOM' DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DVD is booming, but George Lucas refuses to issue ``Star Wars:
Episode I'' _ The Phantom Menace on disc when it reaches tape April
4.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the film may not hit DVD until he completes the prequel
trilogy in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale says her boss wants to do
something ``special '' for ``Phantom Menace'' on DVD, but lacks the
time due to ongoing work on the trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: That's no reason to delay release of ``Phantom
Menace'' on DVD with no bells and whistles. Just the movie would do
nicely, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if DVD extras (trailers, documentaries) are required
by law or can't appear on a reissue. ``Titanic'' emerged on a
movie-only disc last year and eventually will return with added
features.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Phantom Menace'' could do the same. For now, the extras
can wait, but why should the movie?
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' refusal is also painfully ironic. This is the same man
who made strict demands of exhibitors about picture and sound
quality before sending ``Phantom Menace'' to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   If he's so concerned about fans, and so determined they see and
hear his film properly, why doesn't he extend that concern to home
video, where DVD is superior to VHS?
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the delay on preparing extras is no excuse. The movie is
ripe and ready for DVD now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CELEBRATE WITH CNN &QL;

<P>
   It's misnamed (the new millenium begins Jan. 1, 2001), but CNN

$14.95.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Under a microscope in a small town
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I was in the front yard, wondering what I was
going to do about a limb that was scraping the roof of the house.
An old friend stopped by in his new pickup truck. We stood and
talked awhile.
</P>
<P>
   He said the truck actually wasn't all that new. He'd had it six
months or so. I guess I hadn't been paying good attention.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that we live just around the block from one another.
Never mind that we have been best of friends since junior high. But
we don't get together as much as we ought to.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he stays busy working hard, always has, even back
when we were teenagers. He was one of the few of us who could pay
his way through college without depending on his parents.
</P>
<P>
   He worked hard in college, too, and as a result he can put
``Dr.'' in front of his name. Over the years he has built up a
solid reputation and a good practice, well respected and widely
admired in his profession and in the community. He even served on
the school board for a couple of terms.
</P>
<P>
   What with 60 creeping up on us, he has been wanting to find
somebody to share his practice, with the idea of eventually taking
it over. One fellow made a stab at it, but it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, not everybody can fit into small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we usually say when one person or another lives here
awhile and then decides to move on. We'll say, ``Well, I guess they
couldn't fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think we ever say, ``Well, I guess we didn't fit them.''
</P>
<P>
   I had a good friend who moved here from the city. But he found
it uncomfortable, even a bit unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   He told me this story as an example, about eating breakfast one
morning in a local cafe by himself, not particularly paying
attention to anybody else who was there.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day a fellow he knew only slightly came up to him
on the street, big grin on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you like those eggs this morning?'' he asked him.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was dismayed. ``Good grief,'' he told me. ``If they
know what I had for breakfast, what else do they know about me?''
</P>
<P>
   A mutual acquaintance of ours, who had also made the move from
big city to small town, tried to reassure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll get used to it after a while, everybody knowing the
most intimate details about your life,'' she said. ``Of course, by
then something deep inside of you will have died.''
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin is a good place. I recommend it. Anybody like me, who was
born here and has never lived anywhere else, will tell you the
same.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. My doctor friend also took note of the limb on the roof. He
said I ought to do something about it as soon as possible. I guess
I'd better. I know he'll be checking on it every time he passes by.
He never did think I worked hard enough.

THOUSANDS MOURN SLAIN SERB WHO WAS ACCUSED OF WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Several thousand people came Thursday to
bury Zeljko Raznatovic, the indicted war-crimes suspect known as
Arkan, but also to praise him.
</P>
<P>
   After a small funeral service for family and close friends in
the chapel of Belgrade's main cemetery, the thousands of mourners,
some of them weeping, followed Raznatovic's son Mihajlo, who
carried a cross, while uniformed members of Raznatovic's Serbian
Volunteer Guard, the Tigers, carried the coffin to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing camouflage and red berets, they fired a salute with
their rifles as an old Serbian hymn played. Raznatovic, born in
Slovenia to an army father, was portrayed as a Serbian hero,
fighting to extend and consolidate Serbdom and Serbian land, and he
himself enjoyed wearing a uniform of the First World War.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic, 47, was murdered Saturday, along with two other men,
a businessman and a police official, in the Interncontinental Hotel
here. As newspapers competed for unverifiable details about the
assassins and their motives, some officials of the governing party
began to describe Raznatovic as a patriot and a hero, despite his
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   As the coffin was lowered into the grave, Borislav Pelevic, a
``general'' in the Guard, said, ``Commander, I hereby submit the
last report: the status of the Serb Volunteer Guard is normal, the
status of the party is regular.'' Raznatovic also led a small
political party, the Party of Serbian Unity.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mention Thursday of Raznatovic's indictment in
1997 by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague _ an
indictment announced only last March, during NATO's bombing war
against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic and his Tigers played an important role on the
Serbian side in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in 1991 and 1992-95.
He also was a pioneer of ethnic purging, and his indictment _ still
sealed _ is reported to include the murder of 250 Croats taken from
a hospital in 1991.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goran Hadzic, the leader of the autonomous Serb republic in
Croatia, which was overrun by the Croat army in 1995, praised
Raznatovic on Thursday as a friend, adviser and soldier. ``We were
friends,'' he said. ``But he was a big hero.'' Raznatovic, with
Belgrade's approval, ran guns to the Croatian Serbs before war
broke out there in 1991, and he helped fight in eastern Slavonia,
another region of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Dacic, the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, attended Raznatovic's
wedding to the popular folk singer Svetlana, known as Ceca, in
1995, but did not come to the funeral. But in a statement, he said,
``Regardless of his contradictory biography, Arkan was no doubt a
patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling were kind words from the Radical Party leader,
Vojislav Seselj, who had roaring battles with Raznatovic in
television debates. Once, on state television, Seselj said: ``I bet
you've put a black sock on your face more often than on your
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Seselj said in a statement: ``One thing is for
sure _ Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan was a true Serb patriot and all the
political misunderstandings and conflicts we had should be
forgotten now.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians, especially from Vuk Draskovic's Serbian
Renewal Movement, have charged that the Milosevic government
probably ordered Raznatovic's death because he was becoming too
powerful and disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have asked the police to look into charges that
Studio B, the television station controlled by the Serbian Renewal
Movement in Belgrade, is spreading false information. Draskovic has
already accused the government of trying to kill him in a truck
accident last October, and Studio B's signal is being jammed
regularly in parts of the country, while a major transmitter was
stolen this week, cutting off 2 million viewers in central Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers, meanwhile, are reporting that at least two
suspects in the Saturday shooting are in custody while the identity
of a third may be known to the police, who have said little
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The reports say that a man apparently wounded in the attack,
Dusan Gavric, has regained consciousness in a hospital in Loznica
near the Bosnian border, where he had fled.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Glas said information provided by Gavric led to
the arrest of a second person as he tried to leave the country for
Hungary, where Serbs do not need visas. In Novi Sad, near the
Hungarian border, a local newspaper, Dnevnik, said a man named
Goran Jevtovic had been arrested in the Arkan slaying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the official daily Politika, which has been used as
the main instrument of police leaks to show that the investigation
is progressing, said that the police had established the identity
of a third man, described as the ``man suspected of killing
Raznatovic and his two associates.'' But he is apparently still at
large, though inside Serbia, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, the newspaper Blic reported that Gavric, the
wounded man, has attended the police academy in Sremska Mitrovica
and graduated in 1995, though the paper was unable to confirm if
Gavric is still on the force. Glas Javnosti said that Gavric is
still a member of the special police and had taken part in police
operations in Kosovo.

SHORT ITEMS ON THE THEATER WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My Kingdom for a House!
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With well over four months till the Tony deadline,
the spring season on Broadway is already almost completely set,
with every Broadway house either currently lighted or awaiting a
show.
</P>
<P>
   That theater crunch was given special emphasis this week when
the producer Cameron Mackintosh, an 800-pound gorilla if there ever
was one, said even he couldn't get a house for his musical ``Martin
Guerre,'' though Broadway wags suspected that decision may have had
more to do with mediocre reviews than lack of clout.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Lyceum, one of Broadway's least-used theaters, appears
to have a tenant, the coming Lincoln Center Theater production of
``Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a few shows with weak box-office numbers,
namely the plays ``The Price'' and ``Wrong Mountain,'' and to a
lesser extent, ``Amadeus.'' But the theaters in which those plays
are running are already on the short list of other productions,
like ``Copenhagen,'' that have set spring openings.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there may still be a few surprises. Preparation for
David Mamet's ``Boston Marriage'' is moving ahead, with names of
stars (Sharon Stone) and directors (Howard Davies) being dropped
with fair regularity. A closing of any sort might also cause a mad
shuffle of shows to different theaters, each angling for more
attractive houses.
</P>
<P>
   Two other plays, ``Birdy'' and ``Trudy Blue,'' have also stated
a desire to come to Broadway, though their prospects are uncertain.
And the musical ``Jane Eyre,'' a hit last summer in San Diego, may
still find its way here, though next season might be an easier sell
in a year packed with new musicals.
</P>
<P>
   While the set schedule is a boon for amateur prognosticators _
let the Tony guessing begin! _ it leaves little room for that old
romantic notion of a little show with great reviews making a big
leap to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenarios are being posited by some Internet gossips for
the early Stephen Sondheim musical ``Saturday Night,'' getting its
New York premiere next month at Second Stage.
</P>
<P>
   This talk, of course, comes sight unseen. The first preview of
``Saturday Night'' is Friday night. The show, delayed a day for
technical demands, is the first at Second Stage to use a fly
system. Still, even if the reviews are dandy, where might it go? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doing Fine, Thank You
</P>
<P>
   When she was stricken by a stroke in March, just before the
opening of ``Ring Round the Moon,'' Irene Worth promised that she
would be back before the end of that play's Broadway engagement.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't. But now comes word that Ms. Worth is, thankfully,
returning to the New York stage. Beginning on Feb. 6, the
three-time Tony winner will be seen as the grandmother in
``Ancestral Voices,'' A.R. Gurney's drama about a dissolving
marriage. Performances are Sunday and Monday evenings at Lincoln
Center's Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful grandmother, written as a real human being
not just some old trout who wears glasses,'' she said. ``It's nice
for women to be real and not just elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Worth said she was feeling quite well, thank you, but would
rather not have her age printed on advice from her old friend Sir
John Gielgud. ``He says they'll never give you parts if they
know,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Nightcap, of Sorts
</P>
<P>
   You can call David Hirson a lot of things _ and the critics have
_ but you can't say he's chicken. It was just last week that
Hirson's second play, ``Wrong Mountain,'' received the type of
critical drubbing that would send many writers into permanent
hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   Not Hirson. In fact, the boyish 41-year-old playwright has
decided that he will appear every night after the show for informal
discussions with the audience. The idea, he said, came after he was
besieged by questions about his admittedly heady play after a
recent performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might just be healthy to make myself available to
the audience,'' he said. ``I don't always believe the author is the
best person to analyze the play, but he may be able to help.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, in turn, audiences can help him. Without positive
reviews, the producers of ``Wrong Mountain,'' the only new play on
Broadway, are depending on word of mouth, any word of mouth, to get
people to buy tickets. Its gross sales were the lowest of any on
Broadway last week.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple of nonprofit theaters, the postshow discussion is
a rare bird on Broadway. But then again, so are new plays. ``I'll
do it every night,'' said an upbeat Hirson. ``And if it's a night
when only five people stay, we'll all go out for a drink
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the Rounds
</P>
<P>
   The last time New Yorkers heard from Eddie Izzard, the eccentric
British comic was going on about all sorts of topics, including the
moon landing (``It's all sticky''), the naming of Engelbert
Humperdinck and, of course, the French.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, it's circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea, basically,'' he said, winding up, ``is to get at,
loosely, the idea of huge space stuff, that space is curved and the
planets' orbits are curved. The Native American religion is also
all about circles. I will nip that in at one point. And, oh yes,
the Renaissance period.''
</P>
<P>
   This list should come as no surprise to anybody who has
experienced Izzard's ream-of-consciousness style. Audiences will
have a brief window to check it out themselves, April 4-8, when
Izzard arrives with a new show, ``Circles,'' at Westbeth Theater
Center, where his last show, ``Dress to Kill,'' was a hit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong stint is part of a two-month tour that will include
a trip to Australia, as well as American stops in Philadelphia,
Boston, Los Angeles and a city he called that ``little bit up
there,'' known to many as Seattle. Then, Izzard said, he will
return to New York in June for a longer run in a larger theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe comedy should be road tested,'' he said. ``Rock
bands make shows and tour them. I think I tour the whole show to
write it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Like Flynn
</P>
<P>
   Clarke Peters, last seen on Broadway in ``The Iceman Cometh,''
will take over for Robert Urich in ``Chicago'' on Tuesday. A
spokesman for the show said Urich had opted out of his contract,
but might return in the summer.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANGELA'S ASHES,' starring Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, Joe
Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge. Directed by Alan Parker (R,
120 minutes). Anyone who thinks poverty is not pretty would have to
think twice after seeing this artfully desolate-looking film
version of Frank McCourt's boyhood memoir. The movie describes dire
suffering alongside inspiring, uplifting episodes. Directed
reverently by Parker, it parades forth a series of familiar
anecdotes from McCourt's book without taking on much weight. This
is the kind of film about hardship in which nobody has indoor
plumbing, but everybody has clean hair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways against the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen
(Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BICENTENNIAL MAN,' starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam
Neill and Oliver Platt. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG, 132
minutes). This gushy Robin Williams star vehicle follows the
200-year quest of a household robot named Andrew to become human.
Directed by the schmaltzmeister Chris Columbus, who steered this
star through ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' the movie is a joke-strewn,
sentimental man-machine allegory determined to make us feel good
about being human. Corny speeches exalting freedom, the joys of sex
and the mystery of mortality punctuate the tale. Except for
Williams, the acting is strictly of sitcom caliber (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms.
Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `CRADLE WILL ROCK,' starring Emily Watson, John Turturro, Ruben
Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Susan Sarandon, Bill Murray and
Vanessa Redgrave. Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132
minutes). This huge Depression-era story features well-known
figures from Orson Welles to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera,
and it works them into an ambitious ``Ragtime''-like tableau.
Though too many figures in this landscape are reduced to naive
caricature, Robbins and his impressive cast bring strong passions
to bear upon this (mostly) true story of a legendary event: the
trouble-fraught production, by Welles and John Houseman, of Marc
Blitzstein's banner-waving 1936 agitprop musical ``The Cradle Will
Rock.'' Robbins and his cast play out all sides of this event with
the certitude that its importance lives on (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE END OF THE AFFAIR,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore,
Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes).
Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into it with a dreamy,
erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's underlying
ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting is London
in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the inspired costume
designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'') (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Levine,
Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and
Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The new
millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of
animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps
one from the original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science-fiction
title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown,
``Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two
best segments are ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty
Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld
set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's
``Firebird Suite'') in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the
globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's
life forms. Movie star introductions lend the film the feel of a
deluxe corporate promotion (Holden). &QL;

   `GALAXY QUEST,' starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan
Rickman. Directed by Dean Parisot (PG, 102 minutes). Whether you
love ``Star Trek'' or laugh at it, your starship has come in,
docking in the form of this amiable comedy that simultaneously
manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and
replicate the very elements that have made them so durable. The
film spins out of a single joke, about a bunch of washed-up actors
from a canceled television series who are enlisted by some
credulous interplanetary simpletons to champion them in a conflict
with a scaly, bellicose villain who has all but exterminated their
people. And soon they are off on a genuine space adventure. If
``Galaxy Quest'' never attains consistently giddy heights as it
plays out its combination of knowing satire and heroic adventure,
it keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek, offers a few genuine
laughs, moves swiftly if not at warp speed, and is led by a
talented cast (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a precollege-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder
has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the
small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a
charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's
best friend (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock.
Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble
acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man
(Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the
film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Hanks, as
a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's
redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HOLY SMOKE,' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed
by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously
through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ``Hideous Kinky,''
Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong
young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother
coaxes her home, where a ``cult exiter'' named P.J. (Keitel) is
waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film
moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more
serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't
help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Keitel's
P.J. looking overmatched (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Rubin (Hurricane)
Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in
prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy
ballad of a movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep
portrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast
and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members
of a Canadian commune who took up Carter's cause and all but
eliminating his heroic codefendant John Artis from the story. And
the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story
of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is
still inspiring (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER,' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher
Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mann directs
this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates
why, in the corporate climate of the '90s, truth-telling is a
riskier business than it was circa ``All the President's Men.''
While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for
``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAN ON THE MOON,' starring Jim Carrey, Courtney Love, Danny
DeVito and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Milos Forman (R, 118
minutes). Andy Kaufman: genius or creep? This biography takes the
more positive view and minimizes the kinkier aspects of Kaufman's
misanthropic performance art, preferring a big, vibrant collection
of greatest hits. Carrey channels his character brilliantly and
makes his material funnier and tighter than it was in fact. And
Forman directs with the same enthusiasm for outlaw Americana that
he brought to ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' But the writers, who
also wrote that film and ``Ed Wood,'' can't easily find an
unself-conscious side of the late comic artist to work with. This
feels like the authorized version. It has no real answer to the
question of who Kaufman was and how he got that way (Maslin).

<P>
   `SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS,' starring Ethan Hawke, James Cromwell
and Max Von Sydow. Directed by Scott Hicks (PG-13, 130 minutes).
This director's follow-up to ``Shine'' is the cinematic equivalent
of an arty coffee-table book. It is so busy illustrating the story
(with elaborate flashbacks and montage sequences) that it forgets
to be dramatic. Set in the Pacific Northwest in 1950, the movie
looks back to World War II and the charged relationships between
Japanese-Americans and whites on an island north of Puget Sound.
Hawke is the brooding reporter covering the trial and Von Sydow the
defense lawyer who is the film's official conscience. Robert
Richardson is responsible for the gorgeous cinematography
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `STUART LITTLE,' starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan
Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E.B. White's
1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film
about a little mouse (with the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is
adopted by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian cat,
Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook
version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy-boat
race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Lane's sly, wise-guy
vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny
and sweet but never cloying (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SWEET AND LOWDOWN,' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma
Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage to
the kind of jaunty 1930s jazz that has been heard on many of his
other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a consummate jazz
character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn), who can play the
guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain
interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing
attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into
another one of Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a long-suffering
mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works miracles in her
wordless role.) But on the storytelling level, the film remains
flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly
presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written
and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this
glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ``The English
Patient'' was no fluke, Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually
charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian
murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Damon as the
dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the
English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic
magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness
of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the
delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As
the story's odious playboy-snob, Hoffman is scene-stealingly
wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TITUS,' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange and Alan
Cumming, Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie
Taymor (R, 160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and
puppeteer who created transfixing stage pictures in ``The Lion
King'' and ``Juan Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest
tragedy, ``Titus Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of
murderous revenge enacted throughout history. Hopkins is ghoulishly
funny and tragic as the title character, whose political stupidity
sets in motion a devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and
retaliation. Ms. Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who
strikes back. Although the movie's British theatrical and American
film acting styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with
a shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient
Rome with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TOY STORY 2,' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G, 98
minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's
wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to
computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that
Hollywood can still make movies to please audiences of any age or
persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars''
parody) to its Capra-esque conclusion, this is a seamless work with
more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy
bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance
the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy
dealer, experiences newfound celebrity and needs to be rescued by
his fabulous old friends (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   FILM SERIES:
</P>
<P>
   `THE AMERICAN PLACE: LANDSCAPE IN THE EARLY WESTERN (AND A FEW
LATER CLASSICS).' An opportunity for a new look at the Old West is
at hand at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where a monthlong
series highlighted by early westerns began Friday. Spanning the
history of the genre, the series features more than 50 films in 30
programs, including works that extend from Edwin Porter, D.W.
Griffith, Thomas H. Ince, John Ford, Charles Chaplin and Allan Dwan
to Victor Fleming, Victor Seastrom, Sam Peckinpah, Mel Brooks,
Clint Eastwood and Jim Jarmusch. One half of a choice double bill
this weekend consists of ``The Great Train Robbery'' (1903),
Porter's 11-minute seminal work about a deadly holdup, with the
woods of New Jersey substituting for the wild West. The other half
is ``The Wild Bunch'' (1969), Peckinpah's violent chronicle of the
adventures of a band of outlaws who have outlived their time. The
films will be shown at 2 p.m. on Sunday. Continuing through Feb.
24, at the Museum of Modern Art, the series is free with museum
admission: $10 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or
older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what
you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Information and

 &HT;    McCourt's memoir survives on-screen
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Frank McCourt's autobiographical
``Angela's Ashes'' is a remarkable book, rich in colorful,
colloquial language, detailing his destitute family's meager
existence with a clear eye and unexpected passages of genuine
humor. A movie version was both inevitable and unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet director-adapter Alan Parker has done an exceptional job
bringing the cherished best seller to the screen. He understandably
sacrifices its flavorful verbal texture for a stark visual
representation of the dreary, drizzly world of Limerick, Ireland,
but it is a reasonable trade-off. Lovers of the book and newcomers
to the story should both be able to appreciate this cinematic
depiction of McCourt's coming of age, his struggles, setbacks and
triumphs amid unspeakable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins in 1935 Brooklyn, where 5-year-old Frank and
his three younger brothers live in poverty and hunger with his
unemployed father Malachy (Robert Carlyle) and his poor, put-upon,
perpetually pregnant mother Angela (Emily Watson). When a fifth
baby, a girl, arrives and quickly dies, the McCourts pack up and
head to Ireland, a nation in even greater financial despair than
the United States. As Frank observes with typical McCourt
puckishness, ``We must be the only family in Irish history to say
goodbye to the Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reception is anything but warm, in part because of
Malachy's roots in the Protestant North country. They settle in a
house whose first floor is always flooded and furnished with
flea-infested hand-me-downs. Then Frank's younger brothers also
die, Angela withdraws further into her shell, and Malachy withdraws
into drink. Unable to keep a job longer than a day, he abandons the
family for London. Angela is reduced to begging for public
assistance and Frank helps out by delivering coal, under such
dreadful working conditions that he nearly goes blind.
</P>
<P>
   Life is so grim and hunger so prevalent that at one point, Frank
licks the newspaper of someone's fish and chips ``till my face was
as black as Al Jolson's.'' There is humor here, much of it stemming
from the Catholic Church and the mysteries of communion and
confession, as well as the more alluring mysteries of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Although these are his memoirs, McCourt does not leave himself
unindicted. In a particularly brutal scene, a teen-age Frank has
his first pint of beer at the pub _ a rite of passage _ and returns
home and pummels Angela, just as he had seen his father do so
often.
</P>
<P>
   Depicted from age 5 to 16, Frank is portrayed by three
expressive young actors _ Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge
_ close enough in looks to make the transitions believable. This is
Frank's story, but the soul of the movie is Angela, played with
such pitiable passivity, yet a determination to survive, by the
wondrous Watson. As Malachy, Robert Carlyle is consumed by demons,
which he tries unsuccessfully to drown in beer. He deserts the
family when he is unable to provide for them, yet Frank can only
recall him with admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Director Parker has had an eclectic career, with films ranging
from ``Midnight Express'' to ``Evita,'' as well as the Irish
working-class comedy, ``The Commitments.'' Here, with
cinematographer Michael Seresin, he captures the muted, misty gray
landscape of Limerick, hopeless yet idealized by distance and
memory.
</P>
<P>
   His script (co-written with Laura Jones) follows the book
faithfully, which is to say it is largely a dark, downward spiral.
Yet the message of ``Angela's Ashes'' is the resolve that peers
through the gloom, the triumph of the human spirit, the will to
keep going despite the misery. As an older Frank observes in
voiceover, ``It was, of course, a miserable childhood, but a
childhood not miserable is not worth telling.''

 &HT;    Tale of '30s artistic suppression makes the most of too much
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Like impassioned Depression-era composer
Marc Blitzstein, who wrote a folk opera that led to the demise of
the government's Federal Theatre Project employment program, film
director-screenwriter Tim Robbins has deeply felt, left-wing
political views and sees the world in shades of black and white.
Like scowling Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, whose Rockefeller
Center panorama depicted the entire world's political struggles,
Robbins attempts too much in his message-laden movie ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' but his fervent overreach still manages to be exhilarating
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   As we learn in a preface intended to let Robbins off the hook
for his considerable excesses, the yarn we are about to receive is
``a (mostly) true story.'' In fact, the mini-rebellion surrounding
the opening night of Blitzstein's 1937 musical labor lament, staged
by a cartoonishly brash Orson Welles and produced by an equally
blustery John Houseman, is saga enough to fill an overstuffed
movie. But Robbins has larger, wider ambitions, yearning to create
a thick slice of period agitprop populated by the era's famous and
influential, as well as the fanciful and fictional, in the manner
of a frantic E.L. Doctorow.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the government's attempt to silence the show it
bankrolled by locking the actors out of their theater is so full of
drama, it is a shame its impact is diluted by Robbins' more
preposterous inventions. Nevertheless, those who wade through this
uneven mosaic will be rewarded with an armful of juicy performances
and a cry for artistic freedom, either in the turbulent '30s or
today.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by ghostly visions of Bertolt Brecht, starving artist
Blitzstein (a dewy-eyed Hank Azaria) peddles his magnum opus to
Federal Theatre Project, headed by radiant do-gooder Hallie
Flanagan (Cherry Jones, finally getting a movie role worthy of
her). Meanwhile, a callow Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack)
commissions Rivera (Ruben Blades) to design and paint an upbeat
mural for his new corporate complex, and is taken aback by the
prominent image of Lenin on the wall. Both artistic efforts seem
doomed, in part by the government's anti-Communist zeal,
spearheaded by Congressman Martin Dies and his witch hunt hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more. Media magnate William Randolph Hearst is
buying Italian art in an effort to launder money to Mussolini's
fascist regime, a deal brokered by an extravagant Susan Sarandon
and paid in part by a fictional capitalist's wife (a giddy Vanessa
Redgrave). On the other side of the political fence are
well-meaning whistle-blower Hazel Huffman (Joan Cusack), ready to
testify against the Commies in the theater company, and an
overwrought, disgruntled vaudeville ventriloquist (Bill Murray).
Remarkably, Robbins keeps most of these balls juggling in the air,
even if they come at us in wildly disparate moods and acting
styles.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Cradle Will Rock'' had a center, it would be the performers
of Blitzstein's pop opera, typified by stage-struck wannabe Olive
Stanton (perpetual waif Emily Watson, fresh from the gloom of
``Angela's Ashes''). The hodge-podge concludes with the locked-out
cast marching through the streets to another theater where the show
defiantly goes on, a momentary victory for art. And in case we
didn't get the point, a final heavy-handed image underscores the
point that the cultural battle continues in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins is clearly a filmmaker of the ``more is more'' school,
but Blitzstein and Rivera would recognize a kindred spirit in his
boat-rocking political vehemence.

   `Moonlighting' And an Audition
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Gordon Caron's ``Now and Again,'' a show about a
middle-aged man in a young man's body, is now in its first season
on CBS. ``Knock wood we'll get a second season,'' he said the other
day. In 1985 he was wishing the same for another show of his:
``Moonlighting,'' whose run as one of the top series ever was by no
means preordained in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had about the same ratings as the show that preceded us in
that slot,'' he said. That was ``MacGruder and Loud,'' about two
police officers who married each other against regulations. ``The
wisdom was that they'd renew them and let us go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. On Tuesday, Anchor Bay will release the 93-minute
``Moonlighting'' pilot on tape and DVD. The disc also includes
commentary by Caron and Bruce Willis, whose smirk and ``real guy''
demeanor as the private detective David Addison set him up for fame
in future film roles. In those days, masculine characters on
television tended to be sensitive types, like Alan Alda in
``M.A.S.H'' had been. ``I was more interested in writing a guy who
planted his feet and said what was on his mind,'' Caron said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere to be heard on the disc is Cybill Shepherd, who as the
prickly Maddie Hayes helped generate enough frustrated sexual
tension between her and Addison to drive the nation to distraction
for a couple of seasons. Finally, in an episode that ranks with the
revelation of who shot J.R., the coming out of Ellen DeGeneres and
the retirement of Jerry Seinfeld, they ``got horizontal,'' as the
writers put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake maybe,'' Caron said in an interview. Ms.
Shepherd was pregnant with twins at the time, which definitely took
some steam out of the proceedings. Critics contended that the
consummation did the same for the series, but Caron said that
decline wasn't inevitable. ``There were good stories to tell after
that,'' he said. Two years later, in May 1989, the show left the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The disc also presents Willis' screen test. He and Caron were
close, and at first so were Caron and Ms. Shepherd. ``There came a
time when that wasn't the case,'' Caron added.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the disc makes a fine artifact without the other
half of Hayes and Addison. On the show Maddie was a supermodel
turned detective agency owner. ``Cybill said it was a Hawksian
comedy,'' Caron said of the mix of the screwball and the gangster
in Howard Hawks' films in the 1930s and '40s. ``Moonlighting''
reviewers were sometimes bothered by the dual personality. ``They
wondered what the show wanted to be a comedy or a drama,'' Caron
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Like movies of the '30s and '40s, the show burst with dialogue.
``I had them watch those films to see really how fast you could
talk and not worry about people understanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would the show work today? Certainly the sexual tension still
applies, and then some. (For a look at the '90s scene there is
``Ally McBeal: Sex and the Single Life,'' a two-disc set of six
episodes from Fox.) ``Moonlighting'' reruns are on Bravo, and there
are plans to release more videos. ``We haven't finalized anything,
but I'm hopeful,'' Caron said.

   ILLUMINATA
</P>
<P>
   Conjuring some familiar stage types, John Turturro's film pays
knowing homage to actors and the New York theater circa 1900. As
the aging diva Celimene, Susan Sarandon twits ingenues. A master of
casual cruelty, the lofty critic Bevalaqua, hilariously played by
Christopher Walken, falls for a bit player with long eyelashes,
amusingly portrayed by Bill Irwin. Lending heart and ballast to the
story are the aspiring playwright Tuccio ( Turturro, above) and the
star of the company, Rose, played by Katherine Borowitz (
Turturro's solemnly beautiful wife). Directing well enough to make
one forget he's directing, Turturro does ``a fine job of drawing
his cast into the spirit of celebration,'' Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times. &QL;

<P>
   1999. Artisan. $83.33; DVD, $29.98. 111 minutes. Closed

   MY SON THE FANATIC
</P>
<P>
   ``They say integrate _ but they live in pornography and filth
and they call us backward,'' says Farid (Akbar Kurtha), a young
Pakistani trying to live in the north of England. Angrily breaking
off his romance with the daughter of an English police officer,
Farid is less patient with racist treatment than his more liberal
father, Parvez (the Indian actor Om Puri), who drives a taxi
frequented by prostitutes and their clients. Written with delicacy
and wry humor, Udayan Prasad's film is filled ``with loosely
sketched characters who still come fully to life'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Miramax. $104.16. 86 minutes. R. Release date: Jan. 25.
</P>

   BLACK CAT, WHITE CAT
</P>
<P>
   In a mad, Felliniesque scramble through his own imagination,
Emir Kusturica employs a flock of geese and a nonprofessional cast
in a tale of two patriarchs and a lot of young connivers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a heist caper and misdirected passions leading to a
wedding with a barefoot bride who disguises herself as a tree
stump. Just ``give this man the Danube, Gypsy musicians and a
camera and you've got a party'' (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999. U.S.A. $106.99. 135 minutes. Serbo-Croatian and Romany
with English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   MY LIFE SO FAR
</P>
<P>
   A more genteel view unfolds in Hugh Hudson's film about life in
Argyll, Scotland, in the late 1920s. Not that the story, as seen
through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy (Robert Norman), lacks
troubling situations. His father, Edward (Colin Firth), is an
eccentric inventor and passionate nonconformist who clashes over
priorities with his brother, Morris (Malcolm MacDowell), a
hard-headed businessman. Then Edward is smitten with Morris' much
younger French wife (Irene Jacob). But this is ``such a muted,
smoothly textured swatch of British nostalgia, you feel no qualms
about languishing in its `Masterpiece Theater' vision of a safer,
more shining path'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Miramax. $104.16. 93 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Release date: Jan. 25.

   HORATIO HORNBLOWER
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Duel,'' the first film of a four-part series, the
seafaring is none too rollicking for C.S. Forester's famed
midshipman (Ioan Gruffud) as he sets sail with the Royal Navy. With
too little to do _ it being 1793 and the English between set-to's
with the French _ the crew of the Justinian is proving to be its
own worst enemy. Seasick by the time he reaches the ship's decks,
Horn-blower falls prey to the sadistic Jack Simpson (Dorian Healy),
with whom he eventually conducts the altercation of the title. The
problem is, subsequent battles and all, Hornblower and the rest
never snap to throughout the entire series. ``If you can imagine a
young Al Gore in a Napoleon hat, you've got the picture,'' Ron
Wertheimer wrote in The New York Times. 1999. A&AMP;E. A boxed set of
four DVDs. $59.95. 400 minutes. Release date: Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   IN SEARCH OF KUNDUN
</P>
<P>
   With interviews of its creative participants, Michael Henry
Wilson's documentary clarifies the aim of Martin Scorsese's
``Kundun,'' a visually enthralling film that used few words to
convey the spirit of Tibetan Buddhism. Interspersing scenes of
Scorsese at work with comments by the Dalai Lama, the film is
unapologetically puffy, but, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, still makes a ``valuable and informative footnote.'' 1999.
Hollywoodn't. $19.95. 84 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   EVEN DWARFS STARTED SMALL
</P>
<P>
   In Werner Herzog's second feature film, dwarfs take over a
correctional institution and try to break free of a society that
mocks them. 1970. Anchor Bay. $19.98. 96 minutes. German with
English subtitles. &QL;

 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The meeting took place in the cafe of the Four
Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, the power breakfast site of choice.
Mike Leigh, director of ``Topsy-Turvy,'' a love sonnet to the
theater in the form of a biography of Gilbert and Sullivan, waved
across the room to Anthony Minghella, director of ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley,'' the lavish adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel
about a chameleonlike serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   Flashback: Three years ago, Minghella's previous film, ``The
English Patient,'' was a front-runner for the Oscar for best
picture, which it eventually won, while Leigh's ``Secrets and
Lies'' was a potential dark-horse spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Minghella's film _ along with Sam Mendes' ``American
Beauty'' and Michael Mann's ``Insider'' _ is mentioned as a likely
winner of the Oscar for best picture.
</P>
<P>
   And Leigh's ``Topsy-Turvy,'' which won the National Society of
Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle awards for best
picture of 1999, is a potential dark-horse candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the National Board of Review to announce its
best-picture choices,'' Leigh told Minghella, whose film placed
second to ``American Beauty'' on the board's list. ``And when it
came out, and I saw your film in there, I thought, `Uh-oh, here we
go again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh remembered his previous Oscar experience as a bittersweet
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fly all the way over to Los Angeles, and you stay in a
fancy hotel, and by the time they take you over to the Oscar
ceremonies in your limousine, and you walk down that long gantlet
outside and are sitting in the hall, you've bought into it,'' he
said. ``You might just win. And then they started announcing the
winners, and it became gradually clear that it wasn't to be.''
</P>
<P>
   This year when there is no clear single front-runner (as there
was with ``Titanic'' two years ago) or even a race between two
favorites (``Saving Private Ryan'' and the eventual winner,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' last year), the hopes of dark horses are
raised even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it also means the field is more crowded, with such
potential long-shot nominees as ``Being John Malkovich'' and
``Three Kings'' lurking in the shadows. ``It seems to me that
people have been able to put out some really interesting things''
is the way Leigh put it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Leigh said, he must face another Academy Awards season with
a film, at least potentially, in the running. He even faltered over
naming the awards. ``I can hardly get the name out of my mouth,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh said he was delighted with the way ``Topsy-Turvy,'' a
fondly imagined period piece, had been embraced by filmgoers who
might have been alienated by some of his harder-edged urban films
like ``Naked'' and ``High Hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the film is nominated for Academy Awards this time around,
Leigh says, he has learned his lesson. When people come up to him
and assure him that he will win, he will maintain his skepticism.
``I think I have learned to be a little less gullible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Clearer `Window'
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz, the film restoration wizards
who have already done the holy work of fixing, saving and ennobling
deteriorating classics like ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``Vertigo'' and
``My Fair Lady,'' are back in theaters this week with their latest
effort: a lush, vividly colored restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's
``Rear Window,'' made in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, ``Rear Window,'' starring James Stewart, is unlike the
team's other efforts, being more of a chamber piece in comparison
with the big-screen bombast of David Lean's epic ``Lawrence'' or
Hitchcock's emotionally twisted ``Vertigo.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was much needed, Katz said recently, because the original
negative of the film had fallen into such disrepair and because the
film was a technical landmark for Hollywood. ``Rear Window'' was
the first movie to use a Technicolor dye-transfer color process
that later fell into disuse.
</P>
<P>
   A result, Katz said, is that those who have seen the film in
recent years may not recognize the electric brightness of some of
the colors they will see in this restored version.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood studios should come to an agreement about what
constitutes a restored film, he said. Too many movies are sent out
into theaters with little more than a fresh print of an old
negative and advertised as restored, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we finish with a film, there is a brand-new, perfect
negative,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the team will decide what project to take on next. So many
classics are in need of attention, but there is only so much time.
The men say they can work on only one film at a time.
</P>
<P>
   And what they do is also dictated by the willingness of the
studio that owns the film to hire them to undertake the work. Maybe
Hitchcock's ``North by Northwest''?
</P>
<P>
   Katz's face lighted up. ``Oh, we'd love to get our hands on that
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Favorite Foreign Films
</P>
<P>
   Landmark Theaters, the nation's largest chain of art-house
cinemas, celebrated its 25th anniversary with a poll of the
nation's favorite foreign-language films. Visitors to Landmark's
cinemas as well as Borders Books branches were invited to cast
their votes as were visitors to an Internet site, and 35,000 votes
were eventually tallied. The results were announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected in such an unscientific poll of
contemporary moviegoers and bookstore browsers, the largest number
of votes went to the most recent foreign-language box-office
favorites. ``Life Is Beautiful'' ended up in first place, followed
by ``Cinema Paradiso'' and ``Il Postino,'' all films of the last
decade. One has to go down to No. 8, Akira Kurosawa's ``Seven
Samurai'' (1954), to find a film made before the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The other films in the poll's top 10 are ``Like Water for
Chocolate'' (1992), ``Das Boot'' (1981), ``Babette's Feast''
(1987), ``The Gods Must Be Crazy'' (1981), ``Shall We Dance?''
(1996) and ``The Bicycle Thief'' (1948).
</P>
<P>
   Where is Federico Fellini's ``8{?'' Sorry, No. 39. Francois
Truffaut's ``Jules and Jim''? No. 54. Jean Renoir's seminal ``Rules
of the Game''? No. 98. And Michelangelo Antonioni's
``L'Avventura,'' once chosen by a poll of British film critics as
the second-best movie ever made (after ``Citizen Kane'')? Nowhere
in the top 100.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the point, argued Cary Jones, the theater chain's
vice president for marketing. ``Part of the point was to stimulate
discussion of foreign-language films and to get people to begin
thinking about them,'' especially young people, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of Landmark's revenues come from showing
foreign-language films, he said, although this number is fewer than
it had been in earlier years before American independent films
began to squeeze foreign films out of most of America's art houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the challenge,'' Jones said, ``making foreign films the
hip and cool thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tale of a Dog
</P>
<P>
   Jay Russell, who had already had one Hollywood incarnation in
``development hell'' at two production companies, Imagine
Entertainment and TriStar Pictures, was making television
documentaries when he came across the writer Willie Morris at home
in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over to his house and interviewed him there, and he
was one of these larger-than-life characters,'' said Russell. ``I
immediately just fell for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who died in August, was best known for his memoirs of
growing up in the Deep South (``North Toward Home'') and working in
Manhattan literary circles (``New York Days''), but Russell said he
was drawn to a short memoir Morris wrote about the best dog he ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   This resulted in ``My Dog Skip,'' a frankly sentimental film
about a boy and his precocious dog in small-town Mississippi that
opened a couple of weeks ago on a handful of screens in New York
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If it does well, it may expand to more markets, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell studied at Columbia University under the director Milos
Forman. Later at the Sundance Institute Film Workshop he was able
to develop his first film, ``End of the Line,'' starring Wilford
Brimley and Mary Steenburgen. This led to the Hollywood development
deals that after much effort resulted in no films being made.
</P>
<P>
   When the offer came along to make documentaries, Russell said,
he jumped at it. ``At least I was out there doing what I wanted to
do, making movies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he was working on a five-hour miniseries for PBS called
``Great Drives,'' interviewing people about the famed Highway 61
that runs through the heart of the Mississippi Delta, when he met
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his writing is sentimental, but he never considered
`sentimental' to be a negative term, and neither do I,'' Russell
said. ``There's a simplicity to it that touches the heart.'' &QL;

14. Several months ago, as Bradley surged in the polls and the Gore
campaign lurched toward a much-needed overhaul, the Texas race

`A MAP OF THE WORLD': PUSHED TO THE BRINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many sudsy made-for-Lifetime dramas about families in crisis
flood the market that when a film appears like ``A Map of the
World,'' the devastating screen adaptation of a novel by Jane
Hamilton, it can be easily overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   But this film about a family in the Midwest that endures a
grotesque one-two punch of misfortune has an emotional depth and
psychological acuity that place it in a category by itself.
</P>
<P>
   The central character, Alice Goodwin (Sigourney Weaver), is a
mother of two and part-time school nurse who has moved from the
city to help her husband, Howard (David Strathairn), run a farm in
rural Wisconsin. The Goodwins' harried life is turned upside down
one day when Alice is minding the children of her best friend and
neighbor, Theresa Collins (Julianne Moore), and Theresa's
2-year-old daughter, Lizzy, strays into a pond and drowns.
</P>
<P>
   Alice has barely begun to recover from the event, which has left
her guilt-stricken and filled with self-hatred, when she is
arrested and accused of sexually abusing a young boy at her school.
Already on the verge of a nervous breakdown, she is plunged into a
nightmare. A pariah in the community, spat on by her neighbors, she
languishes in prison after Howard can't raise the money for bail.
</P>
<P>
   Where an ordinary film would turn Alice's predicament into a
heartbreaking sobfest, ``A Map of the World,'' which reopens Friday
in Manhattan after a brief run in December, doesn't make it so easy
for us. Headstrong and mercurial, Alice reacts to misfortune with a
perverse, zany combativeness.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is clearly innocent of wrongdoing, she can be
infuriating. And Ms. Weaver's extraordinarily penetrating
performance captures every shade of self-hatred, defiance, guilt,
exasperation and impatience that Alice experiences, as well as
showing us her love for her family.
</P>
<P>
   Every character in the movie, from Alice's basically
well-meaning but ruthless lawyer to her embattled but loyal husband
(who begins to worry that his wife might actually be guilty), has
many dimensions. Ms. Weaver's Alice is matched in depth by Ms.
Moore's radiant, grief-stricken Theresa, who is overcome with rage
over her loss but who also understands that these things happen and
that it wasn't Alice's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elliott, a New York theater director who is making his
screen debut with ``A Map of the World,'' has won acclaim for the
hyper-realistic ensemble performances he puts on the stage. He
brings the same microscopic psychological detail to bear here,
plunging us into the near chaos of family life with young children
and making us feel its stress as well as its joy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's portrait of a marriage that already has its cracks
and seams being put to an ultimate test is wrenching. When Alice
goes to prison, the film's vision of it as a place peopled largely
by volatile underclass women who are barely out of their teens and
emotionally are children is a little shocking and entirely
believable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Map of the World'' has its flaws. The voice-over narrations
that preface and end the movie are stiff and not clear enough. And
when Alice finally gets her day in court, the trial is dispensed
with too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not since Fred Schepisi's 1988 film ``A Cry in the Dark''
has a movie gotten this deeply under the skin of a woman who finds
herself a modern-day Salem witch. And Ms. Weaver's amazingly
self-effacing performance, like Meryl Streep's in the earlier film,
is a marvel.

DROPPING THE LITERARY FOR PRESENT-DAY HIP

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Better choreography, to put it mildly, would have
helped the Stuttgart Ballet on Wednesday night when the German
company opened a run, through Saturday, at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the program of two New York premieres and the
familiar ``Initials R.B.M.E.'' by John Cranko showed off a handsome
crop of young dancers and the troupe's rarely seen contemporary
side.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not ``Delta Inserts'' by the American choreographer
Kevin O'Day and ``Dos Amores'' by Christian Spuck, a German
choreographer new to New York, are works that fully make his point,
Reid Anderson, the company's Canadian artistic director, is on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that the Stuttgart cannot be a single-image company,
fossilized in the handful of Cranko story ballets that rocketed the
troupe to international fame in 1969. Since then, the Stuttgart has
been associated with the full-evening ballets Cranko fashioned out
of literary classics.
</P>
<P>
   After a long absence from New York, the company appeared
typically at Lincoln Center Festival '98 with ``Onegin'' and
``Romeo and Juliet,'' sure-fire Cranko staples.
</P>
<P>
   But Cranko occasionally created plotless pieces in a
contemporary style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initials R.B.M.E.'' (1972) is the best known, the
choreographer's tribute to the four dancers he guided to fame as he
remolded the Stuttgart's artistic profile. The initials refer to
the first names of these dancers: the American Richard Cragun, the
German Birgit Keil, the Brazilian Marcia Haydee and the Dane Egon
Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a compelling acknowledgment that a choreographer
collaborates with his dancers. That Jiri Kylian, John Neumeier and
William Forsythe emerged from the Stuttgart under Cranko's
direction and later Ms. Haydee's to become Europe's three leading
choreographers today is testimony to a body of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these three choreographers produced their best work
at the Stuttgart, and all now head other companies. Anderson, who
danced with Kylian and Neumeier in the company before directing
Ballet British Columbia and the National Ballet of Canada, seems
therefore intent on giving new choreographers a free hand.
</P>
<P>
   One would nonetheless hate to have a newcomer to ballet think
that the quality of choreography in this program is the kind
audiences normally encounter. O'Day has produced what may be his
weakest work, uncharacteristically academic under its familiar cool
veneer. Atypically, he has been infected with the bug of the
stop-and-go style that Forsythe has pioneered to more brilliant
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Spuck, a dancer in the company, is a talent worth developing
and, despite a restricted idiom, he has an expressive fluency. Yet
here, too, there are influences from choreographers who simply work
on a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   To see corseted men suddenly reappear in Baroque skirts is to
recall similar Kylian images just as Spuck's clay-figure duets,
full of flexed feet, owe much to the Spanish choreographer Nacho
Duato.
</P>
<P>
   If there is something to applaud vehemently, it is the new
classical style that Anderson has given to the company. Body
placement is perfect and the men, stronger than the women, are
superb.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Delta Inserts,'' O'Day again explores relationships with a
tinge of alienation, as he has done more persuasively in works for
the New York City Ballet and modern-dance troupes. This time, the
malaise is drowned in the clattering cascade of sound that the
experimental composer John King has written for the piece.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for King to compose for Merce Cunningham, where
the score is deliberately ignored by the dancers. It is another
when the music is used as rhythmic support by O'Day, who is wedded
to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally, the ballet divides an ensemble into four
successive duets, each longer than the other. Strangely, the
choreography often resembles an adagio (or partnering) class with
the women on toe displaying a classroom silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Each couple has a different relationship, but one partner often
taps another on the noggin or other parts of the body. Elena
Tentschikowa hits Ivan Gil Ortega on the shoulder after he tumbles
through a burst of metallic riffs.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Fernandes, somewhat passive, and Eric Gauthier, swift
and darting, give a hint of the manipulative partnering that
follows with Douglas Lee and Bridget Breiner.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conn and Julia Kramer have a duet that is finally
something to write home about. She is lifted from under his legs
and clambers up his calf. After they dance in unison, Conn staggers
about and Ms. Kramer knocks him over with a tap to his forehead:
the fragility of relationships. Generally, the choreography for the
men is more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Cranko, feeling compelled to use all of Brahms' Second Piano
Concerto, created a more persuasive ode to friendship in ``Initials
R.B.M.E.'' Vladimir Malakhov, usually seen with American Ballet
Theater, brought his purity and playfulness to the Madsen role.
Cragun's specialty was triple turns in the air. Robert Tewsley does
not have this technique, but he substituted a lyrical elegance in
the Cragun solos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kramer in the Keil role and Ms. Breiner in the Haydee role
both needed stronger projection, but Ivan Cavallari, as Ms.
Breiner's partner, gave every arabesque and yearning gesture a
magnificent power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dos Amores'' is a collage. The music is by the European
experimental composers Thierry de Mey and Dieter Fenchel as well as
Vivaldi. A love poem by Pablo Neruda is recited in Spanish. Six
couples supposedly explore aspects of love. Steps as such and toe
work do not interest Spuck. Enigmatic images do. The plumb lines
attached to silver cones onstage seem more like props than symbols,
and the occasionally blindfolded dancers look as spliced-in as the
men who dance to Vivaldi, bare chested in Baroque skirts.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Spuck knows how to put movement together. There is
a polish to the partnering. A woman in an overhead lift wraps
smoothly around her partner's neck and flows into a curled position
in his arms.

`HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH': LAST DOUBLE-ENTENDRE OF A GENDER
BENDER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do we really have to say goodnight to Hedwig?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that this stitched-together collage of a woman has put
in close to two years down there on the waterfront, where she has
turned the Jane Street Theater into her personal confessional. But
as of last Wednesday night, she was looking awfully healthy for
someone who describes her own exterior as a ``paper shroud,'' and
she was still wearing her scarred heart like a rhinestone
lavaliere. That heart still glitters; it still hypnotizes.
</P>
<P>
   The closing notice was posted recently for ``Hedwig and the
Angry Inch,'' John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask's remarkable
musical about a ``slip of a girlyboy'' from East Berlin who grew up
to become an ``internationally ignored song stylist'' and, thanks
to a botched sex-change operation, someone of unclassifiable
gender.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which quickly became the coolest ticket in town after
opening with Mitchell in the title role in February 1998, has been
losing momentum of late. The gamble of casting Ally Sheedy, the
adventurous film actress, in the part last fall turned out to be,
by all accounts, unfortunate. Ms. Sheedy left the show six weeks
before her contract ended, and ``Hedwig'' is now scheduled to close
on Jan. 30. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this breathtakingly original musical is, one should
remember, about survival through self-reincarnation, centered on a
character who, in concert with her ragtag rock band, the Angry
Inch, describes herself as harder to tear down than the Berlin
Wall. In the person of Matt McGrath, who took over the part last
month, Hedwig has found an avatar worthy of her infinite, er,
variety. The show feels new-born. Mitchell is the only previous
Hedwig I had seen (others include Michael Cerveris, Kevin Cahoon
and Donovan Leitch), and I wasn't sure I wanted to cloud my
memories of what registered as an unmatchable portrait. Yet
McGrath, who played the terminally sensitive and sullen gay sons of
``A Fair Country'' and ``Minutes From the Blue Route,'' brings a
sly, rejuvenating shift of emphasis to a role that is, after all, a
composite of so many unlikely elements.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't start off with the confrontational confidence or
insolence of Mitchell. There's a vulnerability, even a slight
shakiness, right on the bespangled, bewigged surface of McGrath's
Hedwig, so that when she announces to her audience that she's
``wide open,'' you don't just snicker. This is a Hedwig swimming in
Weltschmerz, and the sparkling makeup on her lips, cheeks and
eyelids suggests accumulated tears as it glistens in the light.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that McGrath, a sure and fluid singer, doesn't
land each of the lewd double entendres that make Hedwig's act such
a down-and-dirty pleasure. But he brings a slow hand to his
delivery, with droll, molasses-paced double takes to match. Even
more than Mitchell, he finds a startling individuality in the
different voices within Hedwig: of those who used and abused her in
the past; of her own crazy salad of selves; and of Trask's
deliciously eclectic score, which ranges from country and western
to glam rock.
</P>
<P>
   The production itself, directed by Peter Askin, feels newly
tightened and muscular. The backup band is first-rate, as is Maggie
Moore as Yitzak, Hedwig's hangdog immigrant husband, equally ready
to snarl and whimper. The metamorphoses of Hedwig and Yitzak at the
show's end have a truly magical inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Hedwig,'' for all its gleeful satire of the ego-driven
``business we call show,'' is ultimately as affecting as it is
funny. Even more than, say, ``Rent,'' it's the perfect musical for
a generation that grew up refusing to draw a line between irony and
sincerity and that knows that striking a pose doesn't mean you have
to freeze yourself in it. Identity is endlessly scrambled in
``Hedwig''; McGrath's performance, like that of Mitchell, makes it
clear that this can be as much of a blessing as a curse.

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ A senior Russian general Thursday became an
unfortunate symbol of the difficulties Russian troops have endured
in their campaign to take the Chechen capital, Grozny, when he was
reported missing there.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Mikhail Malofeyev vanished on Tuesday, the first day
of a renewed Russian ground onslaught on the city in the breakaway
southern Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders said the general had probably been killed in
a fierce clash, but the Chechen militants on the other side of the
fighting insisted that he had been captured alive and was being
interrogated at a rebel hide-out in the Chechen highlands.
</P>
<P>
   As the deputy commander of the Northern Group of Russian forces
in Chechnya, Malofeyev was an important commander. Thursday night,
his fate was the lead item on Russian television news.
</P>
<P>
   The news broadcasts showed a video of the 44-year-old officer as
he stood in a trench near Grozny in early January and gave orders
to his subordinates. His disappearance came among reports that
Russian troops were encountering determined rebel resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers are no longer boasting that they will seize the
city in four days. Instead, they emphasized that there is no
deadline for what could be a protracted and costly operation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest cities in the North Caucasus, Grozny is a
sprawling settlement. Russian officials said that as many as
several thousand militants occupy the city and are fighting from
cellars and well-fortified positions along the Russian routes of
advance. Thousands of civilians still inhabit the city,
complicating the Russian attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have sought to penetrate the city from the north,
east and west. However, unlike the earlier war in Chechnya, from
1994 to 1996, the Russian military is not rushing vulnerable
armored columns into the city. That war ended badly for the Russian
military, with de facto independence for the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Russian armored personnel carriers and tanks found it difficult
to maneuver through Grozny's streets during that conflict. Chechen
rebels would typically attack the first and last armored vehicle in
a column, trapping the rest of the formation. Then they would
destroy the vehicles with grenades.
</P>
<P>
   So this time the Russian military is using different tactics.
Tanks and armored personnel carriers are largely used on the city's
outskirts, where there are none of the multistory houses that are
convenient hiding places for the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Russian artillery and warplanes have carried out a
withering barrage of suspected rebel positions. Then Interior
Ministry troops and soldiers have moved into the city, checking
each building for rebels and arms.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, however, has not produced a speedy
breakthrough. The Russian military did not allow Russian television
crews and Western reporters to observe the fighting in Grozny
Thursday, and accounts of the Russian offensive there are
fragmentary.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of fighting, however, there was still no
confirmation that Russian forces had established control of Minutka
square, close to the center of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting was reported at a bridge over the Sunzha River, which
bisects the city. Russian authorities said they had seized the
bridge, which the militants used to supply their units and for
communications, two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny is a ruin, with wrecked apartment houses covered by a
pall of black smoke, observers and officials said here.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities insist their casualties are minimal: four
killed and four wounded for the last 24 hours. But many soldiers
believe the official statistics grievously understate actual
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels reported on their web site that they lost 45 fighters
over three days. That, too, is probably an understatement, but it
is considerably higher than previously acknowledged rebel losses,
reflecting the intensity of the recent fighting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malofeyev was born in Nakhodka in the Russian Far East. He
graduated from Frunze, one of Russia's premier military academies
and then served in the Leningrad military district.
</P>
<P>
   The general participated in the first Chechen war. And in
October 1999, he was transferred to the Northern Caucasus as Russia
stepped up its military campaign against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here provided conflicting accounts of what might have
happened to Malofeyev. According to one account, he was with the
245th Motorized Infantry Regiment in a neighborhood in the Western
outskirts of the capital. Malofeyev was hiding in a building with
some officers and soldiers when the unit was attacked by militants,
and the general later failed to return.
</P>
<P>
   Another account holds that Malofeyev was shot when he found
himself trapped in a rebel crossfire as he sought to rally his
troops, who were lying on the ground because of the fierce fire.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the general's disappearance was an embarrassing
setback for the Russian military and illustrated the grave dangers
for Russian troops in Chechnya. It was not the only example.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Koshman, the Russian vice minister who administers the
Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya, recently moved his
headquarters from the Russian military base here, several miles
northwest of Chechnya, to Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian official said Thursday night that one of the convoys
of trucks that moved Koshman's headquarters was shot at along the
way.

&HT;     HISPANIC BUSINESS LEADERS CALL FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE

   WASHINGTON _ Hispanic business leaders on Thursday urged
Congress to approve pending legislation that they said would
improve health care for low-income workers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the Capitol, the Hispanic Business
Roundtable released a January telephone survey of 1,000 Hispanic
adults in California, Florida, New York and Texas, in which
one-third said they have no health insurance, mainly because their
employers didn't provide it.
</P>
<P>
   That is consistent with recent U.S. Census Bureau statistics
showing 34 percent of Hispanics are uninsured, compared to only 12
percent of non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by QEV Analytics Inc., a Washington public
opinion research firm, also showed that 89 percent of those
surveyed believe that Congress's highest priority on health care
should be making health insurance more available and affordable for
the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that 33 percent of respondents said access
to quality health care was a ``serious'' problem. The survey has a
margin of error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's access to affordable health care insurance or
access to more choices and prescription drug coverage for
low-income seniors, Hispanics want Congress to act,'' said Robert
G. Deposada, executive director of the Hispanic Business
Roundtable. ``Failure to do so could energize a massive turnout
against congressional incumbents in fall elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Deposada said only 38 percent of Hispanics working in
small-to-medium size companies have health insurance compared to 63
percent for non-Hispanic white workers. That's because Hispanic
workers are heavily concentrated in the service industry and in
smaller businesses that can't afford to offer health benefits, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The business roundtable announced its support for this
legislation in Congress:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Fair Care for the Uninsured Act, sponsored by House
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, which would create tax
credits of $1,000 for individuals and $3,000 for families to buy
private health insurance. This is for uninsured workers who do not
have access to employer-based health plans. The study showed 80
percent of Hispanics surveyed support Armey's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Medicare Preservation and Improvement Act, sponsored by
Sens. John B. Breaux, D-La., Bill Frist, R-Tenn., Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., and J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., which would provide a
prescription drug benefit through Medicare for low-income seniors
and allow beneficiaries to choose among competing health-care
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed 86 percent of Hispanics surveyed said they
support this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that Hispanics believe the most important
health-care problems in their communities are the rising cost of
health care, fixing the Medicare system and getting better access
to quality care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there is no urgency in the Hispanic community to pass
the so-called Patients Bill of Rights,'' Deposada said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A powerful storm south of Nova Scotia will draw bitter arctic
chill into the Northeastern states. Winds from the northwest will
gust frequently over 30 miles an hour from the central Appalachians
to the coast. Periods of snow will gradually taper off Friday
morning near the southern New England coast, but the piercing winds
will produce widespread blowing and drifting snow. Wind-driven snow
will continue to fall in parts of eastern Maine through the day.
Farther west, the interior Northeast will have variable clouds with
some snow showers, especially near the eastern Great Lakes and over
the hilly terrain. Overnight, winds will gradually diminish across
the interior where temperatures will plunge below zero in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be dry and chilly as high pressure moves
eastward across the region. Onshore winds will develop near the
western Gulf of Mexico coast resulting in an expanding area of low
clouds and a bit of drizzle near the southern Texas coast. The
clouds will spread into the southern Mississippi Valley overnight
as a disturbance from the Rockies draws moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico northward.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will be common along many west-facing mountain slopes from
northern California to the central and northern Rockies as moist,
vigorous high-level winds persist. Locally heavy snow will occur in
the mountain of Utah and Colorado as well as over the southern
Cascades and northern Sierra. Farther north in the Pacific
Northwest, generally light coastal rain and mountain snow will
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Bomb
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms erupted off the North Carolina coast Thursday,
offering the classic signature of a very rapidly developing low
pressure system. Storms that explosively intensify along the East
Coast in winter are called ``bombs'' by forecasters. The fuel for
such explosive storms is moist, mild air that overlies the tepid
waters of the Gulf Stream. The match used for detonation is
typically an upper-level disturbance, which vigorously lifts mild,
moist ocean air. Computer simulations project the low to approach
Nova Scotia on Friday evening as a storm as powerful as a
Category-3 hurricane. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One afternoon about three years ago, Claudia Shear
got the type of call young writers dream about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it perfectly,'' she said recently, beaming. ``I'm
standing in my kitchen making beans, and the phone rings. I picked
it up, and someone said, `Hi, this is James Lapine.' It was one of
the great moments of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `How are you?' And I said, `Surprised.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a most unlikely creative partnership, between Lapine,
the respected Broadway director and writer, and Ms. Shear, the
manic comic actress whose autobiographical play, ``Blown Sideways
Through Life,'' became an unexpected Off Broadway hit in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The result of their three-year collaboration is ``Dirty
Blonde,'' an affectionate look at the lives of Mae West and two of
her most ardent admirers. The play opened to favorable reviews last
week at the New York Theater Workshop, where it has been extended
until Feb. 13. The producers are mulling a move to a larger
theater.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the story of the play's development fits into the
classic mold of the theatrical process: the germ of an idea, a
writer's obsession, workshops, rehearsals, an opening. But in the
case of ``Dirty Blonde,'' many of the elements were decidedly
unorthodox.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the play, for instance, came not from Ms. Shear,
the playwright, but from Lapine, the director, who had, in turn,
been inspired by a magazine article. Unusual, too, was the play's
financial support, a combination of development money from the
Shubert Organization, Broadway's biggest theater owner, with
performing space and other creative support provided by the
nonprofit theater workshop. The project's most peculiar element was
the teaming of Lapine and Ms. Shear.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner was Lapine, a mellow perfectionist with an
admittedly short attention span and a professor's love of
structure. In the other was Ms. Shear, a self-proclaimed
``whiner-weeper'' with a ravenous appetite for trivia, whose
cut-and-paste creative process is part art, part Cuisinart.
</P>
<P>
   While Lapine writes his notes on a special pad, Ms. Shear is
prone to bringing in ideas scribbled on lunch bags, candy wrappers,
even her palms. Lapine speaks quietly; Ms. Shear does not. He calls
her Claudia, she calls him Lapine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relationship that Ms. Shear variously described as
teacher to student, veteran to rookie and sometimes adult to child.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have parents who spend tens of thousands of dollars a
year to send their kids to graduate school,'' she said. ``I just
got Lapine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a completely bump-free process. Hundreds of pages of
dialogue were written and trashed. Characters were created and
killed off. At least one title and one fully designed set were
dumped in the weeks leading up to opening night.
</P>
<P>
   In a play about obsession, there was more than a little creative
obsessing going on. Ms. Shear, for instance, said she became
fixated on the word ``good,'' as in West's quip, ``When I'm good,
I'm very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better.'' Other fixations
included Ms. Shear's love of mirrors and the lives of turn-of-the
century bad girls.
</P>
<P>
   Lapine was less concerned with the facts and figures of West's
life. (``I don't really like to know a lot,'' he said
matter-of-factly.) But he admitted to a few preoccupations of his
own, including the play's final image, two characters in a kiss, a
tableau that he said came to him early, and that he never let go.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were privy to the rehearsal process say Lapine was
also highly protective of Ms. Shear's writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was pretty intensely James and Claudia meeting,
with periodic telephone reports,'' said James Nicola, the artistic
director of the New York Theater Workshop. ``And the great thing
about Claudia is that she knows who to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   It all apparently worked out fine. An audience came; the critics
applauded. It wound up with a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning ``Dirty Blonde'' could have been a musical. In
November 1996 Lapine was approached by Scott Shukat, a theatrical
agent, who wanted Lapine and his friend Alan Menken, the composer,
to consider developing a musical based on West's life. The idea,
Lapine said, had come from an article in The New Yorker by Claudia
Roth Pierpont.
</P>
<P>
   Menken wasn't interested. But Lapine was still intrigued, and in
a moment of inspiration he thought of Ms. Shear, a performer and
writer who might be able to do double duty on the project, both
behind the typewriter and in front of an audience.
</P>
<P>
   So he called her.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke to Dessie Moynihan, director of creative projects
at the Shubert Organization, where Lapine keeps an office and has
an assistant. Ms. Moynihan agreed to provide enhancement money for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   A month later _ Ms. Shear said it felt like six months _ she met
with Lapine and Ms. Moynihan at a restaurant in Chelsea to talk
through the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Almost nothing was set. Lapine had an image of a male Mae (a man
in drag) and a female Mae. And that kiss. He also envisioned a
two-person cast. Beyond that, it was all up to Ms. Shear's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   She said she already knew a little about West from prior
obsessions she had had with the comedian Buster Keaton and the Marx
Brothers but as she began reading biographies of West _ nine of
them _ her opinion of the woman began to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by the image of West as a ``tough girl,'' which would become
the piece's working title, Ms. Shear dug into histories of other
female performers ahead of their time. She did research on
vaudeville and read the work of Damon Runyon and Ring Lardner. She
discovered little-known characters in West's life, like Ed Hearn, a
female impersonator, and Joe Frisco, a vaudevillian who was the
only comic West regularly quoted (besides herself, of course).
</P>
<P>
   All of which, Ms. Shear said, also informed her knowledge of
obsession as a concept itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing interesting about obsession is that when you become
obsessed, you don't just become obsessed with the person, you
become obsessed with everything around it,'' she said. ``You eat so
much of the main course that you're looking at the periphery, at
the tiny side dishes, because nothing is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lapine worked on other projects, including the plays ``The
Diary of Anne Frank'' and ``Golden Child,'' Ms. Shear began
writing, sitting at the kitchen table in her Brooklyn apartment and
churning out reams of material. Early on, most of it took the form
of monologues or dramatizations of real events, almost all to do
solely with West. Ms. Shear periodically showed snippets of what
she had written to Lapine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of great because I didn't have to show anybody
anything,'' she said. ``All I had to do was spend days and days and
days alone with little gloves on, going to archives, or sitting
alone in my apartment watching the same movie 75 times. And then I
would get together with Lapine and rant about Mae West, and he'd
nod politely.''
</P>
<P>
   Diligently Lapine would pore over the drafts, marking notes in
the margins in red pen. More often than not he wrote, ``No.'' Once,
only once, Ms. Shear said, there was a smiley face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the encouraging sort,'' Lapine said, dryly. ``But the
great thing about Claudia is that she's so prolific. Sometimes she
would write a whole monologue, and I'd find one line, and she'd
take that and run with it.''
nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In one case Lapine underlined a line referring to Frisco's
helping West into her car for dinner at a Chinese restaurant.
Although Lapine nixed the car scene, the resulting scene Ms. Shear
wrote about the restaurant remains.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997 Ms. Shear turned in her most complete draft of the
play to date. She was extremely nervous. ``I had to call Paul
Rudnick to talk me down,'' she said, referring to her friend and
fellow playwright. ``I somehow knew.''
</P>
<P>
   In December she went to Lapine's apartment on the Upper West
Side. The two sat near the window, overlooking Central Park. Lapine
was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You have to write in your own voice,''' Ms. Shear
recalled. ``And I broke into tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fear, Ms. Shear said, was of repeating herself. ``Blown
Sideways,'' after all, had been autobiographical, very much in her
own voice. Who, she thought, wanted more of that?
</P>
<P>
   I do, Lapine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was realizing why I wanted her to do it,'' he said.
``When she started writing the Mae West play, well, anybody could
do that, so why you? She had to write the Claudia Shear Mae West
play.''
</P>
<P>
   What that meant in practical terms was the enhancement of two
modern-day characters to act as counterpoint to the historical
scenes with West: Charlie, the male lead, and Jo, a none-too-veiled
stand-in for Ms. Shear.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene Ms. Shear wrote after that December meeting was
the real story of visiting Ms. West's grave in Cypress Hills,
Queens. It remains the first monologue in the show.
</P>
<P>
   For Charlie, Lapine brought in the actor Kevin Chamberlin, with
whom he had worked on a failed musical project called ``Muscle''
several years before. What was the pitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started to work on it, James kept saying, `It's
weird, I want it weird,''' Chamberlin said. ``So I'm looking at it,
and it's so weird that I'm gravitating toward it.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally Ms. Shear conceived of Charlie as a gay drag queen
and, not surprisingly, did some obsessive research on the topic.
The deeper she went, however, the more she wanted the character to
be romantically interested in Jo, an idea that Lapine did not
immediately trust.
</P>
<P>
   The two fought over the topic, with Ms. Shear prevailing because
of what Lapine called the Stephen Sondheim principle: ``Whoever
cares most, wins.'' (Lapine should know. He was Sondheim's
collaborator on ``Sunday in the Park With George'' and other
shows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shear also continued to weave real biographical detail into
her characters. One afternoon, while sitting with Chamberlin, she
noticed a series of small, white scars on his knuckles. ``Where did
those come from?'' she asked. Wrestling, he replied. Thus, Charlie
became a wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   For his part Lapine began arranging the scenes into a cohesive
narrative, weaving the story of West's life with that of the
budding romance of Jo and Charlie. For this he relied on index
cards.
</P>
<P>
   On a big table in a boardroom at the Shubert Organization,
Lapine began to piece together the structure, using different
colored cards for each character and short descriptions of their
action. (``Jo goes to the library,'' for instance.) Where there
were narrative gaps, Lapine put a blank white card.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shear had no idea what Lapine was doing. ``He said, `What do
you think?''' she said. ``I said, `Well, it looks nice.'''
</P>
<P>
   He told her to keep writing.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1998 the cast was set: Ms. Shear, Chamberlin
and Bob Stillman, who was to play a number of smaller roles.
Together they traveled to Martha's Vineyard to put a rough version
of the piece on its feet. They stayed at Lapine's house _ clam
bakes included _ and they rehearsed in the music room of a local
elementary school. (Ms. Shear remembered a dirty carpet and music
primers.)
</P>
<P>
   After a week's rehearsal they presented the first public
performance at the Vineyard Playhouse, a workshop production
financed by the Shuberts. There were almost no costumes and a
less-than-packed house. Still, Ms. Shear said, ``it was like one of
those sci-fi movies where they have the organism and grow something
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't fully formed, and it couldn't go out on its own,''
she said. ``But it was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapine was slightly more analytical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we discovered about it at Martha's Vineyard was that it
was very expositional,'' he said. ``There was a lot of standing and
talking to the audience. It wasn't theatrical. It was like watching
`Biography.'''
</P>
<P>
   So the order came down: Take out all the exposition. If it
cannot be expressed through action or conversation, cut it. Gone
were dozens of little things _ West's biggest salary, her biggest
flop _ that Ms. Shear had obsessed about.
</P>
<P>
   Nicola, who had seen the show on Martha's Vineyard, set a
production date for the New York premiere: the first preview would
be on Dec. 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As the date approached, the intensity of work increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of centrifugal,'' Lapine said. ``As you get closer
and closer to the moment, it becomes clearer and clearer what
needed to be done to pull it together.''
</P>
<P>
   That clarity of thought can be painful, though. One such
occasion occurred just days before rehearsals were to begin in
November.
</P>
<P>
   During a final presentation of design elements, Lapine said he
was staring at an elaborate set design made up of dozens of
different curtains when he suddenly felt a thick lump in his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Can everybody leave the room, please?''' Lapine said,
still wincing a little at the thought. ``It was one of those
horrible moments where you're sitting looking at something and
thinking, `Just be brave and throw it out.'''
</P>
<P>
   They did. A new design, a simple pink box with a curtain in
front and one behind, was built instead.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate act of tinkering continued through rehearsals and
into previews. Inspiration came from unlikely sources. A mink head
muff Ms. Shear wore in the theater one day worked its way onstage.
(You'll know it when you see it.)
</P>
<P>
   Just after Christmas Lapine conducted a four-hour rehearsal with
his cast, an afternoon of creative microsurgery: cutting a line
here, timing blackout there, suggesting a change in an actor's
cadence. It is a strange science, directors will tell you, toying
with the tiny elements that can make a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes those little things,'' Lapine said, ``those little
pieces of direction, a little line or a little word, can pull a
whole show together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a process that was not complete until the week the
critics came, when a flurry of cuts shortened the play by 10
minutes. One moment cut out was the first scene Ms. Shear had
written, more than two years before, depicting a young woman
seducing her teacher. ``I loved that scene,'' Ms. Shear said.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, after the show, as the reviews came in, Ms.
Shear held court in an East Village restaurant as her admirers
swarmed. Lapine had left early.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later the two got together again, to discuss how
``Dirty Blonde'' came to be. As Lapine sat and smiled, Ms. Shear
got in the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a line for James in the play,'' she said, ``where Mae
says: `I got all the pieces together. You can read it right now.' I
wrote that for James.'' &QL;

&HT;     BOXER PLANS TO TAP INTERNET FOR HER PAC

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Barbara Boxer launched a website Thursday for
her political action committee that she hopes will raise $1 million
for House and Senate Democrats to help her party win a majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she decided to create the ``PAC for a Change''
because she has realized ``we can't change the world the way we
want to unless we have more Democrats in both houses.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her so-called leadership PAC is the first of its kind
to focus on fundraising for candidates in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she has already raised more than $415,000 for other
candidates by calling supporters. She said she expects that
launching the new site _ www.changethecongress.com _ will enable
her to raise more without spending money on costly mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a following and I'm happy and willing to share it with
those who share my agenda,'' Boxer told reporters. She said she
thinks Internet fund-raising ``is the wave of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal election laws limit to $10,000 the amount of money that
a political action committee can contribute to an individual
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she plans to donate the $10,000 maximum to at least
20 Democratic candidates in tight races, including Hillary Clinton,
who is running for a New York Senate seat, and Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., who is up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is also helping such California House candidates as state
Sen. Adam Schiff who is challenging Rep. Jim Rogan, a Republican;
Jane Harman, a former member of Congress who wants to reclaim her
old seat from Republican Rep. Steve Kuykendall; and Susan Davis, a
state assemblywoman who is challenging Republican Rep. Brian
Bilbray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're harnessing the power of the Internet to fundamentally
change the Congress,'' Boxer said. ``Not only will people be able
to make a donation, they will be able to get information and get
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great opportunity to take back the Congress this
year and put it back on the side of the people,'' Boxer said. ``The
current Republican Congress is out-of-step with mainstream America
and it's time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outnumber Democrats 55 to 45 in the Senate and 222
to 212, with one independent, in the House
</P>
<P>
   The website includes descriptions of Republican positions on
issues such as abortion and shows the faces of GOP chairmen
morphing into the faces of Democrats who would occupy the positions
if the Democrats won control.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ensembles that play only new music are plentiful
these days, but soloists who play recitals devoted entirely to
newly commissioned works are scarce enough to seem heroic or
eccentric, or perhaps a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   For a soloist, after all, a specialty in new music is a
double-edged sword. It is a time-honored way for players to
distinguish themselves from colleagues who play only more familiar
fare; yet it has its limitations as a career-building strategy, not
the least of which is the disinclination of many listeners to take
chances on new works and composers. There is also the danger of
becoming typecast as a new-music player, a problem for musicians
who also want to play recitals of standard repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conservative, eclectic and openly populist trends in
contemporary composition over the last couple of decades have
started to erode listeners' resistance. As audiences lose their
terror of new music, and the boundaries between the standard and
the modern become more porous, typecasting is likely to evaporate
as an issue. Guy Livingston, a 32-year-old American pianist who
lives in Paris, has assembled a program of recent works that may be
quirky enough to appeal to listeners who have doubts about modern
musical language.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he set out to commission 60 composers to write him works
lasting a minute or less for a program that he calls ``60 Seconds
for Piano.'' He ended up with about 150 newly composed miniatures,
written for him by composers in Europe, Asia and North and South
America, and he tends to reshuffle them _ retaining a core of about
20 works _ whenever he plays one of his ``60 Seconds'' concerts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Livingston has played the program in South Africa, the
Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany, and he is to play it Friday
night, at the Miller Theater at Columbia University. The pianist
argues that among its virtues is variety: a range of styles from
the crashingly dissonant to the gently Minimalist are included, and
a listener who doesn't like a particular work will not have to
endure it for long.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Caballero, a 23-year-old guitarist from Lima, Peru, who
won the Naumburg Competition in 1996, is taking a more traditional
approach. Having played two well-received recitals that combined
new works and standard repertory, he is playing the premieres of
three newly commissioned works in Merkin Concert Hall's Saturday
evening ``Zoom: Composers Close Up'' series on Feb. 26. The works
account for only 25 minutes of music, but the format of these
concerts offers other blandishments, including interviews with the
composers, conducted by John Schaefer from WNYC (93.9 FM), and a
wine and cheese reception.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is the first to say that the idea behind his ``60
Seconds'' program is not entirely original. He said that he was
inspired in part by the composers Anton Webern, whose works tended
toward the aphoristic, and John Zorn, who sometimes works in short
forms. He also cited MTV as an influence, not so much because he is
a fan of its programming, but because he admires what he calls
``the compression of material into a short space, visual as well as
musical, in their case.'' But his most direct model was the
Ensemble Aleph, a Parisian chamber group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been a big inspiration for me,'' Livingston said,
``because they do really wacky programs. In 1992 or 1993 they
commissioned a program of short works. They didn't impose a time
limit, they just said, `Let it be like something Webern might have
written.' A lot of my composer friends wrote pieces for them, and
when they gave a concert of the new works, I was blown away, really
taken aback. It was such an amazing use of time, and I began
thinking about doing something like that for the solo piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their show was in a certain way more fluid because the works
had considerable variation in length, and some composers wrote for
solo instruments within the group and some wrote for the full
ensemble. I spoke to them before I started, and they said, `It's
crazy, don't do it.' But I didn't listen to them. I was so excited
by the idea. What I did, though, was give the composers a specific
time limit. And the work had to be for solo piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston set out to commission his 60 works, but he only knew
about 20 composers. Some were former classmates from Yale
University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in music and
architecture in 1988, or the New England Conservatory, where he
earned his master's in 1991. Others were young European musicians
whose work straddles jazz, rock and classical composition. Several
were Americans living in France and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's commissioning budget was virtually nil: he promised
that the piece would be performed and possibly recorded (a CD
version of the ``60 Seconds'' program is to be released by Wergo, a
German label, in the spring), and he sent each composer a bottle of
Jack Daniels. Still, most of the composers he invited came through
with a piece.
</P>
<P>
   Several took a broad view of Livingston's requirement that the
work be for solo piano: a few combine the piano with electronic
sound, texts that Livingston is asked to recite while playing, or
theatrical elements. At the Miller Theater concert, an actress, Ann
Elizabeth Lyon, is to make several appearances, including one in
which she is to skate across the stage on Rollerblades. And
although one might expect composers to be put off by the time
limitation (how much can be said in a minute?), several said that
they relished the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no reservations whatsoever about the length of the
piece,'' said Isak Goldschneider, an American composer who lives in
Amsterdam and contributed ``42-Second Piano,'' a work that combines
the live piano sound with taped sounds recorded inside the case of
the piano and manipulated electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of scale always interested me,'' Goldschneider
said, ``and I find microforms a very viable path. I was also very
curious to see how the individuality of these pieces _ or perhaps
``components'' is a better term _ would come across in the
performance. I thought a lot about cultural models like cartoons or
graffiti _ forms that scrawl across a limited space and a limited
time. Apart from this, the fight was to constantly scale down and
to keep paring phrases away. I ended up building Lilliputian
phrases from tiny themes less than a second long.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some composers compensated for the brevity of the works by
demanding virtuosity and concentration. Dan Warburton, for example,
responded to Livingston's commission with ``Speed Study 1,'' a
densely scored piece that requires what Warburton describes as
``ultraviolence'' (or at least, an energetic, hard-edged playing
style) and is meant to use all 88 notes on the piano keyboard.
Vanessa Lann, an American who lives in The Hague, wrote a work in
which technical toughness is combined with subtle visual imagery.

   ``Structure is the element I work with most in my music, and I
try to limit the amount of material I use in each of my pieces,''
said Ms. Lann, whose ``DD (Double D)'' combines motoric Minimalist
repetition with a Bartokian rhythmic sense and harmonic edge. ``In
this case I treated the very extreme limitation of time as a goal,
and I approached my piece as if it were a clock. Each hand is
playing in a different rhythmic pattern, so that one sounds as
though it's ticking away the seconds, while the other is crossing
under and over it. A pianist has to be limber and agile to play
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other works are similarly picturesque. Annie Gosfield, in
``Brooklyn, Oct. 5, 1941,'' laments the Brooklyn Dodgers' World
Series loss that year in a thundering work that is played, in part,
with a baseball. Richard Brooks, in ``Conflict of Interest''
alternates a sweet chorale melody with a freewheeling boogie
figure. And a few composers quoted their predecessors: Ketty Nez's
``Moondrunk'' draws on Beethoven's ``Moonlight'' Sonata, and Newt
Hinton's ``Nakano-ku (a S.D.)'' is a few bars of Chopin's ``Harp''
Etude overlaid with a spoken passage in French.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Hinton was another of the people who inspired the show,''
Livingston said. ``He wrote a piece in 1993 that used another
Chopin etude. That one begins with an actress holding a sparkler,
and the pianist plays as long as the sparkler is lit. When it goes
out, you stop playing. I played that at a competition once. It was
a defining moment for me, in terms of what you can do in a short
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Livingston ran out of composing friends, he wrote to a few
established composers. William Bolcom and Louis Andriessen wrote
him short works; Pierre Boulez and Luc Ferrari declined. Still,
when it was clear that soliciting works directly would not yield
the necessary 60 scores, Livingston organized a competition through
the Paris New Music Review, which he edits (it is now an online
magazine, called Paris Transatlantic; the Web site is
www.paristransatlantic.com). Several hundred composers responded,
and in 1998, Livingston's jury _ the staff of his magazine _
gathered to sort through the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Livingston said, ``I sat down and played them,
and the jurors voted. We went through an enormous stack of
material. It took us two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Livingston began playing his ``60 Seconds'' concerts, more
minutelong works began pouring in, and he keeps his program fresh
by substituting the best of these new additions for works he has
been playing from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a program of the end of the 20th century,''
Livingston said. ``Very few of these pieces could have been written
in the 1960s. And yet I don't know if I would call the music
avant-garde. My composer friends wrote some exciting, wild pieces,
but the music doesn't necessarily have the daring and hardness _
almost hard-core edge _ that a lot of music did in the 1950s and
'60s. One of the things I find fascinating about the turn of the
century is that that's no longer the aesthetic. Contemporary music
is no longer as scary as it used to be. I find that appealing, but
also somewhat surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Caballero's concert may seem staid by contrast: there are no
Rollerblading actresses, no electronic elements, no style changes
from minute to minute, just a recital of new works, each lasting
around 10 minutes, and a discussion with the composers. Caballero
has played plenty of new music in his recitals, including pieces by
Elliott Carter, Luciano Berio, Hans Werner Henze and Toru
Takemitsu. But he has always been shy about commissioning, and in
this case, he left the choices to Vickie Margulies, the director of
concert programs at Merkin Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been thinking about it,'' Caballero said, ``but it is a
difficult matter. You have to raise money for the commissions, you
have to find the right composer _ because not everyone is
interested to write for the guitar _ and when you find a composer
whose music you like, you have to hope that what he writes is good
for the instrument. Most of the time it's trial and error. So I
left the commissions to Vickie, and I have to say, they turned out
very well. I am not pulling out my hair and saying, `Why did I
agree to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The works are as eclectic as those on Livingston's program.
David Mallamud's piece, ``Spatula,'' is introduced by a quotation
from a work in the standard repertory, Tarrega's ``Capricho
Arabe,'' but then finds its own themes _ one in fast syncopation,
the other a gentler tango _ which alternate through the work.
</P>
<P>
   Gyan Riley, the son of the composer Terry Riley, provided ``Food
for the Bearded,'' a work that includes a brief improvisatory
section that Caballero describes as ``like a recitative,'' and a
lengthier exploration of slow-moving harmonies, expressed in
arpeggiated chords. The third work, by Aleksandra Verbalov, is
called ``C6,'' which Caballero said was ``an amusing piece, in a
very meditative kind of mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the new works, Caballero has been thinking a lot about
Bach lately. He recently recorded his transcriptions of three of
the Cello Suites (for the Musical Heritage Society), and he is
planning to devote a recital to the four Lute Suites in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is also thinking about composers of past (if somewhat
more recent) times. With another pianist, Ivo Kaltchev, he is
giving the premiere of two long-lost works by George Antheil _ the
First Piano Concerto and the Suite for Piano, Four Hands _ as well
as works by Charles Tomlinson Griffes, Debussy and Poulenc, in a
recital sponsored by the New York Public Library for the Performing
Arts at Cooper Union on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in my spare time,'' he said, ``coming out of this idea of
working in short forms, with virtuosity and quick mood changes, I'm
working on a recital of the complete Chopin Etudes. But that won't
be until 2002 or so.''

 &HT;    MEXICO, U.S. OFFICIALS END EXCAVATION FOR DRUG GRAVES
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican officials put a quiet end this week to
excavations for alleged mass graves containing victims of drug
traffickers in the northern border city of Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   It was an investigation that started with a spectacular burst of
publicity last November and raised hopes that the remains of
between 100 and 200 people missing in the Juarez area might be
found by American FBI agents and Mexican officials working
together. In the end, Mexican officials said Thursday, the bodies
of only nine people believed to have been killed by traffickers
were found in four different sites.
</P>
<P>
   The binational operation also caused a stir in Mexico because a
number of politicians questioned why authorities here felt they had
to request expert assistance from the FBI to uncover the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Digging was halted in Juarez on Wednesday, Mexican Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo told Mexican senators and reporters during an
appearance at the Senate here Thursday. He said U.S. and Mexican
officials are still conducting DNA testing to positively identify
the remains of the nine dead, who are believed to have been killed
by gunmen working for the Juarez-based Carrillo Fuentes
drug-trafficking cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said witnesses are still being interviewed in connection
with the case and that additional digging could resume if more
information is obtained about other possible graves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the missing in the Juarez area are Americans. Officials
on both sides of the border said they hoped they would find some of
the disappeared in graves on scattered ranches that were identified
by informants.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo blamed leaks of erroneous information to the American
press for inflating expectations that authorities would find mass
graves containing dozens of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony before senators on Thursday, Madrazo was forced
to explain why he asked for the help of up to 72 FBI experts in
forensic investigations and other criminal probes. Some senators
said the FBI presence violated Mexico's sovereignty or implied the
Attorney General's office was too incompetent to conduct its own
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information about the whereabouts of graves stemmed
from tips to the FBI in El Paso, Texas, across the border from
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to mention that none of the FBI elements
collaborating with the Attorney General's office are acting as
authorities or an invading police force,'' a defensive Madrazo told
senators. ``All the evidence is being controlled by the Attorney
General's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico and the United States have agreed since 1940 to allow the
presence of some FBI agents in Mexico, Madrazo added.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican senator Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a chief critic of the use
of FBI agents in Juarez, agreed that Mexican law allows for
cooperation. But he called Mexican officials ``incompetent'' and
questioned why they had to rely on so many foreign experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico had the technology,'' he said, ``but it didn't have the
credibility to apply it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican law enforcement in general is under pressure to prove at
home and abroad that it is becoming more competent and less
susceptible to bribes by the powerful Mexican drug cartels that
operate in various cities here. Witnesses say many of the
disappeared in Juarez were last seen in the custody of state or
federal police.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said the search for graves was intended to strike a blow
against the Juarez-based cartel and the police who have served as
its protectors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Madrazo was asked whether the graves operation was
linked to the annual ``certification'' of nations working with the
United States to halt international drug smuggling. Next month the
Clinton administration will recommend whether the U.S. Congress
should certify Mexico as a reliable drug-fighting partner.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has long opposed certification, calling it a unilateral
and counter-productive action that angers Mexicans rather than
encouraging cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All (certification) generates is tension. And that tension
only benefits the drug traffickers,'' Madrazo said, denying any
link between the search for graves and certification.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo also explained why he recently called for Mexican law
enforcement to use the names of the individuals who run Mexico's
most notorious cartels rather than the names of the cities where
they are based.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Juarez and Tijuana, another border city, complain
their cities' images have been unfairly smeared because they are
known as the homes of the two most violent cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an absolutely unjust stigmatization of those
cities,'' Madrazo said.

BUSH CALLS ROE VS. WADE ABORTION RULING A CONSTITUTIONAL `REACH' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELLA, Iowa _ Fighting for support Thursday from socially
conservative Iowa Republicans, George W. Bush defended himself
against a rival's charge that he is a ``pro-life pacifist'' and
declared that the 1972 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion was
a constitutional ``reach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe vs. Wade was a reach, overstepped the constitutional
bounds as far as I'm concerned,'' Bush told a news conference in
his strongest anti-abortion comments so far in his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor still refused to say whether as president
he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe vs.
Wade. GOP presidential rivals Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes have
criticized Bush for refusing to join them in a promise to appoint
justices dedicated to outlawing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Forbes called the landmark ruling ``an
out-of-date injustice supported by the flimsiest of scientific
prejudices. It must be reversed, and it will take a principled,
activist Republican president _ not a pro-life pacifist afraid to
offend _ devoted to the rights of the unborn to start the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said Thursday he would oppose U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval of the RU-486 abortion pill. The FDA is in
the final stages of approving the drug that can end a pregnancy up
to seven weeks after contraception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be inclined not to accept that ruling by the FDA. It's
abortion,'' said Bush, but he refused to say whether a Bush
administration would rescind RU-486 authorization. ``That's too
hypothetical.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would appoint ``strict constructionists'' to the
Supreme Court, justices who would not use the Constitution to
legislate. Bush said Forbes does not understand his record as Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a pro-life governor,'' Bush said. ``I've got a
record of adoption, promoted adoptions in the state of Texas,
signed a parental notification law, promoted abstinence education.
I've got a good strong record.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush grew testy when reporters asked him whether members of his
family agree with his abortion views. He said he could not remember
the last time he discussed the issue with his mother, former first
lady Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he discussed the opposition of one of his
daughters to his support for the death penalty outlined in his
autobiography, he refused to say whether his twin 18-year-old
daughters backed him on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about my daughters' point of view. My
daughters are part of my private life,'' Bush said. ``That
(autobiography reference) is an example of something, but I'm not
going to talk about my daughters in the course of the campaign. I
appreciate you respecting their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would tell a friend who became pregnant by rape,
Bush said, ``That's up to her.'' Bush supports abortion rights in
cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a major lead in Iowa public opinion polls, and he is
predicting that he will break Bob Dole's 1988 record by getting
more than 37 percent of the turnout Monday. But he admitted that
overconfidence among his supporters could leave him with a
``less-than-expectations'' finish if they do not show up at their
caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes victory does not mean victory. I hope it does in my
case,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been pushing hard to win the support of social
conservatives, who in past elections have distrusted the sincerity
of his father, former President Bush, on their issues.
</P>
<P>
   At least some are sold on the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the scandals that have been going on, we know that won't
happen with him,'' said Coletta Ivy, 47 of Dubuque, Iowa. ``It's
his morals, honey.''
</P>
<P>
   One flier that Bush is distributing in Iowa plays to social
conservatives by indirectly criticizing President Clinton's sex
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A champion for families...'' the Bush flier declares above a
photograph of Bush walking down a street with his wife, Laura.
``who will restore dignity and honor to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter inside the flier, Bush speaks of his religious
faith as a foundation for his politics, noting his personal
relationship with Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith frees me; frees me to put the problems of the moment
improper perspective; frees me to make decisions that others might
not like,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The flier touts support from the National Right to Life
Committee and the fact that National Abortion Rights Action League
``is already attacking him in TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a Des Moines citizen-question session at the Principal
Financial Group, Bush refused to be drawn into an in-depth
criticism of Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent is not going to be the president. My opponent, if
I am the nominee,and I'm taking nothing for granted, either one of
the two Democrats,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, like a lot of people, was embarrassed for our country, but
it's time to get over that embarrassment and head to the 21st
century carrying a positive message that is hopeful and
optimistic,'' Bush said.

WEEKEND EXCURSION: TO SCHUSS, TO SHOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Addresses, hours and other information at end of 2nd take.)

<P>
   Zermatt it's not. It's not Vail or even Stratton, its tonier
neighbor in the Green Mountains of southern Vermont. But Bromley, a
four-hour drive north of New York City, offers congenial family
skiing and snowboarding with a bonus: proximity to the outlet mecca
of Manchester Center with its designer shops of discounted Giorgio
Armani, Calvin Klein, Gianni Versace, Dansk, Godiva and other
haut-branded fashions, housewares and edibles. In short, all the
makings for a perfect ``ski 'n' shop'' excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, aside from flying down a snow-slick hill
with long slippery things on your feet, is all too clear. Combining
the already luxe sport of skiing with recreational shopping a mere
six miles away is really asking for it. And trying to placate an
antsy, ski-blitzed child while combing the racks for bargains is a
double-diamond challenge all its own. I suspected we had gone too
far when, during our second foray to the shops after a morning on
the slopes, our 9-year-old daughter, Sophie, inquired from the back
seat, ``Is Kenneth Cole alive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' my wife, Debbie, answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Calvin Klein alive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Cole Haan alive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cole Haan isn't a person, dear, it's a store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Anne Klein alive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. She's not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Calvin Klein related to Anne Klein?'' I couldn't stand it.
``Stop!'' I yelled. ``What does it matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Even for die-hard skiers and shoppers, the trip to Bromley
requires an extended weekend, especially factoring in worthwhile
stops en route like Bennington's Potters Yard and the Bennington
Museum, which displays the largest public collection of works by
Grandma Moses in an 1834 schoolhouse she once attended.
</P>
<P>
   We took four days, beginning on Christmas, that we had arranged
weeks earlier fully confident that the season would see Vermont
cloaked in winter white. Alas, there was no snow, dooming Debbie's
hopes of cross-country skiing. But as we pulled up to the base of
Bromley Mountain (elevation: 3,284 feet) on Route 11 in Peru, we
were relieved to see lifts running and the trails afluff with
man-made powder.
</P>
<P>
   After research on the Internet, we had booked three nights at
the Alpinish-looking Bromley Sun Lodge with convenient
ski-in/ski-out accessibility at a premium holiday rate of $219 a
night plus tax, including buffet breakfast. At our first view of
the pitch-roofed inn with its wooden balconies, we congratulated
ourselves, delighting, too, in the cozy lobby with a blazing hearth
and lounge with pool table. But our spirits sank as we loaded our
luggage onto a cart and made our way down a forlorn hall that cried
out for spiffing up.
</P>
<P>
   Our patio level room was a lackluster motel unit with
coral-patterned wallpaper plastered bumpily over textured stucco
walls, two less-than-firm double beds, dim lights, including an
impromptu hanging lamp, a clothes rod, a bureau with drawers that
fell out when you opened them (nice comic touch, that), a
temperamental toilet and miserable television reception. But the
room was clean, and behind a curtain, a sliding rear door opened to
crisp air and refreshing vistas of cottony slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to salvage the afternoon for skiing, we walked the few
steps to the Bromley base lodge, where we rented skis, boots and
poles and bought half-day lift tickets, available on weekend and
holiday afternoons. The holiday had kept the crowds down, so there
were no lines at the counters and no lines outside for the lifts.
We started tentatively on some of the easier runs and soon were
taking the swift quadruple chair to the wind-blown summit, which
offered one particularly easy descent for a fervent snowplower like
Sophie, who often beat me down to the bottom, zigzagging around
nonplussed snow-boarders.
</P>
<P>
   We took a couple of warming breaks in the base lodge, which
offered a congested cafeteria and the rather quieter Wild Boar
Tavern and deli, the requisite cheery fireplace and a well-stocked
ski shop. When the sun dipped behind the mountain, we skied over to
the Sun Lodge and stowed our gear in a convenient storage room.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Lodge advertised an indoor heated pool, and Sophie
couldn't wait to take a dip before dinner. Well, there was a pool
and it was heated, or, rather, warmed, but in the phosphorescent
gloom of weak lighting it looked decidedly uninviting. Clammy used
towels scattered over some of the chairs didn't add to the allure.
But several families were splashing around in the shallow water,
and we joined in, Sophie warily avoiding a far corner enveloped in
dark shadows. Outside the windows, the lights glistened merrily off
the remade snow.
</P>
<P>
   Passing up dinner at the hotel, we had made reservations for an
extravagant holiday buffet ($50 per adult and $22 for children) at
the Equinox, the renowned 230-year-old resort and spa on 2,300
acres in Manchester Village, which among others things, offers
schools for off-road Land Rover driving and falconry.
</P>
<P>
   Driving on-road in a Buick from Avis (and darned, if we hadn't
left our falcon at home), we made the Equinox in about 15 minutes,
scouting, as we whizzed past, Mikasa, J. Crew, Escada, Baccarat,
Donna Karan, Orvis and many of the other outlets on Routes 11 and
30 and 7A that we were determined to explore later.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the white-columned Equinox, we stepped into a Ralph
Lauren world of burnished wood, crackling fireplaces, swagged
drapes and trophy cases, a veritable Yankee Versailles. In a nook
by a fire, two girls in black velvet dresses and red hair were
getting their portraits drawn.
</P>
<P>
   We were seated in the Colonnade Room, a confection of maroon
Wedgwood and cut-glass chandeliers where a pianist serenaded, and
left to forage among the Lucullan splendor: tureens of shrimp
bisque and eggnog soup, platters of snow crab legs, raw oysters and
unpeeled shrimp on beds of seaweed, breads, fruit, pates, cold
cuts, chafing dishes of salmon with creamed oysters, spinach
ravioli, roast turkey, goose with red cabbage and a carving block
with sliced prime rib.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie returned to the table with a croissant, a $22 croissant.
We made her go back for some turkey, if only in armament against
the onslaught of desserts: pies, cakes, cookies, fudge, cherries,
kumquats, warm trifles and mint chocolate puddings.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like a big evening feast to stimulate a
morning's appetite, and by breakfast we were ready for our own
hotel's substantial buffet: scrambled eggs and bacon, potatoes,
French toast, pancakes, melon, grapefruit, muffins, juice and
coffee. Fortified, we returned to the gear room, donned our boots
and headed to the lifts, which were once again blessedly free of
crowds. By midday we had made over a dozen runs and burned the
excess calories.

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Battling overwhelming poll numbers and his
own comments dismissive of the upcoming Iowa caucuses, former Sen.
Bill Bradley put a brighter face on his presidential campaign
Thursday, saying he is ``upbeat'' about his chances here against
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley campaign leaders in 1,000 of 2,100 election
precincts holding caucuses Monday night, ``the real question is who
will actually show up,'' the candidate told reporters. ``We're
feeling good about what we've accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey has been dogged by polls
showing he trails Gore by 20 points in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself sought to lower expectations this week by saying
he would feel good if he captured 31 percent of the Democratic
caucus vote _ the same result Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
achieved in his 1980 bid against President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went a step further Wednesday evening in New Hampshire,
where he is running even with or ahead of Gore, calling Iowa ``a
state that rewards entrenched power.'' Talking to reporters after a
meeting Thursday with some 100 senior citizens at a swing-era dance
hall, Bradley reiterated how he believed ``entrenched power'' is
``what we're dealing with'' in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Gore enjoys the support of most prominent Democrats in the
state, including Sen. Tom Harkin, as well as organized labor. With
100,000 members _ about half of them registered Democrats _ labor
could bring out as much as a tenth of the total Democrat vote on
caucus night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments about ``entrenched power'' suggested he was
blowing off the Iowa caucuses, a process in which each party holds
precinct-by-precinct meetings for the purpose of selecting a
presidential nominee. The caucus votes are several steps removed
from the actual delegate-selection process in Iowa, but they have
symbolic value as the first voting exercise in the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire holds the nation's first primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley went out of his way to deny he intended any disrespect
for the Iowa caucuses. ``The reason I'm in the Iowa caucuses is
that I respect the people of Iowa,'' Bradley said. ``And the reason
I've been here 30, 35 times is that I respect the people of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering Gore's support among union leaders and the party
establishment will require some luck and skill in bringing out
``people who have not been a part of the process before,'' Bradley
said. ``Hopefully (they) are going to turn out for caucuses. I'm
upbeat about this, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said some Iowa voters ``might have been swayed'' by Gore
television ads characterizing Bradley's $55-billion-to-$65-billion
health plan as too costly and dangerous to poor families. ``But
we're countering that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley said, he has no illusions about Gore's power. The
vice president spent Thursday campaigning in western Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that when somebody has support of the president
of the United States ... as well as most Democratic Party
fund-raisers, has the backing of the leadership of organized labor
and rides on Air Force 2, that's entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to New Hampshire where he is doing much better against
Gore, Iowa is ``a bigger state (with) more media markets (where
I'm) not as well known,'' Bradley said. We used to think it a great
success if we got 10, 11 people in a room. Now we're getting much
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so senior citizens who turned out to see Bradley at
the classic Val Air Ballroom are a key ingredient in Bradley's
strategy. Many younger Iowans have gone elsewhere for jobs and
opportunity, leaving the state's population grayer than average.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired Persons, which
sponsored the Thursday meeting with Bradley, only Florida,
Pennsylvania and Arizona have more people age 50 and over.
</P>
<P>
   And senior citizens are politically active. According to AARP,
with 360,000 members in Iowa, 60 percent of senior citizens turn
out for the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared at ease before the group, cracking a joke about
a New Jersey diner and employing many of his stock lines, such as
his desire to be president in ``a world of new possibilities guided
by goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare, a key issue to seniors, Bradley said the federal
health benefit for the elderly is fiscally sound until 2015 at the
earliest, and that future economic growth may extend the system's
life without federal support.
</P>
<P>
   He called Social Security a ``sacred trust'' and ``the most
successful government program in our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as president, he would not include the Social
Security trust fund in the overall federal budget, as the
government has done every year since 1967. Over the next 10 years,
he would pump $2 trillion into it to ensure its solvency for at
least 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended his health plan as bold and visionary while
charging that Gore's more modest approach ``nibbles around the
edges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said ``I'm convinced we're at a time in our history now
where this economic growth (will) give us enormous possibilities,
but if you are not bold you will not be able to use those
possibilities to achieve your objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Bradley's plan, the health insurance program for federal
employees would be expanded to include non-government workers and
the poor would receive subsidized health coverage. People with a
major illness and inadequate insurance coverage also would be
eligible for federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, the Clinton administration's health insurance
program for children would be expanded to include parents, and it
would be opened to children in families closer to the middle-income
range.
</P>
<P>
   Health care was not uppermost in the minds of all those who
listened to Bradley. ``I think he shows a leadership ability and a
moral fiber which I need to have in my next president,'' said Peggy
Patrick, 76, a retired art gallery administrator who spent a year
in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone. ``If he turns in a respectable
showing here, it will help him in other states.''

 UNDATED: excess calories.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we were ready to exercise something else: our American
Express cards. Stop one in Manchester Center was the Giorgio Armani
General Store, where on a previous visit some years ago I had
picked up a lightweight wool tan patterned sports jacket for under
$300, less than half price. Now, post-Christmas, the stock looked
pretty well picked over. There were a few navy suits in my size,
half off at $1,000, shirts for around $50 and some ties as low as
$15 _ 75 percent off. Debbie considered a gray pantsuit, more than
half off at $800. But in the end, goaded by Sophie, who was
impatient to assault the Levi's outlet across the corridor, we
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Brooks Brothers was selling shirts for $42 and ties
for $24 with any second item half-price. We also surveyed J.
Peterman, where clothing, housewares and shaving supplies were 25
percent off; Versace, where some rakish high-button suits were
going for about $500; and Eastern Mountain Sports, where we made
our first score: a green knitted hat for Sophie for $10, a third of
what we later saw it priced at in the Bromley ski shop.
</P>
<P>
   In Donna Karan on Route 7A South, Debbie picked out a pair of
gray slacks for $112, well off the already discounted price of
$159. In the nearby Garnet Hill shop, I succumbed to a pair of
Italian leather hiking boots for $127 ($240 in the catalog) while
Debbie bought a set of flannel bedding including duvet cover for
$84.
</P>
<P>
   We reconnoitered at adjoining Cole Haan, where leatherware,
shoes and particularly boots were substantially marked down; nearby
Dansk, where we searched in vain for some fluted glasses to
supplement a set at home; and the Seiko Co. Store, where some
self-winding watches were temptingly going for substantial
reductions below the already discounted $119 price.
</P>
<P>
   We had made reservations for dinner at another locally
recommended restaurant, Johnny Seesaw's, a quarter-mile west of
Bromley on Route 11.
</P>
<P>
   A log roadhouse remodeled in 1938 as one of the first ski lodges
in the East, it came with its own colorful legend going back to its
origins in the 1920s as the moonshine retreat of a Russian logger,
Ivan Sesow. In more recent times, it played host to annual reunions
of famous Yalies, including President Gerald Ford, Cyrus R. Vance
and Potter Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   From its look, it might still have been a Prohibition hideaway
with its ``sin cabins'' out back and a brawny circular fire pit
dominating the room of couches and rustic tables. ``I want to eat
there,'' said Sophie, pointing to a couch.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Gary Okun, tactfully steered us in another direction.
``I have an even better table,'' he said, seating us by an aquarium
with tropical fish and positioning me with a lady on each hand _
``the thorn between two roses,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for our onion soup, salad, scallops and veal piccata,
Sophie let out a groan. ``There's nothing to do,'' she said,
jumping up to get her Game Boy from the pocket of her coat in the
vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the mountain as usual the next morning, with crowds now
starting to build, I persuaded Sophie to take a group lesson while
I set out solo and Debbie did some reading in the lodge. When the
class returned, the ski instructor looked grave. ``She doesn't turn
enough,'' she said. ``She goes down too fast.'' Sophie, however,
was beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring it was time to quit while we were ahead, not to say
intact, we doffed and stowed our skis and returned to town for a
last run at the stores and a lunch of soup and salad at the Buttery
in the Jelly Mill, a foodstuff and kitchenware shop on Route 7A,
where Sophie replenished her candy supply.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner that night we scouted out another historic hostelry,
Mark Anthony's Ye Olde Tavern, dating from 1790, on Route 7A in
Manchester Village. We ate tasty smoked trout and gravy-smothered
pot roast by a roaring fire and sipped drinks out of canning jars.
</P>
<P>
   Returning our ski gear the next morning in the Bromley base
lodge proved far more chaotic than getting it. With a horde of
holiday-week schussers checking out equipment, hapless checkers-in
like us were consigned to ski-rental hell. We finally pressed the
skis, boots and poles and receipt on a harried clerk and fled. We
had to get going. There were a few last stores to hit.

NFL TESTS SENIORS ON MORE THAN SKILLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TOMMY DEAS   
 The Tuscaloosa (Ala.) News   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Every day in practice this week, college
football's elite are tested in every phase of the game on the
Senior Bowl practice fields to see if their skills will make the
grade in the NFL:
</P>
<P>
   _ Blocking and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Throwing and catching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading and reacting.
</P>
<P>
   But before they step on the field at Ladd-Peebles Stadium for
Saturday's 1:30 p.m. game, however, the 120-plus players selected
for the 51st all-star classic will have been subjected to a battery
of off-the-field tests that may be just as important in deciding
their professional futures:
</P>
<P>
   _ Intelligence tests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Personality profiles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Psychological probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing us,'' said Alabama offensive tackle Chris
Samuels, who is taking part in the testing and other activities but
will miss the game with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the practice field and team meetings, players don't
have much time for leisure activity. They're too busy taking tests
that NFL teams use to decide who they will consider for April's NFL
draft.
</P>
<P>
   On the practice field, teams learn about football talent.
Through the off-the-field tests, they try to determine who will
best be able to master playbooks that number hundreds of pages.
They also want to learn in advance what kind of problems they may
encounter, so they can avoid drafting the next Rae Carruth or
Lawrence Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams put more stock in tests than others. There's nothing
new to the process, but it seems to get more intricate every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's gone on for years,'' said Carolina
Panthers head coach George Seifert, who is coaching the North
squad. ``You just see and hear more about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunther Cunningham, head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs, would
rather rely on what he can learn through direct contact with
players as head coach of the South squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the ability to coach in the Senior Bowl is as valuable
a tool as there is,'' he said. ``You can't get that through
psychological testing or any other kind of workout. You live with
the players for a week. You get to know them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this testing, who creates those tests? What are they
designed to learn? How reliable are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the tests are of the mental variety. The first
official event of the Senior Bowl is the weigh-in, where players
are measured fingertip-to-fingertip and head-to-toe. They then
strip to their underwear and parade in front of hundreds of NFL
coaches and scouts eager to see their physiques without pads and
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now you know what it's like to be a swimsuit model,'' said
North quarterback Giovanni Carmazzi of Hofstra. ``I don't think
there's many swimsuit models in this bunch. It's awkward. It's a
little bit weird. ``
</P>
<P>
   Players find some of the written tests just as perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn lineman Jeno James went through most of the tests
preparing for the Blue-Gray game, so he got a preview of what to
expect. He took more than a dozen tests in the week before that
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are true-false,'' he said. ``Some of them are
multiple choice. Some of the questions they give you are like, `If
a tree falls in the forest, do you hear it?' You wonder where some
of these questions come from.''
</P>
<P>
   The players go along whether or not they understand the reasons
for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the tests, I guess I know what they're doing,''
Samuels said. ``They're trying to find out about who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the questions, I think, are silly. `Are you
good-looking?,' `Do you feel attractive?' stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another test is even more perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to see how fast we could recite a couple of lines of
words,'' Alabama wideout Shamari Buchanan said. ``The words were
all colors and they were all a certain color. The word `r-e-d' was
spelled out in yellow, and so on. There were about seven words per
line and about 14 or 15 lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back, we had to recite the color they were
spelled out in. It was very funny just to listen to the other guys.
That's the test everybody was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham will have access to a lot of testing data before the
draft, but he'll probably rely on personal observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You develop personal relationships I wouldn't ever trade,'' he
said. Instead of spending money on tests, he said, ``we ought to
have about 18 of these games a year. Then you'd really know the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they think of the actual tests, players agree that
they're happy to take them. They understand it's part of the
process of making it to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather for them to want me to take the test,'' Samuels
said, ``than for them not to want me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Alabama running back Shaun Alexander: ``They ask us
questions and we answer them. It's just a long process. That's
about it. I guess they should if they're going to pay you all that
money.''

`BODIES OF RESISTANCE': ART   WITH EMOTIONAL WEIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Britain, South Africa, Nigeria)   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of American art at the end of the 20th century is at
least in part the history of AIDS. Many artists died of the
disease. Its presence shaped the image of the human body as a
potent and volatile cultural emblem. Art played an aggressive role
in battering away at the politics of denial that surrounded the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, AIDS went all but unmentioned in the recent
rash of retrospectives. One reason is simply that, with the
successful use of expensive palliative drugs since the late 1990s,
the disease has lost its aura of emergency for middle-class whites
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the case, however, for the rest of the world, where
the devastation from AIDS has assumed hurricane force. In the
United States more than half of recently reported HIV infections
were among blacks, who constitute only around 12 percent of the
population. Last week the United Nations confirmed that some 70
percent of HIV and AIDS cases worldwide were concentrated in
Africa, with one of four adults infected in some countries.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the emotional weight of these figures finds its
way into ``Bodies of Resistance,'' an exhibition at Real Art Ways
in Hartford, Conn. The exhibit was organized by Visual AIDS under
the curatorial hand of Barbara Hunt. Timed to coincide with the
eighth international AIDS conference that opened in South Africa in
December, the show draws together 17 artists of different
generations and cultural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work in the show (including a temporary outdoor
performance-based piece by Steed Taylor) was commissioned for the
occasion, which is a chancy way to go. Despite some unevenness and
the problems of focus built into loosely defined group endeavors,
the results feel individually thought through and collectively
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Although AIDS is the underlying theme, most of the work is
metaphorically fluid rather than issue-specific, which was not
necessarily the case in similar exhibitions a decade ago. Still,
certain motifs are constants, and one is the body: present or
absent, attractive or repellent, debilitated or empowered.
</P>
<P>
   It assumes grotesque forms in the computer-manipulated
photographs of human skin by the artist team Aziz and Cucher and in
sardonic ``Fantasia''-like cartoon scenarios fastidiously rendered
by the painter Thomas Woodruff. A sense of physical vulnerability
is generally pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case in Ernesto Pujol's photographs titled
``Gulliver's Dream,'' close-ups of a bound nude man in which we
cannot know whether the man has been bound for pleasure or
punishment. Threatened violence is made real in Charles LeDray's
``Patrick,'' a doll-size set of workman's clothes (the uniform of
an auto mechanic, maybe, or a deliveryman), fastidiously
hand-stitched but shredded to tatters below the waist.
</P>
<P>
   The human presence is only implied in a beautiful abstract piece
by Chuck Nanney in which hundreds of tiny cutout and painted canvas
circles wind across the gallery wall like human cells on the loose.
The same is true in Ken Chu's installation of shattered Chinese
plates neatly arranged on table-size mounds of earth, as if a
family picnic were about to take place in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Uninhabited space assumes a life of its own in Albert J. Winn's
photographs of deserted American-Jewish summer camps where
ramshackle bunks and empty lockers are eerily reminiscent of
internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural forms are the basis for two contributions by Rina
Banjerjee, an Indian-born New York artist who will be in the coming
Whitney Biennial. In one, she has drawn figures of Indian goddesses
over blueprints of ventilation systems at Columbia University's
Center for Disease Prevention. (A hand-printed collage piece by
Nancy Spero in the exhibition similarly invokes female figures as
healers.) In the other work, a corner installation, a gilded Hindu
home altar shaped like a house is invaded by sinister-looking
sari-wrapped tubes, leaving the question open as to what kind of
energy is being pumped into or out of the domestic shrine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's few entirely nonfigurative pieces, ``Untitled
(T.W.) Virus,'' by the South African artist Kendell Geers, is also
one of its more intriguing. A six-foot-square Pandora's box
entirely wrapped in red-and-white caution tape, it feels at once
threatening and magnetic precisely because it conceals its possibly
lethal contents.
</P>
<P>
   Tension produced by information withheld also enlivens the
multipart installation titled ``(Mis)communication'' by Oladele
Ajiboye Bamboye, a Nigerian-born artist living in London who will
make his New York solo debut at Thomas Erben Gallery this spring. A
video of what looks like visual static, with figures occasionally
surfacing, plays in the gallery. It was produced by a camera
trained on a hotel room television tuned to a scrambled paid-view
pornography channel.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of voyeurism is further complicated by the continuous
Internet broadcast of a live image of the gallery itself, along
with the video and any visitors who wander in. With this electronic
layering, two politically loaded concepts associated with AIDS _
transmission and surveillance _ are evoked without any mention of
the disease itself.
</P>
<P>
   Other entries in the show are less oblique in their approach.
Skowmon Hastanan, in a small, powerful, no-nonsense installation,
addresses the issue of Western sexual tourism in Thailand.
Photographs by Sunil Gupta pair images of his own AIDS treatment
with shots of gay clubs in London. (These pictures, along with
others by Gupta, can also be seen at Admit One Gallery through
Saturday..)
</P>
<P>
   The New York artist Barton Lidice Benes deals directly with
physical traces of the disease in the context of gay culture. His
pigeonholed ``Art Reliquarium,'' one of many such pieces he has
made, holds, among other things, a swatch of a St. Marks Baths
bathrobe, circa 1971; funerary ashes; and a coil of the red ribbon
used to make the first batch of AIDS lapel insignia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The original Ribbon Project, sponsored by Visual AIDS, was
conceived by the artist Frank Moore, whose painting ``Release'' is
one of the highlights of the show. The work was made under great
stress. Moore, who has been battling AIDS for years, experienced a
significant dip in health last year. (He has since rebounded.)
</P>
<P>
   Walking in the woods near his home in Deposit, N.Y., at the time
of his setback, he saw plants growing from a rotting fallen tree,
and this image, with some adjustments, inspired the picture. The
tree has become his bare arm, stretched impossibly long. Bleeding
sores and lesions are turned into miniature ecosystems of plant and
insect life. His hand springs open to release a cloud of
butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of the best art that has emerged in response to AIDS,
Moore's operates on many levels, political, metaphorical and
personal. This is true, in varied ways, of all the work here, most
of which operates beyond the polemical content and essentializing
ideas of illness, sexuality and social activism prevalent (though
by no means universal) a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is important to remember that history; much still proceeds
from it. The psychic experience of AIDS has long since infiltrated
the bloodstream of American culture. In all kinds of indirect ways
it filters into new work, and it will continue to be an active
component, both as stimulant and depressant, in a contemporary art
world that has recently found global extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Art itself, piece by piece, does not effect change. Art is what
it is: a Babel of visual data and disparate things trailing price
tags and promises, dogmas and ego, taking up space and gathering
dust.
</P>
<P>
   But the spirit of resistance generated by art as a creative
phenomenon, however overt or subtle, is a secret weapon of immense
and long-acting power.

 &HT;    Delta adds $20 gas surcharge
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even though it has avoided the brunt of jet fuel price
hikes so far, Delta Air Lines joined an industry move to add a $20
fuel surcharge to most domestic round-trip bookings.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after fourth-quarter profits at Delta and other
carriers dropped because of higher fuel costs, driven by rising oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Continental initiated the surcharge, and on Thursday, Delta and
Northwest joined United and American in matching. Delta's fee took
effect immediately and is included in published fares, though it is
technically a separate charge.
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers are applying the surcharge to travel starting
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Airways, Delta's primary rival in Atlanta, said it has
no plans to add the surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has been hurt less than other airlines by rising fuel
prices. It is buying most of its fuel under purchasing contracts
negotiated when prices were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of short-term economics, it's clearly disingenuous to
tack on a surcharge given their very effective fuel hedging
program,'' said PaineWebber analyst Sam Buttrick. ``But let's face
it, the average consumer has little insight into hedging programs.
All they hear is that fuel's gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   In its quarterly profit report, Delta said it paid an average of
53.6 cents a gallon for fuel, up 2 cents from a year earlier _ far
less than the increases at other carriers whose hedging contracts
weren't as well timed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Delta's contracts run out later this year, but the
airline said in its profit report that they will ``continue to
limit jet fuel price volatility in fiscal 2000,'' which ends June
30.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the surcharge ``is not solely
related to fuel expenses.'' Asked what other factors prompted it,
he cited ``other costs'' but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick said Delta is simply taking advantage of the chance to
reap the benefits of a price hike advanced by other carriers. But
he noted that generalized increases prod travelers to shop harder
for deals, so the effect on average fares paid is often less than
carriers hope.
</P>
<P>
   The surcharge is the first of its kind since the early 1990s,
when the Gulf War drove jet fuel prices to more than $1 a gallon
and sent airline profits into a tailspin for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The recent run-up in fuel prices has fogged profit forecasts for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick expects major airlines to collectively post flat or
reduced profits in the first and second quarters, then resume
profit growth in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's entirely conditioned on a retreat in fuel prices,'' he
added. Fuel is the second-highest expense at most airlines, after
labor.

 &HT;    Southern Co. '99 earnings set record
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. met Wall Street expectations Thursday by
reporting fourth-quarter net income of $123 million, after $20
million in one-time expenses, and wrapped up 1999 with record
yearly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Southern reported net income of $1.28 billion, or $1.86 per
share, for 1999, compared with $977 million, or $1.40 per share,
for 1998. Revenue was $11.59 billion, an increase from $11.4
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Income from operations, which excludes one-time items and is
closely watched on Wall Street, was $1.90 per share. That was an 8
percent increase from $1.76 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg, chairman and chief executive, said the
company exceeded its internal financial target of $1.85 earnings
per share and reached its target of 8 percent growth ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We delivered,'' Dahberg said, expressing hope that investors
will reward the company by boosting its launguishing stock price.
``I believe we are well-positioned to continue our success through
2000 and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to earn $2.05 a share this year, another 8
percent increase, said Allen Leverett, vice president of financial
planning and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg noted that Southern Energy Inc., the subsidiary that
runs international operations and unregulated U.S. businesses,
accounted for $328 million, or 26 percent, of Southern's 1999
bottom line. Despite economic turmoil in Asia, a 150 percent
increase in profits from that region accounted for 14 percent of
the parent company's profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said fourth-quarter net income of $123 million, or 19
cents per share, compared with a loss of $52 million, or 8 cents,
for the 1998 fourth quarter, when the company took $200 million in
write-down for underperforming South American investments.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.62 billion, compared with
$2.54 billion for the 1998 comparable period.
</P>
<P>
   Results for the quarter included a one-time $34 million charge
for work force reductions at Berliner Kraft und Licht, the Berlin
utility in which Southern has a 26 percent stake. That was offset
by a one-time $14 million gain from an insurance settlement from an
explosion and fire at the company's power plant in Hammond, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter earnings from operations _ which exclude the
one-time items _ totaled $143 million, or 22 cents per share. That
was a 24 percent decline from $188 million, or 27 cents per share,
reported for the 1998 fourth quarter. The decline was attributed
mostly to accounting changes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had marked down
their average forecast for quarterly operating income from 28 cents
a share to 22 cents following an October warning from Southern that
fourth-quarter profit would be less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Southern attributed that decline Thursday mostly to new
accounting procedures for accelerated depreciation on power plants
that were part of Georgia Pwer Co.'s 1998 rate settlement with the
Public Service Commission. Southern also cited a shift in
operations and maintenance expenditures last year to the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Southern shares closed Thursday at $23.81 1/4, down 12 1/2
cents.

WINE SURVIVES STORMS IN BORDEAUX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN BUCKLEY   WineToday.com   c.2000 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Bordeaux landmarks took a beating in the
region's worst storms of the 20th century, but vintners report
little wine was lost when 120-mph winds roared across Europe last
month.
</P>
<P>
   At Chateau Lafite Rothschild in the Medoc, winds snapped a
majestic cedar tree that stands tall on the label of the grand
estate. In Pomerol, the legendary ``Le Pin'' is now le matchstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The famous tree is stripped with just one lone branch left
dangling _ luckily Jacques planted a second one a couple years ago
so we will have to rely on that,'' said Fiona Morrison Thienpont,
wife of Chateau Le Pin proprietor Jacques Thienpont.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau owners report scant damage to wines in cellars and
vines, though building damage is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The storms hit over the Christmas holidays and New Year revelers
celebrated by candlelight with bottled water and wine served to
heavily bundled guests huddled before massive hearths, the only
heat in the 17th, 18th and 19th century stone estates.
</P>
<P>
   At Chateau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac,
the estate became an impromptu dormitory during a week without
power, water or telephone. Though normally an elegant museum piece
with rooms restored to a 1850s style, the chateau supplied the only
light for miles.
</P>
<P>
   At Chateau Pontet-Canet, ``the park looks like it was bombed,
most of the great cedars are on the ground'' said Pauillac neighbor
Jean-Michel Cazes, whose properties were also damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Cazes family sustained roof damage to fermentation vat
buildings. Chateau Pichon Longueville, Chateau Ormes, Chateau
Cantenac-Brown and the Michel Lynch brand warehouse _ estates that
Cazes manages for the giant AXA insurance company _ also sustained
serious, but reparable, building damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disaster can be seen in the park where the damages are
heartbreaking,'' Cazes said of Cantenac-Brown. ``An impressive
number of trees fell and, unfortunately, among them, several big
beautiful cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away in Saint-Julien, only a few trees surrounding
Chateau Talbot survived; the landscape has totally changed.
Historically, fir trees were planted around the chateaux to protect
them from wind and to soften the barren winter landscape of the
vast Medoc vineyards. Many of the trees were more than 100 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   A few wine cellars were flooded in the Blaye region when dikes
broke, threatening the core of a nuclear reactor across the Gironde
river from Pauillac in the Medoc. Vineyards, dormant at this time
of year, were unscathed except in isolated patches where trees fell
onto vines or where flood water damaged trellises.
</P>
<P>
   In central Bordeaux, stone parapets fell from the towers of the
Cathedral of St. Andre, the city's central park sustained severe
tree damage and some flooding was reported, but within days the
streets had returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The storms hit hardest from the northern reaches of the Medoc,
felling hundreds of thousands of fir trees from beachside Lacanau,
site of the summer European surfing championships, through the
Cognac region and into the massive central forests of France.
Cognac distillation came to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees were flung into the alambic stills.'' said a spokeswoman
for the Pineau de Charentes wine bureau. ``With no electricity, we
had to stop distillation.''
</P>
<P>
   This is normally the most active time for distilleries, as all
wine destined to become cognac from the 1999 white grape harvest
must be distilled by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hine &AMP; Co. in Cognac reported building damage as a result
of falling trees, but its parent firm, Hennessy escaped with just
one tree down and no building damage, according to a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Various regions were without electricity, water and telephone
for one to three weeks. Utilities have just returned to normal in
Cognac, the world's largest white-wine production center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that 40 percent of French forests were
toppled as a result of the storms. The French government last week
issued an emergency Europe-wide plea for forestry and plant nursery
experts to assist with clearing and replanting.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of chateaux in the Medoc, Sauternes, Graves, Pomerol,
Saint-Emilion and throughout the region report roof, building and
parkland damage. No official estimate of chateaux damage is being
compiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``People dare not complain too much. They say that compared to
the rest of the people who lost everything _ and even lives _ I am
very lucky,'' said Florence Raffard, spokeswoman for the Bordeaux
Wine Bureau and tourism center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are meeting to assess how tourism will be affected.
Some forests will be off-limits and campgrounds will be closed in
many regions of France.
</P>
<P>
   Some chateaux tours have been halted or limited until cleanup
and repairs are completed. For the visitor to Bordeaux, the main
difference will be in the suddenly open vistas from the steps of
the chateaux. The wine will remain the same.

IN MAKEOVER OF HOUSE OF LORDS, PANEL WANTS SOME ELECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The House of Lords should include, for the first time
in history, some members who have been elected by the British
public, a commission studying the future of the Lords recommended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission stopped well short of suggesting that the
chamber be wholly elected, saying that the vast majority of its
members should be appointed by a special board that would be free
of political control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure that the reformed second chamber will no
longer be a source of political patronage,'' said Lord Wakeham,
chairman of the Royal Commission on the Reform of the House of
Lords, presenting a fat report filled with proposals at a news
conference Thursday morning. ``The prime minister will no longer be
able to control the size, political balance or individual
membership of the second chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords has been existing in a strange holding
pattern since November, when Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
government ended hundreds of years of history by removing the right
of hundreds of hereditary peers, whose titles pass from generation
to generation, to sit and vote in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Lords has been made up of 92 hereditaries, as
they are called, and 544 life peers, appointed over the years by
the government in power at the time, who hold their seats, and
their titles, until they die.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been particularly satisfied with this interim
arrangement: not the Labor Party, which wants all the hereditaries
gone for good; not the Conservative Party, which saw much of its
power leave along with the hereditaries, and not the peers
themselves, who know they are living on borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of what to do now with Parliament's upper
house, a historically powerful body that was stripped of most of
its authority nearly 100 years ago, has proved a troublesome one
for Blair. He is not eager for a reconstituted house to have
increased responsibilities and power that can challenge his
political sway.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposals by Lord Wakeham's 12-member committee seek to
alter the Lords without effecting particularly radical changes.
According to the report, a small percentage of Lords _ either 65,
87, or 195 people, depending on various models it sets out _ should
be elected from among regular Britons in various regions. The rest
of the members should be appointed by an independent commission,
with 20 percent of them to have no party affiliation and at least
30 percent to be women.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber would still include church representatives. But in
an effort to reflect Britain's changing demographics, some of the
current ones, who are all Anglicans, would be replaced by
non-Anglican Christians and five would be added from non-Christian
religions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, no one would become a member of the Lords
because of heredity or because of an appointment by the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new second chamber should bring a far wider range of
experience and expertise to bear on the consideration of proposed
legislation and other policy issues,'' Lord Wakeham said. ``It's
members should come from all walks of life and be representatives
of the whole of British society.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, the new upper chamber would not have
substantially greater power than the old one, which is allowed to
delay legislation for up to a year but cannot kill it. But Lord
Wakeham said the Lords should be given a broader mandate to
scrutinize constitutional and human-rights legislation and to hold
the House of Commons to account in its handling of European Union
business.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN ALSO END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the proposals said that the commission had wasted a
one-time-only chance. ``People have been going on in this country
for decades about Parliament being too weak and too much power
residing in the executive,'' said Robert Blackburn, a professor of
constitutional law at King's College, London, who supports the
formation of a wholly elected second chamber with greater authority
over legislation. ``This would have been a great opportunity to
redress the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would study the report and then decide
whether to acton the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides a sound platform for moving forward on a genuine
cross-party basis,'' said Baroness Jay, the Labor leader of the
House of Lords, adding that the government would ``need time to
consider'' the substance of the report.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Conservative Party said that it doubted
whether Blair's government was committed to real reform at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much that they are going to want to take this
on,'' said Lord Strathclyde, the Tory leader in the House of Lords.
``They have got the house they want, a sort of crony house, and I
think that will continue for many years indeed.''

GENETIC DATA ON SPERM SUGGEST EARLY WOMEN HAD MANY SEX PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (bl) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A startling insight into the evolution of human mating behavior
has been extracted from DNA data generated by the federal human
genome project.
</P>
<P>
   The genes involved in sperm production have been evolving at a
much faster rate than most other human genes, according to a study
published Thursday in the journal Nature by Dr. Chung-I Wu and
colleagues at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The finding implies that, at least in the human evolutionary
past, women generally had many sexual partners, enough that the
males' sperm needed to compete with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of sperm competition is well known among humans'
closest living relatives, chimpanzees, as well as in humbler
creatures like fruit flies. Fruit fly sperm are positively toxic, a
chemical weaponry acquired because several males will mate with a
female, and the male fly whose sperm knocks out the rest has the
best chance of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the primate world, gorillas practice a harem system in which
one male controls access to many females. Presumably because males
can be sure of their paternity, gorillas do not need to produce
much sperm and so have small testicles.
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees, on the other hand, have huge testicles in relation
to their body size. Under the lax rules of the chimp mating system,
a female is likely to be inseminated several times, and males need
to deliver competitive volumes of ejaculate to have a serious
chance at paternity.
</P>
<P>
   Wu is an evolutionary biologist who studies male reproduction as
a driving force in creating new species. ``We have built up a
notion that what drives species apart is sexual selection in the
form of competition among males,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After testing this theory in fruit flies, Wu realized he could
explore it further in people because of the vast amount of DNA
information now building up in computer databanks as a result of
the human genome project, the federally sponsored effort to decode
the 3 billion-unit sequence of the human genetic playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a group of genes known to produce proteins involved in
male reproduction, Wu showed that they had evolved considerably
faster than other human genes.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues, Dr. Gerald Wyckoff and Dr. Wen Wang, then
looked at three genes involved specifically in sperm production.
Two of the genes make special DNA-packing materials called
protamines that govern the shape and size of the sperm. They found
that human protamine genes had evolved extremely rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the counterpart genes in other primates, the Chicago
biologists calculated that the protamine genes of chimpanzees had
evolved just as fast, but those of gorillas much more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In Wu's view, the finding strongly suggests, though does not yet
prove, that human sperm have needed to be competitive for the same
reason as chimpanzee sperm: they have to fight off rival sperm from
other males in the female reproductive tract. He believes his
findings apply not necessarily to today's world but certainly to
the period in which humans evolved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Bobbi Low, a biologist at the University of Michigan and
author of a new book on the evolution of human sexual behavior,
``Why Sex Matters'' (Princeton University Press), said the Chicago
biologists' work ``is fabulous for its connection of genetic
evidence on the intensity of sexual selection to things we already
knew from physical and behavioral data _ I'm really excited by
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Behavioral and biological evidence suggests that sexual
selection is an intense force on male primates, and that the
intensity might vary with the social system. This idea is
supported, Dr. Low said, by Wu's finding that gorillas, with their
harem system, have been under less evolutionary pressure than
humans and chimpanzees, which live in multimale groups.
</P>
<P>
   In chimpanzee societies, male chimps try to control access to a
small number of females, but not with complete success. Females
will often solicit sneak copulations with younger males outside
their group. Primatologists believe they may do this to buy
insurance for their children, because adult males are more
protective toward the children of females they have mated with.
``No male can completely control access to females all the time,
and that is the situation in which sperm competition arises,'' Low
said.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of human sexual behavior and social organization
is far from resolved, but Wu's work shows that DNA can speak to
matters on which fossils are mute. It suggests that men vied for
reproductive success at the level of sperm competition as well as
in other ways, and that in this respect human social and sexual
structure has been closer to the chimpanzee model than the gorilla
system.
</P>
<P>
   Most human groups, like those of chimpanzees, are multimale,
polygynous societies, in which males try to control females'
reproduction. ``Males are very clever about this,'' Low said,
noting that in most human societies the bride goes to live in the
husband's village, where the husband's relatives can watch her
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the constraints of the patrilocal system, women seem
to have been adept at making their own choices too, if the
implication from Wu's dig in the DNA databanks is correct.

DOT-COM IS ENVY OF THE NEW RICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, Jan. 27)  
(lh) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, we know that coveting your neighbor's wealth isn't
pretty. We can usually rise above it. But now that I've heard
others express it, I can finally admit to similar shallow feelings.
I'm talking about dot-com envy, which might be defined as jealousy
and slight resentment for people who are suddenly and hugely
wealthy because they're an online darling.
</P>
<P>
   Every day ordinary people like yourself are suddenly cyber-rich.
Your kids' friends are e-tycoons at 30. Suddenly there are new ways
to become rich, and you're not even sure how it works, but you
suspect you should have found out long before now.
</P>
<P>
   Did we somehow miss the chance? Did it sound too good, and we
blew it off. Maybe it came in the mail looking like Publishers
Clearing House and was thrown in the trash before we saw it was a
chance to invest in a start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how many psychiatrist couches are filled with people
trying to get past their resentment of 28-year-old Web
zillionaires. Or dealing with negative feelings for their cousin
who owned shares in a little-known company whose stock soared more
than 1,000 percent when it was bought by a telecom giant. Or
kicking themselves for settling for a regular merit increase with
two more holidays when they could have gone with the company's
e-division.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been very wealthy people around, but they
didn't stir up the same kind of envy. They were just rich. They
lived up on the hill in white houses with pillars. You could
explain their wealth and therefore rationalize your non-wealth.
They inherited old oil money. He built subdivisions. Her uncle
invented the Post-it. You couldn't be them if you tried.
</P>
<P>
   You could envy them in a general way. You could pout and say, if
your parents had that kind of money you too might have gone to a
major university and now be sitting in a leather chair smoking
cigars. Or reason that had you really wanted comfort you should
have studied brain surgery instead of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has changed that. Some reporters who dumped the
newsroom for cyberspace are raking it in. As are former professors,
grad students and office workers who defected to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich,'' it has been said, ``are different from you and
me,'' but today's rich are just like us with pre-IPO stock options.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech workers are the nouveau riche. So are former computer
nerds and some members of the generation once called slackers.
Success is being controlled and fortunes are being made in an
industry that most people didn't know of 15 years ago and some
people still doubt has much more of a future.
</P>
<P>
   For those not in the Web, it's a mystery. We don't really see
what these online companies produce. Some help people sell their
Beanie Babies. Some let people read about something on a computer
screen instead of on paper. Yet, some are famous and successful for
not making any money at all. Amazon.com, the virtual book store,
brags about losing millions of dollars but at the same time it has
sucked the life out of some very real bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   People continue to quit their traditional jobs to start new
online businesses, with the hope of getting rich, but how many
online businesses is the world clamoring for?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently a lot. Last week a service known only for its ability
to hook us up with Massachusetts became an equal partner in the
largest corporate merger in history. More overnight billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we who do not play in that world and who get prickly
when we hear that the Web has scooped up the best and brightest are
going to have to get over it.
</P>
<P>
   For us, it remains business as usual. Do some good, have fun,
remember that money isn't everything. And look for a 25-year-old
venture capitalist orphan to adopt.

GERMAN PARTY FINANCE OFFICIAL COMMITS SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ A leading finance official of Germany's
embattled Christian Democratic party committed suicide Thursday
after leaving a note indicating he had become aware of crimes of
embezzlement, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Huellen, the head of the Christian Democratic Union
parliamentary delegation's finance and budget department over the
last 18 years, hanged himself in his Berlin apartment as a
parliamentary investigation is getting underway into a web of
illicit payments to the party in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin prosecutor told the daily Bild that a criminal inquiry
into embezzlement had been opened based on a passage in Huellen's
suicide note. The Friday issue of the Berliner Zeitung reported
Huellen had said in his suicide letter that he was afraid of an
audit of the party's finances and that he had transferred money
from the parliamentary group's account. No further information on
the nature of the embezzlement was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Huellen, 49, the father of two children, became the first
casualty of a widening scandal that has prompted repeated
comparisons to the web of corruption whose revelation brought down
Italy's Christian Democrats after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, several prominent public figures, including the former
head of the state-owned oil company, killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   German Christian Democracy is not Italian Christian Democracy _
it is better organized, it has not held a monopoly on postwar
power, it represents a respectable German right in a way that may
be irreplaceable. Still, the headlines of ``Deutschland alla
Romana'' have resonated, not least for the sheer operatic intensity
of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Hoerster, a chief whip of the Christian Democrats in
parliament, announced the suicide to the lower house of parliament
and said first indications were that it was ``of a personal
nature.'' Parliamentary proceedings were briefly suspended.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate on the term ``personal nature,'' and
police accounts of the suicide note later suggested strongly that
the background to Huellen's death was in fact political. For
several weeks, pressure has been mounting on the Christian
Democrats to explain several million dollars in undeclared, and so
illegal, payments to the party.
</P>
<P>
   The search for answers centered Thursday on the Reichstag
building, focus of many German troubles over the last century and
now home to the parliament. The committee investigating illegal
payments under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl began its proceedings
by hearing his successor as party leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
apologize for his acts.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who last week admitted taking 100,000 marks ($52,000)
in cash from an arms dealer named Karlheinz Schreiber, said: ``A
few weeks ago in this chamber I didn't react as I should have to
calls made from the coalition benches. I regret that and I
apologize for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, although he did not say it clearly, Schaeuble was
apologizing for having lied.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, 1999, under questioning about Schreiber from
Hans-Christian Stroebele, a Green member of parliament, the
Christian Democrat leader said he ``may have run into Schreiber on
one occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without a suitcase?'' Stroebele shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a suitcase,'' Schaeuble replied. ``That means I may
have had a briefcase with me. I don't know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has now conceded, Schaeuble met Schreiber not once but
twice and, on the second occasion, accepted a bag containing a pile
of cash that he says he passed on to the party treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   It is this sort of behavior that has led many people to conclude
that Schaeuble cannot now restore his party's shattered
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary committee, headed by a Social Democrat
politicians, Volker Neumann, has summoned 26 people to testify,
including Kohl and several of his former ministers. One central
figure who will have to testify is Horst Weyrauch, long the man in
charge of party finances under Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, who has said that during Kohl's 16-year term as
chancellor ``the government was for sale,'' has indicated the
inquiry could go on for as long as two years. It seems evident that
the Social Democratic party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is
eager to draw out the positive impact of the scandal on its own
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is true that there is much to investigate, including
payments to the party by Schreiber totaling over $550,000, the
source of the more than $1 million that Kohl says he took between
1993 and 1998, and how millions of dollars from the party branch in
Hesse reached bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will also examine the suspicious sale in 1992 of
the former East German refinery Leuna to Elf Aquitaine of France.
Kohl was highly enthusiastic about this transaction, a
demonstration, he said, of renewed French-German friendship after
France's long hesitation over German unification.
</P>
<P>
   But tens of millions of dollars from the sale have not been
properly accounted for, prompting judicial investigations by
prosecutors in Switzerland and France into possible payments of
bribes. Documents relating to the sale disappeared mysteriously
from Kohl's chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted taking more than $1 million in secret
payments, but insisted that none was a bribe. He has said his
``honor'' prevents him from identifying the donors because he gave
his word he would not.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the truth so terrible that Helmut Kohl places his word of
honor above the German Constitution?'' asked Gabi Bauer, the
anchorwoman on Germany's main television show. The question clearly
echoed the thoughts of millions of people in a country where the
law says any contribution over $10,500 must be declared.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Kohl's defiance, and in the absence of any
``donors'' coming forward to identify themselves, suspicions have
been growing that some or all of the money that the former
chancellor says he received may in fact have come from overseas
bank accounts maintained to manage illegal payments and kickbacks
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   For unless the source of the money was illegal, it is
increasingly hard for many Germans to understand how Kohl can
continue to place his honor above the oath of office he took and
above the well-being of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor'' is a resonant word in the history of German political
scandals. It was repeatedly used by Uwe Barschel, the former
Christian Democrat premier of Schleswig-Holstein, who gave his
``word of honor'' that he had not used dirty tactics against his
Social Democratic challenger in an election in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the election he was forced from office when his
denials were disproved. A month later Barschel was found dead in a
Geneva hotel.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S GRANDMOTHERS TO VISIT U.S., JUDGE OFFERS TO REMOVE
HIMSELF FROM CASE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS

<P>
   MIAMI _ In a dramatic new twist, the grandmothers of 6-year-old
Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez are expected to fly from Havana to New
York as early as today to make their case for reuniting the boy
with his family in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department officials confirmed late Thursday that
travel visas have been issued for the two women, Raquel Rodriguez
and Mariela Quintana. Officials from the National Council of
Churches, a group that supports returning Elian to his father in
Cuba, flew late in the day to Havana on a chartered jet to meet
with the grandmothers and bring them back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who were issued passports in Cuba earlier this week,
were reportedly uncomfortable with the idea of traveling to Miami,
where Elian's case has sparked explosive emotions among
Cuban-American exiles.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly what they will do once in the United
States, and whether they would visit Miami or take a role in the
legal proceedings surrounding their grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Those legal proceedings moved forward slowly Thursday when a
federal judge selected to hear a lawsuit filed by Elian's Miami
relatives in a bid to keep the boy in this country said he would be
willing to remove himself from the case if attorneys are troubled
by several possible conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks to block a decision by federal immigration
officials to send Elian back to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James L. King said his son, Larry King, a
Miami-Dade County Judge who faces an upcoming election, has hired a
political consultant who is now working as a press advisor to
Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   That consultant, Armando Gutierrez, also worked for another
Miami-Dade County judge, Rosa Rodriguez, who last week issued a
controversial ruling granting temporary custody of Elian to his
Miami relatives. After the ruling, several legal experts criticized
Gutierrez and Judge Rodriguez for not disclosing his prior work in
her judicial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's ruling, however, was brushed immediately aside by
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who said immigration matters are
solely a federal responsibility. Reno invited the family to file a
lawsuit in federal court to resolve the matter, which the family
did on Wednesday, with the case being assigned by computer to Judge
King.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the possible conflict with his son, King also
offered to step down from the case because his daughter works for
the U.S. Justice Department, which is named as a defendant in the
lawsuit. King also said his trial calendar is jammed and that he
may not be able to hear Elian's case as quickly as attorneys might
want.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives told reporters they have
no problem with King presiding in the case. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott
of Miami said he would let the judge know today if federal
officials want a different judge.
</P>
<P>
   The developments are the latest chapter in Elian's two-month-old
saga, which began when he was found clinging to an inner tube off
South Florida on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and nine other people
drowned when their small boat capsized as they attempted to flee
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Cuban exiles have engaged in a bitter battle of words
with Cuban President Fidel Castro over the boy, with Castro
alleging Elian has been kidnapped, while Cuban-Americans say the
boy faces a horrible future if he returns to the communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Elian's grandmothers in this country promises to
bring a new round of headlines and rhetoric. The women's travel
visas were requested by Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's
National Assembly, who has been that country's chief negotiator
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's exile community has blasted Elian's Cuban family for not
coming to the United States to retrieve the boy, saying they have
been manipulated by Castro and haven't been able to speak their
true opinions about the case. Elian's father has repeatedly said he
will never come to the United States because he feels his boy is
being held here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has
kept the boy in his Little Havana home for the past two months,
reacted calmly when told the boy's grandmothers might soon be in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'll let them in the house,'' he told reporters.
``I'm not happy or sad about it. I'm the same as always.''

   NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, SUNDAY, JAN. 23, 12:35 p.m. (ET)
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (12-5) at St. Louis (14-3)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stat: The Buccaneers have the second-ranked pass defense;
The Rams have the first-ranked pass offense.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Tampa Bay's defensive unit is one of the most
impressive in the NFL in recent years. The Buccaneers give up just
14.6 points a game, only 119 passing yards a game and a meager 87
on the ground. The team has an amazing 21 interceptions. Such
numbers are almost unheard of in modern football. Tampa Bay's
defense is a reflection of its head coach, Tony Dungy, an
intelligent, even-keeled man who practices what he preaches. Dungy
tells the defense to always stay cool, no matter what the score is
or how well an offense may be moving the ball. Stay patient and
play hard, and you will get a turnover. It is a smart way to play,
but the philosophy will be truly tested against St. Louis, which
has scored 31 points or more 12 times this year, including last
week's playoff game against Minnesota. The Rams play pinball, and
even a defense as good as Tampa Bay's won't be able to shut them
down forever. Here is the problem for Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers
held Washington, a powerful offense in its own right, to 157 total
yards and no offensive touchdowns. But that game was on grass, and
now Tampa Bay must travel to St. Louis and play on the speedy turf.
Thus the Buccaneers, even if they play their best game of the year,
will likely give up at least 17 points, and probably more. And
Tampa Bay's offense is unlikely to match that. The offense is
ranked 28th in the NFL and scored only 270 points during the
regular season. The Buccaneers need some kind of offense, any
offense. But they don't have enough. The Rams make it to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Rams, 28-10

   AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, SUNDAY, JAN. 23, 4:15 p.m. (ET)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (14-3) vs. Jacksonville (15-2)
</P>
<P>
   Key Stat: The Titans have three consecutive victories over
Jacksonville, while the Jaguars have a record of 30-4 in their last
34 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Not only did Tennessee sweep Jacksonville this season,
but the Titans also beat Jacksonville in their final meeting of the
1998 regular season. Jacksonville says that one mattered little
since the Jaguars played two backups at quarterback. This season,
Tennessee won in Jacksonville, 20-19, back in September in a
rain-soaked game and then trashed the Jaguars, 41-14, a day after
Christmas in Tennessee in a game where Steve McNair tossed five
touchdown passes. McNair flourished, the Jaguars say, because they
allowed him too frequently to break containment and play the game
on the edges, throwing passes short and long while rolling right
and left. This time, the Jaguars' plan is to keep McNair inside the
pocket and force him to make his reads with pressure directly in
his face. It is a nice plan, but it will be difficult to implement
because of McNair's strong legs and mobility. Does Tennessee own
the mental edge over Jacksonville? Do the Jaguars think too much
and play too softly when they meet the Titans? In the teams' last
two meetings, the answer to both questions was yes. But this time,
Jacksonville is prepared to show its deep talent in every phase,
especially in a passing game that includes running back Fred Taylor
and in kick returns, where punt returner Reggie Barlow figures to
be a game breaker. This is Jacksonville's second AFC championship
game in four years. The last time it lost to the New England
Patriots and missed a trip to the Super Bowl. This opportunity will
not slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Score: Jaguars, 27-23.

SPORTS COLUMN: SELIG SHOULD MAKE THE DESIGNATED HITTER DISAPPEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Bud Selig has been made Consolidated Imperial High Lord
Overseer, here is a modest proposal for something in the best
interests of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball is going to dismantle the old rivalry between the
American League and the National League, it should get rid of the
most odious symbol of the gap between the leagues. Bud's got the
big irons strapped on his spindly hips. He should puff out his
chest and growl, ``Feel lucky, punk?'' to the first union lawyer he
sees. He should deep-six the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, what with the Parcells frolics and all,
on Wednesday the owners gave Selig powers that haven't been seen in
a baseball commissioner since Kenesaw Mountain Landis shook his
white mane and roared, ``Off with their heads.'' Didn't matter
whose heads. Landis just roared it.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum Bud even has the power to redistribute some income to
equalize the gap between big- and small-market teams. The
commissioner as Robin Hood. Having run the Milwaukee Brewers for
ages _ his family now runs it, wink-wink _ the Big Guy should have
a feel for disenfranchised franchises. Handing Bud the Ultimate
Deterrent is part of the continuing merger between the old leagues.
What is a century of tradition down the drain?
</P>
<P>
   If the owners had scrapped the two-league system to get the
umpires back into some semblance of control, that would have been a
noble cause. In reality, the biggest damage done to the umpires
came from their own union chief, Richie Phillips, who provoked an
insane Career Kool-Aid Drinking Contest last fall. That gaffe
provided baseball the blind-luck excuse to fire umpires left and
right, and to force Phillips out of his job. Finally, as the saying
goes.
</P>
<P>
   In this power vacuum, baseball now has the opportunity to
coordinate strike zones, uniforms, techniques, equipment and
attitude, without letting two sets of umpires whipsaw the leagues
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   The old rallying cry of ``this is a league matter'' was not all
bad, by the way. The American League was the domain of DiMaggio and
Williams and Greenberg, serious sluggers. The National League was
the domain of Robinson and Mays and Clemente, the feisty next
generation. Back a few decades, there really were stylistic
differences between leagues. When Hal McRae was traded from
Cincinnati to Kansas City in 1973, American Leaguers were aghast at
his aggressive slides into second base. In essence, he replied,
That's the way the Reds do it over there. When the leagues rolled
out the bunting in October, this sun-dappled exercise was called
the World Series. It meant something. Teams that never saw each
other all season were now paired in a kind of a civil war, only
with mustard on the fans' fingers.
</P>
<P>
   People really cared. When the National League lost an All-Star
Game, loyal presidents like Warren C. Giles and Charles S. Feeney
moped right through the cocktail hour. When the American League
lost a World Series, true believers like Lee MacPhail and Robert O.
Fishel limited themselves to gruel and hardtack until Thanksgiving.
Free agency has cut down on the differences between leagues, to be
sure. Now they play interleague games during the summer, and then
conduct relatively endless playoffs, with the World Series turning
out to be anticlimactic. One should think carefully before killing
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey has the Stanley Cup, but the old regional splits don't
mean much in the international age. Basketball has four divisions
based on geography, with the West leaning toward ballet and the
East toward pro wrestling, but no true rivalry. Pro football has
the Super Bowl, but the old divisions have been lost. After the
merger between leagues in 1970, the American Conference lads vowed
to win one for good old Al Davis, and the National Conference lads
vowed to win one for good old Pete Rozelle, but that has pretty
well faded now in the ascendancy of Jacksonville and Tennessee.
Quick: which conferences are they in?
</P>
<P>
   Only baseball _ good old tottering baseball _ has a century of
tradition, which it abuses just about every chance it gets. By
installing the hideous designated hitter rule in 1973, the American
League has been playing nearly three decades of lumbering,
unimaginative ball, while the National League continues to
encourage a certain amount of cerebral effort from its managers and
athleticism from its pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Having made the statesmanlike shift from the American to the
National League, Selig has the credentials to be Commissioner for
All People. His first act should be giving free gloves to all
designated hitters and telling them to go shag a fly. Baseball
wants to be entertaining? That would qualify.

 &HT;    Home Depot dumps Whirlpool appliance roll-out
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot is pulling the plug on a large-scale
rollout of Whirlpool appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after announcing the launch of Whirlpool
and General Electric appliance sales, the Atlanta-based retailer
has stopped ordering from Whirlpool because of kinks in the new
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot is continuing a rollout of General Electric
appliances, which should arrive in nearly 300 stores by early
February and all Home Depots by August.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would say why Whirlpool is being left out of the
launch, but apparently Home Depot has doubts that Whirlpool can
keep stocked its growing warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool, the nation's top maker of refrigerators, stoves and
other home appliances, faced delays in shipping products to smaller
customers last fall due to computer software problems. Analysts
said the manufacturer may have irked Home Depot, the nation's
largest home improvement retailer, by not meeting its rigorous
stocking requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot doesn't take any beef, and they don't forget
mistakes,'' said Nicholas Heymann, a Prudential Securities analyst.
``There have been some big delays with some vendors, and Home Depot
doesn't have patience for that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Whirlpool spokesman said Thursday that its glitches with Home
Depot related more to business matters than technology problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely not a computer issue,'' said Christopher
Wyse. ``We're continuing our negotiations and discussions for a
longer-term relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry estimates peg Home Depot's potential appliance
sales at $1 billion within two years. So whatever the reason, Home
Depot can't risk running out of an appliance, which is typically
the last piece of a new home or kitchen remodel, Heymann noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you build kitchen cabinets to accommodate a refrigerator
or a dishwasher, and it's not in stock when you need it, you can't
just go to the next store to buy a replacement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benton Harbor, Mich.-based Whirlpool won't get many chances to
get its foot in the door. Home Depot is ruthless when a supplier
lets a shelf go bare.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, for example, General Electric lost a deal as Home
Depot's exclusive light bulb supplier when it didn't maintain the
stock. Home Depot canceled tens of millions of dollars in orders
with General Electric and switched to Philips. It took two years
for General Electric to get back into Home Depot's good graces.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has apparently learned its lesson. The nation's
No. 2 appliance maker is ``jumping through hoops'' to fill Home
Depot's appliance needs, said Mark Healy, Home Depot's national
product merchant for kitchen and bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing everything to get the quantity and (products)
we need to move forward,'' said Healy, who noted that Whirlpool is
still a part of long-range plans. ``We're not saying we're going to
stop doing business with Whirlpool. But we're looking at other
manufacturers, just as we would with any products.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Maytag, the third-largest appliance maker, would
be a likely supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's move into appliance sales will take another bite
out of Sears, Roebuck and Co. Sears' share of appliance sales has
been slipping in recent years, Heymann noted, and Home Depot and
Lowe's Cos. are expected to pick up the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's, Home Depot's No. 1 rival, sells appliances made by
Whirlpool, General Electric, Maytag and others.

<P>
   SIMONDIUM, South Africa _ Ah, harvest time in the wine country!
The lush vines twist on wooden gables, the green leaves unfurl in
the warm summer sun and the sweet grapes hang heavy and ripe in the
shadow of the craggy Drakenstein mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Gideon Malherbe, a farmer, gazes at his acres and acres of plump
white wine grapes _ and dreams of hacking and killing each and
every vine. ``It doesn't make sense to harvest,'' he said with a
sigh. ``There's no money in it.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's wine producers are expecting a bumper crop of
grapes this year, but many couldn't be gloomier. About 21 million
gallons of white wine _ nearly 20 percent of last season's drinking
wine harvest _ is still sitting unsold and unwanted in cellars
across this region. The glut has sent prices plunging, and many
fear the new crop will make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   A ton of white wine grapes sold for $164 last year but now goes
for about $123, farmers say. Nationally, producer profits fell 15
percent in 1999 from the year before. And all over the country,
farmers like Malherbe are choosing to uproot their bountiful vines
while wine dealers sell what they can at deep discount.
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't the country _ or the world _ clamoring for these
vintages, which are flooding markets here in bottles, boxes and
bags marked at 30 percent to 40 percent off the average price of $4
or $5?
</P>
<P>
   The problem, politely put, is that the surplus wine is not the
tastiest, merchants and wine farmers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to drink plonk?'' asked Craig Hughes, the liquor
merchandise manager for Makro, a local chain of wholesale stores
that spends $13 million a year on wine. ``Most of this surplus wine
we've turned down. A lot of that wine is not very drinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   To some people this may come as a surprise. After all, what
could be sweeter than a fine South African wine? The intoxicating
liquid tickled Thomas Jefferson's tongue at Monticello and pleased
Louis XVI's palate in Paris. And until two years ago, wine profits
were booming as drinkers in Europe and America rushed to taste the
fruits of this nation's new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers were perhaps too eager to enter world markets after
trade sanctions imposed on the all-white government in the 1980s
ended in 1992 and 1993. Hoping to capitalize into the bargain on
local demand for brandy made from white wine, many planted grapes
cheaply and easily cultivated here but less popular (and often less
tasty) than those preferred in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners cheerfully sipped mediocre brands in the heady days
after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994, but they are
choosier now, wine merchants say. That means the surplus wines
cannot be sold abroad. Frankly, it's hard even selling them here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some wineries in this region of rolling hills and green
vineyards still produce high-quality wines, of course. Well-known
brands still sell briskly and at full price (anywhere from $8 to
$12 a bottle) here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And bulk exports of higher-quality white wine, which in 1998
dipped slightly in Britain, South Africa's biggest foreign market,
seem to have rebounded last year, according to SA Wine Industry
Information &AMP; Systems, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that the foray into the free market
was tougher than expected for most producers, who had dizzyingly
high hopes after watching profits soar nationally, to $240 million
in 1997 from $142 million in 1994, according to the trade group.
Last year profits fell to $198 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were excited about getting into the market
after so many years that some brands and labels were put into the
market which could have had more thought put into them,'' said
Lynne Sherris, commercial director of Vinfruco Ltd., which imports
about 2.6 million gallons of South African wine to Britain every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a lot of exporters are going about things with more
prudence,'' Ms. Sherris said. ``We're telling them, `Look we've
tried that and that doesn't work.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bruising lesson, but farmers are quickly shedding old
habits. In the past, the tightly regulated industry rewarded
growers for producing large quantities of grapes, with less
emphasis on quality or popularity, farmers say. Growers who
overproduced paid few penalties because the national wine
cooperative took responsibility for selling all surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Now the market and consumer preferences rule. And the national
wine cooperative, which has privatized, buys much of its brandy
from France.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many farmers are pulling up white grapevines and
replanting red, recognizing that more and more drinkers locally and
abroad are choosing merlots over chardonnays. Red wine grapes
currently sell for about $738 a ton, compared with $123 a ton for
white grapes, farmers say.
</P>
<P>
   When they do plant white, they often plant sauvignon blanc and
other brands known overseas instead of focusing on local varieties
like chenin blanc and colombard.
</P>
<P>
   Jannie Le Roux, whose family has grown wine grapes in nearby
Paarl for 10 generations, pointed proudly at his young merlot
vines. He still has some unpopular varieties of white grape, but he
plans to uproot them later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get out of the mass market,'' Le Roux said. ``The
only thing that will sell now is quality, quality, quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Malherbe's farm, workers are already busy hacking
and uprooting his healthy colombard vines. He, too, has started
growing red wine vines, although the first grapes will not appear
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all must change very fast,'' said Malherbe, whose grapes
are 80 percent white. ``I want to be 100 percent red.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men feel the pinch of falling prices, but they consider
themselves lucky. They have enough money to replant and regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Albe Treurnacht is less fortunate. He produced about 1.6 million
gallons of white wine last season. Today, half of it is still
sitting in tanks in his cellar.
</P>
<P>
   He says it is all spoken for. (No self-respecting winemaker, he
says, will acknowledge a surplus. It is too devastating to the
image.) But much of this wine will be sold in foil bags to
customers who pull up in pick-up trucks and supply taverns in poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Treurnacht guides a visitor to the packaging room and shrugs
sheepishly as a shiny machine pumps bag after bulging bag of white
wine. He still likes to think of himself as a man who only makes
wine fine enough to be sold in bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud of this,'' he said glumly. ``It's survival.''

 &HT;    Net site offers preview of Grisham's `Brethren'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Grisham fans who can't wait until his new legal thriller,
``The Brethren'' (Doubleday, $27.95), is published Feb. 1 can get a
sneak preview of the first two chapters online courtesy of the
publisher and Liquid Audio. But there's a catch: You can only
listen to the first chapter via a Liquid Audio player, which can be
downloaded free. Then you can read the second chapter and order
copies of the book online.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio Inc. is a major provider of software and services
for the digital delivery of music over the Internet. This is the
first time Doubleday, part of the Random House publishing empire,
has released a preview using a digital download in conjunction with
a print excerpt. This is just another marketing tool, says Terrence
Chenge, Web producer for Random House. ``The extensive distribution
network of Liquid Audio gives us an additional channel for
promoting and selling our books, both online and through
traditional markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brethren'' is about three former judges who are perfecting
a mail-order scam while serving time in a Florida federal prison.
They all are getting rich until something goes terribly wrong on
the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Web sites offering the preview are www.amazon

   &QR;  Winfrey winner: North Carolina novelist Robert Morgan is the
latest author to join Oprah Winfrey's exclusive circle. The TV talk
show host has chosen Morgan's novel ``Gap Creek'' (Algonquin Books,
$22.95) for her next book club discussion. Set in
turn-of-the-century Appalachia, ``Gap Creek'' is the story of
17-year-old Judy Harmon, who has to deal with premature births and
deaths, malnutrition, poverty and other hardships. Morgan, a
55-year-old poet who turned to fiction in 1984, is also the author
of ``The Truest Pleasure'' and ``The Hinterlands.''

   &QR;  Irish eyes: It's been years since Edna O'Brien left Ireland
for London, but her homeland still has an irresistible attraction.
After writing a biography of James Joyce last year, O'Brien returns
to fiction and the Irish landscape in April with ``Wild Decembers''
(Houghton Mifflin, $24). The novel traces the story of a sister,
her brother and a love-hate relationship with a neighboring
landowner. O'Brien will give a preview of the work during a free
reading at 7 tonight at Emory University, followed by a reception
and book signing.

 &HT;    An Irish woman wildly attuned to the writer's art
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the lobby of the Emory University Conference
Center Hotel, Edna O'Brien is gazing out a window at pretty much
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ordinary winter day, skies gray, trees bare. A building
in the near distance, beyond the trees, is nondescript as could be.
Nothing else is visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would do this?'' she asks. ``Who would sit here and try to
describe that? Try to describe the effect of those trees.''
</P>
<P>
   She is talking about why writers write, an old subject and
sometimes a tired one but one that quickens her already quick
conversation and brings her forward in her chair, her green eyes
alight with interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wound,'' she says. ``You don't fully understand it or
you wouldn't write. You grope toward it. It's both unreachable and
unfindable. But it is there, from the earliest age. It is a
dissatisfaction or anguish with life that only words can cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the cure _ the searching for those words, for exactly the
right ones _ is a terror every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing is something you try to postpone,'' she says,
reassuring anyone who's ever wondered why the one thing he wanted
to do was the one thing he would put off and put off. ``It's a
terror that you won't bring it off.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, whose papers have been acquired by the special
collections department of Emory University's Robert W. Woodruff
Library, read Thursday night from her new novel, ``Wild
Decembers,'' which will be published in the United States this
spring by Houghton Mifflin. A day earlier, tired from a
trans-Atlantic flight that arrived later than expected, she sat
over tea in her hotel's stately lobby, a woman who was once called
Ireland's most banned novelist after James Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   As literary mantles go, one can do worse.
</P>
<P>
   She confesses to being private about certain things. One is a
marriage that ended in divorce in 1958 and the two sons that came
of that marriage. Another is her age. But it is a matter of record
that she was born in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   She was 23 when her first novel, ``The Country Girls,'' was
published. It celebrated her divorce and scandalized her parish
priest in County Clare, who burned it on the chapel grounds. It was
her mother's disapproval that hurt more. After her mother died,
O'Brien found the novel wrapped in a bed sheet in an outhouse,
every offending word and passage censured with thick black ink. ``I
both wept and screamed,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, she had a reputation as a writer outside the
pale of accepted culture,'' says Ron Schuchard, professor of
English at Emory. ``Today, many people would say she has helped
pave the way for a lot of Irish women.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any Irish writer of her time, O'Brien has written
frankly, often exuberantly, of the repressed erotic side of women's
lives, of their silent anger and unrequited passion. ``I was
brought up by my mother always to be mindful of the shame of sex,''
she says, leaving you to infer that she thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Country Girls'' was banned when it was published in 1960,
and so were the next six novels.
</P>
<P>
   If Edna O'Brien paved the way for other Irish women, the price
was self-exile.
</P>
<P>
   James Joyce, one of her heroes (her biography of Joyce was
published in November by Lipper/Viking's Penguin Lives), both loved
and hated Ireland and had to get away from its obsessive piety, its
famines, its unending heartache to portray it.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce left for Paris, O'Brien for London. Neither was ever fully
reconciled to Ireland, and yet neither could be anything but Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say every writer I have admired,'' she said once,
``regardless of their particular daily history, has a loneliness
and a depth of feeling that cannot be corresponded to, and that's
why they write.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the wound that never completely heals, and impels a
certain kind of person to seek connection and contact through
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a man,'' she says of Joyce, ``who had written
`Ulysses,' who, for 17 years, every day and sometimes night, with
his eyesight almost gone and having to feel words and use color
pencils and crayons, went into the Hades and the paradise of his
mind and his imagination to write `Finnegans Wake.'''
</P>
<P>
   She accepts the reality that not everyone might wish to
accompany a writer on a journey so daunting. At a certain pitch,
the writer alone can hear the music of the words sometimes. But
other times, at a more accessible level, as in the famous
concluding paragraph of Joyce's short story ``The Dead,'' the music
fills head and heart like a hymn at a requiem High Mass, with its
image of snow ``falling on every part of the dark central plain, on
the treeless hills ... upon every part of the lonely churchyard ...
on the spears of crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of
the little gates, on the barren thorns.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows them well, almost as well as her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words,'' O'Brien is saying, ``are incantatory.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a terror in facing the blank page, there is also,
she says, an ecstasy like no other. ``Something comes over you and
the words move. They take wing. When that sequence of words, that
moment of narrative, carries you along, you are in another world.''
</P>
<P>
   She lives in two worlds, one the workaday world most of us know,
the other in her imagination. If she has not always been entirely
at home in the one, she knows there is sanctuary in the other,
whatever its terrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers don't always enjoy what they do, like brain
surgeons,'' she says. ``But if I were born again, I would still ask
to be a writer. When you're finished, you look back on it and
there's nothing like it. Others can have their judgment and, as we
all know, that can be a slaughterhouse. But you know what you were
meant to be.''

 &HT;    A bemused `Felicity' enters `Twilight Zone'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.J. Abrams, creator of ``Felicity,'' has an autographed picture
of Rod Serling hanging on his office wall. This bit of office decor
trivia is submitted for your approval as partial explanation for
Sunday night's episode of ``Felicity,'' a homage to Serling's ``The
Twilight Zone'' that is really pretty inexplicable but still grand
fun.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, ``Help for the Lovelorn,'' is never all that
frightening, but the attention to detail is downright scary. The
black-and-white cinematography, filmed on vintage cameras, throws
shadows into high relief. The music is hokey, the cast dresses in
early-'60s period clothes (their fresh, modern faces made
artificially old-fashioned call to mind scenes from the film
``Pleasantville''), and the dialogue sometimes has that sing-songy
quality that was Serling.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams even got Lamont Johnson, director of many of the original
``Zones,'' to direct.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Felicity (Keri Russell) is told by a mystery woman
to go to ``The Clinic'' for ``The Treatment'' _ a method of curing
incurable romanticism and a tendency to wear her broken heart on
her sleeve _ two afflictions that Felicity suffers from mightily.
The clinic is a creepy, menacing place, and she can't get anyone to
give her a straight answer as to what ``The Treatment'' consists
of. When she finds out ... ooh, it's not to her liking.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ``Lovelorn'' a dead-on ``Zone'' tribute, it's a
spoof of ``Felicity'' itself. It mocks her tendency toward
indecision. It plays (quite cleverly) with the show's ongoing
mystery of what her zonky roommate, Meghan, keeps in her lockbox.
It even goofs on the tape recorder that Felicity gushes her every
thought into.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the episode is that some things are left
unresolved _ the old ``Zones'' were always resolved _ and viewers
may feel cheated.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell what folks will make of this extraordinarily
bizarre outing. Most regular fans of ``Felicity'' are too young to
know ``Zone'' as anything more than a name from the distant past,
and most ``Zone'' fans probably don't watch ``Felicity,'' so Abrams
may have made a show for just a small group of people who like
twisted TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You unlock this door with the key to imagination,'' Serling
used to say in his intros. ``Felicity's'' Abrams has provided a new
door, and it's up to viewers to let their imaginations unlock it.

 &HT;    Haysbert brings enigmatic edge to `Now and Again'
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All actors have a cool quotient that determines their position
in the pop-culture food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's up, sometimes it's down. Right now, Dennis
Haysbert's is through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the 45-year-old actor is co-starring in the CBS
Friday night hit ``Now and Again,'' arguably one of the coolest,
and easily the weirdest, show of the 1999-2000 TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Haysbert's character, the icy Dr. Theodore Morris, is a twisted
government scientist who creates a bionic crimefighter and breaks
into a capella renditions of old standards like ``Close to You''
when the mood hits him.
</P>
<P>
   As if that's not cool enough, Haysbert is a personal friend of
Richard Roundtree's, whose portrayal of leather-jacketed private
eye John Shaft in 1971 helped invent the.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent trip to Atlanta, Haysbert bumped into Roundtree
at the Omni Hotel, and they greeted each other like only guys who
are supremely secure in their can: with a big hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known each other for about five years now,'' Haysbert
said after Roundtree headed toward the escalator. ``We go to the
same celebrity golf tournaments, which I love doing. He's got a
lower handicap than mine. I've been so busy I haven't had much time
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, ``Now and Again'' is in the ``back nine'' of
its contract with CBS, but that has nothing to do with Haysbert's
rusty golf game. The term refers to the network's decision to pick
up nine additional episodes of the show, a good sign that it may be
around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for Haysbert, who has also been around for a
while, but hadn't landed a breakthrough role until ``Now.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly has leading man looks: He stands 6-foot-4 and has a
knockout smile and a milk-chocolate complexion. Striding across the
Omni ballroom, he has the confident gait of an athlete, and with
good reason. In high school he was a football-basketball-track
triple threat.
</P>
<P>
   His voice, a rumbling bass, is reminiscent of a younger James
Earl Jones, who was actually considered for ``Now and Again''
before Haysbert snared the part.
</P>
<P>
   Although the role has been a personal coup for Haysbert, not
everyone is applauding. When the fall lineup of shows debuted, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People took
little note of ``Now and Again'' and charged the major networks
with failing to include blacks and other minority groups in front
of and behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   After threatening a TV boycott, the civil rights organization
has since forged agreements with ABC and NBC, a move that could
lead to more diverse programs.
</P>
<P>
   Haysbert said he was disappointed that NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume failed to mention ``Now and Again'' as an example of a
network show with a black co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kweisi Mfume had his agenda, and I don't think our
show fit that agenda,'' said Haysbert, who nevertheless chose not
to confront Mfume while both men were attending the Trumpet Awards
here. ``I think our show has been grossly ignored. My character is
not stereotypical. He's not going out there saying `(racial
epithet) this' or `cracker that.' He's a man doing what men do.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted later, the NAACP said ``Now and Again'' didn't fit the
bill, regardless of Haysbert's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the show doesn't center on him day in
and day out,'' said Sheila Douglas, an NAACP spokeswoman. ``It's
not his show.''
</P>
<P>
   It is producer Glenn Gordon Caron's show, and he disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   From the show's inception, Caron said, he envisoned Haysbert's
character as a black man who would have a major role in an ensemble
cast. Caron said he wasn't trying to make a point, or trying to
score any with African-American viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some level I was aware there might be some prejudices on
the audience's part, and as a storyteller you try to startle,''
said Caron from his New York office where the show is shot on
location.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the dispute between the networks and the NAACP, Caron
said, is Haysbert's performance. ``This guy is a very, very good
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis has a regal quality that makes it very difficult to
take your eyes off him, and he has an extraordinary facility with
language,'' said Caron. ``It's like jazz. You either hear the music
or you don't. Dennis hears it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haysbert's co-star, Eric Close, plays Michael Wiseman, a
middle-age insurance executive killed by a speeding train whom Dr.
Morris transforms into a hunky superman. The show is an oddball mix
of drama, romance, comedy and fantasy that doesn't dwell on the
racial differences of its co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the audiences are responding to the chemistry between
us,'' Close said from Pasadena, Calif. ``He's really a good actor
who brings a lot of film qualities to the show. Sometimes he does
this subtle thing with his eyes that you don't notice when you're
shooting. But when you see it in close-up on TV, it's so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, cool.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if Haysbert's role will make him a
cooler-than-thou-legend like John Shaft. For now, he's just
enjoying the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I racked my brain trying to figure out if there has ever been
a character like this, and I don't think there has been,'' Haysbert
said. ``He's very eclectic and eccentric, and he gets to sing. My
singing is questionable, but I'm having a great time and nobody
seems to care that I can't carry a tune very far.''

 &HT;    Enjoy Sunday show; few take it seriously
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the end of the Golden Globes on Sunday night, most people
watching the NBC broadcast still won't know who's responsible for
handing out the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much reason to care, either. Enjoy the outfits and
the usually lively pace of the trophy toss. Just don't take it too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Even the winners don't, and their acceptance speeches show it _
like Michael Caine last year, 'fessing up that he ``made a lot of
crap'' in the course of his acting career. Also last year,
presenter Christine Lahti turned up dragging toilet paper on her
shoe, a reference to missing her own previous win because she was
in the loo when they called her name.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Globes are thrown by an elusive little group
called the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. They're a cabal of
some 90 part-time journalists who write for overseas publications
you've never heard of (in some cases, not many people in Europe
have, either).
</P>
<P>
   Even though celebs are happy to accept their prizes, not many
particularly respect the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Its
members seem a little too happy to accept free meals, hotel rooms,
gifts and access to stars during the junkets studios host to
generate buzz about their movies.
</P>
<P>
   In the trade magazine Variety, Joan Rivers quipped of the HFPA,
``I know them all, because they wait on me during the year in
various restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, so now you know who's behind Sunday's show. The main
reason to watch is to handicap the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The Globes are seen as a semi-reliable barometer for Oscar
nominations. That's not because the HFPA's voters are especially
shrewd. It's just that they hand out nearly twice the number of
big-category awards that Oscar does, so they have plenty of room to
seem prescient.
</P>
<P>
   Voters from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
nominate only five movies for best picture, with the emphasis
usually on more somber than comic fare. Last year's nomination (and
surprise win) for ``Shakespeare in Love'' was a rare exception.
They also have only five slots for best actor and actress. By
contrast, the HFPA breaks movies into two categories: drama and
musical/comedy. In other words, 10 pictures, 10 actors and 10
actresses compete for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   This year, that results in Julianne Moore being nominated twice
as best actress (for the comedy ``An Ideal Husband'' and the drama
``The End of the Affair''). All five Globe nominees for best
picture in the drama category stand pretty good shots at getting
Oscar nods. But it's unlikely that the academy's nomi-
</P>
<P>
   nations Feb. 15 will include the HFPA's popcorn picks in the
musical/comedy category, ``Analyze This,'' ``Notting Hill'' or
``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if the movie mix wasn't already excessive, don't forget
that Sunday's show also honors TV shows and stars. Really, it must
be hard to go to anybody's home in Los Angeles without tripping
over Globes in every room.

 &HT;    Off-the-beaten-track Panhandle town a step back in time _ slow
and warm and gloriously relaxing
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Jan. 23.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   APALACHICOLA, Fla. _ It's one of those mild, breezy Saturday
afternoons, deep in the off-season, when this entire town seems to
be sleeping off a big oyster lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The only sounds along Water Street _ 150 years ago, the busiest
waterfront between New Orleans and Charleston _ are the mutter of a
shrimp boat engine and a seafood plant's exhaust fan. Water sloshes
under the skeletal remains of a wharf. Gulls caw testily. Wind
riffles the reeds in Apalachicola Bay, where the fresh waters of
the Apalachicola River and the salt of the gulf swirl together to
create ideal conditions for the succulent oyster that bears the
bay's name.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pelicans crouch on the docks with the goofy, stupefied
look of people who've overdone it on the shellfish. On a downtown
street, built wide as an interstate in 19th-century style, two
women pull their car windows even to gossip; there's no one to honk
at them. Cats stalk sidewalks in the winter sun; there's even one
sacked out on the registration desk of the 93-year-old Gibson Inn.
Dogs loll with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Apalachicola _ a working Panhandle fish town that doesn't drool
after tourists, but welcomes more visitors from Atlanta than from
any other city _ is dozing. Dreaming of its past. Beautiful dreams
of steamboats packed with cotton bales and cypress logs, top-hatted
barons of commerce and bejeweled ladies laughing in the flare of
gaslights.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts walk here even in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mystique about Apalach,'' says Ralph Brooks, 54,
who, like everyone else, conserves energy by ignoring the last
three syllables of the name. ``I guess it's the history; it's
something I can't quite put my finger on.''
</P>
<P>
   The carpenter is taking a cigarette break in the hangar door of
Benign Boats, soaking up the low-slant sun that even now, in
January, is toasty. ``When I was 18, there was absolutely nothing
to do here, but every girlfriend I brought home from college fell
in love with the place _ never wanted to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks blows out his smoke, sums up his hometown: ``It's a
feeling you get, more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bickel, 47, a photographer who relocated here from
Pittsburgh and patched up a grand Edwardian house with his wife,
Susan, says the soul of the area comes through in its images _
``vignettes of old Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's natural beauty ... hand labor ... rickety docks made
of twigs and boards ... half-submerged craft ... lagoons so far
back you can't believe it when you find boats there,'' says Bickel,
who has a gallery of his pictures in the restored Grady Market
building and likes to shoot oystermen from his kayak. ``It's not so
much what's here, it's what isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk of the town, says Susan Bickel, is owls: ``It's a wild
year for them!'' A snowy owl, fluky visitor from way north,
inexplicably settled on nearby St. George Island and is stopping
traffic. In the Chestnut Street Cemetery, where Spanish moss
shrouds the slanted gravestones of shipwreck victims and
Confederate soldiers, native hooters screech night after night,
keeping the Bickels awake.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing gently, the photographer says, ``I wonder what it all
means?''
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Cathy, and I succumbed several years ago to the
gracious and funky charms of Apalach. Midsummers are sweltering,
but the other months are seductive. The place is within 20 minutes
of beautiful beaches but is hardly a ``beach town''; rather, an old
Southern community that seems to have drifted down, like a cypress
log, to lodge itself here, out of the stream of time.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety miles southwest of Tallahassee, Apalach is the center of
what tourist authorities call the Forgotten Coast, served by no
convenient interstate or airport. Sixty miles west is Panama City
and the slick, noisy beach-culture strip stretching practically to
Bourbon Street. But Apalachicola, which had a French consulate when
the sailing ship was king, now feels as far off the world's radar
as you can get in a seven-hour drive from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The town of 3,000 was a handy base of operations for our
three-day exploration of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The hamlet of Indian Pass, 17 miles to the west, is so deep in
gator country that you find yourself nervously wondering about the
spare tire as you zip down the flat straight blacktop through the
slash pine and cabbage palm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as you walk into the Indian Pass Raw Bar, built in 1929
as a company store for the workers who made ``catface'' scratches
on pines to drain turpentine, you are greeted with a sign strung
across the store on a clothesline: ``This is Gator Country.'' It
refers not only to the fanatical following of University of Florida
football but also to a waiter-shucker named Gator Weiland who
peddles a blazing condiment called Insanity Sauce and is so surly
that newspapers celebrate the fact. We missed Gator (shucks!) but
we did meet his warm cohort Audrey, who's coming up on her 4
millionth oyster shucked.
</P>
<P>
   At $4.50 a dozen, the raw mollusks were laughably succulent, the
gumbo savory. You fetch your own beer from the wall cooler; ceiling
fans turn slowly on the end of long pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the Turtle Beach Inn, as in love with turtles as the
bar is with gators. As our car crunched onto the shell driveway, we
were greeted by a leaping chocolate Lab named Turtle. Since the inn
sits at the edge of a loggerhead turtles' nursery beach (hatchings
can be witnessed in late summer), those ancient creatures are
saluted throughout the inn with carvings in metal, ceramic and
driftwood. The 2-year-old inn is so immaculate that the scent of
pine floors jumped up in our noses as we opened our spacious room
with a commanding view of the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Innkeeper Trish Petrie is a likable Nashvillian who passed
through the area and decided to build the inn, ``so that I could
afford never to leave the place.'' We heard many variations of this
end-of-wandering tale on the Forgotten Coast.
</P>
<P>
   That night, with anchored shrimp boats puttering a lullaby
offshore, the stars were so bright that I could pick out five of
the Pleiades _ the ``7 Little Sisters'' that only show up as a
single smudge through Atlanta smog.
</P>
<P>
   First on the morning agenda was horseback riding on the beach.
We saw dolphins barely 10 yards from shore make their way along,
rising and diving, as if to an oceanic heartbeat. We saw the
remains of Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish with bells as large as a
bicycle helmet. We saw shrimp boats like fat airplanes with their
net booms extended over the water, seabirds swirling in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want to leave here because it's so small,''
said Julie Faircloth, 17, our friendly guide. ``I don't know what
they think they'll find.''
</P>
<P>
   We motored into Apalachicola for lunch (with heavenly clam
chowder) at the Owl Cafe. We checked into the rambling, charming
Gibson Inn (1907), which looks like a grounded riverboat with its
wraparound verandas. After picking up a walking-tour map at the
nearby Coombs House, a handsome B&AMP;B in a lumber baron's 1905
mansion, we commenced to mosey.
</P>
<P>
   Something amusingly eccentric _ even a touch gothic _ flavors
this community of gracious homes, gardens and churches. There's a
tiny museum, perfectly priced at $1 admission, devoted to John
Gorrie, inventor of the ice machine. An 1899 monument to Gorrie
across the street was erected by a ``Most Worshipful Lodge'' of the
Masons. All around are Queen Anne, Colonial Revival and
Plantation-style homes being restored, next to ones slumping into
the marshy ground.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to walk far before you're among sun-scorched
shotgun shacks, with streets that flood in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes' drive, at the north end of town, is Sipio Basin,
where a bevy of weathered, shrimp-redolent boats _ with names like
Linda Fay, Mrs. Ruby, Lady Diane, Karol Ann _ tie up. Nearby is a
national research center on wetland life and its public exhibit,
the Estuarine Walk, containing tanks of such colorfully named
critters as Gulf toadfish, alligator snapper, yellow-bellied slider
and Suwannee cooter (the last three are turtles). The kids will get
a few minutes of free diversion here, but let's face it: Apalach is
no Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any night life to speak of _ but who needs it when
you've got Boss Oyster? The Water Street eatery looks like nothing
more than an old mortar dive attached to a tin ``shuck house.'' But
step through the screen doors and out again on the dockside dining
area, and Boss casts its spell _ an enchantment of funkiness. Order
a frosty brew and some oysters (steamed, fried or raw, $6.50 a
dozen), grouper or soft-shelled crab. Everybody gets a battery of
hot sauces and a roll of paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a floor show. At sunset the light comes over your
shoulder and dabs tarnished gold on the shrimp boats chugging out
to the bay, each with its inebriated-looking pelican riding shotgun
in the rigging.

<P>
   APALACHICOLA, Fla.: On our last day we headed out to St. George
Island, spending most of the 20-minute trip over water on two
causeways. From that vantage we saw oystermen in their little
boats, hauling in their rough-shelled catch with the 9-foot tongs
unchanged for generations.
</P>
<P>
   At St. George Island State Park we took a four-mile walk over
sugary sand beside a two-toned sea, bottle green in the shallows,
deep blue farther out. We passed four other people. Slat fences
twisted and submerged beneath the drifting dunes.
</P>
<P>
   After a lunch of soft-shell-crab po-boys (fit for a king!) at
the nearby Blue Parrot Cafe, whose grass-hut beachside bar is the
nerve center of St. George, we rented a two-person kayak. Skimming
a lagoon, we saw two great blue herons. The first, standing 4 feet
tall with long white breast feathers fluttering in the wind, looked
eerily like a shaman in a bird costume. The second rose from the
reeds in a slow-motion spectacle of unfurling wings, endless legs
streaming behind it.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned the kayak, despite my assurances that
alligators couldn't live in a salt lagoon, Cathy asked rental
proprietress Jeanni McMillan about the reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, there's a few little ones,'' she said to our thunderstruck
faces, ``but they never bother anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it seems everyone in the area has sighted a gator, but
no one's ever heard of an attack. The key is to avoid grassy banks
where their nests might be hidden. Still, it's worth remembering
what an old-timer said to Bickel in his kayak: ``To a gator, you're
an oyster on a cracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Water, earth and air are in balance, perfectly mixed in the
bracing cocktail that is Apalach life. One sees, moving among all
three realms, terns, oyster-catchers, plovers, egrets, ospreys.
</P>
<P>
   And moving right into town, this odd winter, is a surplus of
owls. We know because one swooped just inches above our heads as we
stepped out of the Gibson one evening.
</P>
<P>
   After a stylish dinner at Tamara's Cafe Floridita _ named for
its chef, a former TV personality from Venezuela _ we were chatting
with her over coffee. A cook summoned us outside with these words:
``He's back.''
</P>
<P>
   There, on a satellite dish in an empty lot across the street,
sat a brown owl, as if to compose a surreal photograph. Or was it
tuned to vibrations from the Great Beyond? As we chattered just a
few feet from the bird, it swiveled its head like a gun turret to
shoot us a baleful look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him Chico _ means `boy' in Spanish,'' Tamara Suarez
said with a laugh. It was only 9 on a misty Sunday evening, yet
Apalach seemed deserted. Once again, dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the stars!'' exclaimed Tamara suddenly, and we all
raised our heads without a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good fishing tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   It's a seven-hour drive from Atlanta. Take I-75 south to Tifton,
Ga., U.S. 319 south into Florida, U.S. 98 west to Apalachicola.

BRADLEY LOSING GROUND IN BAY STATE, NEW POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bill Bradley, who is depending on strong support in the
Northeast to keep his presidential candidacy competitive, is losing
ground in Massachusetts to Al Gore, a new University of
Massachusetts poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey taken Jan. 13-16, the vice president has
bounced back among Massachusetts Democrats, earning support from 42
percent of poll respondents, while Bradley received 36 percent.
Another 19 percent were undecided; the remaining 3 percent refused
to answer. A similar UMass poll in October showed Bradley leading,
43 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, director of the quarterly UMass poll, which first
picked up Bradley's surge in the Bay State in June, said the swing
to Gore spells trouble for the former New Jersey senator with
Massachusetts's primary looming March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley can no longer count on winning Massachusetts,''
DiNatale said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the poll's margin of error is 6 percent, the Democratic
rivals are actually in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround comes even after Bradley spent twice as much as
Gore on television advertising in Boston aimed for the most part at
New Hampshire voters. Bradley has aired $2.2 million worth of ads
since early November.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows that both Democrats enjoy leads over the top
Republican candidates. Gore leads Texas Governor George W. Bush 52
percent to 28 percent with 15 percent undecided, a major reversal
from October's survey in which Bush lead Gore 46 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also beat Bush in Massachusetts, 51 percent to 31
percent, with 14 percent undecided. Those figures were similar to
Bradley's October lead of 48 percent to 34 percent. Bradley tops
Arizona Senator John McCain 49 percent to 30 percent, with 19
percent undecided. In October, Bradley was leading McCain 51
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who trailed McCain in October by 5 percentage points now
leads him 47 percent to 29 percent, with 19 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred people participated in the poll, conducted by the
school's McCormack Institute.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola shuffles European operations
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So far, Douglas Daft is sticking to his word.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview just a few days after becoming Coca-Cola's
president last month, Daft said he would follow the advice of the
company's late chairman, Roberto C. Goizueta.
</P>
<P>
   Goizueta, he said, taught him the value of focusing on a ``short
and critical agenda,'' and moving quickly to deal with key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Thursday, the company made a decisive move by
creating two new business units _ one for Western Europe and the
other for Central Europe and Eurasia _ to more effectively deal
with its operations there. Last summer in the region, Coke
experienced the biggest product recall in its 113-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new structure for Greater Europe reflects our strong
desire to make sure we are managing our business on a local
basis,'' said Charles Frenette, president of the Greater Europe
business, which encompasses 866 million potential consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Since being named company president, Daft has stressed the
importance of becoming more locally focused and decentralized,
especially since Coca-Cola sells soft drinks in some 200 nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daft is continuing to decentralize the regional management to
keep attuned to the demands of the market, including demographics,
marketing and bottler issues,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein said the company is
simplifying its European operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of layers in the former structure,''
Pecoriello said. ``Now, there will be less bureaucracy and more
streamlined communication.'' Similar moves, he predicted, are
likely to take place in other parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, Daft announced he was shifting Frenette
from his job as chief marketing officer to head the company's
European operations, which will now be based in London. Those
operations had been based in Atlanta and led by William Casey, who
retired.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of both new business units will report to Frenette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the move makes a lot of sense,'' Conway said. ``I
think Daft is aligning his midlevel management to the anchor
bottlers of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   In Western Europe, Coca-Cola Enterprises is the key bottler. The
new unit there _ which includes Belgium, France, Germany, the
United Kingdom and 10 other countries _ will be based in Madrid and
headed by Jose Nunez Cervera, 59. He was previously responsible for
operations in Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The new Central Europe and Eurasia Group covers 35 nations,
including Austria, Poland, Hungary, Russia and Greece. It will be
headed by Cem Kozlu, who will be based in Vienna. Previously,
Kozlu, 54, was in charge of operations in Turkey, Caucasus and
Central Asian Republics.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the key bottlers operating in Kozlu's area, Hellenic
Bottling and Coca-Cola Beverages, are attempting to merge. The
deal, which the European Union is scrutinizing for antitrust
reasons, would create the Coke system's second-largest bottler
after Atlanta-based CCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is a real priority for the company,'' said Coke
spokesman Rafael Fernandez. ``Both new units are headed by
executives with international business experience who have a very
clear European understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this latest move, Daft made several others this
week. On Tuesday, for example, he selected Jack Stahl to become
president and chief operating officer in April, when Daft ascends
to the top spots of chairman and chief executive officer. Current
Chairman M. Douglas Ivester is retiring then.
</P>
<P>
   Daft also named a new head of the company's Japanese operations,
Mary Minnick, who becomes the first woman in that role.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company's board elected five executive vice
presidents, who will serve on a six-member executive committee that
Daft chairs. The top management committee will set company policy
and establish a strategic direction.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose 62 1/2 cents Thursday, closing at
$65.87 1/2.

US MOVES TO SPEED UP MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time slipping away in what was to have been a
decisive month in Middle East peace negotiations, the Clinton
administration Thursday stepped up its efforts to bring the
Palestinians and Israelis closer to agreement on some of their
thorniest issues, while warning that neither side should expect to
get all that it wants.
</P>
<P>
   The US talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Araft came just days
after the postponement of a third round of separate negotiations
between Israel and Syria that were due to resume Wednesday at
Shepherdstown, W. Va. Arafat's trip was scheduled last month when
those high-level discussions were still ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright met with the Palestinian leader in an attempt to nudge the
parties along keep alive a Feb. 13 deadline for Israel and the
Palestinians to finish the outline of a final settlement of their
long running dispute over such issues as Palestinian statehood and
the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any process like this, there must be inevitable and
difficult compromises,'' Clinton said at the top of his meeting
with Arafat, who sat beside him in the Oval Office as he spoke.
``No one can get everything that either side wants. But I am
convinced we can get there, and I am convinced that Chairman Arafat
is proceeding in great good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of achieving peace in the Middle East as a key part of
his legacy, the president has invested extraordinary amounts of
personal time in the effort to keep both sets of talks moving.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arafat said, ``There is no doubt that there will
be difficulties along the way; these are expected difficulties. But
there is also determination.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, National Security Council spokesman Mike
Hammer dampened expectations that the two sides would reach a
preliminary settlement by Feb. 13. They hope to reach a final
settlement in September.
</P>
<P>
   Calling deadlines ``artificial,'' Hammer said, ``If it slips by
a week or two or a month, they are not breaking off. It's an
ongoing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright met first with Arafat, hosting him for 40 minutes in
her seventh floor office in front of a roaring fireplace. Then her
motorcade cruised through the snowy streets of Washington to her
home in the Georgetown section, where their talks continued for
another hour over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lunch, Arafat said, ``Warm, positive and
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his later meeting with Clinton, the Palestinian leader said,
``It was a very fruitful and productive and important meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's arrival was expected to coincide with the resumption of
direct talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the head
of the Syrian delegation, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. But
those discussions hit a snag over differences concerning proposals
for Israel to return the Golan Heights to Syria. Albright and other
US officials blamed the collapse of those talks on both sides
wanting priority for its key concerns in fashioning an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Syrian officials
would come to Washington next week, to be followed by Israeli
experts, in an effort to work out with some of the outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said US officials were determined to nudge the peace
process along on both the Palestinian and Syrian tracks. ``They
will move at different speeds, and that's fine, but in order to
achieve a comprehensive peace, you are going to need success not
only on one track but also on the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Richard W. Murphy, the director of Middle East Studies at
the Council on Foreign Relations and a former diplomat: ``This is
the decisive hour for determining if the year 2000 is going to see
a major stride toward Israeli-Palestinan agreements.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, ARAFAT REMAIN CONFIDENT IN PEACE PROCESS, DESPITE
UNCERTAINTY OF MID-FEBRUARY DEADLINE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat agreed Thursday that a comprehensive Middle
East peace accord remains within reach this year, despite the
growing likelihood that a key milestone slated for Feb. 13 would be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Arafat, though, that Palestinians and Israelis
would both have to bend a little in their efforts to negotiate a
land-for-peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any process like this, there must be inevitable and
difficult compromises,'' Clinton told reporters, as Arafat looked
on, at the beginning of an hour-long Oval Office meeting. ``No one
can get everything that either side wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mentioned no issues in particular, but the points of
greatest friction are well known.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for instance, want thousands of refugees to have
the right to return to Israel if they choose; Israelis say
Palestinian refugees are an issue for the Arab world to address.
Arafat is also pressing for land to create a Palestinian state _ an
area where Israel has shown some flexibility _ to include a portion
of Jerusalem, a point on which Israel has shown considerable
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough going in the peace process, Clinton said he
remains hopeful that he can help broker an overall peace accord
between Israel and its Arab neighbors before leaving office next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be disappointed if we don't, because we have the leaders
who can do it,'' Clinton said. ``The issues are clear _ even if
they're difficult, they're clear _ and I certainly think we could
have it and I'm going to do everything I can every day I've got to
try to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that Syrian-Israeli peace talks remain on
track, despite setbacks in that area as well.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings this month in Shepherdstown, W.Va., and last
month in Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa had been scheduled to resume
negotiations near Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were postponed indefinitely, however, because the two
sides were at odds over, among other things, the precise boundaries
of the Golan Heights territory Israel would return to Syrian
control in exchange for peace and normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian negotiators are expected to return to Washington as early
as next week, in hopes of rejuvenating the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read too much into this,'' Clinton said of the
interruption in the Syrian-Israeli talks. ``Actually, the parties
have a framework for making these decisions that's more clear and
more bridgeable than I would have thought by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scrambling to keep both tracks of peace talks alive,
in hopes of helping to broker an end to half a century of bloodshed
and enmity between Israel and its Arab foes.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was here to seek Clinton's help in advancing peace talks
between Palestinians and Israelis. Arafat and Barak have pledged to
agree by Feb. 13 to a framework for final peace negotiations, with
an eye toward wrapping up the entire process by September.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian talks have bogged down, however, over
disputes concerning Israeli troop withdrawals from parts of the
occupied West Bank and shortcomings in Palestinian efforts to crack
down on anti-Israeli terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are expected difficulties,'' Arafat told reporters at
the outset of his meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Arafat came out of the White House and told
reporters he remained confident of striking a peace accord before
Clinton leaves office a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure, and we are determined to complete our endeavor of
achieving the goals in a comprehensive peace during the tenure of
President Clinton,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   It's anything but a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met earlier in the day with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. The two huddled by a roaring fire in her dark-paneled
office at the State Department in the morning, then repaired to her
elegant Georgetown home for a private lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Following their morning meeting, Albright's spokesman hinted
that the Feb. 13 deadline might be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe it will be a formidable challenge to meet the
mid-February deadline, or goal, for a framework agreement,'' said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rubin said Albright was prepared to host a summit
between Arafat and Barak, if that would help them meet the Feb. 13
target date.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Arafat spent much of their time Thursday discussing
``what kind of meetings could take place, what kind of schedule
could be created,'' to try to bring the overall Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations to a conclusion by September, Rubin said, as well as
possible ways for ``bridging the gaps,'' between the two.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton remains hopeful
that if the Feb. 13 deadline slips it would be by only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both parties believe that they need extra time, I'm sure
that we will work with them on that,'' Lockhart told reporters at a
White House briefing. ``But we're going to continue working with
them with an eye toward meeting the deadline.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, ARAFAT REMAIN CONFIDENT IN PEACE PROCESS, DESPITE
UNCERTAINTY OF MID-FEBRUARY DEADLINE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat agreed Thursday that a comprehensive Middle
East peace accord remains within reach this year, despite the
growing likelihood that a key milestone slated for Feb. 13 would be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Arafat, though, that Palestinians and Israelis
would both have to bend a little in their efforts to negotiate a
land-for-peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any process like this, there must be inevitable and
difficult compromises,'' Clinton told reporters, as Arafat looked
on, at the beginning of an hour-long Oval Office meeting. ``No one
can get everything that either side wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mentioned no issues in particular, but the points of
greatest friction are well known.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for instance, want thousands of refugees to have
the right to return to Israel if they choose; Israelis say
Palestinian refugees are an issue for the Arab world to address.
Arafat is also pressing for land to create a Palestinian state _ an
area where Israel has shown some flexibility _ to include a portion
of Jerusalem, a point on which Israel has shown considerable
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough going in the peace process, Clinton said he
remains hopeful that he can help broker an overall peace accord
between Israel and its Arab neighbors before leaving office next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be disappointed if we don't, because we have the leaders
who can do it,'' Clinton said. ``The issues are clear _ even if
they're difficult, they're clear _ and I certainly think we could
have it and I'm going to do everything I can every day I've got to
try to achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that Syrian-Israeli peace talks remain on
track, despite setbacks in that area as well.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings this month in Shepherdstown, W.Va., and last
month in Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa had been scheduled to resume
negotiations near Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were postponed indefinitely, however, because the two
sides were at odds over, among other things, the precise boundaries
of the Golan Heights territory Israel would return to Syrian
control in exchange for peace and normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian negotiators are expected to return to Washington as early
as next week, in hopes of rejuvenating the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read too much into this,'' Clinton said of the
interruption in the Syrian-Israeli talks. ``Actually, the parties
have a framework for making these decisions that's more clear and
more bridgeable than I would have thought by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scrambling to keep both tracks of peace talks alive,
in hopes of helping to broker an end to half a century of bloodshed
and enmity between Israel and its Arab foes.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was here to seek Clinton's help in advancing peace talks
between Palestinians and Israelis. Arafat and Barak have pledged to
agree by Feb. 13 to a framework for final peace negotiations, with
an eye toward wrapping up the entire process by September.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian talks have bogged down, however, over
disputes concerning Israeli troop withdrawals from parts of the
occupied West Bank and shortcomings in Palestinian efforts to crack
down on anti-Israeli terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are expected difficulties,'' Arafat told reporters at
the outset of his meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, Arafat came out of the White House and told
reporters he remained confident of striking a peace accord before
Clinton leaves office a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure, and we are determined to complete our endeavor of
achieving the goals in a comprehensive peace during the tenure of
President Clinton,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   It's anything but a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met earlier in the day with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. The two huddled by a roaring fire in her dark-paneled
office at the State Department in the morning, then repaired to her
elegant Georgetown home for a private lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Following their morning meeting, Albright's spokesman hinted
that the Feb. 13 deadline might be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe it will be a formidable challenge to meet the
mid-February deadline, or goal, for a framework agreement,'' said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rubin said Albright was prepared to host a summit
between Arafat and Barak, if that would help them meet the Feb. 13
target date.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Arafat spent much of their time Thursday discussing
``what kind of meetings could take place, what kind of schedule
could be created,'' to try to bring the overall Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations to a conclusion by September, Rubin said, as well as
possible ways for ``bridging the gaps,'' between the two.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton remains hopeful
that if the Feb. 13 deadline slips it would be by only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both parties believe that they need extra time, I'm sure
that we will work with them on that,'' Lockhart told reporters at a
White House briefing. ``But we're going to continue working with
them with an eye toward meeting the deadline.''

CHECHEN REBELS SAY THEY'VE CAPTURED RUSSIAN GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Separatist guerrillas claimed Thursday to have captured
a ranking Russian general as fierce fighting continued for control
of Chechnya's capital Grozny, a feat that would strike a dramatic
blow to the Kremlin's military campaign against the separatist
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Mikhail Malofeyev disappeared during fighting on
Monday and Chechen rebels said Thursday that he was taken prisoner.
The Russian Defense Ministry said only that Malofeyev was missing
in action.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent capture of the deputy commander of one of Russia's
three fronts in Grozny, which came as Russian forces seemed to be
regaining the advantage in the battle, was a major setback for the
Kremlin, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant in that it demonstrates the breakdown in
morale and discipline in the Russian army. This is a boost for the
Chechens and means shame for the Russians,'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based military analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Television news reports in Moscow gave varying accounts of the
circumstances surrounding Malofeyev's disappearance. Some said he
was shot by snipers while touring Grozny's northern districts,
which Russia claims to control, but others said he vanished during
street fighting in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops dodged sniper fire trying to tighten
their noose on the battered Chechen capital as tanks and helicopter
gunships continued to blast the city. Russian army officials said
warplanes and helicopters had flown more than 200 bombing raids and
claimed to be making slow but steady progress toward capturing
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant General Stanislav Kavun was quoted by news agencies
as saying that Russian troops had control of ``a considerable
part'' of the Chechen capital and that rebels were ``suffering
heavy losses.''
</P>
<P>
   But an unidentified Russian officer in Grozny told NTV
television that the Chechens were putting up a fierce resistance as
they tried to hold their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are extremely well prepared,'' the officer said of the
rebels. ``In our advance we have already had to cross three lines
of defense. As we get closer to the center the defenses get
stronger and stronger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After easily occupying Chechnya's northern region, Russian
troops have been bogged down for weeks trying to capture Grozny.
Chechen rebels still control most of the repubic's mountainous
south.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has boasted recently that Grozny would fall
in a matter of days. Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Thursday,
however, that the goal was not to meet deadlines, but to minimize
casualties among Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to be still trapped
in Grozny, unable to escape the fighting. Russia has come under
intense international criticism over the high number of civilian
casualties and for using excessive force in the four-month-old
military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Thursday, the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, which has observers in the war-torn region, accused Russian
soldiers of raping Chechen women in the republic's Russian-occupied
areas. Citing eyewitnesses, the report described rapes in Shali, 16
miles southeast of Grozny, and Alkhan-Yurt, just southwest of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rape is a war crime, and these allegations about rape in
Chechnya are very serious,'' the group said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe, the continent's highest human rights
body, has sent a delegation to Chechnya on a fact-finding mission.
Lord David Russell-Johnston, president of the council's
parliamentary assembly, visited the war zone this week and asked
Moscow to call a ceasefire and open peace talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin launched its military assault on Chechnya in late
September after a series of apartment bombings that killed hundreds
of people in Moscow and other Russian cities. Russian officials
blamed Chechen rebels for the bombings, although the Chechens have
repeatedly denied any involvement in the blasts.

<P>
   BOONE, Iowa _ A minor mystery in the current presidential
campaign involves the people who turn out to listen to Steve
Forbes' speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery would be why.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate, Forbes is a guy in a suit who works a room as if
he were proctoring a test. Thanks to his extraordinarily immobile
features, he always looks precisely the same from nose upward, no
matter what his mood. Offstage, he hardly seems to exist. His staff
sort of carts him away when the speeches are over, and there are no
Steve Forbes anecdotes, either charming or chilling. He has spent
more than $60 million over the last four years trying to buy his
way into the presidential race, but he doesn't even seem to dabble
in conspicuous consumption. During his most recent Iowa swing, he
and his wife were spending their rest times at the neighborhood
Econo-Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how remote the town or treacherous the weather,
there's a roomful of people waiting patiently to hear him speak.
It's hard to explain what brings them out, since I have finally and
reluctantly accepted the fact that he is not hiring them. None of
his issues seem to have much pull. The polls show voters are
apathetic about tax cuts of any size, let alone one as complicated
and controversial as Forbes' pet proposal.
</P>
<P>
   He's trying to appeal to the Christian right _ this week he said
George W. Bush was a ``timid'' abortion opponent, while he was
``bold.'' (``Bold'' appears to be the adjective of choice this
year. Perhaps this race, lacking any other focus, will be
remembered for recycling old laundry detergent names. Let's call
the Bush tax cuts ``fab.'') But dissatisfied social conservatives
seem to yearn for a candidate with fire in the belly, and they can
get more passion than Forbes is offering in Alan Keyes or Gary
Bauer. Or the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sight of all those upturned faces has energized the
candidate, sort of. ``I'm pumped up!'' Forbes keeps saying, with
exactly the same expression he uses when vowing to drive a stake
through the tax code, or inquiring whether everybody liked the free
chili. The newly peppy speeches sound like an infomercial, in which
Forbes explains how we can all become winners in the game of life
by instituting a flat tax and privatizing Social Security. (``You
take someone on minimum wage their whole lives. They'll have
upwards of $200,000 when they retire!'')
</P>
<P>
   The serious presidential candidates generally ignore the Forbes
campaign, but in Iowa the Republican establishment has been
attempting to demonize him as an archfiend of negative advertising.
Sen. Charles Grassley is on the radio warning the public to beware
of possible anti-Bush ads as if they were radioactive. At the first
sign of negativity, he urges, ``hang up the phone, throw the mail
out and change the station.'' While Bush was busy hammering on John
McCain in New Hampshire, his staff in Iowa was complaining that a
Forbes pamphlet had been rigged to make Bush's ears look big. If
this keeps up, Forbes may actually qualify for the sympathy vote.
</P>
<P>
   His organization, which is the best money can buy, may
compensate for his lack of pizazz. But Americans still prefer
presidential candidates who seem to have at least a modicum of an
idea what they're getting into, and the Forbes people want the
nation to entrust its security to a guy whose chief claim to fame
is that he once ran a business his father gave him. You can't spend
your way around that problem.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, however, is selling his lack of credentials as his
big strength, and his supporters seem to agree. Almost invariably,
they say they are in his corner because ``he's not tainted,'' or
``he doesn't run with the ones in Washington.'' Maybe the
mysterious Forbes audiences are made up of voters who believed the
Gingrich revolution would refashion America in their own image.
When things sort of fizzled out, perhaps they gave up on
politicians completely, and decided to place their bets on someone
so uncharismatic he could be trusted not to trick them the way
politicians did.
</P>
<P>
   Or, on the other hand, it could just be that people who live in
Iowa in the winter have a lot of time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either come here or go to exercise class,'' one elderly
woman said.

WITH AID OF DOGSLED, A CENSUS BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Alaska)   (jw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNALAKLEET, Alaska _ Stanton Katchatag, an 82-year-old Inuit,
answered a knock on his door here Thursday at 10:50 a.m. and found
himself facing Kenneth Prewitt, the director of the Census Bureau.
Katchatag invited him in and offered a chair.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, who arrived on the back of a snowmobile at the end of a
trip that brought him across four time zones, got right down to
business. Pulling out the census short form, he asked Katchatag his
age, race and the spelling of his name.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the scene to reporters afterward, Katchatag said
Prewitt asked for similar information on the only other person
living in the one-story cedar-frame house, Katchatag's wife, Irene.
When the 15-minute interview was over Katchatag, whose ancestors
were among the first people to inhabit the North American
continent, became the first person to be officially counted in the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying plenty of excitement but only a vague grasp of
population figures, Mayor Henry Ivanoff of this tiny fishing
village on the Bearing Sea said, ``That means that over 225 million
people will be standing in line behind him, including the president
of the United States and the vice president, including the
governors and lieutenant governors of all the 50 states, including
Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview here began the first census of the 2000s, an
effort to count the U.S. population and find out where every one of
the estimated 275 million Americans are living on April 1. The
Constitution calls for a count every 10 years to fix the number of
House seats for each state and states uses the numbers to draw
legislative districts. In addition, billions of dollars in federal
aid will be distributed on the basis of how the population is
counted.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest peace-time operation undertaken by the federal
government and will take census workers to impoverished areas on
the Texas-Mexico border, to islands off the Maine Coast, and to
shifting groups of shanties erected by homeless people in the
nation's cities.
</P>
<P>
   This critical count is taking place in a country that is more
diverse than ever and that has often been termed less cooperative
than ever. It is also taking place when political power between the
major parties is balanced on a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Forms will be mailed to more than 120 million households and
about a half million census takers will be dispatched to interview
the approximately 40 percent of households that do not return them.
Census statisticians will then tabulate the results for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Census 2000 is the opportunity to paint a picture of the
country at one of its most dynamic periods in its history,'' said
Prewitt, who began the count going from house to house past
aluminum-frame herring fishing boats set on blocks in the front
yards.

HELMS WARNS UNITED NATIONS ON US SOVERIGNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Senator Jesse Helms, confronting an
organization he derides as overreaching and inefficient, bluntly
vowed to the Security Council Thursday that American power in the
world would never be usurped by the United Nation's ``utopian''
vision of a centralized world order.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Helms has
led the fight aginst US payment of its UN dues and has blocked
several ambassadorial appointments, including that of former
governor William F. Weld.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's clash with the United Nations went beyond the issue
of the UN's budget and efficiency, touching off a philosophical
debate about sovereignty versus collective action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans sense that the UN has greater ambitions than
simply being an efficient deliverer of humanitarian aid, a more
effective peacekeeper, a better weapons inspector and a more
effective tool of great power diplomacy,'' Helms said. ``They see
the UN aspiring to establish itself as the central authority of a
new international order of global laws and global governance _ an
international order the American people will not countenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms, the first member of Congress to address the Security
Council, said the United States is fed up with routinely losing
General Assembly votes, being investigated for human rights abuses,
being called a ``deadbeat,'' being challenged on the ``inherent
legitimacy'' of intervening militarily, and with possibly becoming
a target of UN war crimes tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the UN seeks to impose its power and authority over
nation-states'' and instead does not remain ``just one part of
America's diplomatic arsenal . . . the American people will cast it
aside,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' at times harsh remarks appeared to shatter the normally
staid atmosphere of the UN chamber. The senator's comments also
drew immediate _ and at times, equally blunt _ responses.
</P>
<P>
   France lectured him on the importance of being tolerant of other
nations, and Namibia blamed Helms' support of the Reagan
administration's constructive engagement of apartheid South Africa
for delaying by several years the former South African colony's
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UN is important because it can give people freedom,''
Namibia's ambassador, Martin Andjaba, pointedly told Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said Congress began withholding UN dues in the 1980s to
pressure the UN to reform. In response, the UN has had a
zero-growth budget for the past six years and has reduced staff by
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, put
together a $926 million UN dues package last year signed by
President Clinton that is conditioned on a reduction of the US
contribution from 25 percent to 22 percent in the general UN budget
and from 31 percent to 25 percent in peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Helms warned Thursday that if the UN rejects a reduced US rate
``it would mark the beginning of the end of US support for the
United Nations'' and the remaining $726 million would not be
released.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Helms was asked by reporters whether anything
he heard had changed his perception of the UN. ``Not really,'' he
said. ``I expected the various comments that were made and they are
valid. But we've got to bring this thing to a meeting of minds and
the best way is for everyone to sit down together and talk about
it.''

   Ten years ago, the Census Bureau began the 1990 census in remote
parts of Alaska in the dead of winter two months before forms were
mailed out to the rest of the country. Bureau officials say it is
more efficient to try to count in person the estimated 50,000
people, mostly Inuits, who are scattered about the 250 million
square miles in the state's remotest areas. In winter, census
takers can travel by snow mobile and dog sled, before people
scatter to even more isolated hunting and fishing areas in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the logistical, demographic and political challenges
facing the Census Bureau are as daunting as the trackless
wilderness outside Unalakleet.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   This year's census is by far the most expensive in American
history, even taking inflation into account. So far, the 2000
headcount is scheduled to cost $6.8 billion, a huge increase over
the $2.6 billion spent in 1990. Yet all the expense will not
protect the Census Bureau from challenges in the political arena
and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in a period with very balanced political control
between Republicans and Democrats,'' said Margo Anderson, a
professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee
and an expert on the census. ``So both parties see opportunities in
the census, the redistricting process and the presidential election
to resolve the current stalemate to their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is hoping it can slow a decades-old decline in the
proportion of people who take the time to fill out their census
forms and mail them back. In 1990, 65 percent of American
households that received the form completed and returned it, down
from the 78 percent who did so in 1970. This year, the bureau is
planning on a 61 percent return rate.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, only 52 percent of the households that received the
forms sent them back in, the lowest mail response rate in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say social trends that have caused mail-back rates to
plummet have strengthened during the last 10 years. There are more
two-earner families with less time to fill out forms. People
receive more junk mail that is thrown out without a glance. The
proportion of the population made up by immigrants, who tend to be
less likely to complete the form, increased to 9.7 percent in 1997,
up from 7.9 percent in 1990. And such signs of civic participation
as voting rates are down.

   ``We're kind of in our own little worlds,'' said Robert Putnam,
a professor of public policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
and author of ``Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American
Community,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster). ``We don't feel an obligation to
our communities and don't connect with our communities.'' He added:
``This is why Ken Prewitt's goal to reverse this decline is such a
big challenge. He's running up a down escalator.''

<P>
   Census Bureau officials are planning a $102.8 million
advertising campaign _ the largest ever for a census _ aimed at
members of minority groups, renters and those living in mobile
homes, who tend not to return their census forms. Executives of
Young &AMP; Rubicam, which is handling the campaign, estimate that many
African-Americans will see the census commercials as many as 120
times and some Hispanics could see them as many 105 times by the
end of April.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is also working with local governments and community
groups in an effort to persuade people to return the forms.
Starting on March 27, a short time after the forms are first sent
out and running until April 11, the bureau will post on the
Internet the mail-back rate for every city, town and village in the
country, hoping that publicizing the response rates will spur
competitions among municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is pleased with the Census Bureau's efforts.
William Spriggs, director of research and public policy at the
National Urban League, said that beyond informing community groups
of the importance of the census, the bureau had come up with few
concrete ideas on how community organizations could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, they have not done more than visit our
affiliates and say the census is important,'' Spriggs said. ``We've
known that for five years. So we are left relying on them because
we're not really in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The bureau will also be trying to hire more than 500,000
temporary workers, in an economy with a jobless rate of 4.1 per
cent, the lowest it has been since the 1960s. Because there is such
a high turnover in these jobs, the bureau says it will need an
applicant pool of about 3 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials are also striving to improve on their
performance from 1990 when, according to later studies, more than 8
million people were missed and another 4 million were counted
twice. The undercount was particularly severe among children,
African Americans living in central cities and Hispanics residing
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that we're worried about is that the causes for the
undercount in 1990 haven't gone away; in some ways they've
increased,'' said Marisa Demeo, regional counsel for the Washington
office of the Mexican American legal Defense and Education Fund.
``So we know there still will be an undercount, even with the
bureau's best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a large undercount, officials plan to conduct a
nationwide survey of a randomly selected sample of 300,000
households. It will use the results to adjust population counts in
geographic areas containing on average 100 people. That statistical
sampling, while scientifically sound, has run afoul of partisan
politics. Because a large percentage of those missed, mainly racial
and ethnic minorities, tend to live in Democratic areas, adjusting
their population totals upward will give Democrats an advantage
when states draw new boundaries for congressional and state
legislative districts for the new decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential pitfalls, the bureau is ``more ready'' at
this point than in previous count years, said John Thompson,
associate director for the decennial census.
</P>

<P>
   Oblivious to the concerns of the Census Bureau, the residents of
Unalakleet were thrilled to be the first place to be counted.
Scores of school children greeted Prewitt's flight from Anchorage
on Wednesday with hand-made welcome signs. He was given a
traditional parka trimmed in wolverine fur. Changing on the snowy
tarmac out of his black wing tips and into white insulated boots,
the he was whisked into town by dog sled.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials selected Unalakleet to kick off the new count
because of the town's reputation for welcoming outsiders. Indeed,
it is stop every March on the Iditarod dog race, and the
townspeople are used to the presence of news media and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days we used to get folks like Terry Bradshaw and
Lynn Swann,'' said Tim Towarak, the city administrator. ``But this
is much more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``This is affecting the whole community.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Bill Bradley does not have advisers in the
traditional sense _ and does not need any, according to a number of
those who are acting, as the candidate's friend Dan Okimoto put it,
``more as a sounding board, raising doubts here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His mastery obviates the need for close policy advisers,''
said Okimoto, a college buddy, now a professor of international
relations at Stanford, and someone with whom Bradley discusses a
number of matters, including foreign policy. ``There is no such
structure in place on foreign policy or any other issue. The
candidate is in charge of tone, direction, vision and those around
him provide support. Both in a political sense and on policy, Bill
Bradley is his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But after several perceived missteps recently _ a somewhat
confused response during an agriculture debate here, and especially
the decision to spend so much time in Iowa, where his campaign
appears to be lagging, instead of concentrating on New Hampshire,
where he's in a tight race _ even some supporters say the holes in
the campaign are starting to show.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Trippi, an unaligned Democratic consultant who ran Walter
Mondale's Iowa campaign in 1984 and has had generally positive
things to say about Bradley's campaign over the last year, said,
``He really is running his campaign the way he wants to run it, and
I'm not sure he's taking any advice. That's always a bad sign. The
move to Iowa definitely was a risky gambit and I don't think I
would have advised it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, it is only after next Monday's caucuses that
``we'll see if Iowa was a big mistake _ or brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of Bradley's sounding boards, his wife, Ernestine
Schlant, a professor of comparative literature, has a theory about
politics that might apply: Any candidate's greatest asset almost
always turns out to be his greatest liability as well, she said in
an interview last summer, citing Bill Clinton and his personal
warmth and empathy as an example.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While both Bradley's broad knowledge and his determination to
``run a different kind of campaign,'' as he likes to say, have been
keys to his appeal, they have also left him vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore
and the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, have
been criticized for relying too much on consultants of all sorts.
But those in opposing camps _ advisers themselves, of course, with
a clear interest in the perceived importance of their work _ insist
that the lack of a more formal advisory structure in the Bradley
campaign is a problem. And say a truly smart candidate is smart
enough to know he needs help.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really arrogant and characteristically Bradley,'' said a
Bush adviser. ``The truth is that politics is a team sport. The
quarterback gets the credit, but you still need a defensive line,
and I haven't seen that in Bradley's camp, which is a huge
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics have called Bradley glacially slow in responding to
attacks, particularly on his health care plan, leaving Gore's
assertion t hat it would end up hurting poor people virtually
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   And because he chose to disarm unilaterally, when he finally did
fight back, for example by criticizing Gore's complicated history
with tobacco companies, what may have been perfectly legitimate
questions were seen as out of bounds because he had set himself up
as a candidate who was above that kind of give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   On those and other campaign decisions, it is not that Bradley
listens to no one, but that , on the contrary, he listens to a
great number of people _ and then makes the important calls
himself. It was Bradley who chose child poverty, health care, race
relations and gun control as the central issues in his campaign.
And who, to a surprising degree, mapped out the plans he wanted to
see put in place.
</P>
<P>
   His staff insists that he does not micromanage, and is happy to
leave mechanical, logistical details like booking planes and
deciding which field directors go where to others. Even in this,
though, ``he does like to be keep informed, and will tell us if
we're going the wrong direction,'' said his campaign chairman,
Douglas Berman.
</P>
<P>
   And the list of ways Bradley is in control of his campaign is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Back when nobody but Bradley, Berman and a couple of other
Bradley die-hards thought it was possible to raise even a fraction
of the money the campaign has raised, the senator showed how it
could be done, by pulling in people who had not been politically
active before.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Aronoff, his point person on policy, said that he had
been refining ideas for a health care plan for years and reached
out to hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   '`I don't think you're going to see every decision coming back
through him, but on health care _ the cornerstone _ or child
poverty, he takes an active interest. Or improving race relations.
Or key economic and foreign policy decisions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Cutler, a Harvard economics professor considered one of
the chief architects of his health care plan, said, ``I don't
consider myself to be an incredibly important adviser.'' Told that
nobody else seemed to, either, he said, ``I had a sneaking
suspicion that was true.
</P>
<P>
   He's a very intelligent man, so he didn't need the getting up to
speed that a lot of candidates need.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is so loose, he added, that ``I don't think I've
ever actually met him. And I don't know if he's ever made a formal
decision that, `Oh, now you're x adviser.' I found him very
impressive _ and I don't know him well, so it's kind of the same
way I find the pope impressive _ but he listens to a lot of
voices.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Al Garber, a Stanford professor who was one of those ``putting
the details together'' for the basic plan that Bradley wanted said
the most surprising part of the process was the lack of
``dissension'' among those discussing the options. ``Everyone liked
Bill's idea, and it really is his plan,'' he said. ``He
incorporated diverse views and listened to a lot of people, but
within the campaign there was tremendous consensus, and that
probably reflects Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   On political strategy, too, he is also the final arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   And his staff includes a number of people who have been with him
so long that they often reflect the way he thinks. His campaign
chairman, Berman, who met Bradley when he was an adoring high
school senior, on the morning after the Knicks won an NBA
championship, has been with him since his first Senate campaign in
1977. His finance director, Rick Wright, played basketball with him
at Princeton 35 years ago. Ms. Aronoff was his longtime chief of
staff in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, a friend and former aide to Bradley says, ``It would
only be a slight hyperbole to say Doug is the first person he calls
in the morning and the last one he talks to at night. On political
strategy, it's Doug and Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Berman describes his job this way: ``If I have a role,'' he
said, ``it's being clear and helping people understand the values
that course through the organization as a reflection of Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the proof that Bradley was not too much of a one-man
show was in the campaign's organizing successes: `We filed in 31 of
31 districts in New York, he was first to file in Oklahoma, we
raised twice as much money as the vice president in the fourth
quarter, and more people in California signed up to be delegates
for Bill Bradley than the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   And Berman suggested that the campaign had, in fact, taken some
recent hits on purpose. When asked about Bradley's confused
response to a question about whether he had voted against flood
relief while in the Senate _ in fact, he had voted for the bill,
but against an amendment, Berman said, ``We never talk about
specific decisions. But Bradley has said, `I want to run a campaign
as an extension of the way I want to govern, to restore rust and
bring back civility.' And if you say that, you have to operate that
way. It's not that at times there's not the impulse to operate at a
different level. But those who elevate tactics, we disagree with.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, of course, the Bradley campaign's position that
it is above all that is itself a tactic. Whatever advice Bradley
does get is purposely underplayed by the campaign, which does not
want to be seen as doing much of anything in the usual way.
``Advisers,'' Berman said, ``are never the story.''
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Ravitch, who has reviewed some ideas about housing
and urban development with members of Bradley's staff, suggested
that the status of some of them was still a bit of a mystery _ even
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd you get my name?'' Ravitch asked. Told he was
considered someone Bradley listens to, he said, ``Glad to hear
it.''

 &HT;    Bush says ``Roe v-- . Wade was a reach''
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELLA, Iowa _ Inching closer to a litmus test that he so far has
refused to adopt, GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush said
Thursday that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would not
issue rulings like the one that ended state bans on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe v-- . Wade was a reach,'' Bush said. ``It overstepped the
constitutional bounds as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bush has avoided taking a vow adopted by some of his
GOP opponents that would exclude the appointment of any justice who
would support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments came while under increased fire from Republican
foes for not being more firm in his stand against abortion rights.
Challenger Steve Forbes, campaigning in Iowa in advance of the
Monday caucuses that kick off the delegate selection season, this
week called Bush a ``pro-life pacifist.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after a speech at Central College here,
Bush renewed his promise to appoint ``strict constructionists'' to
the Supreme Court. He defined that as judges who would ``strictly
interpret the Constitution and not use the bench as a way to
legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, except for the Roe v-- . Wade decision, declined to offer
examples of high court cases that either upheld that doctrine or
ran afoul of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into Supreme Court rulings. I'm not a
lawyer,'' said Bush, who long ago was denied admission to the
University of Texas School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that his belief that the Roe v-- . Wade decision
ran afoul of strict constructionism should not ``invite
speculation'' that he would make opposition to abortion rights a
litmus test in picking judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to name strict constructionists to the court,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in response to reporters' questions, defended his
anti-abortion credentials. Unlike other GOP contenders, Bush's
standard stump speech includes no mention of abortion, a major
issue among a large segment of Republican voters here _ a tactic
seen as politically pragmatic but one that also makes Bush
vulnerable to criticism from supporters and opponents of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a record. I've promoted adoptions in the state of
Texas. I signed a parental notification law. I worked hard for
abstinence education in the state of Texas. I've got a good strong
record. I've actually done in office. I've performed. You might
have to ask him about that,'' Bush said of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes abortion should be legal only in cases involving
rape, incest or pregnancies that endanger the mother. Despite his
anti-abortion rights stance, Bush has said he does not believe the
nation is ready to approve a constitutional amendment restricting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday what he would recommend for a relative who became
pregnant as a result of rape, Bush said he would ``hope to be able
to ... comfort her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would counsel against undergoing an abortion, Bush
said, ``It's up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, campaigning in Iowa, did not like the answer, saying it
is ``not enough just to say one is pro-life.''

ROME SHINES FORTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Paul II has summoned tens of millions of Roman Catholic
pilgrims to Rome for the 2,000 Jubilee, a Holy Year that is the
most ambitious ever planned by the Vatican. Taking a cue from the
many Romans who plan to flee, crowd-fearing tourists may decide to
skip the Italian capital altogether this coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct is understandable, but it would be a pity.
</P>
<P>
   Woven into the Vatican's elaborate plans for millennial
religious events is one of the more extensive beautification
projects Rome has seen in a century, a sprawling canvas of restored
or cleaned churches, palaces, museums and piazzas that has brought
long-forgotten light and space to the ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   Rome, unlike other, younger European cities, did not erect any
new, grandiose monuments for the year 2000 such as the Millennium
Dome in London. Instead, it has taken a more humble approach of
sprucing up the oeuvre of preceding generations.
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian critics saw this as cowardice or inertia or both,
but the result is that more than any other city, Rome in the year
2000 will recapture some of the feeling it had in millenniums past.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking feature, and the one that most inspires fear
and anger in the hearts of Romans, is the way the city has used the
Jubilee as an excuse to reclaim streets, squares and public spaces
that for years have served as rush-hour shortcuts and parking lots,
and has turned them into pedestrian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, walking in the Piazza del Popolo, a large
neo-Classical square that frames twin baroque churches by Carlo
Rainaldi and Bernini, was about as pleasant as crossing an
interstate at rush hour. Cars and motorbikes whizzed around and
around the 1200 B.C. Egyptian obelisk (brought to Rome by Augustus
2,000 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   Now, cars have been rerouted, and the center of the piazza is
reserved for pedestrians and horse-drawn carriages. Walking across
the Piazza del Popolo these days feels a little like it must have
when Giuseppe Valadier designed it in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the Campo dei Fiori, where the philosopher
Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for heresy in 1600 and which
now serves as the city's most colorful outdoor food market. Campo
dei Fiori was closed down for most of 1999 to put in new sewers,
relaid the cobblestones and eliminate the narrow street and
sidewalk around the square.
</P>
<P>
   Cars, which once circled like predatory sharks around the fruit
stands and fishmongers, are banned. Visitors can shop or sit at the
outdoor cafes that line the square without fear of being run over
or mixing exhaust fumes with their espressos.
</P>
<P>
   The city has similarly reclaimed some 100 piazzas, infuriating
residents who now have no place to leave their cars, and who as
recently as the 1970s, could park with impunity even in St. Peter's
Square.
</P>
<P>
   At some places, the absence of cars _ as in a small square in
front of Chiesa Nuova _ is almost imperceptible. At other places,
like Piazza Trilussa, in Trastevere on the west side of the Tiber
facing the newly restored Ponte Sisto, there is a startlingly
agreeable contrast with the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, risked a public lynching
by decreeing that the reclaimed piazzas will be kept clear of cars
not just for the Jubilee but for the years that follow, though that
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, automobiles are a little like the weeds that grow in
the cracks of the Aurelian walls _ no matter how much you trim them
back, they keep sprouting up anew.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors may be tempted to steer clear of St. Peter's and
other basilicas where pilgrims will congregate by the tens of
thousands, and that can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Domus Aurea, the ruins of Nero's palace across
from the Colosseum, will be almost irresistible. In stark contrast
to the monuments to the power of Renaissance and
Counter-Reformation popes, tourists can relive the wicked ways of
the emperor who slaughtered early Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems almost churlish to completely eschew a
centuries-old pageant that takes place only once every 25 years
(though the more ambitious popes sometimes call extraordinary
jubilees; John Paul II did so in 1983, to commemorate the 1,950th
anniversary of the death of Jesus, and that was seen as a kind of
dress rehearsal for this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Since 1300, the year Pope Boniface VIII first summoned the
faithful to Rome because the crusades had made travel to the Holy
Land too risky, pilgrims have been rewarded with a plenary
indulgence, a remission of punishment for sins. Pope John Paul has
broadened the process for earning an indulgence (a visit to the
Rome airport chapel counts, and so does quitting smoking for a
day), but traditionalists will still visit at least one of Rome's
four main basilicas.
</P>
<P>
   St. Peter's will, of course, be the spiritual epicenter of the
Jubilee, though the Vatican has planned to hold its largest
gatherings, like the Mass concluding the 15th World Youth Day on
Aug. 20, in a field outside the city. The restored 17th-century
facade of St. Peter's, which was unveiled last September after
remaining under scaffolding for almost two years, is less somber,
thanks to restorers' recovery of the original tones, which include
green and reds around the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Even nonbelievers may be tempted to brave long lines to cross
through the Holy Door, which the pope opened on Christmas Eve, in a
solemn ritual that dates back to 1450, symbolizing the start of a
Jubilee. The door is bricked over when the Holy Year ends.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most compelling stops on the pilgrims' route is
St. John Lateran, the first Christian basilica, between the
Colosseum and the Basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. It was
built by Emperor Constantine in the early fourth century and
renovated in the 17th century by Borromini. It was the church of
the Popes until the 14th century, and served as the model for many
early Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
   A little like Boston or St. Petersburg in the shadow of New York
and Moscow, St. John Lateran has a slightly forlorn, second-place
feel to it that has its own melancholy appeal. (In Henry James'
``Portrait of a Lady,'' Isabel Archer went there to seek
``companionship in endurance'' when her marriage unraveled.)
</P>
<P>
   Even though some of its art treasures and holy relics were moved
to St. Peter's, St. John Lateran remains extraordinarily beautiful,
rich in both medieval mosaics and baroque sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee history buffs may want to inspect the small portrait of
Boniface VIII proclaiming the first Holy Year, a fragment of a
fresco believed to have been executed by Giotto, above the
middle-right aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Across from St. John Lateran, is the Scala Santa, a holy
staircase that, according to legend, was taken from the palace of
Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem and was trod upon by Jesus. Pilgrims
ascend the stairs on their knees to the Sancta Sanctorum, an
indulgence-earning rite of humility that also holds a certain
fascination for protestants; some biographers believe that Martin
Luther was in the act of climbing the stairs when he had a sudden
flash of reformist inspiration, and quit midstep.
</P>
<P>
   The steps lead to the pope's private chapel, which is now open
to the public and includes a portrait on wood of Jesus painted by
St. Luke _ and according to legend, completed by an angel.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most alluring feature, however, is a newly
landscaped pedestrian piazza in front of the basilica, which melts
into a large park, a lovely, tree-lined pedestrian path along the
Porta San Giovanni, that leads from St. John Lateran to the
Basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, another holy shrine revered
for its relics of the true cross.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Maria Maggiore is a fourth-century church and the only one
of the main basilicas that has mostly retained its original form.
Its fifth-century mosaics depicting scenes from the lives of Jesus
and Mary are among the most impressive of the period. There, too,
the outside area has been relandscaped to accommodate visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Basilica-Hopping, however, will be something of a challenge.
Transportation in Rome, reliably unreliable at the best of times,
is not likely to grow efficient in 2000. Even the government agency
in charge of boosting the city's jubilee preparations bluntly warns
visitors on its Web site, www.comune.roma.it, ``It is not easy to
get around Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   The city, which has banned private tour buses from parking near
the Vatican, has laid on 112 blue Jubilee buses to shuttle pilgrims
and tourists from lots outside the city to religious sites around
the center. The Vatican built a six-story underground garage to
accommodate 800 cars and 115 buses.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, perhaps, today's pilgrims will be able to travel
from shrine to shrine by car and bus, while ordinary tourists will
be best off touring the city on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The area around the Piazza del Campidoglio, designed by
Michelangelo in the ancient heart of Rome, has been completely
cleaned. The Capitoline Museums _ repository of sculptures
including the original equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, and
the celebrated ``Dying Galatian'' _ and the Capitoline picture
gallery _ with works by Caravaggio, Titian and Rubens _ have been
completely renovated and enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   Not far, even by foot, are the former papal stables at the
Quirinale, an 18th-century building restored last year and opened
for the first time ever to the public in December. Rome is not
known for its modern exhibition spaces, but the stables were
re-designed to allow contemporary-style shows, ranging this year
from an exhibition of French Impressionist paintings from the
Hermitage in St. Petersburg to a Botticelli show, to an exhibition
of photographs by Sebastiao Salgado.
</P>
<P>
   Italian museums, long derided for shoddy lighting, indifferent
guides and baffling hours, have undergone a major overhaul. Hours
have been extended and visitor services, from bookshops to
cafeterias, have been expanded; Rome is one of the main
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Villa Borghese, Rome's most famous public park, has seen
some of the most dramatic improvements. The Borghese Gallery was
reopened three years ago after a 13-year restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Next to it, the secret gardens, so-called because the Borghese
family rather ungenerously kept their private fruit and vegetable
patches walled from view, were reland-scaped and reopened in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Villa Giulia, the museum of Etruscan Art, has been
completely overhauled, adding new sections that give more
intelligent display to its ancient artifacts, including the
Castellani collection of ceramics, bronzes and gold jewelry, which
has not been seen for more than 10 years. Just down the Viale delle
Belle Arti, the National Gallery of Modern Art is now completely
renovated and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   New museums are also opening. For 20 years, Palazzo Poli, the
imposing 18th-century palace to which the Trevi fountain is
attached, lay idle. In May, it will become part of the National
Institute for Graphic Arts and hold the world's most important
collection of copper-plate engravings, including all the engravings
of Piranesi, the 18th-century artist famous for his views of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual museums is just off the Piazza del
Popolo. The Hendrik Christian Anderson Museum, which opened in
December, was once the home of Anderson, an American sculptor and
painter who was born in Norway and lived in Rome from 1896 to his
death in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be used for short-term exhibits, but also reverently
displays the owner's sculptures, paintings and drawings for his
utopian vision of a ``World City.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rome's least-loved building, the Victor Emmanuel II
Monument on the Piazza Venezia, an opulent 262-foot-high white
marble confection known to Italians as ``the wedding cake'' and
``the typewriter,'' was included in the restoration effort. The
building, begun in 1885 and completed in 1911, was meant to glorify
Italian unity under the Savoy monarchy, but now mostly symbolizes
fin-de-siecle bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaning has brought back its original brightness. The
better news is that a vast, high-tech visitors center was
constructed inside, which can help guide visitors to other, newly
appealing parts of the city.

BUSH ATTACKS USE OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELLA, Iowa _ Texas Governor George W. Bush, his conservative
credentials under scrutiny four days before the Iowa caucuses, drew
his firmest line yet on abortion Thursday, saying he would reject
the abortion pill if it were approved by the Federal Drug
Administration and dismissing the Supreme Court decision Roe v.
Wade as ``a reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the 1973 court decision that legalized abortions
``overstepped the constitutional bounds.'' But he refused to say if
he would choose a Supreme Court nominee based on the person's views
on abortion views, instead repeating his vow to nominate judges
only on their strict reading of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The comments followed a television advertisement by millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes accusing Bush of being a ``pro-life
pacifist.'' Campaign aides insisted Bush's remarks were nothing
new. But they were in stark contrast to Bush's recent silence on
abortion during speeches, and they fit into a familiar candidate
strategy in the waning hours before the Iowa caucuses: playing to
more conservative voters in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has hardly raised the topic on the campaign trail in recent
days, hammering voters instead with his other pet themes: tax cuts,
the military, restoring dignity to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But he frequently responds to abortion questions when asked, and
Thursday the comments came at a news conference after a speech at
Central College here. Seeming reluctant to pursue the issue at
first, Bush eventually reiterated how he would handle selecting
justices for the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would appoint strict constructionists,'' he said. Asked to
clarify that, he said: ``Someone who views the Constitution and
strictly uses the Constitution for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the abortion pill called RU-486, Bush also made his stance
clearer. If the FDA were to approve it, he said, ``I would be
inclined not to accept that ruling by the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of his presidential term in 1993, President
Clinton changed a number of abortion-related policies established
by Bush's father when he was president.
</P>
<P>
   Among Clinton's policy changes was his acceptance of the
French-made pharmaceutical that terminates a pregnancy in its
earliest days. Since then, the FDA has determined that RU-486 is
``safe and effective.'' But the agency is waiting to formally
approve the pill until all manufacturing and labeling details have
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous administration, President Bush had refused to
act on getting approval for RU-486 and had opposed abortion rights.
His wife Barbara, however, has said she does not believe abortion
should be a part of the Republican Party plank. News accounts have
also reported she supports legalized abortion outright.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush would not discuss his mother's position on
abortion Thursday. Nor would he say whether he had discussed the
issue with his 18-year-old twin girls. ``I'm not going to talk
about my daughters' point of view. They're part of my private
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He offered only one personal glimpse. Asked how he would advise,
theoretically, a female friend who had been raped and become
pregnant, Bush said he hoped he ``would be able to evoke enough
sympathy'' for her. Asked what he would suggest her to do, Bush
replied: ``It's up to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The abortion remarks briefly overshadowed the chief debate of
the Republican presidential primary thus far: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona have been sparring for
days over each other's tax cut proposals, focusing on a component
of McCain's $237 billion plan that would tax some employer benefits
such as transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had singled out that part of the plan as harmful, saying it
would raise taxes by $40 billion. McCain fiercely objected, saying
the amount would be no more than $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After arguing that particular point for days _ and, in Bush's
case, releasing a campaign ad about it _ Bush Thursday indicated he
might be willing to accept he had been wrong in summarizing the
figures in McCain's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended his criticisms of McCain's overall tax plan,
however, which is nearly half the size of his own. He also pointed
out that his remarks about McCain were based directly on the policy
paper the Arizona senator released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently he changed his plan,'' Bush said. ``I just wanted to
know, John, why? I think the people needed to know exactly what was
in the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Bush's detailed attacks, McCain said: ``My eyes glaze over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made taxes the centerpiece of his public appearances in
Iowa and New Hampshire, touting his more than $483 billion tax cut
alongside a mantra of returning money to taxpayers. Thursday, he
announced a new ``tax calculator'' on his Web site, saying it will
allow voters to calculate their savings under his plan.

 &HT;    Gore solidifies spot in Texas
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As they trudged through Iowa and New Hampshire
this week, Democratic presidential hopefuls Al Gore and Bill
Bradley may have missed an important development in Pasadena,
Texas: Ceole Speight put on a campaign button.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, an AFL-CIO employee, was undecided for months. Last
fall, she was leaning toward Bradley because she was worried about
Gore's electability. But after hearing about Gore at the Texas
AFL-CIO convention in Austin this week, Speight finally picked her
pin: Gore 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Her choice may be emblematic of broader trends in Texas, which
will hold its presidential primary March 14. Several months ago, as
Bradley surged in the polls and the Gore campaign lurched toward a
much-needed overhaul, the Texas race looked like a toss-up. But
Gore has since solidified his position with organized labor,
Hispanics, and other traditionally Democratic constituencies, and
now he looks tough to beat in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man is going to be fantastic. He's done an awful lot for
labor,'' Speight said of her newfound champion. ``Anything but
(Republican George W.) Bush _ and I think Gore has the best chance
of beating him.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released last Friday showed Gore with a comfortable 54
percent to 25 percent lead over Bradley in Texas. The Dallas
Morning News/Houston Chronicle survey, which had a margin of error
of 6 percentage points, also showed Gore running slightly better
than Bradley in a match-up against Bush. And last week the Tejano
Democrats, who only endorse when they can muster a two-thirds
majority, backed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Teachers Association, the Texas Federation of
Teachers and the state AFL-CIO don't endorse national candidates,
but their national affiliates have lined up behind Gore in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got teachers, labor, the Tejano Democrats and 400
elected Hispanic officials _ there aren't many places for Bradley
to go,'' said Garry Mauro, the Democrats' 1998 gubernatorial
nominee and a co-chairman of Gore's Texas campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley supporters say it's too early to assess the former New
Jersey senator's chances in Texas. They contend that if Bradley
does well in Iowa on Jan. 24 and in New Hampshire on Feb. 1, he'll
get a boost in New York and California on March 7. And if he does
well in those primaries, he could cruise into Texas with a powerful
tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early primary states, where Bradley has already engaged
voters, his popularity has skyrocketed,'' said Harold Cook, the
former head of the Texas Democratic Party and a Bradley adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has raised about $600,000 of his $27 million from Texas
donors, but he hasn't yet opened a campaign office in the state.
The Gore campaign, which couldn't say how much the vice president
has collected in Texas, plans to open offices Tuesday, though they
wouldn't release details. Both campaigns say they have Texas
leaders in place, and will be ready to push hard here once the New
Hampshire primary is over.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee also
will hold primaries on March 14, but Texas and Florida loom largest
because they offer the most delegates. Mauro said Gore may have
clinched the nomination before March 14, but Cook says Bradley's
fund-raising success _ he's collected about as much as Gore
nationally _ means the race will ``go down to the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore had the lion's share of the Democratic insiders
wrapped up long ago. But in the final analysis, the March 14
primary isn't going to be about the Democratic leadership, it's
going to be about primary voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook added that Bradley courted the Tejano Democrats ``out of
respect'' but knew he didn't have a legitimate shot at getting
their endorsement because they are Democratic insiders, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Martin, a former head of the Texas Democratic Party who
hasn't chosen sides in the Gore-Bradley race, said the support of
Democratic leaders is critical because it translates into a
superior campaign organization. Martin said ``the inherent
strengths and advantages that a vice president tends to have'' are
likely to be pivotal in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those strengths were evident during the competition for the
Tejano Democrats' endorsement. Both candidates have met with the
Tejano Democrats during the campaign, and both sent close family
members _ Gore sent his daughter and Bradley sent his wife _ to the
convention last week. Both mailed campaign literature to members
and had people working the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing Gore and Bradley by phone, the group's
leaders were hard-pressed to distinguish between them on the
issues. But in the end, Bradley failed to sway the one-third of
delegates he needed to block a Gore endorsement. Sen. Gonzalo
Barrientos, who heads the Tejano Democrats, said party loyalty _
and connections _ made the difference. ``One of the things it says
is that Vice President Gore has a little advantage insofar as being
able to work the party machinery,'' said Barrientos, who hasn't
endorsed either candidate.

IN MAKEOVER OF HOUSE OF LORDS, PANEL WANTS SOME ELECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs to fix run-on words `act on' in 4th graf from end.) 
(bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The House of Lords should include, for the first time
in history, some members who have been elected by the British
public, a commission studying the future of the Lords recommended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission stopped well short of suggesting that the
chamber be wholly elected, saying that the vast majority of its
members should be appointed by a special board that would be free
of political control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure that the reformed second chamber will no
longer be a source of political patronage,'' said Lord Wakeham,
chairman of the Royal Commission on the Reform of the House of
Lords, presenting a fat report filled with proposals at a news
conference Thursday morning. ``The prime minister will no longer be
able to control the size, political balance or individual
membership of the second chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords has been existing in a strange holding
pattern since November, when Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
government ended hundreds of years of history by removing the right
of hundreds of hereditary peers, whose titles pass from generation
to generation, to sit and vote in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Lords has been made up of 92 hereditaries, as
they are called, and 544 life peers, appointed over the years by
the government in power at the time, who hold their seats, and
their titles, until they die.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been particularly satisfied with this interim
arrangement: not the Labor Party, which wants all the hereditaries
gone for good; not the Conservative Party, which saw much of its
power leave along with the hereditaries, and not the peers
themselves, who know they are living on borrowed time.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of what to do now with Parliament's upper
house, a historically powerful body that was stripped of most of
its authority nearly 100 years ago, has proved a troublesome one
for Blair. He is not eager for a reconstituted house to have
increased responsibilities and power that can challenge his
political sway.

   The proposals by Lord Wakeham's 12-member committee seek to
alter the Lords without effecting particularly radical changes.
According to the report, a small percentage of Lords _ either 65,
87, or 195 people, depending on various models it sets out _ should
be elected from among regular Britons in various regions. The rest
of the members should be appointed by an independent commission,
with 20 percent of them to have no party affiliation and at least
30 percent to be women.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber would still include church representatives. But in
an effort to reflect Britain's changing demographics, some of the
current ones, who are all Anglicans, would be replaced by
non-Anglican Christians and five would be added from non-Christian
religions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, no one would become a member of the Lords
because of heredity or because of an appointment by the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new second chamber should bring a far wider range of
experience and expertise to bear on the consideration of proposed
legislation and other policy issues,'' Lord Wakeham said. ``It's
members should come from all walks of life and be representatives
of the whole of British society.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposals, the new upper chamber would not have
substantially greater power than the old one, which is allowed to
delay legislation for up to a year but cannot kill it. But Lord
Wakeham said the Lords should be given a broader mandate to
scrutinize constitutional and human-rights legislation and to hold
the House of Commons to account in its handling of European Union
business.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY CAN ALSO END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the proposals said that the commission had wasted a
one-time-only chance. ``People have been going on in this country
for decades about Parliament being too weak and too much power
residing in the executive,'' said Robert Blackburn, a professor of
constitutional law at King's College, London, who supports the
formation of a wholly elected second chamber with greater authority
over legislation. ``This would have been a great opportunity to
redress the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would study the report and then decide
whether to act on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provides a sound platform for moving forward on a genuine
cross-party basis,'' said Baroness Jay, the Labor leader of the
House of Lords, adding that the government would ``need time to
consider'' the substance of the report.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Conservative Party said that it doubted
whether Blair's government was committed to real reform at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt very much that they are going to want to take this
on,'' said Lord Strathclyde, the Tory leader in the House of Lords.
``They have got the house they want, a sort of crony house, and I
think that will continue for many years indeed.''

GORE, BRADLEY CONTINUE EXCHANGING BARBS IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNCIL BLUFF, Iowa _ Winding down the days to the Iowa
caucuses, Al Gore and Bill Bradley traded barbs on who cares more
about the nation's first presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Vice President Gore accused the former New Jersey
senator of being disrespectful to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent ... has spent more money here than any Democratic
candidate in the history of the United States of America,'' Gore
told an enthusiastic crowd in the Iowa Western Community College
gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after all of that money ...he has evidently developed a
new vision of the Iowa caucuses. He said `Iowa rewards entrenched
power,''' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that fighting to reduce the high cost of
pharmaceuticals, fighting to save Medicare...that's not entrenched
power. That is fighting for people!'' Gore declared with a thrust
of his fist, drawing wild applause from the audience of mostly
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was quoting from a news report of Bradley's comments
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator respects
Iowans and their caucuses. And the Bradley campaign unearthed
quotes they attributed to Gore during his 1988 campaign for
president, in which he called the Iowa caucuses ``madness'' and a
contest that ``distorts the process.''
</P>
<P>
   With several days of campaigning to go before Iowa Democrats
gather Monday in living rooms and community centers to vote for a
presidential nominee, the fight has come down to perception of
victory, instead of absolute victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to convince the nation that a loss here does not
mean his challenge to the sitting vice president has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters after an appearance in eastern Iowa,
Bradley fended off speculation _ encouraged by the Gore campaign _
that his candidacy is stalling here and in New Hampshire. Bradley
trails in most Iowa polls by 20 points or more, and Gore aides say
their internal polling shows Bradley slipping in New Hampshire,
where the two have been in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're staying with our basic strategy... I'm upbeat about
this, quite frankly,'' Bradley said. Still, Bradley acknowledged
that Gore's relentless criticisms of his health-care plan may have
taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to a certain extent some voters might have been swayed
by that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's comments Thursday about Bradley's attitude toward Iowa
represented an expansion of his assaults on health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never criticized him personally and I never will,'' Gore
said Thursday. Soon afterward, he reminded the Iowa Democrats that
Bradley has said he admires the governing style of former President
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley kicked off a four-day bus tour through
eastern Iowa by making a vigorous pitch for his health-care plan.
He told an audience of senior citizens that his proposal was on par
with the creation of Social Security by Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Medicare by Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those leaders saw something big that needs to be done,
acted on it, and in so doing made all of our lives better,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was also determined to reassure his audience that
his $650 billion, 10-year plan would not leave Medicare or Social
Security at risk, as Gore has charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say you've got to choose _ that you can either
protect Medicare or provide health insurance for all Americans,''
said Bradley in a clear reference to Gore.``I say, `No, you can do
both.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also complained that most voters were unaware of the
``most underreported'' part of his proposal: tax deductions on
health-care costs that Bradley said will amount to a $25 billion
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign announced Thursday it will run two new
advertisements here this weekend, one featuring Nebraska Senator
Robert Kerrey, who announced Thursday that he will not seek
re-election this year, and another with former Boston Celtic star
Bill Russell, a friend from Bradley's pro basketball days. The
campaign also announced the endorsement of Betty Friedan, the
feminist author and co-founder of the National Organization for
Women.

ATTORNEY GENERAL ORDERS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF PRESIDENT FOR TAX
EVASION
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A snowballing investigation of the large sums of
money a French businessman gave President Ezer Weizman entered a
new phase on Thursday when Israel's attorney general ordered a
criminal investigation into possible tax evasion by Weizman.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first criminal investigation of an Israeli president,
whose tasks are largely ceremonial but who is the official head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   Although the presidency is supposed to be a largely symbolic
post and above politics, Weizman, 75, a former air force chief and
defense minister, has used the influence of the office to speak out
in support of Arab-Israeli peace efforts and on other issues. But
the questions about his financial affairs have weakened his public
voice, threatening to force him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein ordered the criminal inquiry
after police investigators submitted findings suggesting that
Weizman had business ties with Edouard Saroussi, the French
executive who reportedly gave Weizman hundreds of thousands of
dollars over several years when he served as a legislator and
Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   The transfers were disclosed three weeks ago by Yoav Yitzhak, an
Israeli investigative reporter, who asserted that Weizman had
received a total of $453,465 from Saroussi in monthly installments
from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman acknowledged receiving money from Saroussi, but said
that it was a personal gift from a friend that was not considered
taxable income and said that he was not legally obligated to
report.
</P>
<P>
   However, the police officers investigating the money transfers
said that they had discovered documentation indicating a business
relationship between Saroussi and Weizman, raising suspicions that
the transfers may not have been mere gifts but payment for
services.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Ministry statement said that there was ``apparent
evidence of a relationship of a business nature between Weizman and
a company linked to Saroussi between the years 1983-84, until after
Weizman assumed the post of Cabinet minister.'' The statement noted
that the business connection did not appear in documents submitted
to investigators by Weizman's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the findings, the attorney general and the state
attorney have directed the police to open an investigation along
with the tax authorities,'' the statement added. Investigators are
expected to question Weizman as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's lawyer, Yaacov Weinroth, emphatically denied any
wrongdoing by his client, saying that he had paid taxes on a
consultation fee received for advising a foreign company owned by
Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was reported to the income tax authorities,''
Weinroth said at a news conference broadcast live on television,
noting that Weizman did not hold public office at the time. ``The
president hid nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an opening statement, Weinroth declared: ``The president is
innocent, spotless,'' adding, ``The president will certainly not
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Weizman himself avoided any public comment on Thursday as he
went about his ceremonial rounds, receiving the president of
Armenia at his official residence in Jerusalem, and later traveling
to his home in the seaside resort of Caesarea for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Aryeh Shumer, said: ``The president is not
resigning. He is continuing at his post.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His honor the president demands to be investigated as would
any citizen, without privileges,'' Shumer added, reading from a
letter sent to the state attorney's office by Weizman's lawyers.
The letter urged that the investigation ``be completed with all
deliberate speed.''
</P>
<P>
   As news of the investigation spread across Israel, many
politicians seemed reluctant to call openly for the resignation of
the popular Weizman, despite the pervasive sense that his public
standing had been irreparably compromised. Those who have spoken,
have chosen their words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult hour for all of us, especially those of us
who know the president and respect his tremendous contribution to
the state,'' said Prime Minister Ehud Barak. ``I'm sure the
president will know how to act with regard to the inquiry and in
accordance with its findings.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said that Weizman should take a
leave of absence for several weeks. ``At this moment it would be
advisable for the president to take a vacation,'' Beilin said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak had to answer questions himself on Wednesday night when
the state comptroller came to his office to query him about
reported illegal fund-raising in his election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, is looking into allegations
that nonprofit organizations set up during the campaign funneled
funds illegally to Barak and his Labor Party. Barak has denied any
link to the reported violations. The comptroller's report is
expected next week.

LEADERS MEET OVER SENIOR DRUG BENEFIT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pharmaceutical industry leaders met Thursday with
top aides to President Clinton in a further sign that the
government may soon help seniors cover the cost of prescription
drugs through the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and Democratic leaders say they want to offer a
drug benefit, but they are at odds over the details. Drug companies
oppose a plan President Clinton laid out last year. The industry
fears any development that would give the government a hand in
setting prices, and it does not want the government to choose which
drugs would qualify for insurance reimbursement and which would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, industry officials decided to work with Clinton to
devise a benefit plan rather than fight an idea that has become
increasingly popular with voters, who complain of rising drug
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Before visiting the White House Thursday, two industry leaders,
Raymond Gilmartin, chief executive of Merck &AMP; Co. Inc., and Gordon
Binder, chief executive of Amgen Inc., met with Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, who strongly supports a drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and White House aides said that the two sides have
modified several long-held positions to agree on a set of
principles. While falling short of a complete roadmap for
legislation, the principles are a starting point for devising a
drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   According to aides, the agreement says that all Medicare
beneficiaries should be covered by the new benefit, with extra
assistance for low-income people. Previously, industry officials
had pushed for a smaller benefit targeted at low-income people,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to the industry, the agreement also says that
the benefit would be administered by a new, independent government
agency, rather than by the agency that runs Medicare. This new
agency might survey changes in the cost of prescription drugs each
year and determine the annual premium for the drug benefit, similar
to the way cost-of-living raises are determined for Social Security
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage would be offered through competing, private plans that
rely on marketplace competition to control costs. But the
government could devise ways to buy drugs in bulk and win volume
discounts, an idea President Clinton included in his proposal last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit would cover all drugs, suggesting that the
government could not favor one type of heart medication, for
example, over another.
</P>
<P>
   Aides also said that the industry is now willing to back the
benefit as a stand-alone piece of legislation. Previously, the
industry wanted the benefit to be included as part of a broad
Medicare reform, which in itself would face long odds of passage in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Representing Clinton at the White House meeting Thursday were
Chief of Staff John Podesta, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala and several other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the industry were Binder, who is also chairman of
the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
Gilmartin, Alan Holmer, the president of the trade group, and
Robert Wilson of Johnson &AMP; Johnson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The insatiable American appetite for German cars,
French perfume and Japanese televisions has helped the world's
wealthiest countries grow faster than at any time since the
mid-1990s, but the United States is warning that its allies need to
join in the gluttony.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit with the rest of the world set a new
all-time high in November, statistics released Thursday show. Led
by purchases of autos, electronics, oil and clothing abroad, the
United States posted a monthly trade deficit of $26.5 billion, a
nagging indicator that not everything is perfect in America's
otherwise rosy economic picture.
</P>
<P>
   Based on November's numbers, the U.S. deficit was on course to
reach $267 billion for all of last year, about $100 billion more
than 1998, which was itself a record year. The momentum is also
worrying. Imports grew at double the rate of exports.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the swelling trade gap is the Clinton administration's
top priority at a gathering of world finance ministers in Tokyo
this weekend. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, speaking in
advance of the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting, said that
Europe and Japan need to start thinking big and growing fast, much
like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both Europe and Japan, there's a complacency of low
expectations,'' Summers said. ``The world cannot indefinitely
sustain the present level of imbalances.''
</P>
<P>
   America's stellar growth means that it's consuming more than its
fair share of world output. Europe and Japan have the potential to
grow faster if they loosen up the reins on their economies and
worry less about inflation, Summers said. Ideally, both major
trading partners would then buy more U.S. goods and help even out
global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit has been a persistent concern for years,
of course. But U.S. policy-makers are frustrated by its
stubbornness during a period of relative prosperity abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit was supposed to level out, or begin contracting, now
that the rest of the world has started growing again after the
slump that began during the global financial crisis of 1997.
Instead, it continues to set new records, month after month.
</P>
<P>
   Though the deficit is a bigger burden on the economy now than it
was in the 1980s, it has a lower political profile. Few economists
or politicians question the competitiveness of the United States
now as they did then. With inflation staying low and the government
running a budget surplus, the United States is better equipped
today to handle a big deficit than it was 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some even argue that a surge of inexpensive imports has helped
propel the U.S. economy to its current heights. Imports seem to
have helped keep inflation down, allowing the Federal Reserve to
raise interest rates less than it otherwise would. And by buying
manufactured goods abroad for less than they can be made here,
capital has been freed up for investment in the hottest sectors of
U.S. economy, like technology and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the swell in the trade gap poses some dangers. It reveals
a persistent weakness in U.S. manufacturing industries, like
automobiles. Despite the fact that German and Japanese automakers
have invested billions of dollars in the United States to build
cars here _ meaning that the Toyota, Honda and even BMW and
Mercedes-Benz brand names no longer always signal an import _ the
American passion for high-end, foreign-made cars remains one of the
biggest overall contributors to the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   A larger concern, at least for economists, is the challenge the
deficit poses to the dollar. Through the record economic expansion
of the 1990s, the U.S. has sought to keep the dollar strong. But
the ever widening trade deficit needs to be paid back, sooner or
later, by a surge in exports or a decline in the value of the
dollar relative to other currencies, or both.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Every time we have run a big deficit we have ended up with a
big decline in the dollar, and that is bound to happen again,''
said C. Fred Bergsten, who runs the Institute of International
Economics. ``The real question is whether the dollar decline is
hard or soft. The administration is doing what it can to make sure
it's soft.''
</P>
<P>
   The dollar has already lost about a third of its value against
the Japanese yen in recent months. It has remained strong against
the euro, Europe's single currency, but many economists see the
dollar weakening sharply if the trade gap persists.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the demise of the United States economy has been a
fool's game in recent years. But one possible scenario for the end
of the long expansion begins with a steep fall in the dollar. That
would likely prompt a surge of inflation, causing the Fed to
increase interest rates, choking growth.
</P>
<P>
   If Europe and Japan were to start investing more in their own
economies, and buying more abroad, some pressure on the dollar
would ease, padding the ground for a soft landing, the thinking
goes.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' not-so-subtle plea to allies abroad is raise the speed
limit on economic growth by setting aside, as the United States has
in recent years, the idea that it's better to keep growth well
below its potential than to risk even modest inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Japan are both growing ``well below their
potential,'' Summers said. ``Having achieved a cyclical expansion
does not constitute the basis for relaxation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Japan has made a massive injection of public capital into
its economy and lowered interest rates to near zero, Summers argues
that it must commit to do so going forward. Japan could also do
more to stoke its moribund economy by lowering barriers to
investment, trade and labor mobility.

   Europe is a bigger problem for the Clinton administration. Led
by France, many economies there are growing faster now than in
recent years. But central bankers have quickly raised interest
rates to head off potential inflation and keep the newly unified
currency strong, disappointing the United States.  &QL;

TAIWAN CANDIDATE EASES ON CHINA POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ In a move that could ease tensions between
Taiwan and China during the campaign here before the presidential
election next month, the candidate of the governing Nationalist
Party declined Thursday to reaffirm the government's policy of
dealing with China ``state to state.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, said the policy, which
President Lee Teng-hui announced unexpectedly in July, merely
reflected the reality of relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not reaffirming it, because that has been the constant
position,'' Lien said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lee's original statement was widely interpreted here
and in Beijing as a crucial step away from the premise that Taiwan
and China are two parts of the same country. The notion of ``one
China'' was the basis of sporadic talks between Taiwan and China.
Beijing angrily broke off contact after Lee's statement, and said
he was setting the stage for Taiwan's independence, something that
China has vowed to prevent, by military force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lien said Taiwan wanted ``parity'' in negotiations
with China, ``nothing more, nothing less.'' Political analysts said
with the election less than two months away and with Lien's
trailing in many polls, the vice president was trying to distance
himself from Lee, who has become a lightning rod for Beijing's
impatience toward what it views as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that at this moment we could make ourselves very clear
to them,'' said Lien, 60, a political scientist and protege of
Lee's. ``Taiwan will not go independent. But Taiwan cannot reunite
with the PRC for the foreseeable future, because it is simply
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   In another gesture, Lien said he would consider relaxing
restrictions on trade with China if relations improved. Under Lee,
Taiwan has maintained strict limits on trade in military and
technology-related products and on investments in Chinese public
works.
</P>
<P>
   Lien's campaign manager, Jason Hu, said the candidate would
offer more details about his China policy in a few days. Political
analysts here expect the vice president to offer a new linguistic
formulation that avoids the inflammatory phrase ``state to state
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the debate over Lee's statement is an
exercise in semantics rather than diplomacy. But words matter
greatly in the halting dialogue between Taiwan and China. And
Lien's more circumspect words are quite likely to be welcomed in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Chinese government issued yet another warning,
saying that the election, on March 18, ``must not lead to a split
or Taiwan independence.'' A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Zhu
Bangzao, said, ``No matter who becomes Taiwan's leader, it should
benefit the development of relations between the two sides and
China's peaceful reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lien has crept up in popularity polls recently, he
remains in second or third place in most surveys, behind Chen
Shui-bian, a former mayor of Taipei and the leader of the
Democratic Progressive Party, and James Soong, a former Nationalist
Party official who is running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote nears, nerves are fraying. In 1996, in the last
presidential campaign, Beijing fired missiles into the ocean near
Taiwan to intimidate voters. Chen's party platform calls for an
independent Taiwan, although Chen has said he would make no
precipitous moves, and Lien is calculating that he can draw votes
away from his rival by promoting himself as the man least likely to
provoke a hostile response from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   While Lien is reaching out to China, he also appealed to the
United States not to abandon its support of Taiwan. ``After so many
years,'' he said, ``we find that American policy seems to lay more
emphasis on one side, the PRC side, and the Taiwanese side is not
emphasized as much as it needs to be.''

HOME HEATING-OIL PRICES HIT HIGHEST LEVEL IN 9 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A combination of a brutal cold snap and the
determination of OPEC oil ministers has driven Massachusetts
heating oil prices to their highest level in nine years, with no
signs petroleum-producing nations are wavering in their pact to
keep output tight and prices high.
</P>
<P>
   The latest state survey of oil dealers, conducted Monday, found
retail prices have hit $1.17 a gallon for home heating oil, which
in noninflation-adjusted terms is the highest price seen here since
the Gulf War of 1990-91, when prices jumped as high as $1.37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on average (wholesale) oil prices have gone up on
average 4 to 5 cents a day for the last seven days,'' said Dick
Horan Sr. of Hughes Oil in West Roxbury, a 47-year veteran of the
heating business whose company was posting a $1.38 a gallon price
Thursday. ``It's just been really, really wild.''
</P>
<P>
   The root cause for the spike appears to be commodity-market
speculation linked to both a sudden spurt in northern US demand for
heating oil after two mild winters, and to new signs that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers will
probably extend their yearlong production cap when they next meet
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Local specialists disagree over whether the cold weather or OPEC
is more to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me it's the weather, because one week of weather
shouldn't be causing this kind of change,'' said Larry Chretien,
executive director of the Boston Oil Consumers Alliance, a
6,000-member buying cooperative. ``It's not a free market here,
it's a rigged market, and in this country we would call what OPEC
is doing antitrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's group is backing some Capitol Hill leaders who are
calling on President Clinton to draw down oil from strategic
government reserves to undercut OPEC efforts to drive up prices. He
also said that the recent crude oil price increase to $29 a barrel
is the driving factor behind nascent inflation increases that will
probably make the Federal Reserve raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Connor, state energy resources commissioner, said,
``OPEC has really been sticking to their production quotas, unlike
previous years when they had them but didn't stick to them. Add a
little cold weather, and, bingo, the prices really start escalating
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The current $1.17 average price is, in nominal terms, the
highest price seen since February 1991, when prices hit $1.21 a
gallon during the Gulf War. During the winter of 1996-97, prices
climbed to $1.15, but for most of the last year have been in the
80-cent range.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent the current sticker shock may reflect a long
period of complacency for Massachusetts heating oil users after
back-to-back mild winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole system has sort of relaxed after the last
three mild winters,'' Hughes Oil's Horan said. ``What we have here
is a very short-term spike. The total cure-all is three to four
days of 35 degree weather. The first sign of moderation, the price
will drop like a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale New York Harbor price for heating oil hit $1.06
Thursday, a level not seen since market turbulence during the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough stocks. Until last week, the winter had been
been 14 percent warmer than usual. But when the weather gets colder
people get possessive of their barrels and are less willing to
sell,'' said Alan Struth, a petroleum market analyst at Honeywell
HiSpecs Solutions in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a fundamental standpoint there is not much difference
from a week ago. Psychologically, however, there is a lot more
uncertainty and we may see substantially higher prices, but it is
not a shortage problem,'' said Struth.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market may be overreacting to one week of cold
weather and may soon plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this goes well beyond the bounds of what can be
considered normal,'' said Timothy Evans of Thomson Global Markets
on the hikes. ``Once the market cools off, we think the warmer than
normal temperatures due into the Northeast next week and a less
bullish price environment will (put) a pin in this bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Morrell, president of a group representing local
community action programs that distribute federal home-heating aid
to low-income families, said, ``We are very concerned that the fuel
assistance resources we distribute to over 100,000 households will
run out long before the temperatures rise. Our clients are
essentially paying twice as much to heat their houses with oil as
they did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   More evidence of the tight oil market came Wednesday with a
report from the American Petroleum Institute that US oil
inventories dropped nearly 13 percent during 1999, the largest
one-year plunge since at least 1950.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said New England has inventories of 7.5 million barrels
of oil, down from 13 million a year ago, meaning there is far less
supply available to moderate price jumps when the recent cold
weather triggered increased demand.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have been climbing steadily over the last year as
OPEC countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela have
largely stuck to production limits voted in last March, and some
non-OPEC members such as Mexico and Norway have voluntarily limited
their oil output to help keep prices high.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Administration estimated that OPEC
members stayed within about 20 percent of their production limits
in November and December. World oil use is expected to exceed
production by 2 million to 3 million barrels daily during the first
three months of this year, the agency said.

$2.4B DEAL TO SIMPLIFY CMGI'S NET AD STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the major companies owned by CMGI Inc. has agreed to pay
about $2.4 billion in stock for two other firms owned by CMGI, in a
deal intended to simplify CMGI's Internet advertising strategy.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI owns 80 percent of publicly traded Engage Technologies Inc.
of Andover, Mass.. The company uses tracking technology to
determine the viewing habits of Internet users, and send them
advertisements targeted to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI also owns two other Internet advertising businesses,
Adsmart Network of Andover, Mass. and San Francisco-based Flycast
Communications Corp. Adsmart sells advertising space on 385 Web
sites; Flycast represents about 2,000 sites. Engage chief executive
Paul Schaut said that every month, over half of all Internet users
visit sites that use the Adsmart and Flycast services.
</P>
<P>
   Schaut said Engage didn't simply want Adsmart and Flycast to be
sister firms in the CMGI stable. ``You can't always tell your
sister what you want her to do, and sometimes you have conflicting
goals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Engage is going to use some of its very valuable stock to
acquire Adsmart and Flycast outright. The company will issue 32
million new shares to CMGI in exchange for ownership of the two
firms. As a result of the deal, CMGI's stake in Engage will
increase to 87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the deal is structured just as it would be if CMGI
did not control all of the firms involved. ``The fact that these
two companies are owned by a significant shareholder is
irrelevant,'' said Schaut.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies will continue to operate as separate
entities for the most part, said Schaut. But they will share a
unified force of 200 ad salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``The synergies that come along with the Engage combination make
a lot of sense,'' said marketing analyst Troy Mastin of Raymond
James Financial Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. The combination will
make it easier for Adsmart and Flycast clients to gain access to
Engage's system for targeting ads to the most likely customers. In
addition, said Mastin, a unified sales force should enable Emerge
to offer its customers a single point of contact for the services
offered by all three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Engage shares shot up 20 9/16, or 27 percent, to 97 9/16, while
CMGI, based in Andover, slumped 1 13/16 to 120 9/16, both on the
Nasdaq stock exchange.

AILING OCEAN SPRAY CHOOSES A NEW CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man credited with turning around the Alpo pet food brand in
the early 1990s, Robert Hawthorne, will head Ocean Spray
Cranberries Inc., the struggling cooperative said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He will lead a Lakeville, Mass. business that saw net proceeds
(the term Ocean Spray uses for earnings) drop by over 50 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne, 54, formerly an executive at Pillsbury Brands and at
General Mills Canada, was picked to be Ocean Spray's president and
chief executive after a six-month search that considered over 20
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne will assume his new duties next week.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ocean Spray's chief executive, Thomas E. Bullock,
announced plans to retire, once a successor had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray's troubles, which stem from an oversupply of
cranberries and new competition, are reflected in financial results
just released for the fiscal year that ended in August.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1999, revenue fell 8 percent, from $1.48 billion to
$1.36 billion. Net proceeds fell from $280.4 million to $134.9
million, or nearly 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray, however, said that a launch of new products and a
new ad campaign have helped it to regain momentum after a two-year
decline.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in 1998, its market share of cranberry drink sales
in grocery stores had dropped below 45 percent. Now, its share is
back up to about 55 percent, Ocean Spray said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne was unavailable to comment Thursday, an Ocean Spray
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Hawthorne said: ``Ocean Spray is a
brand with tremendous power, a company that's respected by
consumers and other companies alike. I look forward to the
opportunity to lead this brand and be a part of Ocean Spray's
future success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob Hawthorne's experience as a brand builder at Pillsbury and
General Mills makes him the right choice to strengthen the Ocean
Spray brand,'' said Donald G. Hatton, chairman of Ocean Spray's
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to right itself, Ocean Spray announced plans to begin a
strategic review of its operations when Bullock made public his
decision to retire. The review continues, though Ocean Spray
recently said it had ruled out selling all or part of the
cooperative to a larger company with greater global reach and
marketing power.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne will help guide the completion of Ocean Spray's
strategic review, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry and citrus growers are suffering from something that
affects many US agricultural categories: Growers have become so
efficient that they routinely produce crops that far exceed demand.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Ocean Spray did a good job of keeping supply and
demand in balance, through highly successful marketing campaigns,
with slogans such as ``crave the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, however, supply began to exceed demand, and
the price Ocean Spray could pay its growers for a 100-pound barrel
of cranberries fell, from more than $60 to less than $30.
</P>
<P>
   When prices were still high, many Wisconsin growers banded
together to sell to a new publicly traded company, Northland
Cranberries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Unaccustomed to competition, Ocean Spray has been criticized for
being slow to react to the much smaller Northland.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray hopes that Hawthorne will change that. He spent 14
years at General Mills, leaving in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10-year stint at Pillsbury, he rose to head six
divisions with annual sales of $3.1 billion. He left in 1996 to run
Select Comfort Corp., a maker of air beds and bedding products.
During his tenure, he led Select Comfort in an initial public
offering of stock.

SKAKEL CASE KEPT ALIVE BY PRESS, OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Skakel, scion of wealth and cousin to the powerful
Kennedy clan, gave himself up on Wednesday to face charges in the
quarter-century-old murder of Martha Moxley, some of the seeds of
his fate lay a continent away.
</P>
<P>
   For there, in Los Angeles, the rage engendered in 1995 by the
O.J. Simpson verdict spurred two men to reexamine the Moxley case
and explore whether money can truly trump justice in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Those men, author Dominick Dunne and former LA police Detective
Mark Fuhrman, rekindled public interest in the 1975 Moxley murder
by writing about the case so compellingly that, in retrospect,
their questions about the justice system seem to have led
inexorably to Skakel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne's ``A Season in Purgatory,'' published in 1993 as fiction,
is a thinly veiled account of the teenager's slaying that
excoriates the corrosive influence of wealth and power. While
covering the Simpson trial, Dunne encouraged Fuhrman to investigate
the Moxley case, which Dunne also revisited in a Vanity Fair
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominick told me about the case,'' Fuhrman said. ``I was done
with `Murder in Brentwood,' '' a book he wrote about the Simpson
investigation, ``and I was looking for something to do. He said,
`I've got you something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, whose inflammatory racial attitudes may have influenced
the Simpson verdict, retired from the LA force in August 1995. By
1998, he had written ``Murder in Greenwich,'' a analysis of the
Moxley case in which he identified Michael Skakel as the likely
killer.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Fuhrman's book was published, a Connecticut grand
jury was convened to reexamine the Moxley case. New evidence had
emerged, including significantly altered alibis from Michael and
Thomas Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury, consisting of a single Superior Court judge,
also is believed to have heard testimony that Michael Skakel
allegedly told classmates at a Maine school for troubled boys that
he had committed murder.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Carroll, one of the first Greenwich detectives assigned
to the case, said he believes the initial team of investigators
were dazzled by wealth and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think initially we were intimidated by the power and the
wealth that's there,'' Carroll said. ``If they didn't live where
they lived or had the relatives that they did, the investigation
probably would have been much more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich police at first refused to believe that such a
``heinous crime,'' one in which the 15-year-old Moxley was
bludgeoned to death by a golf club, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives at first were given free run of the Skakel home by
the boys' father, Rushton, Carroll said. But because of the
informal approach, and without a search warrant, the evidence
gathering was less scrupulous than it would have been done at the
home of a more ordinary resident, the detective said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, later, when police began to focus on Thomas Skakel as
their primary suspect, the investigation virtually ``shut down,''
Carroll said, when a high-powered attorney hired by the family told
police they would face harassment charges if they continued to
question the youth.
</P>
<P>
   The family, once one of the richest in the country, stopped
cooperating with police completely in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Dumas, a former Greenwich reporter who wrote ``A Wealth
of Evil'' about the case, also believes wealth and aura impeded the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s were a lot different from the '90s,'' Dumas said.
``Police were more respectful then of the prominent citizens of the
town, and they poked about much too gingerly, I think, when it came
to the Skakels.''
</P>
<P>
   But the aura of power and celebrity that the Skakels possess
could be double-edged, Dumas said. If convicted, Skakel will now
face a prison sentence that could keep him imprisoned for decades.
If he had been tried as a juvenile, Skakel would have been freed at
age 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will work out worse for Michael if he did do this than if
he were a nobody,'' Dumas said.
</P>
<P>
   For if he were a ``nobody,'' Dumas surmised, the wheels of
justice might have turned much quickly.

MANY RUSSIANS QUESTIONING OFFICIAL TOLL IN CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
   (With RUSSIA-CHECHNYA) 
(rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After four months of war in the north Caucasus, serious
doubts have been raised about the Russian military's official death
count _ by the media, by experts, by soldiers' families and by
Russian soldiers themselves, who have taken to yelling out higher
death tolls to reporters visiting sites of recent battles.
</P>
<P>
   At this sensitive phase in the latest Chechen war, when popular
support is being tested by the letdown that comes from a delayed
but still anticipated victory, new voices are joining the usual
chorus of skeptics challenging the truth of Moscow's accounts of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander V. Rutskoi, a hawkish former Soviet general who, as
Russia's vice president, lead a mutiny against the Kremlin in 1993,
said that ``judging by what is happening there, the losses are much
greater'' than reported.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the death toll stands between 740 and 800, including
both soldiers and militiamen serving under the Interior Ministry.
But a detailed analysis, conducted by a former Defense Ministry
press secretary and recently published in Komsomolskaya Pravda, a
major Russian newspaper, claims that the real figure is almost
twice that, or 1,300.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Union of Committees of Soldiers' Mothers,
a group that is a tireless advocate for Russian conscripts and says
the real number of Russian dead in this Chechen war is more like
3,000. The Defense Ministry says that figure is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   But says Valentina Melnikova, spokesman for the mothers'
committee, the worst is that no one will probably ever know the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in peacetime, soldiers' casualties are hidden,'' Ms.
Melnikova said. ``This is how our system works.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview broadcast on Sunday, Gen. Anatoly
Kulikov, the former commander of federal troops during the 1994-96
war, said a recent surge of behind-the-lines attacks by guerrilla
forces had surely produced more losses than had been officially
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see on a TV program one official saying, 10 killed and
15 wounded, and another saying five killed and 12 wounded, as a
professional, I can tell this is not true,'' said Kulikov, a former
minister of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows how casualty figures can be camouflaged, it
would be Kulikov. According to the recent Komsomolskaya Pravda
article, a declassified report put the total number of dead in the
first Chechen war at close to 4,000, both army and Interior
Ministry troops, but the author, in an interview, said he reckons
that even that figure is low by as much as 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Kulikov, in his interview, even named various techniques, like
listing dead soldiers as missing, or spreading out casualties over
a long period, so as to hide devastating losses from a single day
of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Some underreporting is built into the military's accounting
system. For instance, wounded soldiers who later die in hospitals
are not counted as killed in action. And soldiers whose bodies are
not recovered also go uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kulikov noted, there is a danger to playing games with
the numbers for too long. ``At the first attempt to analyze the
situation, heads may roll at the very top,'' he said. ``This should
not happen. By no means should the real situation with losses be
concealed from society.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the Russian press and television has been
supportive of the war in Chechnya, some newspapers have published
articles critical of the military, its strategy and its information
policy. Early on in the war, the newspaper Izvestia challenged
official denials of rocket attacks against a marketplace in Grozny.
``Strike,'' screamed the paper's defiant front-page headline.
</P>
<P>
   NTV, Russsia's largest privately owned television channel, often
uses interviews with soldiers, in the field or in hospital wards,
to give viewers a different, more brutal picture of the war than
that painted by media more closely tied to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report describing the miserable existence of Russian
soldiers crouching in the rubble of Grozny, the Chechen capital,
firing off rounds of artillery at Chechen snipers, an NTV
correspondent concluded laconically that ``everything is going
according to a plan.'' That is acting President Vladimir Putin's
favorite phrase about the course of the war.
</P>
<P>
   The official version of the war has also been challenged by a
new nongovernment news agency dedicated to military affairs, run by
a former army general who once headed the Defense Ministry's press
and information department.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the ministry job in 1995, halfway through the last
Chechen war, Gen. Vladimir Kosarev realized that his hopes of
bringing the Russian military's information policy in line with
modern, international standards was a losing battle. ``When I came
to the ministry, I saw that there was a wall between the army and
society that was higher than the Chinese Wall,'' he said. ``It is
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosarev's Military News Agency, which employs 16 correspondents,
all former military officers, and dozens of stringers inside the
armed forces, has collected evidence in scattered cases where the
official death count and reports from the field do not tally.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yuri Gladkevich, the agency's Caucasus specialist,
a recent report listing 26 dead and 30 wounded during a day's
fighting in Chechnya was in fact the death toll from a single
guerrilla attack on a single column of Interior Ministry troops
near the village of Dzhkalka. The total number of deaths in other
fighting around Chechnya that day was not known, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Viktor Baranets, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda
and former press secretary to a defense minister, has been
following the official casualty figures since the Russian army and
Interior Ministry troops first went to fight the Chechen guerrillas
in Dagestan in August. The invasion of Dagestan by Chechen fighters
was eventually repelled by federal forces, which then moved onto
Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baranets, official casualty figures, reported twice
daily by both the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry, never
quite add up and in some cases, were obviously stretched over
several months to minimize losses from particular battles,
particularly in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When big losses are reported, then heads fly, and our generals
want to be able to eat well,'' Baranets said. ``I look at all these
things with a great deal of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   To come up with his own figures, Baranets collated thousands of
statistics drawn from draft boards, hospitals, the military
insurance company, and even from orders for the zinc coffins used
to transport dead soldiers. The research, which took months,
produced the figure of 1,300 dead and almost 5,000 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Defense Ministry, reached this week, refused
to comment on the Komsomolskaya Pravda report. But Gen. Valery
Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian general staff, has on
other occasions attacked those who have challenged the official
casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such data misinform the Russian and international public with
regard to parameters of the operation for eliminating hot spots of
international terrorism in the North Caucasus,'' he said on Jan.
14, using the official parlance that portrays this war
overwhelmingly as a fight against Islamic insurgents. ``Moreover,
it might alter the vector of support for the Russian troops'
actions.''

THOUSANDS MOURN SLAIN SERB WHO WAS ACCUSED OF WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs to correct spelling of `Intercontinental' in 4th graf.) 
(bl) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Several thousand people came Thursday to
bury Zeljko Raznatovic, the indicted war-crimes suspect known as
Arkan, but also to praise him.
</P>
<P>
   After a small funeral service for family and close friends in
the chapel of Belgrade's main cemetery, the thousands of mourners,
some of them weeping, followed Raznatovic's son Mihajlo, who
carried a cross, while uniformed members of Raznatovic's Serbian
Volunteer Guard, known as the Tigers, carried the coffin to the
grave.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing camouflage and red berets, they fired a salute with
their rifles as an old Serbian hymn played. Raznatovic, born in
Slovenia to an army father, was portrayed as a Serbian hero,
fighting to extend and consolidate Serbdom and Serbian land, and he
himself enjoyed wearing a uniform of the First World War.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic, 47, was murdered Saturday, along with two other men,
a businessman and a police official, in the Intercontinental Hotel
here. As newspapers competed for unverifiable details about the
assassins and their motives, some officials of the governing party
began to describe Raznatovic as a patriot and a hero, despite his
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   As the coffin was lowered into the grave, Borislav Pelevic, a
``general'' in the Guard, said, ``Commander, I hereby submit the
last report: the status of the Serb Volunteer Guard is normal, the
status of the party is regular.'' Raznatovic also led a small
political party, the Party of Serbian Unity.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mention Thursday of Raznatovic's indictment in
1997 by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague _ an
indictment announced only last March, during NATO's bombing war
against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic and his Tigers played an important role on the
Serbian side in the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in 1991 and 1992-95.
He also was a pioneer of ethnic purging, and his indictment _ still
sealed _ is reported to include the murder of 250 Croats taken from
a hospital in 1991.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goran Hadzic, the leader of the autonomous Serb republic in
Croatia, which was overrun by the Croat army in 1995, praised
Raznatovic on Thursday as a friend, adviser and soldier. ``We were
friends,'' he said. ``But he was a big hero.'' Raznatovic, with
Belgrade's approval, ran guns to the Croatian Serbs before war
broke out there in 1991, and he helped fight in eastern Slavonia,
another region of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivica Dacic, the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, attended Raznatovic's
wedding to the popular folk singer Svetlana, known as Ceca, in
1995, but did not come to the funeral. But in a statement, he said,
``Regardless of his contradictory biography, Arkan was no doubt a
patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling were kind words from the Radical Party leader,
Vojislav Seselj, who had roaring battles with Raznatovic in
television debates. Once, on state television, Seselj said: ``I bet
you've put a black sock on your face more often than on your
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Seselj said in a statement: ``One thing is for
sure _ Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan was a true Serb patriot and all the
political misunderstandings and conflicts we had should be
forgotten now.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians, especially from Vuk Draskovic's Serbian
Renewal Movement, have charged that the Milosevic government
probably ordered Raznatovic's death because he was becoming too
powerful and disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have asked the police to look into charges that
Studio B, the television station controlled by the Serbian Renewal
Movement in Belgrade, is spreading false information. Draskovic has
already accused the government of trying to kill him in a truck
accident last October, and Studio B's signal is being jammed
regularly in parts of the country, while a major transmitter was
stolen this week, cutting off 2 million viewers in central Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers, meanwhile, are reporting that at least two
suspects in the Saturday shooting are in custody while the identity
of a third may be known to the police, who have said little
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The reports say that a man apparently wounded in the attack,
Dusan Gavric, has regained consciousness in a hospital in Loznica
near the Bosnian border, where he had fled.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Glas said information provided by Gavric led to
the arrest of a second person as he tried to leave the country for
Hungary, where Serbs do not need visas. In Novi Sad, near the
Hungarian border, a local newspaper, Dnevnik, said a man named
Goran Jevtovic had been arrested in the Arkan slaying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the official daily Politika, which has been used as
the main instrument of police leaks to show that the investigation
is progressing, said that the police had established the identity
of a third man, described as the ``man suspected of killing
Raznatovic and his two associates.'' But he is apparently still at
large, though inside Serbia, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, the newspaper Blic reported that Gavric, the
wounded man, has attended the police academy in Sremska Mitrovica
and graduated in 1995, though the paper was unable to confirm if
Gavric is still on the force. Glas Javnosti said that Gavric is
still a member of the special police and had taken part in police
operations in Kosovo.

MIT GETS $90 MILLION FOR HIGH-SPEED INTERNET RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A Miami-based company pioneering new
photonics technologies that could boost Internet traffic speeds by
hundreds of times is committing $90 million to create a new
research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Nanovation Inc., which includes $10 million to endow
new professorships, is expected to supercharge local efforts in
what is called optical networking, or connecting computers and
telephones to fiber-optic backbone lines through links that can
carry far more traffic than wires or electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation will sponsor research into what are called
microphotonics and nanophotonic devices and circuits, which can
carry hundreds of times more data at much higher speeds over
connections a hundredth or a thousandth the size of a metal wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microphotonics is the next revolutionary technology,'' said
MIT professor Lionel C. Kimerling, director of the MIT Materials
Processing Center, who will be director of the new
Nanovation-backed center.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation president G. Robert Tatum said the company hopes the
center, to be built at an as-yet undertermined location on the MIT
campus, will be ``the finest photonics center in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The stunning initial public offering in October of
Chelmsford-based Sycamore Networks Inc., which now has a stock
market value of $20 billion, has highlighted the emergence in
Greater Boston of what many analysts call the strongest
concentration of optical-networking companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, the quest of optical networking is to upgrade
the bumpy country lanes that connect computers and
telecommunications devices to the fiber-optic Internet superhighway
_ in many places copper and coaxial wires _ with new optical links
that are as fast and have as much bandwidth as the Net fiber
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiber optics has sparked impressive growth in the
long-distance carrying capacity of so-called wide area networks,
but local distribution is constrained by electronics and wires,''
Kimerling said. ``The challenge of the next generation is to build
high-capacity tributaries'' to neighborhoods and homes through
photonic technology.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its pact with Nanovation, MIT will have freedom to
publish research results and will share in ownership of patents
developed jointly by Nanovation with MIT researchers and
facilities, which could yield millions of dollars in revenue for
the institute.
</P>
<P>
   MIT launched a microphotonics center two years ago to pool
research efforts by associates of the Materials Processing Center
and other laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, MIT has pursued several similar joint ventures
worth more than $160 million with corporations such as
biotechnology leaders Amgen and DuPont, pharmaceutical giant Merck,
Ford Motor Co., Merrill Lynch, Microsoft Corp., and Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp.

 &HT;    Bradley forced to defend health care stance
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTUMWA, Iowa _ Democrat Bill Bradley opened a crucial swing
through eastern Iowa on Thursday to sharpen his differences with
rival Al Gore in advance of Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But as often as not, Bradley found himself diverging from his
own message to respond to criticisms Gore has lodged against his
health care proposal and plans for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference in Des Moines, Bradley conceded
that Gore's negative attacks, including a television commercial
that raised questions about his health care plan's impact on
Medicaid, were working.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, voters might have been swayed by that,''
Bradley said. ``But we are countering that now, and we are making
up our distance very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a campaign stop here hours later, retired social worker
Don Kirchner expressed concern that Bradley's plan to channel the
uninsured into private plans would amount to a $150 voucher that
wouldn't cover any private plan. In TV ads and during the debates,
Gore has used almost identical language in characterizing Bradley's
health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get hung up on the numbers here,'' Bradley responded,
insisting that the details could be worked out later. ``The idea
here is that this is the direction that I want to take us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirchner, who is attempting to decide between Gore and Bradley,
said later he was still doubtful. ``Any politician who says to me,
'Don't worry, trust me,' causes me some concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bradley spoke to the Iowa chapter of the
AARP, devoting a portion of his remarks to reassuring the seniors
that he would never jeopardize Medicare or Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has hammered Bradley in recent weeks over his failure to
offer a specific plan to extend the solvency of insurance programs
for the elderly beyond 2015. Gore has also challenged Bradley's
commitment to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to assure you that Medicare today is rock solid,''
Bradley said. He asserted that the nation's expanding economy would
continue to extend the life of the program without government
intervention now. And he sought to assure the audience that if the
program did require a fix, he had the leadership to accomplish the
task.

SOME FULAN GONG FOLLOWERS ARE BEING HELD IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ More than 50 followers of the banned Falun Gong
spiritual group are being held at a psychiatric hospital on the
outskirts of Beijing, a Hong Kong-based human rights group said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They were sent to the Zhoukoudian Psychiatric Hospital a month
and a half ago, after being detained by the police for continuing
to support Falun Gong, a movement that combines traditional Chinese
meditation and exercises with a smattering of Buddhist and Taoist
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The followers have repeatedly asked the hospital how much
longer they will be confined, but the hospital has indicated that
this is a matter for the government to decide,'' said the Center
for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, which is based
in Hong Kong, in a statement. Both hospital staff and local police
had verified the confinement, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The once widely popular Falun Gong movement was banned last
summer and, in a aggressive defamation campaign, China's top
leaders have declared it an ``evil cult'' that fosters
superstition.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 people held in the psychiatric hospital were detained
last fall, when Falun Gong practitioners from other provinces
flocked to Beijing to stage almost-daily silent protests in
Tiananmen Square in defiance of the government ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not patients, they are there to be re-educated,''
Yang Yang, a spokesman for the police station near the hospital,
told Agence France-Presse Thursday. He added: ``Most of them are
Falun Gong extremists who have been to Beijing to protest at least
10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds, if not thousands, of Falun Gong members are
still in detention or in labor camps, it had not been previously
known that some were being kept in psychiatric hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The use of psychiatric hospitals to hold political troublemakers
is thought to be relatively rare in China, although a few
dissidents have endured that fate in a system of psychiatric
hospitals run by the Public Security Bureau. Doctors at the far
more numerous mainstream psychiatric hospitals do not participate
in this work.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Wan Junying, a longtime democracy activist who
had already spent seven years at a psychiatric hospital for
``paranoid delusions'' that caused him to ``attempt to disturb the
social order,'' was forcibly re-hospitalized after he tried to hold
a news conference to discuss his experiences as a patient.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said in the past that rank-and-file
Falun Gong members who came to Beijing to protest would be sent
home and given short-term ``education'' about the evils of Falun
Gong, although they acknowledged that some devotees had been
unwilling to give their home addresses, so had remained in
detention for a time in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   A number of members who had been remanded home quickly returned
to the capital to resume the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The government has formally charged more than 300 people in
connection with Falun Gong, some of whom have already been tried
and sentenced to prison terms of more than 10 years. Human rights
advocates estimate that thousands more have been placed without
trial in labor camps or detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the movement bilked followers and resulted
in the deaths of hundreds of members who did not seek medical care
for serious illnesses, believing Falun Gong would cure them.
</P>
<P>
   Li Hongzhi, the New York-based leader of the movement, has said
that practicing Falun Gong improves health and reduces the need for
conventional medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if the Falun Gong members at the Zhoukoudian
Psychiatric Hospital are being treated as psychiatric patients or
merely detainees.
</P>
<P>
   But in its anti-Falun Gong campaign last fall, government
officials laid the groundwork for psychiatric hospitalizations by
insisting that some members were so devoted to Falun Gong that they
ceased to be rational and could no longer think clearly.

MCCAIN, BRADLEY GIVE VOTERS CONTRAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Bill Bradley can lull you to sleep with his
soothing voice, get you to think big thoughts about man's place in
the world, how we should be one with nature and love our neighbors.
He quotes Toni Morrison on the stump and can be moved to tears, as
he was Wednesday, by stories about people without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While some may think the Democrat's soft style is odd, what's
stranger is watching him and Republican John McCain. The two
outsiders challenging the party establishment have vastly different
approaches to campaigning but are targeting many of the same
independent voters, with similar success.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley is the zen candidate, McCain is the Jedi master,
fully caffeinated, willing to affectionately call an aide ``you
little jerk'' or answer any question (``I never smoked marijuana''.
. . ``I will not serve as vice president'') with focused intensity.
</P>
<P>
   They share a common zeal for the issue of campaign-finance
reform, believing big money is the root of most evil in politics.
They even reached across party lines and shook hands on working
together to overhaul the fund-raising system. And both say they
would not use polls to help set their agenda in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But there, they part ways, in style and substance and it's
evident in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley keeps his talks short and does not linger, while McCain
will shake every hand and sign every book (he wrote ``Faith of my
Fathers'') in the room. Bradley travels by van, alone with top
aides, while McCain rides on the Straight Talk Express bus packed
with media. Bradley will simultaneously chew gum and quote
Morrison, an African-American poet and author, on the subject of
race, while McCain will close a town hall meeting with the words of
the ``great philosopher, Mayor Daley of Chicago, `Vote early and
vote often.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bradley is fending off criticism that he is
arrogant and aloof, while McCain is often perceived as irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet independent voters, whose numbers are growing in New
Hampshire especially in the southern part of the state, appear to
be drawn by both candidates' ``refreshing'' styles as much as the
issues they talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking polls over the last week show Bradley and Democratic
rival Al Gore just points apart, but statistically tied within the
margin of error, among independent voters; likewise for McCain and
his chief opponent, Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because both elections are tight, 1 or 2 percent of that vote
could make the difference,'' said Andy Smith, director of the
University of New Hampshire Survey Center, about the independent
voters, who number 37 percent here. ``But it's not a matter of
whether it's refreshing. I think the key is how genuine it is. Both
candidates appear genuine. They're comfortable in what they're
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and other political analysts suggest that Bush and Gore
are coming across as too scripted. Bush seems to be getting more
spontaneous, particularly in televised debates, Smith said. ``I
think Gore's having the most difficult problem in deciding what
personality to wear, what style to use. He still looks forced,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters are more likely to consider personal style
more important than policy positions, analysts said. Many
independents may not pay close attention to the race every day, but
are more likely to turn out if the race is tight.
</P>
<P>
   Independents are also more likely to be influenced by
personality, political scientists said, because they feel isolated
from the political process and are looking for a human connection.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why Bradley's support is slipping in New Hampshire
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lou DiNatale, senior fellow at the McCormack
Institute at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, independent
voters have been choosing Bradley over Gore in tracking polls
because of his maverick image, but once some of them hear the
former New Jersey senator speak, they are put off. And the latest
polls show Bradley's early popularity is eroding in New Hampshire
as more unenrolled voters hear him speak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has a personality surplus, the other has a personality
deficit,'' DiNatale said referring to McCain and Bradley,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, two sides of Bradley were on display.
</P>
<P>
   At the Salemhaven Senior Center in Salem, N.H., Bradley
addressed the residents in a room that is sometimes used as a
chapel, with a cross and stained glass on one wall. And he sounded
like a minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign is about asking good people to come forward and
join us so our goodness can be heard,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, just down the road at the Wonder Years child care center,
Bradley showed emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Perry, who has no health insurance, said her young son
once apologized for getting sick because he knew the doctor bill
would be costly. The story moved Bradley to tears, and he had to
compose himself after the Pelham woman spoke before he could launch
into his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``it's important when reality enters a
political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ruddig, a teacher and registered independent supporting
Bradley, spoke about students who come to school sick because their
families don't have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   After her endorsement, Bradley conceded that ``an election will
always be about something broader than issues. Issues are a way of
defining character, but they're not the only way.''

CANDIDATES STRIVE TO BE LAUGHS OF THE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPKINTON, N.H. _ Senator John McCain was well into his comic
riff about being a POW in Vietnam _ joking about how it hadn't
taken a lot of talent to intercept a missile with his own plane,
lamenting that his kids thought Danny DeVito, not Tom Cruise,
should play him when his life story is made into a movie _ when
suddenly the curtain behind McCain tumbled down and blanketed a
couple of his staffers.
</P>
<P>
   The big town-hall audience, already nicely warmed up by the GOP
presidential candidate despite a 30-below wind chill outside and
the fact that it was only 7:45 a.m., howled at the sight gag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've identified the problem,'' McCain cracked as the
fallen curtain exposed a photographer with a ladder and sheepish
grin as the guilty party. ``The worst kind of infiltrator!'' cried
McCain, who had gotten a laugh earlier calling the press corps
covering him ``communists and Trotskyites.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for president in the weeks before the first primary
contest here is serious business. But fortunately, not all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Even Al Gore, that stiff and earnest policy wonk, is trying to
show voters he is lightened and loosened up. One of his favorite
jokes, which happens to play off his argument with rival Bill
Bradley over health insurance, is about the HMO director who shows
up at the pearly gates and asks for admission to heaven. ``Sure,''
the vice president says, quoting St. Peter, ``but you can only stay
two days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore should really let people see that he has this less
serious, unscripted side,'' Karen Golec, a special education
teacher, said after attending a Salem event where Gore strolled
around like a stand-up comic, bantering with the audience and
joking about being a new grandparent. ``I feel more positive about
him, knowing he can laugh at himself,'' Golec said.
</P>
<P>
   Any political strategist will tell you that the right dose of
self-deprecating humor is an important campaign ingredient. It can
humanize a candidate, setting him or her apart in a crowded field.
And it can soften or alter a negative image that either the media _
or, worse, Jay Leno _ are creating for millions of Americans.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running in New York for the US
Senate, appeared on David Letterman's show last week after lots of
taunting and years of needling, and got rave reviews as witty and a
good sport.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the field is so big, the need to be a star is so
urgent, and the GOP's 11th Commandment _ thou shalt not bash your
opponent _ is taken somewhat seriously, the Republicans are coming
up with a lot more laugh lines than the stern combatants on the
Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, who jokes that he gets his big
mouth from Barbara, his mother, often uses humor to blunt the barbs
about his IQ. Bush's comic comeback is that well, OK, maybe I'm not
so smart _ at least when it comes to baseball sluggers. ``As you
may remember I was in the business world at one time, and as
managing general partner of the mighty Texas Rangers, I signed off
on that wonderful transaction: Sammy Sosa for Harold Baines.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew a laugh when the moderator of a New Hampshire debate
asked about his reputation for having a bad temper and few friends
among fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a comment like that really makes me mad,'' McCain
deadpanned, paused, and then with a twinkle, went on to say that he
is well-liked by everybody but Washington's greedy special-interest
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is a wonderful way for candidates to connect to people,
cut through a lot of malarkey, and make a point in a very effective
way,'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian at Boston
University.
</P>
<P>
   The art of the political put-down is particularly useful in this
presidential campaign. The candidates are under so much pressure to
be civil and positive that one of the only acceptable ways to
attack their opponent is through humor.
</P>
<P>
   A classic dig came from the stiff-collared Senator Orrin Hatch
of Utah. In a debate in Iowa last month, Hatch said he had a
question to pitch to multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes that
would allow him to hit ``a home-run ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This usually means `hold your wallet,' '' Forbes replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, I couldn't even lift your wallet,'' Hatch shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes got a chance to sting Hatch in return at Saturday's
debate in Iowa, after Hatch used an answer to plug an ad that he
described as a ``a fireside chat of about 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the fire survived,'' Forbes replied.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud's description of humor as a vehicle for expressing
hostility seems especially apt when the Democratic presidential
candidates get together. Laughter rarely punctuates debates between
Gore and Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, and the few funny
lines spring from sarcasm more than wit.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent debate in New Hampshire, Gore said he was hoping for
a come-from-behind victory in the state's Democratic primary Feb.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, Al, your underdog pitch brings tears to my
eyes,'' Bradley said drolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I hope that my upset victory brings tears to your
eyes,'' Gore snapped back.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, the Gore campaign is using a comic character _ ``Corn
Man,'' a volunteer ``stalker'' who dresses up like an ear of corn
and hands out critiques of Bradley's farm policy _ to wage
psychological warfare on the usually cool and laidback Bradley.
``Real class,'' Bradley complains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your opponent engages a cartoon figure,'' laughs a Gore
spokesman, ``you know you are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   There's risk, of course, when amateurs try to be funny. McCain,
whose humor at times has a mean-spirited edge, made a joke last
year about his growing old. ``The nice thing about Alzheimer's''
McCain quipped, ``is that you get to hide your own Easter eggs.''
Last week, the New Hampshire branch of the National Right to Life
Committee, which opposes McCain on campaign-finance issues, took
out a radio ad accusing McCain of insulting the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was unapologetic and is determined to be remembered like
the late Morris Udall, a Democratic congressman and fellow
Arizonian, as the funniest man in the presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1976 (Udall) walked into a barber shop in Manchester and
said, `I am Morris Udall from Arizona, and I am running for
president of the United States,''' McCain told the Hopkinton
audience. ``And the barber said, `Yeah, we were just laughing about
that this morning.' ''

BRITISH PLAN TO CHANGE ULSTER POLICE DRAWS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British government agreed Wednesday to change the
name of Northern Ireland's police force, cut its size nearly in
half, and speed up the recruitment of Catholics to make it
representative of the population within ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the House of Commons, Peter Mandelson, Britain's
secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said the government would
implement nearly all 175 recommendations made last September by a
special commission. While a new power-sharing administration in
Northern Ireland has taken over most governmental responsibilities
under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, responsibility
for security measures is still in the hands of the British.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by Christopher Patten, Britain's last
governor in Hong Kong, called for a major overhaul of the
13,500-member Royal Ulster Constabulary, or RUC, which is more than
90 percent Protestant. The commission, which included former
Massachusetts Public Safety Secretary Kathleen O'Toole, recommended
changing the name and ethos of the RUC so that more Catholics, who
make up more than 40 percent of the population, would be encouraged
to join. Many Catholics consider the force biased against them.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to change the name to the Police Service of Northern
Ireland, and especially to drop the word ``royal,'' is an emotional
issue for Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland, who consider
themselves British and credit the RUC with holding the line against
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who is a member of
Parliament as well as first minister in the new power-sharing
Northern Ireland Assembly, angrily denounced the plan. ``Nothing
that this government says or does can dishonor the RUC and the men
that serve it, but this government can and is dishonoring itself,''
Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair rose as Trimble sat down, insisting
the reforms did not insult the memory of the 300 police officers
killed and some 9,000 injured since 1969, most of them at the hands
of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no dishonor intended to the RUC. Their officers have
given their lives in outstanding bravery over many years,'' said
Blair. ``What we are trying to do is ensure that we have a police
force in Northern Ireland that is capable of attracting support
from all sides of the community so it can police better.''
</P>
<P>
   The government made some minor concessions to unionists, leaving
the job of designing the RUC's new badge to a new civilian
authority. It also rejected a recommendation that local authorities
be allowed to hire private security firms after unionists claimed
it was a scheme aimed at farming out subcontracts to the IRA. But
unionists had been expecting more concessions, and their anger
showed.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party
welcomed the plan, saying it strengthened the peace process. Sinn
Fein, the political allies of the IRA, which had demanded the RUC
be disbanded, was more cautious. Republicans view many of the
changes as simply cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Fein assembly member who was once an IRA
bomber, said it was wrong to assume that Irish republicans would
embrace the proposed changes. He said his party would wait to see
the actual legislation before offering a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unionists are upset because the RUC was their police force,''
said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter recriminations Wednesday suggested the honeymoon is
over following last month's creation of the first power-sharing
government of unionists and republicans. It also focused attention
anew on a Feb. 12 deadline set by Trimble, who has vowed to resign
and bring down the power-sharing government unless there is
evidence that the IRA is serious about turning in its hidden
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said the police force would be whittled down to 7,500
within ten years, and that severance pay would be ``generous and
sympathetic.'' He said new officers would be appointed on a 50-50
basis between Catholics and Protestants. In a bid to get more
Catholics to join, the officers' oath will drop a line that swears
allegiance to the Queen. Unionists complained, but no other police
department in the United Kingdom takes an oath to the British
monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Iona Meyers, whose husband was killed by the IRA and who heads
the police widows association, called the government plans ``a sop
to terrorism.'' Sgt. Les Rogers, who heads the police union, called
it ``an act of appeasement of terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said most of his officers
were willing to accept the name change and fundamental reform as
long as paramilitary groups were committed to advancing their
causes through strictly peaceful methods.

CHINA TO REQUIRE REAL NAMES ON BANK ACCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The head of China's central bank Thursday described
renewed efforts to turn China's giant state banks and ailing state
enterprises into sound commercial operations, able to withstand the
competitive pressures that are certain to follow China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, speaking
at his annual news conference, also pledged a smooth growth in the
money supply and a stable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   But what grabbed public attention was something Dai said in
passing, with words that underscored how deeply China's financial
culture has differed from that in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a plan to adopt a real-name system for bank deposits
this year,'' Dai said in answer to a question. This simple step _
requiring people to put their names on their bank accounts _ is
intended to aid tax collection and the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anyone can open a savings account under any name, no
identification required, with only the passbook needed for deposits
and withdrawals. While most individuals use their real names, the
use of false ones is common enough to have attracted the concern of
top officials.
</P>
<P>
   The practice seems to have roots in the aversion many Chinese
have to revealing their often-sizable nest eggs. People have also
been known to open accounts under aliases to conceal money from
spouses, Beijing residents said, while companies sometimes hide
revenue from tax collectors in phony-name accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the technique is mainly used by individuals concealing money
gained through bribery, embezzlement or the stripping of the assets
of state corporations, said a corporate lawyer in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that officials and state enterprise managers
with questionable income often open several bank accounts under
different names.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adoption of a real-name mechanism is consistent with
international practice,'' said Dai, the bank chief. But to avoid
serious disruptions, he said, the new rule will apply only to newly
opened accounts to avoid serious disruptions, he said, the new rule
will apply only to newly opened accounts _ perhaps leaving would-be
miscreants time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Several Beijing residents said Thursday that they welcomed the
plan as a blow against rampant corruption. In private conversations
and on Internet sites, rumors have been traded about what may be
the largest corruption case in decades. It reportedly involves
scores of officials, mainly in the southeastern province of Fujian,
who are accused of smuggling billions of dollars worth of cars,
electronic goods, firearms and oil, avoiding large duties and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has not been announced here, but in recent
days the Reuters news agency and The Wall Street Journal, citing
anonymous sources, have reported that the wife of a member of the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo has been implicated, making the
case an especially embarrassing one for the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under detention, these sources say, is Lin Youfang, head of a
trading company of the Fujian provincial government. She is married
to Jia Qinglin, who is a member of the 22-man Politburo and is also
Beijing's Communist Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are said to have taken over two heavily guarded
hotels in the southern port city of Xiamen, where witnesses and
suspects are being questioned.

ELECTRONIC READING TURNS A PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Four years ago, a friend who worked at the Digital Equipment
Corp. research laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., showed me a
top-secret project that somebody in the lab was working on. It was
an electronic book, about the size of a clipboard and as thick as a
box of matches. The front had a high-resolution-paper white screen.
On its back were a series of buttons for turning the pages _ that
is, advancing through the printed text. Although the prototype was
tethered to a desktop computer by a thick cable, the plans were to
place a low-power microprocessor behind the screen and pack the
remaining space full of batteries. The result would be a computer
that you could take to bed, to the beach, or just about anywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a few months after I saw that prototype, Digital halted
development on its electronic book. The reason: Digital was
stepping up its involvement with Microsoft Corp., and since the
digital book couldn't run either Windows 95 or NT, Digital's upper
management decided that there could be no place for the device in
the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Today, electronic books have moved from the research lab into
the consumer electronics marketplace. Palm Pilots, Windows CE
machines, and even lightweight notebook computers are all used for
portability and for reading electronic words.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most innovative of these products are the Rocket
eBooks from NuvoMedia Inc. With an exceptionally readable screen
and list prices of $199 for the original eBook and $269 for the
eBook Pro, these machines are designed to let the voracious reader
transport and read reams of text.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket eBook looks like an oversized palm-top organizer,
with its dark gray body, a screen roughly the size of a paperback
book, a paucity of buttons, and a sleek plastic stylus that slides
into a slot on the unit's side.
</P>
<P>
   Its specifications are impressive: The system can run for up to
40 hours on a single battery charge (20 hours if the backlight is
energized at its brightest level), the computer packs 16 megabytes
of memory, and it weighs just 22 ounces. The eBook case, which has
a bulge on one side for the battery, is roughly the size of an
oversized paperback book.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the computer on by pressing the recessed power button on
its side and the eBook displays the book that you are reading, with
the screen positioned where you left it when the machine was turned
off. You move to the next page or previous page by clicking the
eBook's two buttons next to the screen; move to the previous page
by clicking the other.
</P>
<P>
   The eBook can display written texts in small and big type. The
small font is roughly the size of the print in a typical paperback
book. Unfortunately, it's not nearly as readable, since
ink-on-paper has a much higher resolution than the eBook's liquid
crystal display. I preferred the large font, which packs roughly
120 words onto the device's screen.
</P>
<P>
   The eBook can hold the text of up to about 40 novels. It comes
with a copy of the user's manual, ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland,'' and an on-line dictionary. The dictionary is
integrated into the operating system, so you can easily look up
words in a book that you're reading. You can also set bookmarks,
underline, and even enter notes into the text _ although since the
machine doesn't understand handwriting, you need to tap out the
notes one letter at a time with the plastic stylus.
</P>
<P>
   New texts can be downloaded from the Web and then transferred
into the eBook using a serial cable. The Industry Standard
magazine, for instance, now has an electronic edition designed for
the Rocket eBook format. Electronic books are available on line
from Powell's Books (www.powells.com), ecampus Books
(www.ecampus.com) and Barnes and Noble (www.bn.com). Although some
cost as little as $3, many of these electronic editions are no
bargain. For example, Scott Turow's novel ``Personal Injuries''
costs $21.60 from Barnes and Noble for the Rocket edition; the
bookseller sells the hardback for $13.50. And since many of these
electronic editions are encrypted with the serial number of your
eBook, you can't share them with anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Far more interesting than these commercial books, I think, are
the texts available for free at rocket-library.com. This Web site
contains many self-published works as well as texts from the
decade-old Project Gutenberg, a group of people dedicated to
digitizing chk classic works for which the copyright has expired.
Before a recent trip, I downloaded Bram Stoker's ``Dracula,''
Charles Darwin's ``The Origin of Species,'' and a biography of
scientist and inventor Michael Faraday that was written shortly
after his death in 1867. It's likely one side effect of the eBook
and similar devices will be a resurgence of interest in
19th-century writing.
</P>
<P>
   Although I like the Rocket eBook a lot, it's clear that this
technology has a long way to evolve. No matter how readable the
computer's screen is, it's still not as readable as a paperback
book. One reason is screen glare, another is the type. A font with
serifs would improve readability. A vision-impaired friend said she
wished the device had larger fonts still.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the eBook is not for people who like to collect volumes
on their shelves as reminders of what they've read. On the other
hand, if you were going on a long trip in a non-English-speaking
country and needed to pack light, the eBook would be an easy way to
bring along some good reading.

   When Adam Sonenshein was in the sixth grade, a teacher assigned
him to follow the presidential race between Democrat Michael
Dukakis and Republican George Bush. For the 12-year-old, politics
was cool.
</P>
<P>
   But now, 12 years later, Sonenshein and his peers don't have the
threat of an unfavorable grade on their report card forcing them to
pay attention, and encouraging them to be less apathetic and
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Different times require different tactics. And so political
advocates are taking the talk of politics directly to what most
grabs the attention of Americans ages 18 to 25 _ the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they've said they want more information on the
Internet, we're designing a huge new Web site that will focus on
providing the information that they're interested in,'' said
Adelaide Elm of Project Vote Smart, which surveyed, in conjunction
with Pew Charitable Trust, 18- to 25-year-olds. What they found: 70
percent said the Internet is the most useful source for news
information.
</P>
<P>
   Political organizations and political candidates across the
country, then, are scrambling during this presidential election
year to make their Web sites more interactive, more user friendly,
and just more.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism survey
found that 58 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds don't pay attention to
political stories in the newspaper or on television. Those results
prompted the journalism school to create a Web site that provides
political news and lets young people participate in discussions.
</P>
<P>
   A feature of Project Vote Smart's site is a National Political
Awareness Test that measures a candidate's position on broad-based
issues such as abortion, affirmative action, crime, and welfare.
Anyone linking to the site will be able to take the test and see
how their answers compare with those of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `The Dating Game,' '' said Aili Langseth, 24, who
runs the youth inclusion program at Project Vote Smart that
oversees the new Web site. ``It will match you up with candidates
to see who most closely fits with you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Rock the Vote campaign, which succeeded in its ``rebirth
of cool'' politics in 1992, the challenge to keep young people
involved is as big as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with a number of other organizations to call on
candidates to speak directly to young people,'' said Alison Byrne
Fields, campaign manager for Rock the Vote, which, she says, is
focusing on political issues. ``We're drawing them in that way and
pointing them in the right direction,'' said Fields.
</P>
<P>
   During the last presidential election, the program's Web site
was the first to offer on-line voter registration, a returning
feature for Campaign 2000, along with snapshots of the issues and
the names of organizations tackling those issues. Rock the Vote,
founded by recording artists in 1990, paired with MTV's Choose or
Lose campaign to register 37,000 voters in 1996. MTV plans to kick
off this year's Choose or Lose campaign next week with a concert at
New Hampshire College.
</P>
<P>
   According to US Census data, in 1996, 45.6 percent of an
estimated 10.8 million 18- to 20-year-olds and 51.2 percent of the
nation's 13.9 million 21- to 24-year-olds were registered to vote.
But only 31.2 percent of those under age 21 and 24.2 percent of 21-
to 24-year-olds voted in the 1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, young people don't magically become
older adults who vote, said Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the points that should be made in all of this is that
it's not solely a youth issue,'' she said. ``It's really important
to address the fact that voting is a learned behavior that's
influenced by the way your parents vote. It should not be assumed
that young people will grow into voting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Fields says, has successfully empowered many
college students across the country. ``It's a sense of community
that exists on the Web that young people have a greater sense of
than adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, dozens of nonpartisan organizations came together to
form a coalition that encourages civic participation among young
people. The result is youthvote2000, a network of over 35
organizations including Black Youth Vote, Campus Green Vote, and
the League of Women Voters that demands accountability from
politicians on issues of importance to youth.
</P>
<P>
   And candidates seem to be responding. Republican presidential
candidate Steve Forbes created e-Precincts. Democratic presidential
candidate Bill Bradley's campaign ranks top among candidate
Internet fund-raisers. US Representative Tammy Baldwin reached the
bulk of potential voters in her district _ college students in
Madison, Wisc. _ via the Internet as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely recognizing that they have to do it,'' said
Fields. ``They're recognizing that it's a fairly economical way to
get their message out there and to create a standard message for
potential voters and the press.''
</P>
<P>
   One campaign that capitalized on both public interaction and the
Internet was Jesse Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial bid in
Minnesota. Volunteers were mobilized and the voting public was
educated with the help of www.jesseventura.org. Ventura posted all
of his public policy positions on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the Internet and e-mail in a combination that had not
previously been used before,'' said Phil Madsen, Web master for the
Ventura campaign site. ``Nobody came close to producing the results
we did and that was just because of the way we had done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which cost under $200 to establish, raised over
$50,000 for Ventura's campaign. There are those, however, who say
that getting young people enthusiastic about voting has less to do
with getting information on the Internet than with political
candidates treating young adults as viable citizens, consumers, and
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jesse Ventura) was the only candidate not treating youth as a
problem to be solved. Ventura viewed the youth as people who were
allies in the campaign to help him get elected, and the kids
responded to that by the thousands,'' Madsen said. ``It's not about
the Internet, it's about the relationship you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of news organizations have figured out younger voters
are future readers,'' said Deborah Potter, executive director of
NewsLab, a Washington-based nonprofit that works with local
television news on reporting. ``My sense is newsrooms across the
country are waking up to this issue. I think the Internet is a way
of reaching them that hasn't happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Attey, director of the Communications and Policy Technology
Network, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's creating a more educated group of voters. I think the
youth are going to be much more up on the issues than traditional
voters. The better sites provide the candidates' stance on every
issue and how to get involved with their campaign,'' said Attey,
head of the trade organization for professionals who use the
Internet for public affairs, policy, and political work.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians aren't the only ones paying attention. Duke
University offers a class on the role and influence of the Internet
on this year's political race. Statistics and research show the
younger generation craves information that is easy to access, and
results that are visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're unsure whether (their vote) would really
count. You hear a lot about a loss of faith in the political
process,'' said Melissa Jones, 20, a third-year political science
student at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people feel politics have nothing to do with them,''
said Robyn Barros, 19, a second-year Northeastern political science
student. ``I think it's a lack of knowledge about how the
government works. Once you understand that, you're more likely to
be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonenshein, quality control supervisor for Project Vote Smart,
hopes to help in that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking how important it is for politics to be cool
again for young people to be a part of it,'' he said. ``Our
generation romanticizes the late-'60s activist period. I think a
lot of that happened because once your friend is doing it, you want
to be involved, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that clothing designers work to create brand
loyalty with consumers when they're young, there needs to be some
sort of brand loyalty with activism, said Fields, the Rock the Vote
campaign manager. ``In order for us to have a true democracy 20
years from now, it has to be addressed now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fields points to three key steps needed to break the cycle of
voter apathy: candidates should speak directly to young people and
listen to them, the young need to ``get louder and take advantage
of'' the opportunity to vote, and there needs to be a sense of
responsibility from the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some space to present a more positive image of
who young people are and the media has a role in that as well,''
said Fields. ``If they start believing what they read about
themselves, then we're all in trouble.''

JORDAN MAKES A RETURN ON HIS OWN TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Jordan entered a crowded room Wednesday and
immediately began doing what makes him most comfortable. He changed
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after 5 p.m. when Jordan approached the dais at the
MCI Center. The first thing you noticed was his left ear, from
which a large diamond-studded ring dangled. Jordan is the only
owner who wears such a ring. But he is more than the league's
best-dressed owner. He also becomes the most handsome owner. The
only owner who can outplay the men who work for him. The only owner
who has his age (36) and skin complexion (sepia-toned). The only
owner who can brag that he has sold ads that represent various
aspects of Americana: basic underwear, gaudy sneakers, greasy hot
dogs and hamburgers, low-cost cologne and high-budget movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards, the second-worst team in the Eastern Conference,
were thinking of those credentials when they excitedly introduced
Jordan as their part-owner and president of basketball operations.
President Clinton attended  &UR; last night &LR; 's game against Dallas and
the mayor of Washington was at Jordan's press conference. I can
understand the enthusiasm for the man Jayson Williams once called
``Jesus in Nikes,'' but I'd like to see Jordan turn water into
wine, a task equivalent to making the awful Wizards winners.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan truly will have to change the rules _ more than he ever
did in his brilliant playing career _ to make this work. He will
have to become St. Michael of the Potomac. You may remember that
Jordan used to call Jerry Krause, the disheveled general manager of
the Chicago Bulls, ``Crumbs.'' Well, I think Jordan will have a lot
more respect for Krause and other GMs after he spends a few months
on the job. It's a gig that looks a lot easier than it is. It is
even more vexing when you don't have a first-round pick (the
Wizards might not) and are locked in a culture of losing (they last
won a playoff series in 1982).
</P>
<P>
   We mentioned changing the rules, right? Well, Jordan will have
to change them to do his job well. A lot of talent evaluators spend
their time on the road, scouting in Sheboygan on a Tuesday night
and in East St. Louis on a Wednesday. Jordan acknowledged that his
celebrity may make this difficult. He may be the first owner who
has to wear an Afroed wig so people won't notice him in public. He
will also be the first operations chief who will not reside in his
team's city; he said he will commute from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment among most Washingtonians Wednesday seemed to be,
``Well, this guy won six championships, so maybe his intensity will
rub off on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   They are right. The intensity will rub off. But intensity
doesn't make salary-cap problems disappear. Bill Russell won as
many MVP awards as Jordan and nearly doubled Jordan's six titles.
Russell tried to revive terrible teams twice, in the 1970s with
Seattle and in the '80s with Sacramento. He had mixed results and
no championships. Jerry West was a great player who is also a great
executive. The man Jordan replaced, Wes Unseld, was a good player
whose only greatness as an executive came from the fact that he was
not fired by the team. What about Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   From what I saw Wednesday, people here need to call this guy,
``Michaelavelli.'' He made it clear that things would be done his
way or jobs would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I practice with the team?'' he said. ``Sure.'' He
explained that the best way to see a man's fear is to look into his
eyes while he's on the court. He also said that Wizards coach
Garfield Heard may not want him practicing but, ``I'm his boss.''
People laughed when Jordan said that, but he was not joking. He was
not joking when he said everyone in the organization would be
evaluated. He was not joking when he said that he now has the
decision-making power over Unseld and that majority owner Abe
Pollin has the final say over both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Unseld gave curt answers Wednesday. He should realize that he no
longer has the protection of Pollin. If Jordan eventually decides
that Unseld has no place in basketball operations, Unseld will have
to go somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan practiced with the Bulls, he was known for his
stinging critiques of teammates whom he considered to be slackers.
When he practices with the Wizards, he can trash as many players as
he wants but he'll still have to pay them. He would be wise to
store the cell phone numbers of Kevin McHale and Larry Bird so he
can vent about the priorities of some of today's players. That's
the biggest difference between wearing a uniform and wearing a
suit.
</P>
<P>
   As the man in jersey No. 23, you post a triple-double when you
are angry and want to make a statement. As the man in the
pinstriped suit, you call your peers and beg them to make a deal
with you.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Jordan will have to alter his relationship with
agent David Falk. Other owners could complain that Jordan has a
competitive advantage, due to his close relationship with the
powerful Falk. That's an issue that will have to be handled at
another time. Today's news is more pressing.
</P>
<P>
   On Jordan's first day on the job, the Wizards played the
pathetic Dallas Mavericks. They were blown out, 104-86. He may be
able to do some moderate tinkering with this team. But when things
go bad, all he will be able to do is watch.

LITTLE ELCOM LACKS GLAMOUR, BUT STOCK'S A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Down in the gearbox of the new economy, the most mundane
business-to-business software that's run over the Internet is
promising corporate America a new level of organization and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take the stock market long to catch on to the
opportunity offered by Internet-based procurement systems, which
can track and execute practically every purchase order a company
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of two high fliers that sell top-of-the-line products,
Ariba Corp. and Commerce One, have climbed more than eightfold
since the companies went public last summer, amassing in a flash a
combined value of nearly $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Far less glamorous, little Elcom International Inc., of Norwood,
Mass., is trying to burrow its way into the lower end of the
corporate market for Internet-based procurement software.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, sells systems that allow employees to order supplies
from personal computers, track purchases, bounce e-mails to
supervisors when their approval is needed and, above all, cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go as low as a business with 100 PCs, and I can save
that company money,'' said Elcom's chief executive, Robert Crowell.
</P>
<P>
   Elcom may not have the bulging, multibillion dollar stock market
value of an Ariba or a Commerce One, but it outran every other
stock in Massachusetts last year, based on percentage gains. It
soared 1,654 percent in 1999, though many bigger local stocks piled
up greater increases in sheer dollar value. At a peak of 34 per
share, Elcom climbed to a $1 billion market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks in that arena have just gone crazy,'' said Tim Stobaugh
of Stonegate Securities, the only analyst who follows Elcom. He
continues to rate Elcom a ``strong buy'' but has not adjusted his
last published price target for the stock, which was 16 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other small high-tech stocks, Elcom has taken its
lumps in January. It had sunk like a rock to below 20 by last week
and finished Wednesday at 25. Its total stock value has slipped to
$700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Elcom wants to become the Honda Civic of the procurement
software business, a reasonable choice for people who have a
limited amount of money to spend. Procurement systems from Ariba
and Commerce One can cost millions of dollars. They're better and
more flexible, but much costlier than Elcom's systems, which run
about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ariba has been phenomenally successful, but not everyone is in
a position to pony up the money to buy it,'' said Lisa Williams, an
analyst working on enterpise commerce and applications at Yankee
Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big market out there, and not all that demand is
ever going to be captured by one company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elcom's PECOS procurement system has attracted a small but
interesting list of early clients, including CBS Corp., which has
deployed it on a limited basis, and Entergy Nuclear, a subsidiary
of Entergy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an Ariba or a Commerce One, but it's a pretty quick
and easy solution that provides a lot of the same benefits,''
Stobaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowell has been working on the unglamorous fringes of
technology since he started selling calculators while at the
University of Massachusetts in the early 1970s. Later, he ran the
computer reseller Neeco Inc., of Canton, Mass., but sold the public
company in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Crowell stayed in the computer reseller business when he got
Elcom off the ground, and that's what continues to generate almost
all of its hundreds of millions in annual revenue. But it's the
budding procurement system business that has propelled Elcom shares
and that represents the vast bulk of the company's current stock
value.
</P>
<P>
   The plan: Turn the elcom.com procurement system subsidiary into
a publc company by selling a small chunk of its stock in an initial
offering, then give Elcom shareholders the rest of the new
company's stock in a year when the government will presumably
approve of a tax-free spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent coversation, Crowell said the elcom.com IPO should
happen in the first quarter of this year. Other company officials
are more cautious, suggesting the offering might take place the
following quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal is clear: Separate Elcom's new opportunity from its
old business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got too many connotations of being a PC remarketer,''
Crowell said. ``There's not too many businesses that are valued
lower or perceived worse. The margins are in the tank; manufactuers
are all going direct. Their stocks are at their lowest points in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens next depends on the product itself. When companies
like Elcom aim for the low end of a market, they need to attract
lots of customers to make the strategy work. So far, so good. But
there's a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   And the stock market, enamored of business-to-business software
today, can discover a new pet Internet application in a snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ego is well under control,'' Crowell said. ``You really
can't figure out what value the marketplace will put on something
when it's a pure play.''

CONFIDENT YOU ARE COMPETENT? THINK AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For me, this week's most fascinating story was deep inside
Tuesday's New York Times, a piece by Erica Goode headlined, ``Among
the Inept, Researchers Discover Ignorance Is Bliss.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that studies by psychologists have found that most
incompetent people have no idea they're incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the researchers found that the incompetent are
``usually supremely confident of their abilities, more confident,
in fact, than people who do things well.''
</P>
<P>
   This could explain a lot. Professional sports. Certain aspects
of politics. The way some people drive. The mystery of how certain
clueless individuals manage to thrive at work. A great deal of what
passes for popular entertainment. That obnoxious guy who'll never
take ``no'' for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   But it also raises questions. If you are confident about your
abilities, how do you know you're not fooling yourself?
</P>
<P>
   (Maybe a person who is confident but incompetent wouldn't even
ask that question.)
</P>
<P>
   And if you're not confident, does it necessarily follow that
you're more competent than you think you are?
</P>
<P>
   (Maybe. The researchers believe that their findings support
Thomas Jefferson's belief that ``he who knows best knows how little
he knows.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David A. Dunning of Cornell University and his former
graduate assisant, Dr. Justin Kruger, now of the University of
Illinois, published their report in the December issue of the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Goode notes that,
given the subject matter, the two were a little nervous about
presenting their research to the public. They didn't want to seem
too confident.
</P>
<P>
   The two psychologists think that inept people are often
self-assured because they lack self-monitoring skills, which are
the same skills required for competence. Subjects who scored in the
lowest quartile in tests of logic, English grammar, and humor were
also the mostly likely to ``grossly overestimate'' how well they
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do (incompetent people) reach erroneous conclusions
and make unfortunate choices,'' wrote Dr. Kruger, ``but their
incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it.''
</P>
<P>
   The inept, then, are in an impossible position. Is there any
hope for them? Or don't they care?
</P>
<P>
   Dunning and Kruger found that a short course in logical
reasoning helped some of the subjects assess their performance more
realistically. But it appears a lot more work must be done.
Stamping out incompetence, especially among people who won't admit
they're incompetent, could be a Herculean task. One of the
obstacles to encouraging realistic self-assessment is that, in most
situations, honest feedback is nonexistent. As Goode puts it,
``Social norms prevent most people from blurting out, `You stink!''
</P>
<P>
   It makes me grateful to be a newspaper columnist, the kind of
job in which you get that sort of honest feedback on a regular
basis. Of course it doesn't sink in, in every case. Years ago I
worked with a person who was astonishingly inept. This wasn't just
my opinion. It was widely shared. He was also extremely
self-confident, something of a blowhard. There was a long-running
office debate about whether he knew, in his heart of hearts, that
he was a loser. In one camp were those who maintained that he knew,
that when his defenses were down, in quiet moments of reflection,
he had to know what an incompent jerk he was.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that he couldn't possibly know, that if he had the
gift of being able to see himself as others saw him (thank you,
Robert Burns) he wouldn't be the way he was. Science seems to have
settled that debate for us at last. Although who knows? You can't
be too certain of anything.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Virus may catch Georgia, other states off guard
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia and other states on the Atlantic and Gulf
Coasts may not be prepared for a resurgence of West Nile virus, the
imported illness that infected 61 and killed seven in the Northeast
last fall and may have spread south with migrating birds, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 17 states and the District of Columbia could be at risk if
the virus rebounds, the agency said in a report released Thursday.
The August outbreak in New York City marked the first time that
West Nile, which lives in birds but can pass to horses and humans
via mosquitoes, had ever been seen in this hemisphere; by the time
cold weather ended the mosquito season, the virus had spread from
Connecticut to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the CDC said the emergency effort to track and
identify the virus placed extraordinary demands on New York and
surrounding states, inhibiting other crucial work by their public
health systems. Before the virus surges again, the agency warned,
the other states at risk should be prepared to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Division of Public Health said Thursday that its
plans are under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got several things in place already and we're putting
the finishing touches on a request for assistance to the CDC for
more funds,'' said Dr. Susan Lance-Parker, a medical epidemiologist
with DPH.
</P>
<P>
   Because the virus was not pinpointed until late September _ 20
days after it was misidentified as a different mosquito-borne virus
_ many questions about it are still unanswered. It isn't known, for
instance, how far infected birds traveled along migration pathways,
if New York-area birds carrying West Nile passed the virus to local
birds or whether the virus can persist over a winter season.
According to CDC research, the virus was found in 1999 in crows,
pigeons, and bald eagles; mallard ducks, sandhill cranes and
kingfishers; ring-billed, herring and laughing gulls; broad-winged,
Cooper's and red-tailed hawks, and kestrels; and robins, cuckoos
and blue jays.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report summarized 60 pages of guidelines developed
during a November summit meeting of disease experts convened by the
CDC. It warns that states are likely to be weak in:
</P>
<P>
   _ Surveillance of birds and mosquitoes, to see whether they are
carrying the virus, and reports by veterinarians and doctors of
unexplained neurologic problems in horses and humans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laboratory ability to do several levels of blood testing and
virus identification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mosquito control and public education about avoiding mosquito
bites.
</P>
<P>
   _ And expertise on mosquito-borne diseases in state health
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has already identified and addressed some of those
needs, Lance-Parker said. The state health department employs three
scientists specializing in diseases that are passed to humans by
insects or other invertebrates such as snails. It has enlisted
three veterinary diagnostic labs, two in Athens and one in Tifton,
to gear up for required tests. And it has begun an inventory of
mosquito-control programs and resources, since wiping out mosquito
populations stops transmission of West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Lance-Parker said, only four Georgia counties have
long-term mosquito control programs.
</P>
<P>
   If the state's bid to CDC for additional funding is successful,
she added, DPH will also create training programs for district and
county health departments, which would be the first to receive
reports of unexplained diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to improve surveillance for many things: not just
(viruses of the West Nile type), but bioterrorism and pandemic
influenza,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance-Parker declined to specify how much the state will ask the
CDC to provide. The agency, which regularly passes federal
disease-fighting money along to the states, said last month that it
would distribute up to $2.5 million to states for fighting West
Nile.

PLASTERER OFFERING GOOD ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When I pulled off the heavy vinyl paper from the plastered
walls of my living room, some of the paste remained, but some paste
and some of the plaster was pulled off with it. A plasterer said he
would remove the glue, put on a bonding agent, and replaster, for
$700. Is that too much to pay? Could I do that myself?
</P>
<P>
   A.H., Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not too much to pay, I believe, and the plasterer is
suggesting the right thing, especially using a bonding agent, which
will virtually guarantee that the new plaster coat will stick.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you can do it yourself. Success depends on your know-how,
time, and energy. To remove the paste, wash with a strong solution
of Spic and Span and water, and let this solution sit on the paste
for a few minutes, to soften it, before scrubbing. If there is a
lot of paste, you might have to scrape it off with a wide putty
knife as you soften it.
</P>
<P>
   If the plaster did not come off in great sections, you can fill
in the voids with joint compound, which has glue in it and should
stick quite well, even without a bonding agent; certainly better
than regular plaster. Let dry and sand smooth. Then paint with a
flat latex wall paint. If you feel the wall is too rough for
painting, apply new Wall-Tex type heavy duty paper with no pattern,
then paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house in Vermont is 200 years old and is so badly located
that the cellar floods in spring and whenever it rains, no matter
what I do. I just installed a new hot air furnace, and would like
to keep it from rusting away in that wet basement. How can I do
that?
</P>
<P>
   JON MILTON, East Barnard, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you really can't keep the water out by drainage, sump
pumps, and any other means, it means that your house is sitting in
a swamp or wetlands or other area with constant water. If so,
ventilation is your best bet. Make sure the furnace and other
cellar appliances are raised high enough to keep out of flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
   What ventilation does is release water vapor, which otherwise
will rust out the furnace before its time. And if there is water
present, venting will do little good, because there is a constant
source of water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   It's obviously a tough situation, but here's a thought: Make the
basement a crawl space by filling it with earth, and put
polyethylene plastic on top to prevent water vapor from coming up.
Relocate the furnace and water heater to the living part of the
house, or build a little addition to house them. This may not be
prohibitively expensive, and since the cellar is useless and always
will be, why not?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I burned a large pot of rice on the stove weeks ago, and
despite cleaning everything more than once, the kitchen still
stinks. How can I get rid of that odor? Most seems to be coming
from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   DAVE KAY, Harvard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, try a deodorant spray. One is Febreze, by Procter &AMP;
Gamble. It is designed for soft materials but could work on the
ceiling. It is sold in supermarkets. Another is Natural Magic Odor
Blaster, sold in various stores. Call 800-376-2442 for locations.
Or, before you do anything, wash the ceiling with white vinegar. It
may smell vinegary for a while, but when that goes away, the odor
might be gone, too. If none of these ideas works, paint the ceiling
with BIN, a pigmented shellac that will seal in the odor. Then
finish with latex ceiling paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a pretty good Stanley miter box, which I loaned to a
friend. He tried to adjust it and now it's all out of whack, and no
amount of adjusting by me seems to help. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES MASON, Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Call the Stanley Works in New Britain, Conn., 800-262-2161,
maker of that miter box. Stanley prides itself on the quality of
its tools and products, so you should get some good advice or even
an adjustment. The handyman worked in New Britain in his salad
days; in fact he could see from his house the Stanley Works, which
is the sole survivor of half a dozen factories in what was callled
the Hardware City. This only means that the handyman has a high
opinion of the Stanley Works. Or, call Sears, which with its new
Brand Central program sells many brands, might be of help, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some window quilts that have been up for many years
and they do work very well in keeping the heat in and the cold out.
But they are quite soiled, and my regular dry cleaner won't touch
them. Who would clean them?
</P>
<P>
   PHYLIS MOWBRAY, Hamilton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Window quilts are simply quiltlike coverings for windows, I
believe, and should clean like a quilt. Try a cleaner who
specializes in cleaning upholstery. Or, try it yourself with a
nonwater cleaner or a rug shampoo. Call Energy Unlimited of
Wayland, Mass., which sells window quilts, 508-358-7358.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., came to the Security
Council Thursday offering a ``hand of friendship,'' but delivered
the sort of clenched-fist message that has made him the symbol of
right-wing hostility to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, the most powerful conservative voice in foreign policy as
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argued that
Congress had the right to dictate conditions for the payment of
American debts to the organization. He warned the United Nations to
keep its ``utopian'' visions away from American sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United Nations respects the sovereign rights of the
American people, and serves them as an effective tool of diplomacy,
it will earn and deserve their respect and support,'' he said in a
speech to council members. ``But a United Nations that seeks to
impose its presumed authority on the American people without their
consent begs for confrontation and, I want to be candid, eventual
U.S. withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms tried to put a positive face on his visit, arranged by a
North Carolina businessman and a friend of the senator who was
appointed an alternate delegate to the General Assembly last fall
and by Richard Holbrooke, the American permanent representative to
the United Nations and this month's Security Council president.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has spent months trying to build bridges with a
hostile Congress, led by Helms, that has held up payments of U.N.
dues and delayed the confirmation of ambassadors and other foreign
policy officials _ notably including Holbrooke himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' Helms said, ``that this body have greater
contact with the elected representatives of the American people,
and that we have greater contact with you.'' He invited Security
Council members to visit his committee in Washington. Before the
council meeting, he spoke for about 40 minutes with Secretary
General Kofi Annan and asked him to pose for pictures with the
Helms family.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Helms, asserting that he was speaking for the
American people _ delivered a clear-cut conservative manifesto on
the United Nations, and didn't leave anything open for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his address to an extraordinary gathering of
ambassadors, nearly every member of the Security Council challenged
Helms' bleak portrayal of the United Nations, and criticized the
United States for letting the organization down.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Alain Dejammet of France, visibly agitated, said to
Helms: ``We hear you, but the idea in this house is that others
must be heard as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain added: ``The United Nations
is not a separate organ to which we turn, like a fire service. It
is the member states, and the United States owns 25 percent of the
power and the resources of the United Nations. What it does well,
the U.S. gets credit for. What it does badly, the U.S. must bear
some responsibility for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do things here democratically,'' Sir Jeremy said,
``because we all have national sovereignties. We all have national
sovereignties, and in a globalizing world there is such a thing as
the international collective interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms told the Security Council that unlike the Europeans, the
American people were moving away from ``supra-national
institutions'' and want no part of ``utopian'' international
arrangements, including the international criminal court created
last year over the objections of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session, which the council decided only Wednesday to
open to the press and the public, was a gamble for Holbrooke,
diplomats said. But it seems to have paid off both for Helms, who
was welcomed with fanfare and was given an unusual stage to air his
views, and for his adversaries. Diplomats from around the world,
particularly Security Council members who have fumed quietly over
what they see as a deadbeat America bankrupting the organization,
got the chance to tell Helms directly what they thought _ however
diplomatically the comments were couched.
</P>
<P>
   After Helms praised the anti-communist Reagan doctrine for
having brought freedom and democracy to the world without the help
or approval of the United Nations, the Namibian representative,
Martin Andjaba, took impassioned exception.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan doctrine, he said, denied independence to Namibia and
its Southwest African Peoples Organization, gave support to
apartheid South Africa and empowered the UNITA rebel movement in
Angola, which has prolonged a quarter-century-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It contributed to a lot of suffering in Africa,'' he said.
``Some of us in SWAPO who were a legitimate and genuine national
liberation movement were called other names: terrorists,'' he said.
``And those that caused death and destruction in Africa were called
liberators _ and they were supported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That page has passed, but we have it fresh in our memories,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said Thursday that he spoke for the American people, but
in reality he set out a clear-cut manifesto of the conservative
right on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a list of indictments against the organization, he revived
old criticism about votes in the General Assembly that ran against
the United States, he attacked a human rights monitor who reported
on allegations of human rights violations in the United States and
objected to accusations that American debts _ still more than $1
billion despite a recent payment _ were harming the organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States had spent $10.1 billion on the
United Nations and its projects in 1999, a figure immediately
disputed by Steven Dimoff, vice president of the U.N. Association
of the United States and the director of its Washington office.
Dimoff said in an interview that the sum ``really does stretch
reality,'' because it included military activities planned and
executed by the United States without any input from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Dimoff, whose organization supports and studies the United
Nations, said that the spectacle in the Security Council of a
member of Congress and not the president purporting to speak for
the American people on foreign affairs ``demonstrates how the
Clinton administration has ceded all the ground of U.S.
policymaking on the U.N. to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance Thursday,'' he said, ``is symbolic of the
extent to which Congress is now in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of France and Canada also challenged Helms
on his budget assertions and his denials that the burden of
American arrears was falling on poor nations. Helms said that the
American people ``have heard U.N. officials say absurdly that
countries like Fiji and Bangladesh were carrying America's burden
in peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's representative, Robert Fowler, replied: ``Senator, I
don't know if I am a U.N. official. I don't think I am. But I am
somebody who has spoken recently about Fiji and Bangladesh. I noted
that in 1999 Bangladesh was owed approximately $18 million, or just
under 175 times its regular budget contributions to this
organization, and that Fiji was owed $4 million, or just under 100
times its regular budget assessment.

   ``In that 60 percent of all monies owed to the United Nations
are owed by the United States, 60 percent of those numbers are owed
by Americans to Bangladeshis and to Fijians.,'' he said.

A SLIPPED DISK AND ITS FLIP SIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; was on ``ER'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   The episode opened with a shot of a station wagon racing through
traffic toward a major metropolitan hospital. As the car pulls to a
stop, two attendants lift me onto a gurney, then zip me through a
maze of corridors.
</P>
<P>
   In the next scene, I'm making my way through the triage
procedure, describing the excruciating pain radiating from my back
down my inner thigh, hoping to inspire at least as much compassion
as the cases of pneumonia, trauma, and heart attacks also vying for
immediate medical attention. A male nurse shows up, smiles, and
performs an act of wizardry worthy of Harry Potter. One moment he
is waving shrink-wrapped Percocet and Valium in front of my face.
Seconds later the magic potions have miraculously vanished _ into
my mouth _ and begin causing indescribable special effects all the
way down to the tips of my toes.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, after a ride on an elevator, several extras,
dressed as nurses, are sliding me into the deep tunnel of an MRI
machine. As the walls enclose me, I struggle to decipher the cries
and phrases with which I realize the machine is desperately trying
to communicate. As the drugs fully kick in, I am overjoyed to
realize that I have at last become privy to the secret of the
universe. As soon as I recall what it is, you can be sure I'll be
the first person to reveal to the uninitiated what magnetic images
truly resonate.
</P>
<P>
   My final scene was the best. Back in the ER, stretched out in a
skimpy johnnie, I open my eyes and behold a vision of salvation in
a senior resident's official white jacket, complete with photo ID.
I find myself looking into deep brown compassionate eyes. I am
reassured by a gentle smile and blessed by the comforting touch of
a guy who can only be described by a woman of my generation as a
gorgeous blond hunk.
</P>
<P>
   This is the moment I know for sure I have died and gone on TV.
</P>
<P>
   After that, reality was a bit of a letdown. I was sent home
(diagnosis: bulging disk) with nothing to do but take large regular
doses of powerful legal drugs and wait for my appointment with an
orthopedist 10 days later. I got to watch lots of videos totally
guilt-free, lie around on various flat surfaces all day, and talk
at length on the phone to fascinating friends I once used to end
conversations with by saying, ``I've got to go now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow, looking at it that way, it hasn't been that much of a
letdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, never ending, and out of reach as I lie flat on my back,
e-mail is infiltrating my computer like the swarm of locusts God
sent when Pharaoh dared to dis Moses. I also get business calls.
Some go like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Linda. How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really terrible. I've slipped a disk, can barely make it
to the bathroom, and I'm on so much pain medication, I can't think
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, do you think you could put that information for our
April newsletter into the mail first thing in the morning?''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what would happen if I answered: ``Gee, I'm being
fitted for a coffin at the moment and I'm being buried first thing
tomorrow morning.'' Would my caller ask me to send the information
even sooner?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, almost a year ago I made a commitment to
address a conference in Boston at the end of January, and I dreaded
telling my contact with less than 10 days' notice that I would be
unable to keep my word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, you poor thing,'' she said, her words music to my ears,
``Your only job is to get well and heal as soon as possible. Don't
you worry about a thing. It's my job to find someone to replace
you.'' Believe me, when this woman gets sick and goes on TV, that
blond resident is going to be right there, waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'm strangely content to let the days pass. No
one has ever accused me of being a Pollyanna (just ask me about the
environmental apocalypse looming in our future), but when it gets
down to the little things, I tend to count my blessings. The pain
in my back is not fatal. It is also tolerable. I have visitors,
helpers, and more indications than anyone deserves that people love
and care about me. With the help of a PowerBook, I'm not in danger
of losing my job. We have excellent health insurance and I trust my
primary physician, a miracle in itself.
</P>
<P>
   I see my orthopod today. Hopefully, he'll get me back on my
feet. As my friend Christina reminds me, I have also been given
time to reflect on why it took a bulging disk to slow me down, and
should be able to figure out a less extreme method of taking care
of myself.
</P>
<P>
   I look like a medical disaster area, but really, what more could
a physical setback do for you?

EPA SAYS '99 WAS A RECORD ENFORCEMENT YEAR IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rebutting criticism from inside and outside the agency
for being soft on criminal acts of pollution, the New England
office of the US Environmental Protection Agency announced
Wednesday that it had a record enforcement year in 1999, forcing
violators to spend more than $200 million to comply with
environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism persists, even though the agency's record last
year indicates a tougher stand on enforcement over previous years.
Some say the agency still prefers negotiated settlements to
aggressive enforcement, resulting in lower fines and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it made 33 judicial referrals and issued 90
administrative penalty actions in 1999, more than in any of the
previous eight years. It also scored a record $7.7 million in
settlements with polluters for ``innovative'' projects, ones that
are not required by law, but supplement what is required. It had
only $2.2 million worth of such projects in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under former regional administrator John DeVillars, who left the
EPA on Jan. 7 for the private sector, the agency had spent years
trying to develop more imaginative ways of persuading polluters to
comply than simply charging them with violations. The effort won
DeVillars fans and foes alike, the latter criticizing him for
coddling criminals. The regional office's work was the subject of a
Boston Globe Spotlight series last November.
</P>
<P>
   But in forcing polluters to spend $202 million to comply, a 16
percent increase over 1998, and in winning victories over such
corporate giants as Pfizer and Northeast Utilities, the agency said
that while it has a more flexible approach to compliance now, it
has not forgotten the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's report ``shows that EPA-New England is not willing
to stand by while irresponsible companies pollute our land, water,
and air,'' said Mindy Lubber, the acting regional administrator.
The findings reflect the agency's overall enforcement strategy, a
mix of strict oversight, compliance assistance, and innovative
technologies, said Lubber, considered the top candidate to be named
as DeVillar's successor.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement with Pfizer, the Connecticut pharmaceutical
manufacturer, the EPA won a $625,000 penalty for alleged waste and
community right-to-know violations. But it also required the
company to develop better waste management methods with the
University of Rhode Island, and to train Connecticut teachers on
handling school wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's efforts also resulted in a federal court ruling
against two subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities, the
Connecticut-based power producer, forcing them to pay $10 million
for 25 felony counts at two power plants for violating the federal
Clean Water Act and lying to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Of
the $10 million, $3.3 million will be spent on innovative projects,
including $1 million to preserve riverfront land.
</P>
<P>
   The agency struck a pending $45 million agreement with General
Electric and the city of Pittsfield to clean up the Housatonic
River in western Massachusetts and revitalize a polluted 250-acre
site. It took action against seven federal, state and local
agencies. And it launched an enforcement initiative against the
region's 262 colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   But some say the agency is just returning to the enforcement
level it had earlier this decade before DeVillars took charge, and
that $202 million in compliance costs amounts to companies
investing in themselves. They also say the agency's predilection to
settle may mean millions of dollars are not being collected for
environmental violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England takes enforcement actions only with the consent of
the violator,'' said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a watchdog group of
federal employees. ``If they could have gotten $2 billion for the
taxpayers, but only got $202 million, that's nothing to brag
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's criminal enforcement record, which was not detailed
in the report, indicates it has been more or less holding steady
since 1996, said Sam Silverman, who manages the EPA's enforcement
office. Criminal referrals dropped from 24 in 1996 to 17 last year.
But the number of people indicted, charged, convicted, and
sentenced rose or remained constant, depending on the category, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we have as aggressive an enforcement
program as we can have every year,'' Silverman said. ``But whether
we get grand juries that indict and juries and judges that convict,
that's beyond our control.''

<P>
   In George Foreman's first boxing incarnation, he was a lean,
snarling ogre who mauled Joe Frazier to win the heavyweight
championship 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned in 1987 after a 10-year retirement preaching on
streets and eating his way to 310 pounds, Foreman II became an
image of mirth with punch speed measured by an egg timer.
</P>
<P>
   He did beat Michael Moorer in 1994 to win the title again, but
today, at 51, the closest he gets to boxing is analyzing fights for
HBO Sports. What occupies him now is a second career as a pitchman,
a pitchman with a difference. Instead of endorsing products for
annual fees, as many sports stars do, he has become perhaps the
first to sell his name in perpetuity. Having traded trunks for a
red apron, he now urges television shoppers to buy George Foreman's
Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a radical, and lucrative, image make over, from
tough guy to cuddly superstar.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 million nonstick grillers sold since 1995, the
manufacturer, Salton, bought Foreman's name and image last month
for $137.5 million in cash and stock. Foreman will receive $110
million over five years, joining the ranks of the highest-paid
pitchmen. He agreed never to endorse rival cookware, though he is
free to pitch, say, cars or shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Nike, Coors, McDonald's and now the Internet
dot-coms pay athletes like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and Ken
Griffey Jr. handsomely to endorse their products. Foreman had gone
that route, for Meineke and Doritos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a commercial man,'' he said. ``People would say, `We
want you to sell this,' I'd say, `How much?' and I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But buying a star's name is something else. ``It's unheard of,''
said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports, a Chicago firm that
matches athletes to advertisers. ``I can't come up with anything
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Vuono, president for marketing at the SFX Sports
Group, said, ``Jack Nicklaus built his company around his name, but
I don't know of someone who had his name bought out.''
</P>
<P>
   To revive his dormant career, Foreman packaged himself as a
bald, benevolent, burger-chomping, jelly-bellied boxer determined
to prove that turning 40 (or 50) was not an athletic death
sentence. His loss to Evander Holyfield in April 1991 attracted 1.4
million pay-per-view subscribers, a record that stood for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``George created a lot of good will and loyalty by knocking out
Moorer and doing a lot of talk shows,'' said Henry Holmes,
Foreman's lawyer. ``He has an ability to communicate across age,
economic, religious and racial boundaries.'' In 1993, he even
starred in a short-lived sitcom called ``George.'' And a movie on
his life, based on his book, ``By George,'' is being developed by
Ross Greenburg of HBO Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman wants to box again, but his wife, Joan, won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when you're more afraid of what your wife will do to you
than what fighters will do, you should get out,'' Foreman said last
month in a telephone interview from his home in Kingwood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When Salton, a unit of Centre Partners Management, introduced
the Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine _ sans Foreman _ at a
trade show in 1994, nobody paid attention. But then Michael
Srednick, a veteran marketer of products like the legendary
Veg-O-Matic, spotted the griller and gave it to Sam Perlmutter, who
brought it to Foreman, who pined for some link to hamburgers, his
favorite food.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman briefly considered buying it and marketing it himself.
``But I said to George, `You can't do this on your own, you need
marketing and distribution.''' Srednick said. ``So I introduced him
to Salton.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Foreman suggested changes in the grill's size (to expand
its capacity beyond two burgers at a time) and design (it looked
too much like a waffle iron) but said he loved the way the sloped
grill cooked food on both sides, and let the fat drip into
grease-catchers. In 1995, Foreman signed a deal that made him a
partner with Salton, giving him 45 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to lose,'' Leon Dreimann, Salton's chief
executive, said. ``Retailers were not enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Having George was a wonderful way to reintroduce the
product. It's not that hard to come up with a good product, but it
is hard to separate yourself from the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Salton's expectations were modest. It knew that Foreman,
remembered by some for waving an American flag after winning the
heavyweight title at the 1968 Summer Olympics, was the most beloved
boxer after Muhammad Ali and that his bouts were among HBO's
highest rated. Most of all, it knew of Foreman's indelible
reputation for wolfing down cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back into boxing, the writers said, `His training
camp is next to Burger King,''' Foreman said. He never tried to
alter the impression.
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly altered Salton's anticipated sales. One day,
Dreimann read that Foreman thought he could make $1 million in
royalties from the griller. Dreimann thought, ``I hope he's not
exaggerating.'' Then, when Foreman predicted in a television
interview that the griller would be a staple in 70 million American
homes, Dreimann remembered ``raising my eyebrows and saying,
`That's a lot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sales built slowly at first, then exploded, largely because of
Foreman's infomercials and appearances on the QVC home shopping
channel. The company has never marketed its products through
30-second TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 million grills sold, 700,000 have been sold on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most successful small appliance in the history of its
category on QVC,'' a QVC spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thyra Porter, kitchenware editor for HF Network, a weekly trade
publication, said, ``Salton has done extraordinarily well by
selling the griller with such a charismatic guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman quickly warmed to his calling as an infomercial
superstar like Ron Popeil, the energetic innovator behind the
Pocket Fisherman, and Suzanne Somers, empress of the Buttmaster. He
was becoming as well known for exclaiming about fatty juices
dripping from chicken breasts as for pole-axing opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning to accept that the least part of me is about
boxing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the seminal moment, the moment when Foreman morphed from
part-time boxer to full-time salesman, came in November 1997, when
he stood in a ring in Atlantic City, N.J., and responded to
questions about losing a decision to Shannon Briggs despite
outfighting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, that's about eight weeks I spent on the George Foreman
Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine,'' he said, hiking his
sweatshirt to reveal a not-so-lean belly. ``I grill right in the
bedroom. Steak and salmon steak. I was able to lose a lot of
weight. That thing really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait _ there was more: ``Remember, the George Foreman Lean Mean
Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine. No home should be without this
thing. God bless you. Go get one.'' Had he come to fight or plug?
Hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Salton approached Foreman with the buyout offer in
June, he had pocketed $50 million to $60 million in royalties. His
grills _ in three sizes, selling for $30 to $100 _ accounted for 38
percent of Salton's 1999 revenues of $506.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only surprised they came to me so late with this,''
Foreman said. ``I knew sooner or later it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy for Salton, which also makes the Juiceman, Breadman
and Toastmaster products, is a financial judgment that the buyout
would be cheaper than royalties well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dreimann said the introduction of new Foreman-brand barbecues,
rotisseries and cookware, more competitive products with lower
margins than grillers, meant reduced profits that it preferred to
keep rather than distribute to Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at what we'd been paying him on an annual basis, and
what we'd be comfortable paying out over the next five years,''
Dreimann said. ``There's a point in time when you don't know how
much publicity George will be getting. He gets good exposure with
HBO, but the maximum coverage for him may be what the company is
doing for him. When he hits 55 or 60, how much of a pull would he
have without the continuity we would provide?''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Foreman's career was defined by Howard Cosell's call of
his devastating initial knockdown of Frazier:
</P>
<P>
   ``Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his career can be summed up by this exchange from one
infomercial:
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you made for us, George?'' the host asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot dogs!'' Foreman replied excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Well, eating lasts longer than a boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifetime commitment for me,'' he said. ``They really
made a good deal with George Foreman. Amen.''

   BELMONT-DEAD (Los Angeles) -- Los Angeles Unified's two top
leaders recommended Thursday that the district halt construction of
a high school at the environmentallly plagued Belmont Learning
Center site and instead use the property for administrative offices
and warehouse space. The recommendation by Chief Operating Officer
Howard Miller and interim Supt. Ramon C. Cortines precedes
Tuesday's scheduled vote by the school board to determine whether
to continue or abandon the project, which has cost the district
more than $170 million. The district leaders say other district
sites in the area -- including LAUSD headquarters itself -- should
be used as classroom space. By Greg Gittrich (Will move on the

   He's uttered that line several times in recent days, only this
time he staged the accusation before a bevy of TV cameras, right
across the street from the Russian consulate.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming Russian presidential election, he exclaimed,
``there will be more than one name on the ballot.'' And so, he
said, should it be in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got in his van and was driven away.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no bones about what he was doing. Asked afterwards
why he chose to make his statement at this Upper East Side location
_ way off the beaten track of any other appointments for the day _
he smiled and said, ``I thought it would make a good photo op.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a desperate tactic, but for McCain, these are desperate
times _ in New York, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The way the state's Republican Party has set up its March 7
primary, McCain could conceivably wind up the favored candidate,
and still not win a single New York delegate to the national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The party's leaders, who are backing Texas Gov. George W. Bush
in the presidential race, made it this way long ago and for just
this reason: to control the primary outcome.
</P>
<P>
   State law seems, on the face of things, fairly simple: To make
it on the presidential ballot, a candidate needs to collect 5,000
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the Republican ballot, votes are cast for delegates,
not for candidates directly. And by the party rules, the delegates
must collect signatures from 0.5 percent of registered Republicans
in each of the 31 congressional districts. Furthermore, they must
not include Republicans who have signed another candidate's
petition.
</P>
<P>
   The contest is tilted against McCain in another way. Because the
party leaders have demanded solidarity within the ranks, Bush's
delegates are well-known local politicians. The other candidates'
delegates are, by and large, unknowns. The ballot shows the
delegates' name in big, bold letters _ and the candidates' name in
small, thin ones.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the Democratic primary, voters cast ballots for
the candidates. Delegates are chosen later, to reflect the
proportion of votes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain qualified in only 16 of the districts _ and party lawyers
are challenging even some of those petitions.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, McCain has asked the Board of Elections to allow his
name on all the district ballots, and has filed a lawsuit in a
Federal court, which will hear the case next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, we're a small party,'' said Guy Molinari, the
Staten Island borough president and one of the very few New York
Republicans of any prominence who have endorsed McCain. ``Without
the help of the state organization, it's almost impossible to
qualify in a lot of districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In lots of districts,'' he went on, ``it's hard to find the
Republicans. I spent a half-day, calling registered Republicans in
a minority neighborhood in Brooklyn. I got one to sign a petition.
Two of my guys spent all day in the Bronx. They got one signature.
It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mercurio, a local Republican consultant, said that, in
over half the districts, ``even the Bush people had trouble
qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the multi-millionaire Republican candidate, made
it on all 31 ballots this time, after going through the same
struggles in 1996 that McCain is going through now. However, Forbes
spent $750,000 merely to organize the necessary petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be, both parties in New York ran closed primaries.
Until the mid-1970s, all ballots listed only the names of
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties liked to
run uncommitted delegates,'' recalled Martin Connor, an election
lawyer who is the Democratic leader in the New York state senate.
``That way, the bosses could wheel and deal at the national
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, candidates' names were added to the ballot, but, to
qualify, their delegates had to collect 1,250 signatures in each
congressional district _ far more demanding than the Republican
rule today.
</P>
<P>
   That year, the state's Democratic bosses threw Jimmy Carter's
delegate-slates off the ballots in every district.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter won the nomination and Eugene McCarthy launched a
campaign as an independent candidate, Connor recalled, ``Carter
said, `Get me the lawyers who threw me off the ballot, and get them
to keep McCarthy off.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers succeeded. McCarthy's name was bumped off the ballot
_ a fact that may have won the state and the presidency for Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since, the Democratic party here has enacted
reforms in its primaries. The Republican party _ partly because it
is smaller and more cohesive _ has not. ``They've kept pretty much
the same system,'' Connor said. ``They've opted to hang on to
control.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the season's first real snow blanketed the region
Thursday, Long Island commuters found their way snarled by both the
slick, icy gloss and by politics in faraway Albany, as hundreds of
state workers, unhappy over contract talks, staged a strike rather
than show up to drive snowplows and salt spreaders.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki responded with unusual ferocity, declaring a
state of emergency, putting the National Guard on alert and
obtaining a court order against the workers and their union. He
also ordered an investigation into the walkout, in part to
determine whether the workers could be fired and the union fined.
Labor leaders accused him of overreacting for political effect.
</P>
<P>
   The light layer of snow that fell would rank low on any list of
emergencies, but after three straight mild winters and a balmy
start to this one, New Yorkers could be forgiven for a moment of
panic, not to mention some inept driving, at the first flakes. By
the afternoon rush, about 2 inches had fallen across most of the
metropolitan region, though forecasters predicted that before the
night was through, New York City would get 3 to 5 inches and the
Eastern forks of Long Island would see 4 to 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The governor was not alone in mobilizing as if for a military
campaign. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani activated the city's
hurricane-proof, flood-proof, earthquake-proof command center at
the World Trade Center, where he and other officials cited a long
list of impressive statistics to reassure everyone that all was
under control. (Plows at work: 1,272. Spreaders: 353. Tons of salt
spread by afternoon: 5,000.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The striking road workers on Long Island are members of the
Civil Service Employees Union, the largest group of state workers,
who have been without a contract since March 31, 1999. The union
has held many demonstrations, increasing in size and intensity, to
protest contract offers from Pataki that the workers consider
inadequate. In April, union members rejected a contract that would
have increased salaries 11.5 percent over four years, and talks
have been stalled since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been waiting for a pay increase, and everyone is
more or less rebelling,'' said Richard Diffley, an employee at the
state Department of Transportation's depot in Syosset. He said he
reported to work only because his wife was about to have a baby and
he did not want to risk losing any pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members are just fed up,'' said William Stodolski,
president of Local 508 of the Civil Service Employees, the local
that included the strikers. ``They don't have a contract, and the
wage offers by the state are unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in anticipation of the storm, the department
ordered 440 workers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties to be at work at
6 a.m. Thursday for snow and ice removal duty on state highways.
``Only 30 of them showed up,'' said Michael Fleischer, a department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, in a statement, charged that the strike ``has been
condoned and supported by the state Civil Service Employees
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   But union officials insisted that it was a wildcat strike and
that they had no idea that it was coming. In fact, through the
morning, they gave radio interviews urging workers to report for
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The union contended that by midday, nearly all the workers had
returned, but the administration contended that fewer than half had
done so. Fleischer said that while the department got a slow start
salting the highways, by early afternoon, with help from Nassau and
Suffolk County crews, it had enough plows and spreaders on the
roads to deal with the snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thursday afternoon, Pataki declared a state of emergency
on Long Island, mobilized the National Guard and directed the
Department of Transportation to hire private plow operators. The
department contracted for about 15 private plows, which union
officials said were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The governor directed Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the state's inspector
general, to conduct an investigation into the strike and determine
what punitive action could be taken against the union and the
workers, including, his statement said, ``suspending the workers
without pay, subjecting them to severe penalties and firing them.''
If the administration can establish that the union organized or
condoned the action, it is subject to heavy fines under state law.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Pataki's request, the state also got a temporary restraining
order against the union and the employees in state Supreme Court in
Suffolk County, which directed them to end the strike. Justice
Robert A. Lifson, who issued the order, said that if the walkout
continued, he would fine the union $1 million a day if the state
could show that the union had not done everything it could to end
it, and would fine each striking worker $1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, in an interview on News 12, a Long Island cable
television channel, said: ``This is an illegal act that threatens
the lives of Long Islanders and has resulted in accidents. We're
not going to tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When asked why the National Guard might be needed, Michael
McKeon, the governor's press secretary, said: ``They have resources
they could use. If people were going off the road, they could help.
Mostly, we just wanted them there, just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the action was too well
coordinated and involved too high a proportion of the workers, to
have been carried out without the union's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York state AFL-CIO, called
a reporter to say, ``The governor's response was outrageous, way
out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the credibility of the governor's office,
saying that it was telling the union at 1 p.m. that everybody went
back to work, even as administration officials were complaining to
reporters that few of the road workers were on duty. ``The governor
is making this unfortunate situation worse by trying to be a tough
guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Until the cold spell of the last few days, nature had given the
impression that winter would never come. Thursday's snow _ the
metropolitan area's first of the season, except for a brief dusting
in some spots _ marked the second-latest date for the first
measurable snowfall in New York City's history.
</P>
<P>
   The snowfall covered much of the eastern half of the nation
Thursday, with some cities registering a light dusting while others
saw a thick coating of snow with powerful wind gusts. Roanoke, Va.,
Baltimore and Beech Mountain, N.C., had received 5 inches of snow
by late Thursday, and as much as an inch an hour was falling in
Delaware and southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   While the snowfall in the New York area was a bit less dramatic
during the day than had been expected, it was still enough to
tangle roads. The police reported two flipped cars during the
morning rush on Long Island and about an accident per mile on the
Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   The area's airports saw delays of 30 minutes to two hours, due
mostly to weather problems in connecting cities, and the commuter
trains ran more or less on time.
</P>
<P>
   The greater challenge on the roads may come Friday, when any
slush left on the blacktop will have turned to patchy ice. The
National Weather Service predicted temperatures in the teens, with
high winds and wind-chill readings around zero.

LARGEST DIALYSIS FIRM SETTLES FRAUD CASE FOR $486M 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concluding a sweeping five-year probe of a massive Medicare
fraud scheme, federal officials have said the world's largest
kidney dialysis company, Fresenius Medical Care North America, has
agreed to pay $486 million to settle criminal and civil charges.
</P>
<P>
   It was by far the largest settlement exacted so far in a federal
campaign to prosecute what were once common forms of corruption in
the lucrative and intensely competitive medical services industry,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message today is unmistakable,'' said Mark Pearlstein,
first assistant US attorney for Massachusetts, flanked by some two
dozen investigators and Washington officials at a press conference
Wednesday. ``The government has the ability to unravel the most
complex and convoluted of schemes, and if you are engaging in these
practices, you will be caught.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal charges, three subsidiaries of National
Medical Care _ formerly a Waltham, Mass. company that Fresenius
acquired in 1996 _ routinely filed hundreds of thousands of false
Medicare claims, ordered unnecessary tests, and doled out kickbacks
in an effort to make doctors and health care centers recommend
National Medical Care products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the schemes was simple: to increase revenues,''
Pearlstein said. ``In a very literal sense, these companies adopted
criminal behavior as a corporate strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   National Medical Care was a unit of W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. when the
schemes were carried out, officials said. A federal probe was
already under way when Fresenius acquired National Medical Care in
October 1996, and Fresenius cooperated in the investigation,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the settlement, Fresenius agreed to pay $101
million to settle criminal charges and $385 million in civil
penalties under the False Claims Act. The company also agreed to an
eight-year government-supervised compliance program to ensure
violations don't continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were inherited problems, and the company came into this
with eyes open, knowing there was an investigation going on,'' said
John Markus, a Fresenius senior vice president of corporate
compliance. ``But we're happy to have this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Markus said the company has started training programs for
employees and hired outside auditors who will examine the company's
books and practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very comfortable with how we're working today,''
Markus said. ``We've got people coming around, kicking the tires
and using their instincts to probe for any possible problems. It's
one thing to put a program on paper. The real challenge is to put
it into the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresenius, based in Lexington, Mass., operates more than 800
kidney dialysis centers in the United States and treats some 60,000
patients who have advanced kidney disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In George Foreman's first boxing incarnation, he was a lean,
snarling ogre who mauled Joe Frazier to win the heavyweight
championship 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned in 1987 after a 10-year retirement preaching on
streets and eating his way to 310 pounds, Foreman II became an
image of mirth with punch speed measured by an egg timer.
</P>
<P>
   He did beat Michael Moorer in 1994 to win the title again, but
today, at 51, the closest he gets to boxing is analyzing fights for
HBO Sports. What occupies him now is a second career as a pitchman,
a pitchman with a difference. Instead of endorsing products for
annual fees, as many sports stars do, he has become perhaps the
first to sell his name in perpetuity. Having traded trunks for a
red apron, he now urges television shoppers to buy George Foreman's
Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a radical, and lucrative, image make over, from
tough guy to cuddly superstar.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 million nonstick grillers sold since 1995, the
manufacturer, Salton, bought Foreman's name and image last month
for $137.5 million in cash and stock. Foreman will receive $110
million over five years, joining the ranks of the highest-paid
pitchmen. He agreed never to endorse rival cookware, though he is
free to pitch, say, cars or shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Nike, Coors, McDonald's and now the Internet
dot-coms pay athletes like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and Ken
Griffey Jr. handsomely to endorse their products. Foreman had gone
that route, for Meineke and Doritos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a commercial man,'' he said. ``People would say, `We
want you to sell this,' I'd say, `How much?' and I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But buying a star's name is something else. ``It's unheard of,''
said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports, a Chicago firm that
matches athletes to advertisers. ``I can't come up with anything
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Vuono, president for marketing at the SFX Sports
Group, said, ``Jack Nicklaus built his company around his name, but
I don't know of someone who had his name bought out.''
</P>
<P>
   To revive his dormant career, Foreman packaged himself as a
bald, benevolent, burger-chomping, jelly-bellied boxer determined
to prove that turning 40 (or 50) was not an athletic death
sentence. His loss to Evander Holyfield in April 1991 attracted 1.4
million pay-per-view subscribers, a record that stood for four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``George created a lot of good will and loyalty by knocking out
Moorer and doing a lot of talk shows,'' said Henry Holmes,
Foreman's lawyer. ``He has an ability to communicate across age,
economic, religious and racial boundaries.'' In 1993, he even
starred in a short-lived sitcom called ``George.'' And a movie on
his life, based on his book, ``By George,'' is being developed by
Ross Greenburg of HBO Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman wants to box again, but his wife, Joan, won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when you're more afraid of what your wife will do to you
than what fighters will do, you should get out,'' Foreman said last
month in a telephone interview from his home in Kingwood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When Salton, a unit of Centre Partners Management, introduced
the Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine _ sans Foreman _ at a
trade show in 1994, nobody paid attention. But then Michael
Srednick, a veteran marketer of products like the legendary
Veg-O-Matic, spotted the griller and gave it to Sam Perlmutter, who
brought it to Foreman, who pined for some link to hamburgers, his
favorite food.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman briefly considered buying it and marketing it himself.
``But I said to George, `You can't do this on your own, you need
marketing and distribution.''' Srednick said. ``So I introduced him
to Salton.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Foreman suggested changes in the grill's size (to expand
its capacity beyond two burgers at a time) and design (it looked
too much like a waffle iron) but said he loved the way the sloped
grill cooked food on both sides, and let the fat drip into
grease-catchers. In 1995, Foreman signed a deal that made him a
partner with Salton, giving him 45 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to lose,'' Leon Dreimann, Salton's chief
executive, said. ``Retailers were not enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Having George was a wonderful way to reintroduce the
product. It's not that hard to come up with a good product, but it
is hard to separate yourself from the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Salton's expectations were modest. It knew that Foreman,
remembered by some for waving an American flag after winning the
heavyweight title at the 1968 Summer Olympics, was the most beloved
boxer after Muhammad Ali and that his bouts were among HBO's
highest rated. Most of all, it knew of Foreman's indelible
reputation for wolfing down cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back into boxing, the writers said, `His training
camp is next to Burger King,''' Foreman said. He never tried to
alter the impression.
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly altered Salton's anticipated sales. One day,
Dreimann read that Foreman thought he could make $1 million in
royalties from the griller. Dreimann thought, ``I hope he's not
exaggerating.'' Then, when Foreman predicted in a television
interview that the griller would be a staple in 70 million American
homes, Dreimann remembered ``raising my eyebrows and saying,
`That's a lot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sales built slowly at first, then exploded, largely because of
Foreman's infomercials and appearances on the QVC home shopping
channel. The company has never marketed its products through
30-second TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 million grills sold, 700,000 have been sold on QVC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most successful small appliance in the history of its
category on QVC,'' a QVC spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thyra Porter, kitchenware editor for HF Network, a weekly trade
publication, said, ``Salton has done extraordinarily well by
selling the griller with such a charismatic guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman quickly warmed to his calling as an infomercial
superstar like Ron Popeil, the energetic innovator behind the
Pocket Fisherman, and Suzanne Somers, empress of the Buttmaster. He
was becoming as well known for exclaiming about fatty juices
dripping from chicken breasts as for pole-axing opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning to accept that the least part of me is about
boxing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the seminal moment, the moment when Foreman morphed from
part-time boxer to full-time salesman, came in November 1997, when
he stood in a ring in Atlantic City, N.J., and responded to
questions about losing a decision to Shannon Briggs despite
outfighting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, that's about eight weeks I spent on the George Foreman
Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine,'' he said, hiking his
sweatshirt to reveal a not-so-lean belly. ``I grill right in the
bedroom. Steak and salmon steak. I was able to lose a lot of
weight. That thing really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait _ there was more: ``Remember, the George Foreman Lean Mean
Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine. No home should be without this
thing. God bless you. Go get one.'' Had he come to fight or plug?
Hard to say.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Salton approached Foreman with the buyout offer in
June, he had pocketed $50 million to $60 million in royalties. His
grills _ in three sizes, selling for $30 to $100 _ accounted for 38
percent of Salton's 1999 revenues of $506.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only surprised they came to me so late with this,''
Foreman said. ``I knew sooner or later it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy for Salton, which also makes the Juiceman, Breadman
and Toastmaster products, is a financial judgment that the buyout
would be cheaper than royalties well into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Dreimann said the introduction of new Foreman-brand barbecues,
rotisseries and cookware, more competitive products with lower
margins than grillers, meant reduced profits that it preferred to
keep rather than distribute to Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at what we'd been paying him on an annual basis, and
what we'd be comfortable paying out over the next five years,''
Dreimann said. ``There's a point in time when you don't know how
much publicity George will be getting. He gets good exposure with
HBO, but the maximum coverage for him may be what the company is
doing for him. When he hits 55 or 60, how much of a pull would he
have without the continuity we would provide?''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Foreman's career was defined by Howard Cosell's call of
his devastating initial knockdown of Frazier:
</P>
<P>
   ``Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his career can be summed up by this exchange from one
infomercial:
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you made for us, George?'' the host asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot dogs!'' Foreman replied excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Well, eating lasts longer than a boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifetime commitment for me,'' he said. ``They really

   Cisco Systems Inc. expanded its offerings in the burgeoning
virtual private networks market Wednesday, announcing the
acquisitions of Altiga Networks Inc. of Franklin, Mass. for $351.5
million and Compatible Systems of Boulder, Colo., for $214.5
million. Both were stock deals.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Altiga will enable Cisco to market products
and services to corporations with employees, such as salespeople on
the road or telecommuters, who need to be linked to their company's
central computers through the Internet. Such virtual private
networks reduce a company's costs by requiring less networking
equipment and trimming overall telephone costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets for our kinds of products are moving so quickly
that it's simply phenomenal,'' said Mark Freitas, founder and chief
executive of Altiga. The 76-employee company formed two years ago
to develop virtual private networks and began selling its equipment
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies use toll-free numbers or other dedicated phone
lines for corporate access, a system Cisco officials say is far
more expensive than using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual private networks is a big opportunity for us, and
Altiga has an experienced management and technical team and a
product that we can get into the market quickly,'' said Ammar
Hanafi, director of business development at San Jose, Calif.-based
Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Compatible, formed in 1988, also makes equipment for virtual
private networks, and its products will become part of Cisco's line
marketed to Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The Altiga deal represents Cisco's ninth acquisition in New
England in the past five years. Freitas said Altiga, which will
become part of Cisco's enterprise line, will stay in Franklin. It
plans to expand and increase hiring to meet the expected increase
in demand for its products and services, which Cisco will sell to
corporate customers and ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Freitas said the acquisition offer came after Altiga approached
Cisco and other companies about distributing its virtual private
network equipment, which sells for between $8,000 and $30,000. He
said Cisco was not the only company to make such an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Cisco will issue 3.13 million shares for
all of Altiga's privately held stock. Based on Cisco's closing
price Wednesday of 112 5/16, that's worth $351.5 million. Cisco
also will issue 1.91 million shares worth $214.5 million for all of
Compatible's stock.

OF MILES AND MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN BURGESS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tercel had finally achieved a state of near-perfect
dilapidation, years in the making: The driver's door wouldn't open
from the outside; the heating system worked at blast-furnace levels
or not at all; the rocker panels wore skirts of rust; the splitting
driver's seat looked like a lab project in mid-dissection. It was
Daddy's Car, mainly because I was the only one in the family who
actually liked to ride in it.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news from the mechanic. Exquisite the Tercel
might be, but it was dying, would choke on its own fumes from a
sort of carbon-based pneumonia. Which put me in mind of
(itals)my(unitals) father's cars, perennially on their last legs.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, we were always a one-car family, but that car
inevitably bore my father's stamp of nonchalance. I still recall
family trips watching the pavement pass scenically between my feet
through a hole in the floor. Dad's last car was a 20-year-old
Thunderbird with a squalid vinyl roof and steering so loose that
you began turning a block ahead, as though putting the QE2 into a
berth.
</P>
<P>
   But he had gotten a good 100,000 miles out of it and, I'm sure,
looked forward to another 100,000. Like any real Daddy's Car, it
was scruffy, relaxed, maybe even slack, but in the end staunch.
Like a good traveling companion, which of course it literally is.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, given a richer budget, there are certainly other
possibilities for Daddy's Car _ a vintage Jaguar XKE, say. But
that's going to remain a dream, and I've got to have something
automotive to call my own (our other car is, of course, a minivan).
The three pennies welded to the Tercel's dash by an ancient film of
coffee, the paper bag laid across the erupting driver's seat to
prevent stuffing-butt _ they're as close as I'll ever come to
customizing. I only wish I had gotten around to one of those air
fresheners you hang on the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In its last weeks with me, the Tercel developed a set of grunts
and groans with which I was in complete sympathy. With the end in
sight, it didn't like going to work any better than I did. The
smell of gas fumes grew so gaudy, I thought it might just explode
one morning, taking me with it into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   I was spared, and we have the new car now. Moon roof, leather
seats, power lumbar adjustment; it is _ surprise _ Mommy's Car.
There is no Daddy's Car, yet. But give me and the minivan some
time. A few more New England winters, a couple of dozen cups of
coffee spilled on the dash are all we really need. I even got it a
pine-tree-shaped air freshener for Christmas.

RACE IS ON TO WIRE THE US FOR INTERNET SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As shock waves recede from the stunning $160 billion
acquisition of Time Warner by America Online, one piece of emerging
conventional wisdom seems to be that to the extent the deal makes
sense, what AOL gains most from the combination is access to
high-speed cable modems from Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the country, ``broadband'' access to the
Internet _ ultra-high-speed, ``always on'' service _ remains mostly
a dream. Just 6 percent of US Net households had access to
high-speed cable systems or upgraded telephone access at the end of
last year, according to International Data Corp. of Framingham,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers have been small, AOL clearly has seen the
writing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, more and more of AOL's 22 million
subscribers will have a choice between paying $20 a month for
torturous dial-up access to AOL and perhaps $40 to $50 a month for
super-fast access to a rival provider like Excite At Home or
RoadRunner.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rivals offer thinner content, analysts say AOL has
every reason to expect large numbers of subscribers to bolt,
especially those who just want a fast way onto the Web and to their
electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   That makes getting access to Time Warner's fast cable modems,
which are available to more than 18 million homes across the
country, crucial for AOL to survive and probably even more
important than access to the media giant's huge stable of
magazines, movie houses, and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to cable broadband was a very high priority for them,''
said Amy Harris, a top high-speed-access analyst with IDC. ``From
that perspective, I think it was a very good deal
</P>
<P>
   for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadband net access right now resembles the Oklahoma land rush
of the 1890s, with Baby Bells, cable companies, and independent
digital subscriber line rivals like HarvardNet and Network Access
Solutions racing to be the first company that can offer a ``fat
pipe'' to a given home or business.
</P>
<P>
   While some people will always have a preference between dealing
with ``the phone company'' or the cable company based on their
customer-service experiences, it is generally conceded that whoever
gets a broadband customer first, whatever the technology, will
likely keep that customer for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can knock on the door first and you can sell that
product, it's likely that you can maintain that service, most
definitely,'' said Jeffrey Waldhuter, Bell Atlantic's director of
network services strategy and a top DSL guru.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the cable companies clearly have the lead, but only in
the first lap of the race. As of the end of 1999, IDC estimated
cable firms had 1.35 million Net subscribers among the 36 million
American homes on line, led by Time Warner and Media One with
nearly 200,000 apiece and Cox, AT&AMP;T, and ComCast close behind with
more than 100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   DSL subscribers totaled 330,000, most of them apparently from
Baby Bells such as Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications, which
generally do not release subscriber numbers. ISDN lines, also
generally offered by Baby Bells, accounted for another 240,000
broadband users.
</P>
<P>
   DSL and cable modems both work by adding electronics to take
advantage of vast amounts of previously unused capacity on either
the standard copper telephone wires or coaxial cables that carry
television signals to homes. Despite cable's early lead, DSL
advocates like Waldhuter claim the long-term advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper already terminates in every home and every public area
and every business in America,'' Waldhuter notes. ``You can't say
that for cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Within four years, IDC predicts that 65 million American
households will be using the Net. But despite the billions being
poured into cable upgrades and DSL networks, only 31 percent will
be on broadband. IDC predicts cable and DSL each will have 14
percent, fixed-wireless or satellite systems counting for another 2
percent, and IDSN the last 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Word-of-mouth reports of the wonders of broadband access have
fueled insatiable demand among consumers. Several industry reports
have found that people with broadband access offering download
speeds of 1.5 million bits per second or higher spend four to 10
times as much time on the Net as people relying on
56-kilobit-per-second access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is the crack cocaine of Internet access,'' says
Richard Sabot, a Williams College economics professor who is active
in several Northern Berkshire Net start-ups, including on-line
global crafts bazaar eZiba.com. ``Once you get it, you can't get
enough of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Rasmussen, a spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic's DSL
operations, which have been launched in 735 of its 2,300 ``central
offices'' from Maine to West Virginia, said: ``People tell us this
product is wonderful for the speed, but what they always cite first
is having it always on'' and not having to go through the
frustrating 30-second process of dialing in or keeping other family
members from using the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's Colorado-based research lab last year conducted
anthropological studies of 16 Greater Boston families aimed at
learning how having broadband access changes family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not prepared for what we found,'' said study leader
Ken Anderson. ``Once logging into the Internet is no longer a
special, time-consuming event, instant Web access is treated like
just another home appliance, like a refrigerator or light switch,
taken for granted and used just as casually.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modem families averaged 22 1/2 hours on the Net each week
_ nearly one of every five waking hours _ compared with 4.7 hours
per week for dial-up homes, Anderson found.
</P>
<P>
   People with broadband access, the study said, are far more
likely to use it instead of turning on the radio or television to
check weather, traffic reports, and news headlines, for example.
Many broadband homes also found they moved their computer from a
bedroom or study into the kitchen or family room because they found
it so much more useful.
</P>
<P>
   For all the predictions of how high-speed Internet access will
revolutionize Americans' usage of the Net, it bears noting that
Greater Boston is far ahead of the rest of the country in actually
having the service, and in many places having several choices.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a tenth of all cable modem subscribers in the country are
MediaOne RoadRunner customers in 156 Eastern Massachusetts and
southern New Hampshire cities and towns, where better than 9
percent of homes with access to the service have signed up.
Residents of towns served by cable franchises that have been slower
to move into Net access regularly clamor to know when they will get
broadband.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive heat has pushed Bell Atlantic to roll out
competing digital subscriber line service around Greater Boston,
although early problems keeping up with completing orders have led
it to delay by three to six months plans to make it available
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that explain why Eastern Massachusetts is a national
hotbed of broadband include the region's affluence and high
educational levels _ and also just basic geography.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and DSL are most economical to roll out in the
kinds of densely developed older neighborhoods that dominate
Greater Boston. Streets full of triple-deckers occupied by people
who work in high-tech or communications-intensive occupations are a
dream for companies weighing the huge investments that must be made
to roll out high-speed data.
</P>
<P>
   DSL reaches only customers within three miles of a central
office that has the proper equipment, which makes it more
accessible in densely developed New England communities where many
people live close to a downtown or village center. Likewise, cable
franchises can most economically upgrade to high-speed access in
communities with a high number of homes per mile of fiber-optic
cable to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Shelby of HarvardNet, the first company to begin rolling
out DSL service in New England in October 1996, said: ``The
physical layout of New England towns, set up in Colonial times,
allows service providers to offer better DSL coverage than in any
other region. Consumers in New England don't realize how fortunate
we are to have such widespread availability of high-speed Internet
access'' compared with the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   This region may have a permanent lead over more sprawling parts
of the country on getting cable and DSL broadband services. But
given the intense demand for broadband, it is likely only a matter
of years _ and in many areas months _ before AOL Time Warner and
other telecommunications giants push to get the rest of the United
States caught up.

 &HT;    Reeves says he'll be back next season
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Reeves on Thursday put to rest speculation about
his future with the Falcons. Reeves said he will return to the team
next season for his 20th season as an NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 4, the day after a season-ending 34-29 victory against
the 49ers that left his team 5-11, Reeves, 56, spoke of spending
more quality time with his wife, Pam, ``before we get too old.'' He
said then that his future depended on her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who has two years left on a contract that will pay him
about $2 million per season, discussed it with his wife this week
while vacationing in southwestern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be coming back,'' said Reeves, whose career record of
167-128-1 ranks eighth in wins. ``She's not ready to have me around
that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be determining which assistants will return.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Norv Turner called Reeves on Thursday morning,
and was given permission to interview Falcons secondary coach Ron
Meeks, 45, for a similar position with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Falcons put a ``supervisory'' designation on
defensive-line coach Bill Kollar, making it difficult for another
team to hire him away except for a head-coaching job. The Falcons
had to give Kollar, 47, a significant raise last year after the
Titans offered to make him defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation continues that quarterbacks coach Steve DeBerg will
be fired, but Reeves on Thursday denied Internet and radio reports
that he had fired offensive-line coach Art Shell, the former
Raiders head coach. Shell has been on the Falcons staff since
Reeves came to Atlanta in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has no merit whatsoever,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves denied last week that DeBerg would be fired, but DeBerg
was seen at a California coaching convention two weeks ago looking
for a job. DeBerg, 46, and Shell, 53, have been with the rest of
the Falcons' staff, except Reeves, in Mobile, Ala., this week for
the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants are supposed to sit down for evaluations with Reeves
between today and Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may do some things different offensively, but there's no
truth to (the speculation about Shell),'' Reeves said. ``A lot may
depend on what happens when we sit down and talk ... in the next
two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves spoke a second time with recently fired Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey, a protege since childhood in Americus, who was on
Reeves' staff in Denver, 1985-90.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is believed to be a candidate for several jobs, including
that of offensive coordinator for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they talked about Gailey joining the Falcons' staff,
Reeves said, ``No. I have talked to Chan, but just about the fact
he's coming in to see his grandmother. We didn't talk about
football.''

   As a child, Richard Williams would grow quiet, wiggling to the
edge of his seat when the newsreel came on at the movie house. Up
there on the screen were people gliding gracefully down snowy
slopes, leaving plumes of powder that glistened in the sun. Where,
he wondered, do you do that?
</P>
<P>
   He was 18 before he got the chance to find out, at Hunter
Mountain in the Catskills. His long coat flapping behind him and a
city hat perched atop his head, Williams spent as much time on his
butt as he did upright, but he knew. He laughed in joy, he reveled
in freedom, and he knew: This was his sport.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the 1950s, and when Williams got back to his New York
City neighborhood eager to share the excitement, his story was met
with derision. Lies, said one neighbor. Black people don't ski.
Poor people don't ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if I could ever take these guys and show them this
experience, I would love to do that,'' said Williams recently. ``I
wanted to take them, and I knew I would never be able to take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not quite true. Since founding Youth Enrichment
Services (YES) in 1968, Williams has helped 125,000 urban
youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds get onto the slopes,
acquainting the new YES kids with the challenges, responsibilities
and just plain fun of the rural outdoors. Summer programs include
canoeing, hiking, and camping, but skiing remains the
organization's focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to introduce kids to things they've never seen
before,'' said Williams in the YES offices in Boston. ``Kids have
to feel they can be part of that kind of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that 41 percent of Alpine skiers in 1998 had
household incomes of at least $75,000 and only 15.2 percent less
than $35,000, according to data provided by SnowSports Industries
America, it's little wonder that YES's target population (described
by Williams as the working poor, a family of four with an income of
$33,000-$35,000 a year) sees skiing as something out of their reach
financially as well as culturally.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of 200 volunteers and more than a dozen New
England resorts, the privately-funded YES gets yooths skiing or
snowboarding for $17-20 a day, which includes bus transportation,
use of equipment, a lift ticket (usually costing up to $50)
provided by the resort, a mandatory lesson, and even the loan of a
ski cap if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the program takes place in the basement ski shop
which, each year, trains about 50 kids to work in the shop, tuning
and sharpening the 1,500 pairs of skis the organization has amassed
through donations, often from resorts that have replaced their own
rental gear; maintaining the 500 pairs of cross-country skis and 55
snowboards; and fitting YES skiers for their weekend outings.
Volunteers must maintain at least a B average in school. Of the 50
positions, only five are paid, at $6 an hour for eight hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big prestige thing to get to the paid positions, but we
have a good farm team,'' said Mary Crowther, YES's vice president
and treasurer who began as a volunteer instructor in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 study by the Harvard Business School, more
than half of YES's participants continued skiing after they left
the program, and their participation lasted an average of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lots of fun, and maybe see a different side of
life,'' said Matt Sawyer, director of marketing at Butternut in
Great Barrington. If the youngsters stick with the sport and become
paying customers as adults, so much the better, but economics are
secondary, according to Sawyer. ``We all want everybody to have an
equal chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has always felt the same way. Back in the late
'50s, when Williams began skiing, there was overt racism. Once, he
and some friends returned to their car to find their tires
flattened. Another time, some whites in the lodge threatened to
stick his face in the toilet bowl. ``They didn't do it, but they
tried,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Williams's conviction that familiarity would breed
respect (``What we wanted to do was quietly bring these kids
together,'' he said), YES ski trips continued uninterrupted in the
mid-1970s, during Boston's busing crisis. Based in the neutral
South End, YES was perfectly situated to bring youngsters together
for a peaceful activity in a time of turmoil, according to
Williams. Potential troublemakers were warned to leave behind any
belligerent behavior: ``If you can't come here without doing that,
don't come here,'' he told them. The upshot: ``They wanted to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were any incidents, Williams could recall only
the bus driver who, upon arriving at a resort in Maine, called the
police to warn them that he had just dropped off a bunch of kids
and there was bound to be a riot. When the police arrived, the city
youths eagerly started following them around to see what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to see the action,'' Williams said, still getting
a good belly laugh.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the reaction tends more toward curiosity than
animosity, and sometimes there is concern that bringing
disadvantaged youth to the slopes does nothing but remind them of
an activity they could not otherwise afford.
</P>
<P>
   Crowther bristles. ``Skiing is affordable,'' she said. ``It's
not the elitist, expensive sport anymore. You have to break down
those stereotypes.'' It's like the difference, she said, between
``a rich person's car or a get-around town car.'' You can stay for
a week at a fancy resort and use all the latest gear, or you can
take day trips and pack a lunch. Either way, you're mastering a
difficult skill that nurtures confidence and pride. ``If I can do
this,'' Williams said the kids begin to feel, ``(they) can do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Taran Grigsby, a 28-year-old attorney with Goulston and Storrs
in Boston, wholeheartedly agrees. Grigsby hooked up with the
program as a young South End teenager and has been involved ever
since. ``The program was very, very good for me,'' said Grigsby, a
Bowdoin graduate who is now on the YES board of trustees. ``It
helped me decide that I was going to go and do something a little
different: (People assume) black kids don't go to college in Maine.
It's a vehicle to teach people they can succeed in other
environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fitzpatrick agrees, too. As a South Boston teenager with
eight older siblings whose father died when he was just 4 years
old, Fitzgerald would, he said, probably have been down at Fields
Corner on weekends drinking with the neighborhood kids had it not
been for YES.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a program that definitely brought blacks and whites
together, although I don't think I realized it at the time,'' he
said. ``(Williams) gave us responsibilities and trusted us as young
kids. He made a big difference in my life.''

LEDYARD STEBBINS, 94, DIES; APPLIED EVOLUTION TO PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. G. Ledyard Stebbins Jr., one of the leading evolutionary
biologists and foremost botanists of the 20th century, died on
Wednesday at his home in Davis, Calif. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Stebbins was one of the architects of the intellectual watershed
known as the evolutionary synthesis, the period during which
knowledge from the study of fossils, genetics, cells and the
evolutionary history of organisms was incorporated into the
theories of Charles Darwin, creating what is now evolutionary
biology.
</P>
<P>
   The synthesis has been described by Dr. Stephen Jay Gould,
evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, as ``one of the
half-dozen major scientific achievements in our century.''
</P>
<P>
   In his role in this seminal event, Stebbins is credited with
bringing modern evolutionary thinking to the study of plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolutionary botany is G. Led-yard Stebbins,'' said Dr.
Vassiliki Betty Smocovitis, a historian of science at the
University of Florida. ``He is the discipline. He founded it on his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Stebbins, professor emeritus at the University of California at
Davis, earned his right to such praise with the publication in 1950
of ``Variation and Evolution in Plants.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book he displayed an encyclopedic knowledge of botanical
studies from fossils to chromosomes as he provided a detailed
argument that plants were subject to the same processes of
evolution as animals, an idea that biologists today take as a
given.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, Stebbins gave botanists a framework within which to
view the evolution of plants, the newly emerging theory of
neo-Darwinism, in which new findings in genetics and other fields
were merged with Darwin's theories. It remains the dominant theory.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a fruit fly geneticist and
contemporary of Stebbins who is also recognized as a major figure
in the evolutionary synthesis, wrote to Stebbins at the time of the
book's publication, saying: ``It will mark a turning point in
evolutionary thought and of course in botany as well. Of course,
this is not to say that I agree with all you say there, but science
progresses because contradictions are resolved by more work and
more thinking!''
</P>
<P>
   It was through such interchanges and the publication of a series
of books from 1920 to 1950 that the field of evolutionary biology
began to take shape. It was a time of ``mutual education,'' as Dr.
Ernst Mayr called it. Mayr, an evolutionary biologist, along with
Dr. George Gaylord Simpson was a prominent figure in the synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory geneticists, interested in mutations and population
genetics, joined with field biologists, interested in the
relationships and origins of different species, to make sense of
their respective work. New findings were brought together under the
conceptual umbrella of Darwin's theories of natural selection, and
other theories were tossed aside.
</P>
<P>
   Stebbins was said to have a particularly detailed knowledge of
the flora of California. Dr. Francisco Ayala, an evolutionary
biologist at the University of California at Irvine, said Stebbins
seemed to know every plant in the world, not just scientifically,
but personally.
</P>
<P>
   George Ledyard Stebbins Jr. was born on Jan. 6, 1906, in
Lawrence, N.Y., to a wealthy family. He had the benefit of
naturalist parents who enjoyed frequent hikes in the country. His
mother, Edith, taught her three children the names and songs of
common birds, and his father taught the children about plants and
coastal creatures in tidal pools near their summer home near Seal
Harbor, Maine. Laterm Stebbins carried out his first published
research near there.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Harvard University in 1924 intending to become a
lawyer. But he came under the sway of a charismatic Harvard
professor, Dr. Merritt Lyndon Fernald, one of the century's leading
botanists and editor of the botanical bible, ``Gray's Manual of
Botany.'' Stebbins entered Harvard graduate school to study botany
in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the field of botany was undergoing changes. Once
confined to studying dusty herbarium specimens, botanists
interested in plant species and their relationships were
discovering the modern techniques available for studying
chromosomes and genetics. Stebbins, drawn to these innovations,
barely finished graduate school, nearly becoming caught in the
political and intellectual cross-fire within the botany department
between those intent on keeping genetics out and those intent on
bringing it in.
</P>
<P>
   Smocovitis suggested that it was Stebbins' ability to navigate
such intellectual rifts that may have allowed him to play his role
in the evolutionary synthesis so successfully, bringing plants,
otherwise forgotten, into the body of modern thinking on
evolutionary biology.
</P>
<P>
   After graduate school, Stebbins became a professor at Colgate
University. He later took a position at the University of
California at Berkeley and eventually the University of California
at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   After he moved to California, Stebbins met Dobzhansky, then at
the California Institute of Technology. Both biologists had an
interest in the blossoming field of cytology, the study of
chromosomes and their use in the study of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two often rode horseback on field expeditions, engaged in
intense discussions of evolution, intermittently stopping to
collect specimens. Stebbins called the plants that he collected on
these trips his ``horseback hybrids.''
</P>
<P>
   Stebbins also played an important role in the emerging Society
for the Study of Evolution, of which he became the third president
in 1948. He used the position to speak out for the botanical side
of evolutionary studies, an field dominated by zoologists. In 1949,
he wrote to Mayr, expressing his concerns about the field's
dominant journal, Evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us on the plant side,'' he wrote, ``are beginning to
feel that `Evolution' is favoring animals too much, and our
interest in the journal and society is starting to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also an early conservationist. In 1967 while president of
the California Native Plant Society, he was influential in efforts
to conserve native plants and habitats. He organized weekly field
trips that got people into the habit of the conservationist's credo
of ``taking nothing but pictures, leaving nothing but footprints.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 he prevented the destruction of a raised beach on the
Monterey Peninsula that he dubbed Evolution Hill, now called the
S.F.B. Morse Botanical Area where Stebbins said all the problems
and principles of evolution could be seen played out among the
plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Stebbins received numerous awards, including the National Medal
of Science, the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society of London, the
Verrill Medal and the Lewis Prize. In his honor, the University of
California at Davis renamed Cold Canyon Reserve, 277 acres near
Lake Berryessa, Calif., Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He served as president of the American Society of Naturalists,
the Western Society of Naturalists, the Botanical Society of
America and the California Botanical Society and as secretary
general of the Union of Biological Sciences. He was also a member
of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote six other books, including the influential ``Flowering
Plants: Evolution Above the Species Level,'' and a popular work,
``Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity,'' and some 250 journal
articles.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Edy Paxman of Kalispell, Mont., a
son, Robert, of Corvallis, Ore., and a stepson, Marc Monaghan, of
Chicago. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Syrian-Israeli talks in abeyance, the
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Authority, Yasser Arafat, had
the full attention of President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Thursday, capped by a cozy lunch with
Albright at her Georgetown house.
</P>
<P>
   Until the negotiations were suddenly put on hold Monday, the
administration was trying to juggle the awkwardness of playing host
to both the Syrians and the Palestinians, who have brittle
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But with neither the Syrians nor the Israelis here, Clinton and
Albright took the opportunity to focus on Arafat and try to
persuade him that now was the time for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   If an Israeli-Palestinian framework agreement scheduled for
mid-February is to be completed, Arafat was told, there needs to be
give-and-take, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The February agreement is intended to provide the broad outlines
of a final peace agreement, set for September, between Israel and
Palestine. That agreement would deal with the most contentious
issues, including borders between Israel and a Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   In comments in the Oval Office before the two leaders met in
private, Clinton said: ``As in any process like this, there must be
inevitable and difficult compromises. No one can get everything
that either side wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not specify the mid-February deadline but said he
believed that Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak,
would ``reach a comprehensive peace in a reasonably short period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who has fretted that the Syrian talks were overshadowing
his own efforts with the Israelis, was reassured by Clinton that
this was not the case, the administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Oval Office remarks, Clinton went out of his way to note
that agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was ``at
the core'' of a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's major foreign policy goals before leaving
office is to preside over a Middle East peace deal that encompasses
Israel, the Palestinians and the Syrians. But balancing separate
talks between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and
Syria is a complicated diplomatic exercise, administration
officials acknowledged this week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration planned to assess from Thursday's sessions
whether a three-way summit with Clinton, Arafat and Barak would be
useful in bringing about a mid-February agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a lot of discussion on substantive issues,'' an
administration official said. The lunch at Albright's home was
attended by the Administration's chief Middle East envoy, Dennis
Ross, the new assistant secretary for Near East Affairs, Edward
Walker, and by Arafat's colleague, Abu Mazen.

TRANSMETA'S `SMART CHIP,' STARRING LINUS TORVALDS, DEBUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA, Calif. _ The chips are finally down.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most eagerly anticipated announcements in Silicon
Valley, Transmeta Corp., a secretive, much-watched start-up that
employs Linus Torvalds, creator of the fast-rising Linux operating
system, Wednesday revealed what it had been working on for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The company took the wraps off a family of ``smart chips,'' or
microprocessors, that Transmeta executives say will transform the
world of mobile computing. ``This thing is ready for prime time,''
said James N. Chapman, Tramsmeta's senior vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Called Crusoe, Transmeta's chips are targeted at the
fast-growing market for ultra-light, portable computers and
wireless Web devices. The chips are designed to address one of the
biggest complaints from laptop users _ short battery life. Because
the chips consume less power than conventional microprocessors, a
computer with a Crusoe chip can theoretically run all day on one
battery, according to Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to shape the design of microprocessors for years
to come,'' said Linley Gwennap, a microprocessor analyst in
Mountain View. ``This is a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   The chips, which are being manufactured by IBM Corp., are novel
because they incorporate software to handle functions that are
usually done by transistors.
</P>
<P>
   While Transmeta has been around since 1995, secrecy has shrouded
the company's activities. The tinted glass on the company's
headquarters in Santa Clara, contributed to the mystique, as did
the company's decision three years ago to hire Torvalds, something
of a folk hero among software programmers who developed Linux, the
operating system that is starting to challenge Microsoft's dominant
Windows system. Transmeta received backing from Microsoft Corp.
cofounder Paul Allen and financier George Soros, adding further to
its mystique.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Torvalds, who helped develop the software for
Crusoe, dropped a clue about Transmeta's mission. The product was a
``smart chip,'' he told thousands who attended the annual Comdex
computer show in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the microprocessor smart, Transmeta's founder and
chief executive David Ditzel said Wednesday, is the software that
runs the chip. Called LongRun, the software allows the chips to
constantly adjust their voltage according to the demands of the
applications running on the computer at any given time. As a
result, machines running Crusoe chips burn up far fewer watts than
conventional microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The Crusoe software also takes over some of the functions of a
chip, taking a load off the chip itself and allowing it to run much
faster, said Ditzel, a former chip designer for Sun Microsystems
Inc. and AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts were impressed by the company's technology, they
noted a number of hurdles Transmeta must overcome before it can
begin to whittle away Intel's dominance in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some question, for example, whether equipment makers will pick
up Crusoe processors for their computers. So far, Transmeta has no
contracts to sell its chips, which are being manufactured in
Burlington, Vt. by IBM and will sell for $65 to $329 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel said major computer manufacturers are evaluating the chip
now and are expected to start shipping products containing Crusoe
chips by mid-year. ``We're prepared to take on the industry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, project how much of the $4 billion to $5
billion mobile personal computer chip market Transmeta is expected
to capture. About 22.2 million mobile computers are expected to be
sold this year, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Transmeta's sales, they are not likely to immediately
affect industry leader Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good the product is, it's not something 50
million people will be able to buy next year,'' said Gwennap, the
microprocessor analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Intel should be paying attention,'' Gwennap
said. ``This definitely changes the rules.''

CONSUMERS BEGIN TO FEEL IMPACT OF OPEC'S CUTS IN OIL OUTPUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   When you pay home heating oil bills this winter, pump gasoline
into the family car or buy airline tickets to a sunny climate, you
will see just how much OPEC's game of chicken is costing consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With OPEC vowing to continue restraints on production, oil
prices have begun surging again in the last two weeks. The price of
crude oil is now $29.20 a barrel and headed to $30 or more, say
many commodity analysts. Gasoline prices are at 77.33 cents a
gallon in the futures market and heading to over $1.30 at the pump.
And the near-term home heating oil futures contract is up to 86.46
cents a gallon, after climbing 8.6 percent Thursday. All these
prices, except gasoline at the pump, are the highest since the
run-up to the Persian Gulf war in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The price jumps are now spilling over into financial markets.
Concerns about oil's impact on inflation have sent bond prices
lower and yields higher. Airline stocks have dropped sharply as
fuel costs have risen. Major airlines are now adding fuel
surcharges of $10 each to their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The arctic air in the Midwest and Northeast is responsible for
some of the increases. But the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is really calling the shots. Production cuts by the
oil-producing nations last March caused crude oil prices to double
in 1999. Then last week, OPEC officials said there was a consensus
to extend current production cuts _ amounting to 4.3 million
barrels a day below their levels a year earlier _ beyond the March
expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is, if the price of oil tops $30 a barrel, will
OPEC keep squeezing? Or is it just talking tough?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take any announcement as final,'' said Irene King,
senior oil market analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, referring to
last week's comments about extended production cuts. ``But it is
scary.'' Two weeks ago, she said there was a 70 percent to 80
percent chance that OPEC officials would decide to increase crude
oil production to ease price pressures when they meet at the end of
March. Now she says the odds are 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   If OPEC does not relent, the relatively low levels of oil
inventories and strong demand mean that prices will move higher.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Energy Information Administration and the
American Petroleum Institute, total U.S. inventories of crude oil
are now at their lowest level since the end of 1996. At the same
time, demand in December was 19.8 million barrels a day, the
highest for the month since 1978. The International Energy Agency
forecast Thursday that worldwide demand will rise 2.4 percent this
year, the biggest gain since 1997, as global economic growth
continues to pick up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of OPEC production cuts last year, crude oil
inventories, excluding the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
fell in the week ended Jan. 14 to 293.3 million barrels, from 324
million barrels a year earlier, according to the EIA. The API
figures are about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline supplies are tight, having dropped below 200 million
barrels to 198.3 million barrels, from 222.6 million barrels a year
ago. Distillate stocks, which include home heating oil, are also
low, having fallen to 118.8 million barrels from 152.6 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King is most worried about the low gasoline stocks as
refineries head into a period when they normally shut down for four
to six weeks for maintenance and upgrades. She said that if
inventories remained at these low levels in the spring, ``then we
are in trouble.'' That's because demand for gasoline picks up
drastically during the peak summer travel season.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble could mean gasoline lines, she said. But, ``that is the
extreme case,'' she noted. ``I don't think we are going to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's comments from OPEC, many analysts do not
expect OPEC officials to risk pushing the price of oil too far
above $30 a barrel. If the price goes higher, leaders of the United
States, Europe and Asia may well begin to fret about the possible
impact on their economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the increase in oil prices, and I'm going
to be discussing this with my counterpart ministers from Saudi
Arabia, Norway, Mexico and Venezuela very soon,'' the secretary of
energy, Bill Richardson, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So what OPEC probably wants to do is orchestrate a soft-landing
for the price of oil. That means the group needs to talk tough for
a while longer. Holding out would reduce inventories further as oil
is bought in anticipation of higher prices. With lower inventories,
the downdraft in oil prices would be much weaker if OPEC increases
production. Last week, some OPEC officials said worldwide
inventories of crude oil were not yet low enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want people to anticipate production increases,''
said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch.
``They don't want a production increase to lead to a crash in the
oil price.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Leuffer, senior energy analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.,
said crude inventories were so low now that OPEC would have to
increase production to prevent prices from skyrocketing and the
threat of gasoline lines. ``We're within two days of what the
industry considers a minimal operational level,'' which is crude
oil inventories equal to 12 to 13 days of demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inventories decline from this level, OPEC won't be able to
do what they say they will do,'' Leuffer argued. ``This is simply
an effort to talk up the price. The last thing they want to do is
alienate consumers and force governments to dip into strategic
petroleum reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect Saudi Arabia to take the lead in pushing
for a March agreement that will ease price pressures. Because there
is no agreement yet on how long to extend the production cuts,
there is room to maneuver. For now at least, Saudi Arabia is
talking tough. But some see political motivations for it to do so.
Any switch to supporting lower oil prices now could undermine the
chances of victory for the moderates in the Iranian elections in
February, these analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in the United States, meanwhile, are beginning to
squawk about the higher prices. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., wants
the government to dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help
push prices lower. ``They have been saying that OPEC would relent
for months,'' Schumer said. ``The best way to jawbone them is to
say that we are going to sell some oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   This all means that crude oil, gasoline and home heating oil
prices are going to be higher than anyone expected just two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises a bigger question: When will the American
consumer get mad? Probably pretty soon. Gasoline pump prices have
risen much more slowly than crude oil or the cost of gasoline
before taxes are added in.
</P>
<P>
   But at $1.27 an unleaded gallon Thursday, the average
countrywide price is just a penny away from its 1996 high.

SOUTH AFRICAN GHETTO FOSTERS A MODEL FOR SCHOOL REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE FARM, South Africa _ Orange Farm is what South Africans
call an ``informal settlement,'' an unincorporated jumble of
rickety dwellings and metalwork yards spilling outward from a
grassy hill. One of the poorest black ghettos around Johannesburg,
it also has a reputation for being one of the most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But as a new school year opens, Orange Farm is becoming known
for something else: a high school of improbably high standards. At
a time when less than 50 percent of final-year students pass the
test required to graduate, the Leshata Secondary School stands as a
model for educators struggling to reform an education system
stumped by acute textbook shortages and gross racial imbalances.
Surrounded by cows and tin shacks, Leshata was one of the only
township schools to have passed every graduating student last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have long stories to tell you,'' said Moeketsi
Molelekoa, Leshata's principal, explaining the school's success.
``Nothing will ever substitute hard work. Teachers must teach,
learners must learn. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Molelekoa's simplicity masks the enormity of the challenge that
he and other educators face. Five years after the demise of
apartheid, South Africa's schools still bear the deep scars of
institutionalized racism. For decades, the former white minority
regimes used a cynical system they described as ``Bantu education''
to train blacks into more efficient servants, but to deprive them
of the intellectual tools needed to thrive in a modern, complex
world. Until 1995, 70 percent of South Africans were denied the
right to basic education.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new constitution, education is now compulsory and
universal, and it claims 22 percent of the national budget. But the
imbalances endure. While most white students have well-equipped
schools and demanding teachers, the majority of students are
fortunate to have pads on which to write. According to the
Department of Education, 60 percent of math and science teachers in
black schools are unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   As schools opened last week, many children faced appalling
conditions. In Soweto, the sprawling township just south of
Johannesburg, some students spent the day cleaning classrooms
rather than receiving instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, teachers did not show. Principals complained
that new supplies of textbooks promised by the government had not
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   In many rural places, students learn in decrepit buildings
without electricity _ or under trees. Racial tensions persist,
making classrooms and playgrounds violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is where apartheid was victorious,'' Education
Minister Kader Asmal said at a recent breakfast with reporters.
``White schools are one step behind Spain. Black schools are one
step behind the Republic of Congo. We face an extraordinary
imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   The past is not entirely to blame for the present state of most
South African schools. The national pass rate for the matric, the
exam that students must pass to advance to college, declined
steadily during former President Nelson Mandela's term of office,
the first five years of democracy in South Africa. Last year,
classes were disrupted by a protracted strike as teachers demanded
better pay.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the new school year, acting on no more than two
day's notice, President Thabo Mbeki rounded up educators last
weekend in the Northern Province, where only 37 percent of students
passed the matric. Mbeki demanded a new level of performance. ``If
you look at Africa, it does not matter what field you look at,
whether in economics or technology, we are the last in the queue.
This must stop. . . . Principals who are found not to be doing
their jobs will be fired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Asmal unveiled a five-year national strategy to
improve education standards, including strict policies on HIV/AIDS
in the classroom; the conduct and professionalism of educators;
targets for adult literacy; and improvements for black tertiary
institutions, most of which face extreme shortages of resources and
qualified professors.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene replayed across impoverished townships throughout the
country, Joseph Kobeni stood amid a crowd of desperate parents
outside the yellow-brick walls of Leshata Secondary School who had
been hoping to enroll their children late for classes beginning the
following day. Many fanned away the summer heat with copies of
their child's transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Molelekoa sat frustrated in his office. ``We were
supposed to have our first staff meeting today,'' he said. ``These
people should have registered in November, but poor people are
always so disorganized. Apartheid destroyed the mentality of our
people. They don't make the education of their children a priority.
If you are not strong, you will collapse in this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Physically, Leshata is something of a surprise. Built five years
ago by a private trust, 20 classrooms form a smart, sturdy
quadrangle that contrasts sharply with the township's dilapidated
conditions. But that is where the luxuries end. The school has no
library, and laboratory equipment is scarce. Textbooks are
tattered, and are too few for all 900 students. There are no maps
to assist with geography lessons, no computers to keep
administration records. A high fence surrounds the school, but
theft and vandalism are constant problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Molelekoa allows no excuses. The poor matric results
announced last month, marking an all-time low national pass-rate
average of 47 percent, has prompted widespread calls for a
reintroduction of corporal punishment in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Molelekoa has a different sense of discipline. The challenge, he
said, is to inculcate a new ethos within and beyond the school's
walls to replace the apathy ingrained by decades of apartheid.
Teachers are expected to show up early, stay late, and dress like
professionals. Students receive no sympathy for work undone or done
poorly. If parents are called in for conferences and fail to show,
their children will be punished with after-school chores such as
cleaning bathrooms or pulling weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, in black schools, parents did not cooperate.
Schools were very hostile environments under apartheid,'' Molelekoa
said. ``We still have a serious problem with getting parents
involved in the education of their students. I have to force them.
Whether you are rich or poor, you are not excused from your
responsibility to your child.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, modest man, Molelekoa, 38, is no stranger to the
disadvantages his students face. During his childhood, his family
was forcibly removed from their home by the apartheid police.
Later, the liberation movement recruited him into protests against
the bantu education system. Yet he still thrived. His illiterate
mother would force him to stay up late doing his homework. From
early adolescence onward, he worked to pay his way through three
college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions that my students are in now, I went through
myself,'' he said. ``I was saved by education. Good results are not
manna from heaven. I don't negotiate the rules with my students,
but I stay with them.''

IN HOUSES AND CHURCH HALLS, IOWA WILL CHOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLFAX, Iowa _ On Monday, just after the workday ends, about a
dozen people will trickle into the basement of the faded white
First United Methodist Church here to have an argument.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum folding chairs will be set out. Maybe a pot of coffee.
And for the next hour or so, a handful of people of this tiny,
rugged town will talk to _ and maybe yell at _ one another. Then
someone will make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the country will know who the winners of the Iowa
caucuses are.
</P>
<P>
   It is a political ritual that, to the rest of the world, matters
only for its results. The Iowa caucuses are, after all, the first
contest in the presidential election _ a weird sort of near-primary
that is discussed as if voters actually cast ballots at a booth.
</P>
<P>
   To Al Flyr, a local Democratic official, the caucuses are about
the process. It's like a school board meeting, he says. Or a block
party. Or a kickball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see this many for Al Gore in that part of the room,
this many for Bill Bradley on that side of the room,'' said Flyr,
pointing to the corners of the basement room in which the caucus
for Colfax, about 25 miles east of Des Moines,will take place.
``Then you'll try to talk about it, try to convince people from the
other side to come to yours. It's really not like voting at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it what it used to be. Despite the mythic status of the
Iowa caucuses, attendance is low these days. Almost no one _ just
25,000 out of 562,581 potential participants _ turned up for the
1996 Democratic caucuses, in which when President Clinton ran
unopposed. Election officials think this year might be better, but
not by much.
</P>
<P>
   That means it is up to the political enthusiasts to dominate the
night, to prepare the caucus sites and phone in their results.
</P>
<P>
   And getting ready they are.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Flyr, Al Flyr's wife and the minister at the Methodist
church in Colfax, is planning to give a sermon this Sunday on the
importance of getting out on caucus night.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Kellogg, the fire chief, Mike Patterson, is figuring
out how to move the trucks out of the station for the night to make
room for the dozen or so people expected to turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of churches and schools, civic centers and coffee shops
are setting out chairs and posting signs. Precinct officials are
trying to find transportation for the elderly. Party leaders are
scrutinizing the weather reports. If it snows, the rural two-lane
roads leading to many sites could be blocked for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is not a pessimistic part of the world. Particularly
not around election time.
</P>
<P>
   Take Republicans Johnny and Janice Coder, who live in Ames,
Iowa, just north of the capital of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   The Coders don't much go in for the caucus system, although
they'll be hosting a Republican vote on Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ingrained in Iowa tradition. But so few people
participate,'' said Johnny Coder, 63. ``We're expecting 50 or 60
people. This counts out a lot of people whose jobs don't allow them
to get out, and who would sooner go to a voting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Coders, the caucus system doesn't reflect the will of
voters of Iowa, just that of ``the eager beavers'' like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love having political parties,'' said Johnny Coder, a corn
and soybean farmer who was born in America and still speaks English
with traces of his immigrant parents' Czech accents, and calls his
wife ``mom.'' ``We love America and its future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coders have five children and 14 grandchildren, whose
photographs fill the walls of their rambling house.
</P>
<P>
   In among the snapshots of grinning children, there are grinning
candidates: Governor George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, who both sent
the Coders signed Christmas cards, proudly displayed on the
fireplace beside their Bush and Forbes baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have come courting because voters like the Coders
carry a lot of weight in Iowa's 2,000-plus caucus precincts: only
96,451 of the state's 582,000 registered Republicans voted in the
1996 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the process will work at the Coders' on Monday night.
Dozens of voters will descend on their big brown farmhouse at about
7 p.m. They'll all sign in, then when everybody has arrived,
supporters will have a couple of minutes to sway voters toward
their favorite candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Democratic caucus in Colfax, voters at the Coders'
house will cast ballots privately. Still, proceedings can get
heated, the Coders said. But all of them vote with their hearts,
even if that means disagreeing with gracious hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's individualist,'' Johnny Coder says. ``We honor their
dissension. That's what makes us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colfax, Jill Flyr took an old, framed newspaper off the wall
of the Sunday school room last week.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, when Calvin Coolidge was re-elected to the White House,
every eligible voter in the church congregation showed up at the
polls _ a feat so remarkable that it made the front page of the New
York Christian Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, people voted _ in booths. The caucus system did not
take effect until the late 1960s, when Iowa officials were
searching for a way to engage voters turned off by the political
disenchantment of the age. Now, disenchantment seems to have taken
hold again. But the Flyrs hope that, like the young faces that
stream into their church every Sunday, the political process might
appeal to a younger crowd, if it's pitched the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to talk about it next Sunday, how important it is
to get involved in the political process. Maybe I'll even talk
about the newspaper article,'' Flyr said. ``If we don't go out and
vote, big money is going to take over. I feel this as an American,
and I feel this as a Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   The basement of the 86-year-old church building is sparse, but
that should have little bearing on the Democrats who gather Monday
night. They will arrive around 7 p.m., most of them elderly, most
traveling by car. And there won't be many strangers in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,300 residents of Colfax are a cohesive bunch _ many, if
not most have known one another for decades. Many are descendants
of the settlers who established the town in 1866, or the coal
miners who began moving here in 1882. They vote largely Democratic,
but most say they are Independent _ in spirit if not in the
registry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the airwaves or the polls, the caucus is ``not dominated
by any one candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really open process,'' he said. ``People are encouraged
to speak their minds.''

 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finding raw material for his comic novels ``is like shooting
fish in a barrel down there,'' says Florida native and best-selling
author Carl Hiaasen, lunching at the Charles Hotel while on a
recent publicity swing through the untropical Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities like Boston have their own colorful histories with
graft. But Miami is different,'' Hiaasen spearing a wad of mashed
potato with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   A muckraking columnist for The Miami Herald by day, Hiaasen
mines familiar territory in his latest novel, ``Sick Puppy''
(Knopf), a multilayered saga of passion and revenge that blends a
powerful anti-South-Florida-development message with scenes of
dognapping, wife stealing, kinky sex, fetishism, torture, murder,
possum eating, and plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did we mention the hooker who only services Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   ``In Miami, they're just so clumsy and inept about it that it's
fun to write about,'' Hiaasen continues, chewing on _ to continue
the fish motif for a moment _ a piece of broiled scrod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most politicians who take money realize there's some shame
attached to the moment. In Florida, these guys get caught on FBI
surveillance tape and they're giggling like little children. Money
is flying everywhere down there. (itals)Everywhere.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   And then, says Hiaasen, tossing back a shot of iced tea, there's
the case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban refugee whose
custodial fate has turned into an agitprop opera bouffe worthy of
Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn on CNN and (anti-Castro) protesters are tying up
rush-hour traffic so people can't get to their doctors or home to
their kids,'' snorts Hiaasen. ``They take this boy to Disney World,
give him Pokemon cards, put him in a parade _ it's disgraceful.
It's child abuse. They don't give a rat's ass about this kid. This
circus has lasted for 40 years and eight presidents, and Fidel is
still there, looking taller in the saddle than ever. He's the
happiest little communist there is right now. The last, and the
happiest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen waves his fork with a flourish. While he could likely
afford to give up column writing, he confesses, he would miss the
target practice. The real-life shady pols and deal-makers, the scam
artists and theme-park evangelists who practically cruise around
the state wearing bull's-eyes on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same energy that gets me riled up enough to do a column
about crooked developers goes into the novels,'' Hiaasen opines.
``My outlook is, if you don't stay angry, nothing gets fixed. Not
anger in the sense of venom but in the sense of outrage. You have
to write about these things. Talk about them, put a spotlight on
them. Or they won't get fixed. Even if you don't have all the
answers, you can't turn away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen smiles and puts down his fork. No longer a cult figure
or boy wonder at age 46, Hiaasen, a third-generation Floridian who
grew up near Fort Lauderdale, still cuts a boyish figure when he
ventures out to meet the book-buying public. Otherwise he holes up
in the Florida Keys _ he rarely sets foot in the newspaper offices
_ in a waterfront home he shares with his second wife, his
8-year-old stepson, and a new baby due any day now.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are left wondering, meanwhile, if Hiaasen the novelist
is a clever genre writer, satiric genius, one-trick pony, or an
unlikely but entertaining combination of John D. MacDonald, Edward
Abbey, and Nathaniel West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sick Puppy'' has garnered the usual (for Hiaasen) bag of
mixed-to-rave reviews. Writing in The New York Times, Joe Queenan
likened Hiaasen to Donald Westlake and Eugene Ionesco _ an unlikely
combination right there. Queenan also praised Hiaasen for making
``a persuasive case that the most barbarous, ignorant and just
plain awful people living in this country today reside, nay
flourish, in the state of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Mystery writer Tony Hillerman once called Hiaasen ``the Mark
Twain of the crime novel.'' Salman Rushdie is said to be a fan.
Others have described Hiaasen as ``Elmore Leonard meets Terry
Southern'' or ``Elmore Leonard after several hits of nitrous
oxide,'' which may amount to the same thing. If one critique dogs
the author, it's that he writes essentially the same book over and
over again, upping the absurdity quotient each time out as he
skewers the Sunshine State and all its grotesqueries.
</P>
<P>
   While his characters remain dependably fresh _ the only
recurrent cast member is a fugitive ex-governor named Clinton
(Skink) Tyree, who returns for a fourth time in ``Sick Puppy'' _
the Hiaasen formula varies little from novel to novel. Each book
typically includes one hideously twisted villain (in ``Sick
Puppy,'' a sadistic hit man who collects 911 tapes for personal
amusement), one resourceful but flawed do-gooder, one or more
corrupt state officials, one sexy ingenue, a murderous animal or
two, a threat to Mother Nature, and a small pile of corpses.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, at least Hiaasen comes by his formula naturally. The
son and grandson of Fort Lauderdale lawyers, he grew up in a South
Florida relatively unblemished by retirement communities and theme
parks. His love for adventure novels and the outdoors clearly
shaped his thematic concerns. After graduating with a journalism
degree from the University of Florida, he joined the Miami Herald
staff in 1976. As an investigative reporter, Hiaasen went after the
same unscrupulous developers and narco-traders that have become
fodder for his over-the-top fiction. He's got street cred few
novelists can claim.
</P>
<P>
   While in college Hiaasen demonstrated an aptitude for other
kinds of writing as well, collaborating on one book that became the
movie ``Doc Hollywood'' and three more thrillers he wrote with a
Herald colleague. ``Tourist Season,'' Hiaasen's first solo effort,
was published in 1986. In this acclaimed debut, Hiaasen served up a
band of ecoterrorists that feed tourists to the alligators and
kidnap the Orange Bowl Queen. As in subsequent Hiaasen novels, it's
hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys _ and more fun not to
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start out with a premise,'' Hiaasen explains. ``Like in
`Lucky You' '' _ his seventh novel _ ``a woman wins the state
lottery. In Florida, if you don't have your ticket, forget it. If
the ticket is stolen, how could you prove it? So I threw a bunch of
characters on stage to see what would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens is a lot of mayhem, gunfire, and satiric commentary
on the white supremacy movement. ``Sick Puppy'' has similar
origins, according to Hiaasen. Years ago, he says, he saw someone
idly tossing trash out of an SUV. Imagining what would happen if
the litterbug were a true sleazebag _ and the eyewitness a
crusading environmentalist _ Hiaasen cooked up his latest plot,
about a slimy lobbyist being stalked by an anger-challenged
eco-warrior. Much merriment ensues, some involving a lecherous
developer with a weird thing for Barbie dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my books are character driven,'' Hiaasen says. ``I'm
always amused to see them described as mysteries, because the only
mystery is how the hell I got from point A to point B.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``disguised as thrillers,'' he continues, ``you pretty
much know who did what. I don't have the attention span to do a
real detective guy. I'm not Bob Parker, although I wish I were. I
wish I could stick with a character like Spenser. But the
characters who fade off into the mangroves at the end of my books,
well, I think they're better left out there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hiaasen does not seem deeply troubled by his detractors
perhaps it is because, as with James Bond movies, his novels seem
critically bullet-proof. His biggest flop was probably the film
version of ``Strip Tease,'' a 1993 Hiaasen novel about a stripper,
a child custody case, a sex-crazed congressman, and the corrosive
influence of Big Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds shared co-billing in a movie that
posed the question of which was more mind-boggling, Moore
championing motherhood by baring her surgically-enhanced breasts,
or Reynolds wearing a hairpiece that appeared to be on loan from
the Animal Rescue League?
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen had nothing to do with the movie other than cashing a
few studio checks. His other novels are all under option, but like
Elmore Leonard's books (with the notable exception of ``Get
Shorty'') they seem resistant to sucessful screen adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's OK,'' says Hiaasen. ``The whole Hollywood scene is
cool for about five minutes, and only five minutes. You're sitting
in a restaurant and Paul Newman walks in with his agent. After
that, it's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are folks in Florida who may be grateful
Hiaasen is not attracting an even wider audience. The Walt Disney
Co. would be one one, about which Hiaasen penned a book-length
essay titled ``Team Rodent.'' If that title doesn't say it all,
Hiaasen's introduction does. ``The absolute worst thing Disney did
is to change how people in Florida thought about money,'' he
writes. ``Merely by showing up, Disney had dignified blind greed in
a state pioneered by undignified greedheads. The gates opened, and
in galloped fresh hordes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Chamber of Commerce would be another. Hiaasen once
appeared live on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' and boasted that
Miami led the nation in corpses found in automobile trunks. Nothing
was wrong with the state, he told host Charles Gibson, that ``a
good force-5 hurricane couldn't fix.''
</P>
<P>
   A third would be Governor Jeb Bush, younger brother of
Republican presidential hopeful George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not his favorite writer,'' admits Hiaasen, polishing off a
slice of apple tart. ``He's a smart guy. He's made some good
appointments and some horrendous ones. He understands the
Everglades means votes. But at the very bottom of his soul, he's
still just a real estate developer from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiaasen gets up, preparing to leave for a book signing. One more
thing, he says. He always wanted to write a novel whose hero is a
Labrador retriever. In that regard, ``Sick Puppy'' fulfills a
lifelong dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labs wake up and think it's the greatest day of their lives,''
he says with a wink. ``They're my idols. I should know. I've got
visitation rights to two of 'em.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., came to the Security
Council Thursday offering a ``hand of friendship,'' but delivered
the sort of clenched-fist message that has made him the symbol of
right-wing hostility to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, the most powerful conservative voice in foreign policy as
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argued that
Congress had the right to dictate conditions for the payment of
American debts to the organization. He warned the United Nations to
keep its ``utopian'' visions away from American sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United Nations respects the sovereign rights of the
American people, and serves them as an effective tool of diplomacy,
it will earn and deserve their respect and support,'' he said in a
speech to council members. ``But a United Nations that seeks to
impose its presumed authority on the American people without their
consent begs for confrontation and, I want to be candid, eventual
U.S. withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms tried to put a positive face on his visit, arranged by a
North Carolina businessman and a friend of the senator who was
appointed an alternate delegate to the General Assembly last fall
and by Richard Holbrooke, the American permanent representative to
the United Nations and this month's Security Council president.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has spent months trying to build bridges with a
hostile Congress, led by Helms, that has held up payments of U.N.
dues and delayed the confirmation of ambassadors and other foreign
policy officials _ notably including Holbrooke himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' Helms said, ``that this body have greater
contact with the elected representatives of the American people,
and that we have greater contact with you.'' He invited Security
Council members to visit his committee in Washington. Before the
council meeting, he spoke for about 40 minutes with Secretary
General Kofi Annan and asked him to pose for pictures with the
Helms family.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Helms, asserting that he was speaking for the
American people _ delivered a clear-cut conservative manifesto on
the United Nations, and didn't leave anything open for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his address to an extraordinary gathering of
ambassadors, nearly every member of the Security Council challenged
Helms' bleak portrayal of the United Nations, and criticized the
United States for letting the organization down.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Alain Dejammet of France, visibly agitated, said to
Helms: ``We hear you, but the idea in this house is that others
must be heard as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain added: ``The United Nations
is not a separate organ to which we turn, like a fire service. It
is the member states, and the United States owns 25 percent of the
power and the resources of the United Nations. What it does well,
the U.S. gets credit for. What it does badly, the U.S. must bear
some responsibility for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do things here democratically,'' Sir Jeremy said,
``because we all have national sovereignties. We all have national
sovereignties, and in a globalizing world there is such a thing as
the international collective interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms told the Security Council that unlike the Europeans, the
American people were moving away from ``supra-national
institutions'' and want no part of ``utopian'' international
arrangements, including the international criminal court created
last year over the objections of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session, which the council decided only Wednesday to
open to the press and the public, was a gamble for Holbrooke,
diplomats said. But it seems to have paid off both for Helms, who
was welcomed with fanfare and was given an unusual stage to air his
views, and for his adversaries. Diplomats from around the world,
particularly Security Council members who have fumed quietly over
what they see as a deadbeat America bankrupting the organization,
got the chance to tell Helms directly what they thought _ however
diplomatically the comments were couched.
</P>
<P>
   After Helms praised the anti-communist Reagan doctrine for
having brought freedom and democracy to the world without the help
or approval of the United Nations, the Namibian representative,
Martin Andjaba, took impassioned exception.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan doctrine, he said, denied independence to Namibia and
its Southwest African Peoples Organization, gave support to
apartheid South Africa and empowered the UNITA rebel movement in
Angola, which has prolonged a quarter-century-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It contributed to a lot of suffering in Africa,'' he said.
``Some of us in SWAPO who were a legitimate and genuine national
liberation movement were called other names: terrorists,'' he said.
``And those that caused death and destruction in Africa were called
liberators _ and they were supported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That page has passed, but we have it fresh in our memories,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said Thursday that he spoke for the American people, but
in reality he set out a clear-cut manifesto of the conservative
right on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a list of indictments against the organization, he revived
old criticism about votes in the General Assembly that ran against
the United States, he attacked a human rights monitor who reported
on allegations of human rights violations in the United States and
objected to accusations that American debts _ still more than $1
billion despite a recent payment _ were harming the organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States had spent $10.1 billion on the
United Nations and its projects in 1999, a figure immediately
disputed by Steven Dimoff, vice president of the U.N. Association
of the United States and the director of its Washington office.
Dimoff said in an interview that the sum ``really does stretch
reality,'' because it included military activities planned and
executed by the United States without any input from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Dimoff, whose organization supports and studies the United
Nations, said that the spectacle in the Security Council of a
member of Congress and not the president purporting to speak for
the American people on foreign affairs ``demonstrates how the
Clinton administration has ceded all the ground of U.S.
policymaking on the U.N. to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance Thursday,'' he said, ``is symbolic of the
extent to which Congress is now in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of France and Canada also challenged Helms
on his budget assertions and his denials that the burden of
American arrears was falling on poor nations. Helms said that the
American people ``have heard U.N. officials say absurdly that
countries like Fiji and Bangladesh were carrying America's burden
in peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's representative, Robert Fowler, replied: ``Senator, I
don't know if I am a U.N. official. I don't think I am. But I am
somebody who has spoken recently about Fiji and Bangladesh. I noted
that in 1999 Bangladesh was owed approximately $18 million, or just
under 175 times its regular budget contributions to this
organization, and that Fiji was owed $4 million, or just under 100
times its regular budget assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that 60 percent of all monies owed to the United Nations
are owed by the United States, 60 percent of those numbers are owed
by Americans to Bangladeshis and to Fijians.,'' he said.

STAUNCH ADVOCATES OF CIVIC MEDIA RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, they don't seem to have much in common _ two
daily newspaper editors dismissed from their posts half a continent
apart. But the recent departures of Colorado Springs Gazette
(94,000 circulation) editor Steve Smith and Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun
Bulletin (62,000 circulation) executive editor Martha Steffens have
much in common. Certainly, neither of them saw eye to eye with
their new publishers. But more important,both were serious newsroom
innovators, aggressive risk takers, and major proponents of the
civic journalism movement, which unites media outlets and community
members in an effort to identify and attack local problems. And
both will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parting with (publisher) Scott (Fisher) was very
professional,'' says Smith, who announced his exit this month after
more than four years as editor. ``Scott and I had a different set
of perceptions on content and business strategies.'' Steffens says
her November exit _ after more than two years as executive editor _
was the result of ``deep philosophical differences'' with publisher
William Monopoli.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure, Steffens liked to make unconventional hires,
using a former assistant district attorney to cover the courts and
bringing a teacher on as a copy editor. She is best known for her
stewardship of Facing Our Future, an ambitious civic journalism
project that brought local residents together to address the
region's economic distress. (Among other things, it helped create a
new interstate highway). A staunch advocate of journalism as a tool
for change, she once traveled to Colombia to talk to editors about
using their papers to combat the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado Springs, Smith held open news meetings in the middle
of the newsroom, published stories that not only included the
reporter's byline, but also the names of the headline writer and
story editor, and told his staff to eschew the traditional
``conflict frame'' of journalism and try producing stories from
different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his exit, Smith completed a major redesign and
restructuring of the paper to re-emphasize fresher news. And daily
circulation this past December was up 3,000 copies over the same
monthin 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to step back and think about things,'' says Smith,
when asked about his plans. ``I'm thinking about academics. But I'm
going to take three months and chill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have several irons in the fire,'' adds Steffens. ``One
option is teaching . . . Clearly, I felt very strongly about the
role of the community (and) I know from the many calls that I
received that the community very much wants me to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saddened by the loss of two risk-taking civic
journalists,'' eulogizes Jan Schaffer, executive director of the
Pew Center for Civic Journalism. ``They had both created journalism
. . . that had enormous impact in their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith fans will recognize the style _ a gripping tale
of her attempt to cope with her son's imprisonment in the
February/March issue of Ms. magazine. According to editor Marcia
Ann Gillespie, the former Globe columnist _ along with Gloria
Steinem _ will be regular Ms. columnists with broad mandates.
``This is the place to talk about whatever's on your mind,'' says
Gillespie. ``So we just wanted to say `Hit it, girl.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie says Ms. staffers weighed the merits of hiring Smith _
who resigned from the Globe in 1998 after fabricating characters
and quotes in some of her columns _ and made a decision after being
moved by her piece in the September issue of Essence magazine
reliving that professional nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country where we pride ourselves on our ability to
move on,'' says Gillespie. ``I read that and wondered, `How many
times does this woman have to say, ``I'm sorry?'' ' ''

COMMENTARY: THE MORNING AFTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ With the prospects high that Syria will
eventually follow Egypt's lead into a peace treaty with Israel, a
debate has been triggered within Egypt's political elite that could
best be summarized as follows: Is there life for Egypt after peace?
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, once Syria enters the circle of peace with
Israel, likely followed by the Palestinians, Egypt's longstanding
role of first leading the Arab world into war with Israel and then
into peace will be over. So what role does Egypt play next?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we used to ask ourselves before was: What are we
going to do if the peace process fails?'' said Egypt's foreign
minister, Amr Moussa, in an interview. ``Now we ask, what are we
going to do when the peace process succeeds? Because the situation
is going to change. Peace is going to happen. This is our
conclusion. But the peace has to be fair if it is going to work.''
If it is, though, he asked: ``What's next? All the think tanks here
are working on that question.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many schools of thought. Some, albeit a tiny minority,
argue that Egypt should use the opportunity of peace to redefine
itself out of the Middle East and into Southern Europe, hitching
its wagon to the European Union train.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that Egypt has been and will forever be tied to the
Arab world by history, language, geography and religion, and its
natural role will be as the chief rival of Israel for regional
influence, once Israel is fully integrated into the Middle East.
The Al-Ahram columnist Salaheddin Hafez predicted last week that
after comprehensive peace, Israel's ``first step will be to
concentrate on diminishing the leadership role of Egypt in its Arab
nationalist environment,'' and Egypt must resist that.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Egyptian intellectual, Mohammed Sid Ahmed, also sees
a natural rivalry emerging between Egypt and Israel. ``Egypt-Israel
relations have gone through three phases,'' he explained. ``First
was hostility and war. Second was partnership, when Egypt and
Israel worked together to persuade the other Arabs that their
reconciliation was the right way to go. Third, the phase we are now
in, is moving beyond partnership into rivalry over who will set the
guidelines for this region.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussa insists that Israel will not be Egypt's regional rival,
for one simple reason: ``Israel cannot lead the Arab world. If
Turkey can't, how can Israel? The Egyptian leadership role in the
Middle East did not start in 1948. The Egyptian leadership role is
geographical, cultural and geopolitical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question still lingers: How will Egypt exercise its
leadership post-peace? This region is different today from the days
when the whole Arab world waited to see what the Egyptian press and
movie industry were producing to know what to think. Tiny Qatar,
the smallest Arab state, has its own satellite TV, Al-Jazirah,
which is now the most widely watched TV in the region _ because it
is free, diverse in its views and critical of Arab regimes. Indeed
Al-Jazirah is so influential, Egypt has had to move toward
privatizing some of its own state-owned TV to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I believe there is only one role Egypt can play, if
it is to thrive as a country and remain relevant as the Arab
leader, and that is for Egypt to be the model for how the Arab
world adjusts to globalization. Egypt has the people, the market,
the educated middle class and the brains to be the Taiwan of the
Mediterranean. Unfortunately, though, both its leadership and much
of its population remain ambivalent about globalization. They
recognize the necessity of Egypt's getting its industry and
infrastructure up to speed for global competition, and liberalizing
its politics, but they are wary about the transition. In the long
run, though, Egypt's current gradualism will not be sufficient to
retain its relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt will only remain relevant in the Arab world if it can set
the example _ not for how to deliver Israel, but for how to deliver
the goods. To do that will require the current Egyptian leadership
to be as zealous about modernization and political reform as Gamal
Abdel Nasser was about Arab unity and Anwar Sadat was about the
peace process. As one Egyptian businessman put it to me: ``A few
years after the peace between Israel and Syria, Egypt will either
be very important or totally irrelevant.''

WRESTLING WITH THE WWF AND THE SMACKDOWN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about WWF that is so compelling for our sons?
</P>
<P>
   For Craig Keville, a fifth-grader, it's entertaining. ``They do
crazy things,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Classmate Tim Beatty can't contain himself: ``Like when they
moon!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the ice is broken. The five boys in guidance counselor Corie
Brookshire's office fall over one another laughing as they describe
the moves of World Wrestling Federation superstars Stone Cold
</P>
<P>
   Steve Austin, Mankind, and the Rock. They know WWF is staged,
but there's a heated discussion nonetheless about whether the steel
chairs they break over each other are fake and where the blood
comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ketchup!'' insists Patrick Carroll. ``The ref cuts
'em with a razor,'' says Lucas Villandry.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas can't imagine life without WWF and takes umbrage when
asked if he and his friends pretend to be wrestlers when they play.
``We don't pretend,'' he says. ``We (itals)are(unitals) the
wrestlers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find a 9- to 12-year-old boy today who can't
relate. Wrestling is hot. Not only was ``WWF Smackdown'' the second
most-watched programming on network television last year, but WWF
also markets dozens of products to children of all ages, including
action figures for 3- and 4-year-olds even though the show is rated
for 14 and up.
</P>
<P>
   WWF is sports entertainment with a soap-operalike story line
that extends beyond the ring; there are fifth-grade boys who know
more about the feud between Stone Cold and Vince McMahon than about
Revolutionary battles. It also includes language so crude that
Coca-Cola refused to advertise on ``Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Professionals who study the influence of pop culture on children
say boys would be better off if they never saw WWF. Unfortunately
for those of us with preteens, it's too late for that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Natural inclinations
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist William Pollack is not surprised that boys are
drawn to WWF. ``They have a natural inclination toward action,
quest, and adventure,'' he says. He runs the Center for Men and
Young Men at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. and is author of
``Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of Boyhood'' (Holt).
</P>
<P>
   Boys also have an equally strong developmental need to identify
with something powerful, says pediatrician Eli Newberger, who
specializes in male development. (The attraction to something
powerful is also a draw for a smattering of girls, who tend to
follow WWF's female wrestlers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For boys who are confused about their physical growth and
about where they fit into their social hierarchy, WWF affords
identity with a powerful character,'' he says. He is author of
``The Men They Will Become: The Nature and Nurture of Male
Character'' (Perseus).
</P>
<P>
   By adopting a persona or playing with wrestling action figures,
a boy feels less vulnerable. ``In the play, you are in control.
It's you who is strong and powerful,'' says Kathy Merlock-Jackson,
a professor at Virginia Wesleyan College who specializes in mass
media and children's culture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Security from ritual
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the outrageousness meets a need, says Linda K. Fuller, a
professor at Worcester (Mass.) State College who researches sports
and pop culture. ``Ritual provides security for kids because it is
predictable, and WWF is full of ritual,'' she says. Each wrestler
always enters to the same music, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   WWF allows for experimentation with how far rules can be
stretched. ``It's not just wrestlers who are outrageous,'' says
Fuller. ``As spectators, boys can get away with things: screaming
louder than usual, using bad language.''
</P>
<P>
   Individually, each of these is a normal developmental drive. But
the way WWF combines them with violence is unhealthy and troubling,
even though the action is staged and boys know it, says Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to make a boy who wouldn't hit go out and
hit,'' he says. ``But it does make him less sensitive to real-life
violence: It makes him lose his sense of how much it hurts when he
sees someone else get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack uses strong words to describe WWF _ he calls it
choreographed sadism _ but it's the wrestlers' emotionlessness that
worries him most. ``They're numb, robotic. They act as if it
doesn't hurt,'' he says. Even though boys know on a cognitive level
that the violence is fake, on an emotional level the lack of
feelings reinforces the still-strong cultural stereotype that to be
a real man is to eschew emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurts our sons more than anything,'' Pollack says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Impact on boys under 7
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The message is an even bigger issue for boys under 7, says early
childhood educator and author Nancy Carlsson-Paige.
</P>
<P>
   One way young children learn is by observing cause and effect.
When they see wrestlers kick and push and not get hurt, they assume
they won't either. ``That's why a preschooler is genuinely
surprised if he pushes a classmate and she cries,'' says
Carlsson-Paige.
</P>
<P>
   When they see siblings and parents caught up in WWF, the message
is that violence is not only entertaining but also OK: ``Even Mom
and Dad like it!'' In other words, she says, ``they are socialized
to accept violence long before they are able to understand its
meaning.'' A professor at Lesley College, Carlsson-Paige is author
of ``Best Day of the Week,'' a children's book on conflict
resolution, and coauthor of an accompanying teacher's guide,
``Before Push Comes to Shove'' (Redleaf Press).
</P>
<P>
   Without the ability to put the violence in perspective, they
begin to see the world as unsafe. ``They can walk around literally
worried that at any moment someone may break a chair over their
head,'' says Merlock-Jackson. ``In order to feel safe, they become
unduly aggressive _ `I have to hit first so he doesn't hit me' _ or
withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlsson-Paige urges keeping children under 7 away from WWF. If
a young child has already been watching, explain that you made a
mistake: ``I didn't know how bad it is for you. Now I do. Let's
find something else you can watch.'' Pollack recommends weaning a
child away from it gradually, watching with him and interpreting.
He also suggests substituting for it with something equally
action-oriented.

<P>
   With older boys, it gets more complicated. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --Neither you nor your fifth grader likes WWF but his friends
do. This boy is torn between familial values and a normal need for
peer acceptance, which is too important for us to ignore, says
Carlsson-Paige. While you don't need to endorse WWF, let him know
you understand his conflict: ``I know how important it is to be
included by your friends.'' Be willing to compromise: ``How can we
figure this out so you can watch with your friends and still feel
OK about it?'' If the compromise is for him to watch at a friend's
house, talk about it afterward: ``Tell me about it. Did anything
surprise/worry/upset/please you?''
</P>
<P>
   --WWF is all your son wanted for Christmas, it's all he plays,
it's what he writes about on school essays. This is a red flag,
says Newberger, especially if there also are changes in appetite,
sleep, friendships, or grades, and/or a preoccupation with
violence. He recommends a professional consultation.
</P>
<P>
   --Your son watches regularly but not obsessively. Talk about it
with him: ``Tell me what you like so much about it.'' Be careful
not to be critical, says Pollack; that will shut him down. Reflect
back what he says _ ``So you like the hitting, even though you know
it's not real'' _ and share your concerns: ``It worries me when
people act like it's fun to hurt someone.'' Help him to see how
it's changing his life: ``You used to like to play street hockey,
now you'd rather play a WWF video game.'' Negotiate to reduce
viewing, watch with him, and keep talking.
</P>
<P>
   --Whenever your son and his friends watch, their play afterward
turns violent. Fuller says aggression and bad language typically
increase after viewing. Point this out _ ``Do you notice that. .
.'' _ and help them analyze what's different. They might not like
your doing this (your son is sure to be embarrassed), but Fuller
says, ``It lets them know you care. That matters more than you
think.''
</P>
<P>
   --WWF is a family activity. This may be togetherness, but it's
also a stamp of approval on violence as entertainment, crude
language, and distancing oneself from emotion. ``Tape it and watch
after your kids are asleep,'' says Carlsson-Paige. Fuller says the
only value to watching together is if you analyze along the way _
``If that was real, he'd be paralyzed'' _ but don't get caught up
in it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Stockdale, a student at the Hosmer School in Watertown,
Mass., is very aware of the real-life dangers of WWF and can rattle
off a list of wrestlers' injuries. Still, ask him and his four
classmates what they want to be when then grow up and their answer
is unanimous:
</P>
<P>
   Professional wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Share your concerns about WWF with your child's teachers. In
some schools, it's such a problem that wrestling play is banned and
there are classroom discussions about its influence.
</P>
<P>
   --It isn't enough for a young child to tell you or for you to
tell him, ``WWF violence isn't real.'' Connect it to his life:
``WWF is like a magic trick, the way they kick and don't get hurt.
What happens if someone pushes you? How do you feel? Remember when
you pushed Cory at the sandbox and he cried?''
</P>
<P>
   --Be careful not to underreact to behavior that shocks you. Boys
always try to push the envelope to bend the rules, so the more
easily you are shocked the less outrageous they have to be to get
the reaction they want.
</P>
<P>
   --Remind them that wrestlers are real people: ``I wonder if he's
married.'' ``I wonder what his mother thinks of his job.''
</P>
<P>
   --Be sure WWF is not your son's only model of manliness and that
he has opportunities for creativity in his life.
</P>
<P>
   --Look for other programming and for books that offer action and
adventure without gratuitious violence. Lobby against violence in
programming.

MISSED MISSILE GIVES RAYTHEON ANOTHER BLACK EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two heat-seeking devices apparently malfunctioned aboard an
antimissile weapon built by Raytheon Co., which may have caused it
to miss a target in a key test, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The setback, on Tuesday, didn't seem to weaken political support
for the antimissile program, at least immediately. But it's another
black eye for Raytheon, which was looking for a comeback after its
shares fell sharply on Tuesday, when it warned of earnings
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity, a Pentagon
official said ``the preliminary indication is that we had a
malfunction on both'' of the infrared devices aboard the
Raytheon-built ``exoatmospheric kill vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems prevented it from finding and ramming a mock enemy
warhead in the last six seconds of the test, conducted more than
120 miles above the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The official wasn't able to say exactly by how much the device
missed, but said that other navigational instruments, including
optical star-readers, ``got us to the street address'' of the
target missile. ``What we failed to do is ring the doorbell,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The test was seen as a key demonstration of the feasibility of
the antimissile technology, which is being developed by Raytheon
under contract to Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   In a more limited test in October, the system found and
destroyed its target, though the Pentagon last week disclosed a
problem with star-scanning devices in that event. A third test is
scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
   The mock interceptions are being conducted as a prelude to a
decision by the Clinton administration whether to fund the program,
which the Pentagon estimates would cost $10.5 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, even the program's backers conceded the most recent
failure could tempt the administration to delay things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it could more difficult, politically,'' to fund the
program, said Robert Pfaltzgraff, a professor at Tuft University's
Fletcher School of Law &AMP; Diplomancy and one of the system's
advocates. Still, he said, ``setbacks are inevitable, and one miss
isn't enough to scrap the whole program.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman reiterated that view,
through spokesman Dan Gerstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in this technological bump in the road'' has dissuaded
Lieberman ``from the view that building a viable, effective defense
should be a clear national priority,'' Gerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Support from centrist Democrats like Lieberman, a member of the
Armed Services Committee, will be key if the program, known as the
National Missile Defense, is to be funded on the Pentagon's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The system _ essentially Star Wars Lite _ envisions a more
limited deployment of concepts first outlined in the 1980s. Then,
the Reagan administration imagined a space-based missile shield
that could defeat a hypothetical, vast first strike by the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The current concept is advertised for shooting down a more
limited strike launched by smaller nations, such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts aren't worried about any financial impact on Raytheon
stemmed from the failed test, since major appropriations would be
years away. ``It's all still hypothetical,'' said Edward Jones
analyst Bill Fiala. ``I know it will be big; how big is too early
to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has become of symbolic importance to Raytheon,
however, which Tuesday announced an earnings shortfalls that caused
its stock to decline 25 percent. In trading Wednesday, Raytheon's
widely-traded Class B shares rose 11/16 to close at 19-11/16.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, a Raytheon spokesman said the Lexington, Mass.
company was ``disappointed'' by the result but said that it lacked
further data to fully judge the test. ``Until we whave the facts it
would be preamature to say anyhing further right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that other components of the system, including
radar and satellite sensors, performed as designed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to technical challenges, the missile-defense program
faces policy hurdles as well. Many Democrats and arms-control
experts worry it could could destabilize relations with Russia,
with whom the US has agreements not to deploy defense systems that
would undercut the Cold War deterence policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say the missile-defense program
wouldn't change that relationship. But Russian leaders disagree and
last week backed away from assurances they would use its nuclear
arsenal only if the country's existence was threatened.

NEBRASKA SENATOR SAYS HE WON'T SEEK A THIRD TERM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ After two weeks of Hamlet-like pondering, Sen. Bob
Kerrey announced Thursday that he had decided he could best serve
the nation in the future as a private citizen and would not seek
re-election to a third term, a decision that sharply diminished
Democratic hopes of retaking the Senate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a 56-year-old liberal whose great popularity at home in
Nebraska had made his re-election seem certain until he suddenly
and publicly began pondering his future two weeks ago, said he
intended to remain active in public affairs, but as a private
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a deeply personal decision,'' he said during a brief
press conference at the Omaha Press Club. ``But I feel my spiritual
side needs to be filled back up.''
</P>
<P>
   He provided little elaboration beyond disclosing that up until
11 p.m. Wednesday he had not made up his mind, swaying first one
way and then the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two statements in my pocket,'' he said, ``one to stay
and one to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But this much was clear: His decision to go, for whatever reason
or reasons, left the Democratic Party in a bind. Republicans
control the Senate, 55-45, and now a seat that had seemed certain
to stay Democratic, even though Nebraska tends to vote Republican,
is up for grabs and Democratic hopes of closing, or maybe even
eliminating, the 10-member gap, are considerably less bright.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said he was confident a strong Democrat would emerge to
run in his place.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, pledged in Washington that the party would
put up a stiff fight to hang on to the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daschle confessed, ``I'm disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, always a bit of a maverick on Capitol Hill but
nevertheless something of a power player, said that while he was
leaving public life for the moment, he very well might seek public
office again. For that matter, he went on, should he be approached
about becoming the Democratic vice presidential nominee this year,
a possibility that has been tossed about by others, he would
``never say never.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He ran for president in 1992 but withdrew quickly after failing
to win much support in the early primaries and caucuses. Then in
early 1998, he said he might try another run for president in 2000,
only to drop that idea six months later and announce he would seek
a third term in the Senate. By the end of 1999, he had raised more
than $3 million in campaign funds and seemed well on his way to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new year came sudden word from Kerrey that he
wanted a change in his life, a life already full by any measure _
combat service in Vietnam, where he won a Medal of Honor, followed
by a career as a successful operator of restaurants and health
clubs, a four-year tour as governor, a much publicized relationship
with the actress Debra Winger and then a Senate career.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind of change he was pondering, Kerrey said he was
wrestling with the issue but never made clear just why he was
wrestling, which only served to increase the attention given his
struggle over whether to stay or not to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement and press conference shed little new
light, beyond the senator saying that he first began thinking about
a career change a month or so ago after the New School University
in New York asked if he might be interested in being considered for
its presidency, along with some other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday whether he would take that job if offered _ he
dates a prominent New York screenwriter, Sara Paley _ he replied
elliptically that he was not that far along in his pondering. But
whatever he does next, he said, he intends to keep close ties to
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was leaving the Senate deeply satisfied with the work
he had done on agriculture, education, health, intelligence and
military issues, particularly reform efforts. ``Democracy is alive
and well after all,'' he declared, hastening to add that unlike
many Americans, he had not become cynical about politics and, in
fact, had more confidence than ever in public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Lou Gehrig said in leaving baseball,'' he went on, ``I
consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kerrey said that he thought a strong Democratic candidate
would emerge, only former Gov. Ben Nelson and former Rep. John
Cavanaugh were reported to be seriously thinking about getting into
the race. On the Republican side the list includes Rep. Doug
Bereuter; Attorney General Don Stenberg; former Rep. Jon
Christensen; Mayor Hal Daub of Omaha; Tom Osborne, the former
University of Nebraska football coach; and Elliott Rustad, a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Was Kerrey truly serious about remaining involved in the
nation's affairs?
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who knows war better than most, replied that one of
his favorite movies was ``Patton'' and he recalled that in one
scene the general looks out over the carnage on a battlefield and
mutters to himself, ``God help me, I do love it.''
</P>
<P>
   That, the senator said, pretty well captured how he feels about
staying involved in the fray over how to make America a better
nation.

PERCENT OF AMERICANS IN UNIONS REMAINS FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ongoing national campaign to increase the ranks of organized
labor added 265,000 new union members last year, yet the percentage
of the US work force that's unionized remained unchanged at about
13.9 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 16.5 million workers belonged to unions in 1999.
That's up from 16.2 million in 1998, but far below the all-time
high of about percent in .
</P>
<P>
   About 112,000 of those who joined unions last year were employed
in the private sector. It was the largest increase in that sector
in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders reported significant growth in union membership
among white-collar professionals and service workers, noting that
45,000 doctors joined or formed AFL-CIO affiliated unions last year
and that 75,000 home health aides formed a union in California.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a small group of high-tech and communications
workers have begun exploring the possibility of unionization at
Microsoft, Amazon.com, IBM, and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such increases, the proportion of union employees in the
labor force remained unchanged last year, even though 2.7 million
new jobs were added to the economy. Labor specialists attributed
that to mergers and consolidations, as well as to factory shutdowns
in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, AFL-CIO president John J. Sweeney said the increase
in membership indicates the labor movement's emphasis on organizing
has had a noticeable impact. The higher numbers should result in
more political clout for the labor movement in the upcoming
presidential election, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see the largest and most significant activity
that grass-roots workers have ever exercised in any political
election,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Within the public sector, the Service Employees International
Union _ its members include physicians, registered nurses, health
aides, and technicians _ gained 150,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The SEIU spent $70 million on organizing drives last year,
nearly half of the organization's international budget, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of public-sector union workers increased by
152,788, the percentage of such workers in unions dropped to 37.3
percent from 37.5, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Adams, organizing director for the AFL-CIO, said the labor
movement must add between 500,000 and 1 million new members per
year to grow.

WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR URGES ACTION AGAINST KRADZIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ International war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte
Wednesday implored NATO to do more to arrest former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, even as her office said it hoped that
others under indictment for war crimes would turn themselves in
following the murder of a Serb paramilitary leader last week.
   Del Ponte met in Brussels with representatives from NATO's 19
member nations on the same day that Zeljko Raznatovic, better known
as Arkan, was being buried in Belgrade. Arkan, who was indicted in
1997 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia but never apprehended, was shot dead Saturday in the
lobby of the Inter-Continental Hotel in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after she met with NATO leaders, del Ponte
said she singled out Karadzic in her appeal for the military
alliance to do more to arrest suspected war criminals at large in
areas such as Bosnia that NATO forces control.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, she said, is ``the most wanted . . . the symbol of
this year, the fugitive who has been longest on the loose.''
Karadzic, former Bosnian Serb president, was indicted on charges
including genocide in connection with an ``ethnic cleansing''
campaign that left 100,00 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte acknowledged it would be dangerous and difficult to
arrest Karadzic, who is thought to be in the Serbian area of
eastern Bosnia and surrounded by bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan was always flanked by bodyguards, too, but one of them was
killed alongside him when at least two gunmen opened fire on his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that del Ponte prefers that Arkan and others
face justice before the tribunal at The Hague, her spokesman, Paul
Risley, said Arkan's murder may lead Karadzic and other fugitives,
including the Bosnian Serb general, Ratko Mladic, to consider
turning themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safest and most secure place is the secure detention unit
run by the United Nations here,'' Risley said in a telephone
interview from The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   While many Serbs dismiss the tribunal as being beholden to NATO,
Risley noted that the international court has acquitted some
suspects and given lenient sentences to some who have cooperated
with the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past five years, the tribunal has proved to be
unpredictable,'' said Risley.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen of the 33 suspects who have been arraigned at the
court at The Hague were apprehended by NATO, which has 20,000
troops in Bosnia more than four years after the end of the war
there. NATO Secretary General George Robertson said Wednesday that
NATO remains committed to arresting suspected war criminals when it
can, and he shared Risley's hope that Arkan's assassination would
be a catalyst for more surrenders.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said suspects who surrender and cooperate will be
treated more leniently.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan and his paramilitary unit, known as the Tigers, was
accused of slaughtering civilians in Croatia and Bosnia, allegedly
with the approval of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is
also under indictment for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts in Belgrade have speculated that Arkan was killed
by the Milosevic regime to forestall the possibility that he might
surrender and give evidence against Milosevic. The government in
Belgrade, which openly supported Arkan's activities during the wars
in Croatia and Bosnia, has denied it played a role in Arkan's
murder. The assassination of someone seen as close to Milosevic
could lead others ostensibly in the good graces of the Belgrade
regime to seek a safe haven rather than suffer a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan was seen to be distancing himself from Milosevic, and had
been in contact with Serbian opposition leader Zoran Djindnic.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said that the chief prosecutor's office had had contact
with ``several individuals'' purporting to represent Arkan over the
last two years, but the discussions never reached the stage of
arranging a surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Risley said the prosecutor's office ``surmises that most of
those attempts were to try to gather information on the nature of
the charges contained in the sealed indictment rather than to
arrange a surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Risley said it was ``possible that Arkan could have provided
information that would assist'' in the prosecution of Milosevic,
and that the judges who sit on the international court ``take into
consideration any level of cooperation shown by an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But Risley added that Arkan could not have made his own
indictment disappear, no matter what he offered up on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   As for others under indictment, and presumably under the
protection of forces loyal to or friendly with Milosevic, Risley
said, ``If I were them, I'd be sweating.''

INTEL PROGRAM TO BOLSTER EDUCATION AND COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore., Texas, Ariz.)  (pr) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. announced a three-year program Thursday to help
100,000 elementary and secondary school teachers in the United
States integrate computers and the Internet into their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the program, called Teach to the Future, Intel will give
$75,000 cash grants to nonprofit training centers that will offer
teachers a 40-hour instructional program; Intel, Hewlett-Packard
and other companies will donate some computers and offer
reduced-price computers to school districts; Microsoft will donate
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the program intends to train 10,000
teachers this year in four areas: Northern California, Oregon,
Texas and Arizona. Next year, that will expand to 40,000 teachers
in 10 more regions or states, with an additional 50,000 teachers to
be trained across the nation in 2002. The program is also intended
to train 300,000 teachers in 19 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to produce computer-literate people but to
teach people how to use the computer as a tool to produce
well-educated people,'' said Wendy Hawkins, manager of Intel's
teacher-development programs.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of public school teachers are already comfortable
using computers, according to Intel's research. ``But this program
is designed to take teachers from being users themselves to
incorporating computers into their everyday lesson plans,'' Ms.
Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's program is modeled on a smaller program, Applying
Computers in Education, developed by the Institute of Computer
Technology in Sunnyvale, Calif. The institute is a statewide
agency, founded by the California Legislature, which provides
technology training and planning to schools and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it was investing $100 million in cash, equipment,
curriculum development and program management to the program. In
addition, Microsoft is donating software _ primarily its Office
2000 program, which includes word-processing, spreadsheet and
graphics functions, plus its Encarta encyclopedia _ a donation that
the company says is worth $344 million and is its largest ever.

TRIATHLETE SMYERS BATTLING THYROID CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After three years of battling back from numerous
injuries and childbirth, triathlete Karen Smyers is in another
fight: thyroid cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some scary moments,'' Smyers said Wednesday.
``Probably the scariest is when that c-word was mentioned for the
first time. Now I'm feeling fine. One thing I've learned the last
couple of years is how incredible the human body is in recovering
from things. I feel like everything is under control.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Smyers, who in 1995 became the first woman to
win the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon and the triathlon world
championship in the same year, underwent surgery Dec. 18 at
Massachusetts General Hospital to have her cancerous thyroid
removed, but after consultation with several endocrinologists has
decided to delay further treatment until after the Olympic Trials
in May. Triathlon is making its debut as an Olympic sport this
September in Sydney and Smyers is one of the leading contenders to
make the US team. She has resumed training.
</P>
<P>
   The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, below the
Adam's apple, which makes and stores hormones that regulate heart
rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and the rate at which food
is converted into energy. Thyroid cancer strikes about 16,000
people a year in the United States, accounting for about 1 percent
of all cancers. Most thyroid cancers are highly curable, with a
cure rate that can rise to better than 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Common postsurgical treatment consists of the administration of
radioactive iodine. Although the iodine tends to have relatively
few side effects, Smyers would first need to quit the medication
she has been taking since surgery, which replaces the hormones
normally produced by the gland, and the effects of that would
severely inhibit her training for the 0.9-mile swim, 24.8-mile
bike, and 6.2-run that make up the Olympic triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Smyers's surgeon recommended she undergo the iodine
treatment as soon as her neck healed, within 6-8 weeks of surgery.
Smyers and her husband, Michael King, who live in suburban Lincoln,
were willing to accept that. But in further consultation she was
told of evidence that the treatment might in fact be more effective
if she waited longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all I needed to hear,'' said Smyers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her concern stems from the training time she has already
lost to a broken collarbone sustained in a race last November,
putting her in what she called ``pitiful shape. I need every single
week to get in shape for the trials.'' Effects from the iodine
treatment, she has been told, would last at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a 1 1/2-year-old daughter to care for, Smyers said
she wouldn't consider putting off treatment if she believed there
was a risk. ``As important as sport is, it's nothing compared to
being around as a mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Smyers first learned during a checkup in September
that she might have cancer, but tests were not concluded until
after she finished a strong second in the Hawaii Ironman (2.4-mile
swim, 112-mile bike, 26.2-mile run) in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the Ironman during much of the bike and run and
finishing so well, Smyers said, the chances of having cancer seemed
remote. ``I thought, there's got to be a mistake,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't, as a biopsy in November confirmed. Still, Smyers
takes heart from the success of Emma Robinson, a 28-year-old
national team rower from Canada who last February was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer and went on to set a world record in the
women's pair in July and win her third consecutive world
championship in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my new poster girl,'' said Smyers.

MICHAEL C. SKAKEL: A LIFETIME DOGGED BY TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After living a quarter-century under a murky cloud of suspicion
and innuendo, Michael C. Skakel formally made the transition
Wednesday from whispered suspect to accused defendant in the 1975
bludgeoning death of teenager Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   The long interim has been a rocky one for Skakel, 39, the nephew
of Ethel Kennedy who has been linked his entire adult life to the
sensational Moxley murder committed in exclusive Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   From a drunken-driving arrest that preceded his enrollment in a
Maine school for troubled boys, to his testimony in his cousin
Michael Kennedy's alleged relationship with an underage
baby-sitter, Skakel has been dogged by turmoil since Moxley was
discovered brutally slain by a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Skakel appeared at Greenwich police headquarters with
his lawyer to answer the charges and post $500,000 bond after
journeying north from his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. The charge
followed 18 months of investigation by a single grand juror who is
also a Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley, 15, was found dead outside her home in the gated Belle
Haven enclave of Greenwich after a pre-Halloween ``mischief night''
of strewing toilet paper and shaving cream aroound the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The next-door Skakels initially cooperated with police, but the
willingness of the family, heirs to a Midwestern coal fortune, to
talk with authorities ended abruptly in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The whispers, however, continued in Greenwich about whether
Michael and Thomas Skakel, ages 15 and 17, had committed the crime.
But police investigators did not develop enough evidence to bring
charges, although through the years three speculation-filled books
kept the sensational crime alive in the public mind for years.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after Moxley's death, Michael Skakel was sent to the
Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine. He twice attempted to flee the
residential drug treatment facility, where classmates were told by
the school's owner that he had been involved in the murder,
according to a former student's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel left the school in 1980. He once again gained notoriety
when his alleged role in the Michael Kennedy baby-sitter
controversy erupted in 1997. Skakel, who had become a driver in
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's relection camaign in 1994, became
increasingly close to Michael Kennedy, the senator's nephew and
Skakel's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the campaign, according to someone familiar
with the family, Skakel became Michael Kennedy's ``right-hand man''
as his cousin assumed the executive duties at Citizens Energy
Corp., the Boston nonprofit fuel assistance program begun by former
US Representative Joseph Kennedy II.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel lived in Cohasset, Mass. with his wife, who worked as
assistant golf pro at a country club. He also became friendly with
the family of the teenager with whom Michael Kennedy allegedly had
a sexual affair before she was 16, and he is reported to have
intervened on behalf of the family in an effort to persuade Kennedy
to end the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   During this time, Skakel was part of rowdy rafting trips to
Maine, filled with late-night drinking, on which Kennedy and the
teenager had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel alienated the Kennedy family, sources said Wednesday,
when he agreed to answer questions about the relationship from
Norfolk (Mass.) District Attorney Jeffrey A. Locke.
</P>
<P>
   His position at Citizens Energy became increasingly tenuous, and
Skakel is reported to have sought a $250,000 cash settlement to
leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kennedy died in a skiing accident in Colorado on New
Year's Eve 1997. Skakel left Massachusetts and moved to Florida to
be near his father, who also lives in Hobe Sound.

CLINTON OUTLINES PLAN TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday proposed a $31
billion package of tax advantages and financial aid to make college
more affordable for millions of families, including those earning
as much as $120,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the program, which needs congressional
approval, is a tax credit of $2,800 a year that would be phased in
by 2003 to ease the cost for tuition and fees for eligible
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we open the doors to college, we open the doors to
opportunity,'' Clinton said Thursday at a gathering of college
students in the Old Executive Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   The president's education budget would also include $35 million
intended to encourage college dropouts to re-enroll; $40 million to
help minority students embark on five-year, dual-degree programs;
$716 million for Pell grants to aid needy students, and $400
million for programs to keep students from low-income families in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the proposals would be aimed at
middle-class families but would also benefit families in higher
income levels. Families making below $100,000 a year would receive
the full benefits of the proposals, while those with incomes up to
$120,000 would receive reduced benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would expand, but not replace, existing education
tax credits and scholarships, which Congress enacted in 1997 at
Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives face an uncertain prospect in this election
year, with Republicans in Congress hesitant to give Clinton any
political advantage. A more ambitious tax cut package pushed by
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, won
bipartisan support last year but eventually died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in Congress, I note, are saying that because this is an
election year we really shouldn't try to do anything for the
American people,'' Clinton said. ``Nothing, not a national election
or a Washington snowstorm, should get in the way of making a
college education more affordable for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement, like the health-care measures he
proposed on Wednesday, are part of a seasonal ritual in which the
president tries to build interest in his State of the Union
address, scheduled for next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the details are announced early. Asked how the education
proposals would be paid for, Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman,
told reporters to wait until next month, when the administration's
spending priorities for the 2001 fiscal year will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   At the president's side Thursday were Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who is expected to seek a Senate seat in New York, and Schumer, who
had advocated making college tuition tax deductible during his
victorious campaign over former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the two had twisted his arm to include the
education proposals in his 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the president was Nina McLaughlin, a freshman at
Trinity College here, who said her family would benefit
significantly from the proposals. Ms. McLaughlin has two younger
brothers nearing college age. Her father is working overtime to pay
for expenses, while her mother holds two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscing about his own college days, Clinton said: ``I had
the help of scholarships, loans and jobs. If I hadn't had that
help, there's no way in the world I'd be standing here today.''

PERLMAN TAKES OVER GUEST CONDUCTING JOB IN DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Violinist Itzhak Perlman has been named principal guest
conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, beginning in 2001-2.
He began conducting about five years ago, and since then has led
many leading American and Canadian orchestras as well as the Israel
Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. He makes his first
appearance conducting the Boston Symphony at Tanglewood in July.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation from Detroit Wednesday, Perlman said, ``In my
new job, I'll be making new motions, but it's the old me.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he started conducting in the Pearlman Music
Program, an institute on Long Island, founded by his wife to help
train precollege musicians. ``I coached some chamber music and then
began coaching the orchestra, and to coach an orchestra, you have
to conduct it; that experience started me off. Actually, I've
always been lifting the stick in my mind, and I took some classes
in conducting when I was a student at Juilliard. I thought that if
I could accomplish nice results with kids, it might also work with
pros, and one thing has led to another. All of it has made me very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman will conduct the Detroit Symphony for three weeks each
season, as well as participate in the orchestra's educational
activities. ``I recently conducted the Detroit Symphony for the
first time and we had such a wonderful rapport; everyone was very
happy. Then they approached me about this position. I thought about
it for about 4 1/2 seconds, and then I said `Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman says he has always kept an attentive eye on conductors
over his long career. ``You watch different conductors do different
things to get different results, and it soaks into you. Three or
four different conductors will give a downbeat and three or four
different kinds of sound will result. That's a fascinating mystery
that I don't want to solve.'' He joked that he has worked with
himself as soloist and found himself a little difficult. ``I refuse
to talk with myself before a rehearsal!''
</P>
<P>
   He admits he is ``excited'' about conducting the Boston Symphony
at Tanglewood. ``Brahms's Fourth Symphony is one of the things I'm
going to do _ I've done it with Chicago and Houston, so I will come
to Tanglewood as a veteran.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman says his new career will not mean any cutting back on
his violin playing. ``The conducting is something that comes in
addition, another dimension, a way to work on a different repertory
in an active way. I don't think one will replace the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the effect on his operatic ambitions _ he once sang
the Jailor in Puccini's ``Tosca'' _ Pearlman said, ``I'm 54 years
old and my career as a singer is almost over _ I made my farewell
debut a long time ago!''

   SETBACK FOR PINOCHET JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's government said Thursday it would not
send London a request for an appeal from Judge Baltasar Garzon if
Gen. Augusto Pinochet is freed on medical grounds. It is the first
time since the former Chilean dictator, 84, was arrested 15 months
ago on human rights charges that Spain has refused to transmit the
judge's orders. But a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the case,
once considered strictly judicial, had entered the political realm,
allowing the government to decide not to appeal Gen. Pinochet's
release and his expected return to Chile.

<P>
   The space station Mir got a reprieve when the government came up
with more money to keep it in orbit for another seven months.
Private investors, some from the United States, are expected to
provide $28 million for the station. A crew is expected to arrive
in April for a mission of 45 to 72 days, said Yuri Koptev, head of
the space agency. Mir, in its 14th year, has been empty since
August, and was due to crash into the Pacific.

<P>
   Germany asked the Greek Supreme Court to dismiss a lower court
ruling that it owes $30 million to survivors of 218 people who were
killed by Nazis in the village of Distomo on June 10, 1944. Germany
says the issue of reparations was closed with a 1960 compensation
treaty with Greece. A ruling is expected in mid-February.

ROOKIE HAS KEYS TO THE KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The NFL Book says it won't work. You cannot advance in
the NFL playoffs with a rookie quarterback. It's not done.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two-year-old Shaun King of the Buccaneers is attempting
burn a page out of the Book. King is attemping to go where no
(fresh) man has gone. He is trying to advance to the Super Bowl
despite playing less than half a season of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday at Raymond James Stadium, King led a second-half
comeback, and threw a fourth-quarter touchdown pass that beat the
Washington Redskins, 14-13, propelling the Bucs into Sunday's NFC
Championship Game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Redskins, King completed only four of his first 16
passes and the Buccaneers compiled only 69 yards of first-half
offense. In the first two quarters, King was 4 for 14 for 45 yards
and the Bucs converted only one of seven third-down situations.
Tampa trailed, 13-0, after King was intercepted early in the third
quarter. Backup quarterback Eric Zeier started warming up in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But King got it together and directed two touchdown drives to
win the game. Mike Alstott ran the first TD home. Midway throught
he fourth quarter, on third-and-goal from the 1, King tried to run
a bootleg, but found himself in the grizzly grip of Washington
defensive end Ndukwe Kalu. Before going down, the resourceful
rookie shot-putted a TD toss to backup tight end John Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I played great, but I didn't lose the game,''
said King. ``So I was proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Saap, Tampa's All-Pro defensive end, added, ``You all
said our rookie quarterback couldn't get it done. We had all the
confidence in the world this young fellow could get it done. He had
something special and we're glad he's on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Washington, King became the first rookie quarterback to
win a playoff game since Pat Haden beat the Cowboys for the Los
Angeles Rams Dec. 19. 1976. Dan Marino, Jim Everett, Bernie Kosar,
and Todd Marinovich are the only other NFL rookies ever to start a
playoff game, and they all lost. Before King, the aggregate rookie
QB playoff roll call was 1-5, with four touchdown passes and 13
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Like Haden, King became a starter due to injury. Tampa
quarterback Trent Dilfer broke his right clavicle Nov. 28 against
Seattle. Zeier was already on the shelf with bruised ribs, putting
King on stage. He finished the season with four wins in five
starts.
</P>
<P>
   King is not your prototype NFL starting quarterback. He's only 6
feet tall, and hardly cat-like at 225 pounds. Five quarterbacks
(Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb, Akili Smith, Cade McNown, and Daunte
Culpepper) were taken ahead of him in last year's draft, and all of
them will be eating cheeseballs and/or hitting 9-irons when King
goes to work against the Rams Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His is an unlikely story, almost Crapra-esque. He grew up across
the Bay in St. Petersburg, Fla., worshipped the lowly Buccaneers
for all of his young life, and made belivers out of those who
doubted his quarterback skills. Playing for traditionally-weak
Gibbs High in St. Petersburg, he threw for 50 touchdowns and almost
5,000 yards in his final two seasons, but got no attention from the
Sunshine State's NCAA bohemoths, Florida and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Tulane and did little in two seasons before Tommy
Bowden was hired as head coach. In King's junior year, the Green
Wave enjoyed its first winning season in 16 years and King broke
most of the school's passing records. The best way to describe
King's senior year is to think of Pedro Martinez with the Red Sox
in 1999. Playing nine of his games with a cast on his broken left
wrist, King threw for 3,332 yards and 36 touchdowns with just six
interceptions. Tulane went undefeated and beat BYU in the Liberty
Bowl. Find a better Division 1 season that that.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew what to expect when the draft came around. King told
hometown folks that if he was not selected, he'd like to work for
the Buccaneers' marketing department (he earned a bachelor's degree
in marketing at Tulane). King's family gathered at his
grandmother's house in Tampa and waited for the phone to ring. The
first call was a prank, Shaun's brother Cedric calling from a
payphone and identifying himself as Tampa head coach Tony Dungy. An
hour later, in the middle of the second round, the real Dungy
called.
</P>
<P>
   King was doing the Scott Zolak/Michael Bishop thing when
Dilfer's clavicle snapped in November. He closed out the victory
over the Seahawks, then threw a pair of touchdowns and beat the
Vikings in his NFL debut on Monday Night Football. Teammates
nicknamed him ``Smoothie.'' He stretched his winning streak as a
starter to 25 games, before a 45-0 loss to Oakland, and completed
61 percent of his passes in the regular season. And now he has a
playoff win on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs play conservative, some would say ugly, football under
the direction of coordinator Mike Shula. They are 14-point
underdogs, playing on the road in St. Louis this weekend. And
they're putting a rookie quarterback on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Book says they can't win.

BOY'S GRANDMOTHERS SET TO ARGUE IN U.S. FOR HIS RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration issued visas on Thursday
to the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, allowing the two
women to travel to the United States from Cuba and setting up a
showdown on American soil between two sets of the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana granted the visas as
representatives of the National Council of Churches flew a
chartered plane to Havana to meet the boy's grandmothers and take
them to New York late Thursday night or Friday, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments in the international custody case
virtually guarantee that a dramatic tug-of-war over the boy will
occur in the United States between Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
who wants permanent custody of the boy, and Elian's Cuban
grandmothers, who have said repeatedly that the boy should be
reunited with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's rescue from an inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 other people drowned fleeing Cuba, he has
been living with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, and maternal
grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, applied for the visas late Thursday
afternoon, and they were granted in a matter of hours. ``They were
found to be eligible and the visas were quickly granted,'' said
James P. Rubin, the spokesman for the State Department. ``We
understand they will travel tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintana has told the Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, that
she had wanted to travel to Miami ``for just five minutes'' to pick
up her grandson. Ms. Rodriguez, whose daughter died trying to come
to the United States, has been equally emphatic that the youngster
should return to Cuba to live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, who insisted on anonymity, said the
grandmothers had chosen to fly to New York rather than Miami, where
hundreds of anti-Castro Cubans have demonstrated against the boy's
return to Cuba. The National Council of Churches, whose leaders
have said that the boy should be reunited with his father on the
island, is located in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Miami on Wednesday that challenged the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling on Jan. 4 that the
youngster should be sent back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Thursday night that they
welcomed the visit by the grandmothers because they assume that it
will create sympathy for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's position.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had considered going to court to ask
a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in an attempt to
quickly resolve what has evolved into a highly emotional, extremely
difficult political and diplomatic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official denied that the grandmothers' visit
was intended to circumvent the legal process. ``Presumably,'' the
official said, ``the two grandmothers can speak better for the
father's interests than the boy's great-uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that Justice
Department officials would move as quickly as possible to resolve
the matter in federal court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at everything that can be done to have the matter
heard appropriately and promptly, with the recognition that it does
the child no good to be in limbo,'' Reno said at her weekly press
conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 13 people who tried to sail from Cuba to the
Florida coast in a 17-foot aluminum boat, which capsized. The boy's
mother and stepfather and eight others drowned. Elian, and two
others, were rescued after clinging to inner tubes in Florida
waters for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his fate has become the subject of an intense fight
between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Miami. The boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has made it clear that he wants Elian
to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit filed on Wednesday, lawyers for Elian's
great-uncle argued that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
had violated Elian's due-process rights. They asked a federal judge
to prevent the agency from returning the boy before it grants him
an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the great-uncle, Spencer Eig, told Cable News
Network on Thursday night that the grandmothers would be welcome to
visit Elian in Miami, but they would not be permitted to take the
boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers whose expertise is family and immigration law
support the position of the Clinton administration, saying the
reunification of a parent and child and is a cornerstone of
immigration law and INS practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is rather clear on this,'' said Eliot Lichtman, a
veteran immigration attorney based here. ``This is a federal issue
for the immigration service. They have interviewed the father and
decided the father has a loving relationship with the son.''

THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Every Internet entrepreneur worth his first $5 million in
venture capital says he's building an ``on-line community,'' an
electronic hangout for millions of loyal Internet users. Meanwhile,
the original Net community, Usenet, is being ignored by millions
who might profit from the occasional visit.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet is one of the wonders of the Internet. It's a system of
thousands of bulletin boards, called newsgroups, where people can
ask and answer questions. Each focuses on a single topic _ for
instance, rec.arts.tv.soaps is the group for discussions about soap
operas.
</P>
<P>
   When I recently had trouble with the CD-ROM drive on an old
computer I'm refurbishing, I posted a question on
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.cd-rom. A day later, a guy wrote back with
the solution to my problem. Some people think I know computers;
what I really know is how to ask questions on Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, Usenet junkies loved to gripe about the
foolish messages posted by Internet newcomers, especially visitors
from America Online. It seems they needn't have worried. According
to Internet service providers, most newcomers to the Net want no
part of Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   So says Ritch Blasi, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T Worldnet, which
connects 1.8 million households to the Internet. Blasi told me only
15 percent of Worldnet's subscribers log on to Usenet. ``I was
actually kind of surprised,'' Blasi said.
</P>
<P>
   It also came as a rude shock to Fabrice Hamaide. He's president
of Talkway Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., firm that originally
specialized in offering Web-based access to the Usenet. Hamaide
tells me that Talkway has had to abandon its original business
model, because hardly anyone actually wants Usenet access. Hamaide
has learned to his sorrow that ``most people who get their first
computer or first Internet access don't even know that Usenet
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a new chapter in an old Internet story. A number of
once-popular on-line services have passed away or waned in
popularity, as newcomers, and even Net veterans, embrace simpler
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody uses Gopher to find information anymore. It was a
precursor of the World Wide Web, which works so much better that
all the old Gopher systems have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The old Archie system is still of value. It lets you search
servers worldwide for a particular file, such as a driver for an
obsolete piece of computer hardware. But nowadays, there are Web
resources that offer much the same service _ www.download.com comes
to mind. Archie is still useful for hunting hard-to-find resources,
but only hard-core geeks use it.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Usenet's turn, and that's hardly a surprise. The system
can be confusing and difficult for newbies to learn. Even though
browsers have built-in Usenet reading software, you must know a
little something about the Usenet to get everything set up. It's a
long way from mere point and click.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Usenet's notorious style, laced with flaming
insults, foul language, and a good deal of smut. Hamaide told me
that Talkway users were shocked to visit Beanie Baby bulletin
boards on Usenet, and find ads for pornography. Lots of home
computer users would flee, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to. As promised, Web entrepreneurs are
succeeding in establishing clean, attractive neighborhoods that are
attracting tenants who once would have hung out on Usenet. Look at
the loyal denizens of the eBay auction site bulletin board, or
Yahoo's popular personal finance boards.
</P>
<P>
   And new Web-based technologies offer even more impressive Usenet
alternatives. The Globe's own parent, the New York Times Co.,
operates a clever new service called Abuzz (www.abuzz.com), where
people can post questions and get answers from other members of the
service.
</P>
<P>
   I posted a question on Millard Fillmore's vice president. I got
an answer within hours, via e-mail. The answer is also published on
the Web, so others can read it, and stored in an archive, so future
visitors can look it up. Users grade can even grade each others'
responses.
</P>
<P>
   Abuzz is cool stuff, and newbies will flock to it, as they have
to other on-line communities. But what about the Usenet? Wonderful
as it is, the original on-line community is beginning to resemble a
charming 19th-century suburb, now surrounded by looming
skyscrapers.

THE BEST THING I EVER TASTED 
The Secret of Food 
By Sallie Tisdale 
Riverhead Books, 311 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sallie Tisdale was 9 when she set to work on a daunting project:
Her Northern California grade school class was studying Indians,
and she decided to make acorn meal. She spent hours collecting nuts
on a cold gray day, then crushing and shelling them, boiling them,
roasting (to remove tannins) _ and only then was she ready to grind
meal. Alone, with her father's hammer and her mother's rolling pin,
she made ``a chewy and terrible paste.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale reads a lot in this episode. First there is how let down
she was: ``I had a glimpse that day of how much more than a food a
food could be _ and of the disappointment waiting when inchoate
dreams don't come true.'' Acorn gathering must have been a
community effort, she concludes, and she pictures ``the secret
(that) was being kept from me, . . . the secret of men and women
and girls and boys murmuring, singing, laughing together while they
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   This thread of loneliness _ of being an outsider looking in _
runs through ``The Best Thing I Ever Tasted.'' ``I wore myself out,
that fall, grinding acorns in my mother's fluorescent-lit
kitchen,'' she writes, ``longing for a tribe of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Tisdale decides to sort out all manner of
acorn-gathering, food, and tribes. She delves into the medieval
kitchen, the classic French kitchen, Betty Crocker's test kitchens,
her childhood kitchen, her adult kitchen, and the kitchens of
today's harried moms and dieting public.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a little bleak. The ladies at Betty Crocker assure us
of this when they mention that they get calls about whether motor
oil is OK in a cake mix calling for oil. Or if someone should
follow high-altitude instructions if they're on the 10th floor of a
building.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans actually had to cook every night, wonders Tisdale,
would they survive?
</P>
<P>
   She brings extensive research to her study and has an eye for
the good bits (especially the drive-in years of her own childhood
and her flirtation with the counterculture _ ``the air was always
fragrant with virtue''). She's an easy, chatty writer who never
says anything the way you're expecting, which makes reading her a
pleasure. But there are actually two books here: vignettes from a
culinary memoir woven, not always with a tight weft, with a social
history of food. I wanted more Sallie and less history.
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale, author of five books including ``Talk Dirty to Me,'' is
sad about her life. She remembers afternoons with her mother, a
teacher, sinking exhausted into a living room chair, smoking a
cigarette before dinner. Her father, also a teacher, drank too much
and had a temper, which the slightest thing could set off. He was a
volunteer fireman and on the nights he got called away before
dinner, her mother packed the kids into the tan Chevy and set off
for the local A &AMP; W. You can almost hear the kids screaming
``hooray'' in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother's been gone for 10 years, and Tisdale still longs for
her Velveeta sandwiches with Miracle Whip on white bread, fried in
margarine. There are so many things she needs to ask her mother,
and of course it's understood that none of them involves recipe
cards. Her father isn't much of a dad, never was, Tisdale says, and
his kitchen is full of prepared, canned foods that he never seems
to touch as they collect dust year after year. ``I have a family,
but I long for a family at times,'' she writes, ``longing for a
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   We jump from a Thanksgiving at the silent father's, which she
and her sister and brother manage to salvage into a raucous good
time, to a discussion of medieval feasts and famine. Once you're
there, however _ aided by historians Massimo Montanari,
Jean-Francois Revel, and Fernand Braudel _ you get Tisdale's
distilled and very interesting version of the events. The rich ate
``high, flying, light food, like birds. The poor ate low, thick,
heavy food, earthy food, like root vegetables and dark grains.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdale never wags her finger, even at dieters, fickle eaters,
picky eaters, or her own children preferring to graze for dinner as
they stand and eat in the kitchen, or in their rooms, or on their
way out the door, dropping crumbs in their path.
</P>
<P>
   Americans' insatiable appetite for food has little to do with
ingredients, she decides. ``We lost the ability to tell the
difference between excess and sufficiency, between what is enough
and what is more than enough.'' At the Zen Buddhist retreats where
she goes now and eats in silence, dipping thick dark bread and
butter into a steaming bowl of kale soup, she is trying to learn
``what it means to have enough, and not want more.'' I hope she's
looking in the right place.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these late January days when the other presidential hopefuls
are criss-crossing the frozen farm fields of Iowa, one might expect
to find John McCain capitalizing on his decision to play
odd-man-out in Iowa by working single-mindedly to woo the voters of
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So it said something he challenges facing his insurgent
campaign that Thursday morning the Arizona senator was fielding
questions from the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, in Randolph,
Mass., rather than sitting in his usual leather chair on the
``Straight Talk Express'' at dawn, wending his way through the
first primary state.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Tuesday morning, in fact, McCain has been looking
beyond his make-or-break state of New Hampshire toward March 7, the
first multiprimary Tuesday. He has made the obligatory quadrennial
New York pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He
has won enthusiastic standing ovations in Hartford, Conn., and East
Greenwich, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone to fund-raiser after fund-raiser looking for money
to compete in the expensive media-markets of California, which also
votes March 7. And Thursday he mischievously stood in the snow
outside the Russian consulate to slam the New York Republican Party
for its efforts to remove him from the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that both Russia and New York state will have elections
in March, he said: ``In Russia, there will be more than one name on
the ballot. In New York, unless something happens, there will be
only one name on the ballot. It seems to me that history has been
turned on its head.'' (In fact, not just Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas but Steve Forbes will be on the ballot, too.)
</P>
<P>
   For about a week, the polls have shown McCain with a small lead
over Bush in New Hampshire. One recent poll even had him winning by
double-digits. But the week's schedule may have been less about
confidence than about the McCain campaign's awareness of one of the
senator's vulnerabilities as the last undecided New Hampshire
voters make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dearly want to take back the White House after eight
years of the Clinton presidency. That is why so much of the party
establishment rallied around Bush so early. So McCain has to
convince people who are leaning his way that he can really go the
distance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than once this week voters have asked some version of the
question posed Thursday by Dave Rogers, a 35-year-old lawyer who
asked McCain at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast whether Bush's
money means that in the end he will be ``virtually
insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke of his ``secret weapon'': the Internet. It had
helped him raise about $1.5 million, he said. It had drawn
volunteers to carry his petitions in Virginia. And he talked about
the boost that victory could bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a win in New Hampshire, a win from South Carolina,''
he said, ``if we win both of those we'll have significant momentum.
And by the way we have now enough money that we're up on television
in Michigan. We're going to be up in Virginia. We're going to be up
in the state of Washington. We do have sufficient funding to get us
through March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all of the candidate's endless energy and the
optimism on his bus, there are occasional reminders of how daunting
a task it will be for McCain to defeat Bush, who is still far ahead
in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that McCain might lack name recognition came at the
Marine Air Terminal in New York earlier this week when a police
escort led his campaign bus to a sleek jet with the name TRUMP
emblazoned across it in gold.
</P>
<P>
   As McCain exclaimed, ``Is that the one with the hot tub on it?''
his aides radioed to the police that they had the wrong candidate
and the wrong plane. The motorcade reversed course and headed to a
much smaller aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The past weeks have also showed the limits of a shoe-string
campaign and brought the first hints that despite McCain's pride in
his ability to ad lib, his habit of holding what amounts to an
18-hour-a-day news conference has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has relied on his unusual accessibility both to polish
his reputation for candor as well as to bring him free publicity to
combat Bush's daunting campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   But his winning personality has not always distracted from his
staff's inability to produce the kind of well-packaged and detailed
policy proposals that the Bush campaign puts forward.
</P>
<P>
   McCain opened himself up to Bush's recent attack on his tax plan
when he did not provide much detail on the $151 billion worth of
proposals to close corporate tax loopholes contained in his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the risks of McCain's own accessibility _ and the
reasons why most other candidates avoid it _ have become clearer as
he moves higher in the polls and more reporters squeeze into the
back of his bus and try to parse his every word at the very time
when he can least afford any gaffe or distraction.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he talked himself into a tangle when reporters pressed
him about his comment at a recent debate that he had served with
gay soldiers in the military, as he defended the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked why he had not reported them for removal from the
military and said he had not been obliged to, because he had not
witnessed a homosexual act. So next he was asked how he knew
someone was homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in what was supposed to be a plea for tolerance and
privacy for people, McCain spoke of ``behavior and attitudes'' and
said, ``I think that it's clear to some of us when some people have
that lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought protests from homosexual rights groups. Tuesday
morning he had a new answer and said he actually knew because one
of his fellow service members eventually told him he was homosexual
after he left the military.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wanted to, it would be impossible for McCain to scale
back access now. A little less access would become a very big
story. So his aides have become more vigilant about listening to
what he is saying to reporters and joining the conversation to
steer him from trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   When Thursday's freeflowing discussion, which went from New York
Republicans to Soviet military tactics in World War II, somehow
meandered its way onto a recent magazine article about a city
favored by homosexuals as a vacation spot, Mike Murphy, McCain's
senior strategist, suddenly piped up with, ``What about the
balanced budget amendment?''

INTERNAL REPORT DETAILS CORRUPTION WITHIN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., Mass., Minn., Mont., N.J., Ohio, Pa.)  (lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An internal union report lays out a picture of extensive
corruption in the nation's largest union of government employees,
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was made available by a union official eager
to have the federation take a tougher stance on corruption,
provides an unusual look at a major union's internal problems, and
describes corruption far beyond the well-known scandal at the
union's giant New York City affiliate, District Council 37.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the report describes corrupt activities by 35 union
officials, ranging from the $2.2 million known to have been
misappropriated by an official at District Council 37, to $96,000
stolen by the treasurer of Local 366 in Milwaukee to $51,000 taken
by a mid-level official at District Council 20 Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In dry language, it describes how union officials forged checks,
made unauthorized withdrawals from union accounts, siphoned union
dues into their personal accounts and used union credit cards for
personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a comprehensive list detailing the $4.6 million in
claims that the union made to its insurance company, seeking
reimbursement under a policy that covers fraud by union officials.
The report involved claims pending last November.
</P>
<P>
   Since many unions do not release information about internal
corruption, it remains unclear how the amount stolen compares with
what has happened at other unions, particularly those better known
for struggling with corruption. But the report offers an unusually
detailed portrait of internal problems at a union that is on the
rise in influence and power.
</P>
<P>
   The federation is the nation's second-largest union, a
1.4-million member organization that recently surpassed the
Teamsters in size, while remaining behind the National Education
Association. The union's president, Gerald McEntee, is chairman of
the AFL-CIO's political committee. He is one of labor's most
prominent backers of Vice President Al Gore, and he has overseen
more than $4 million in contributions to Democratic causes over the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the accuracy of the information contained in
the report, officials with the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, known as AFSCME, insisted that corruption
was no worse in their union than in many other unions. These
officials said that the report attested to the success of the
union's stepped-up up efforts to audit locals and uncover financial
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the claims arise out of New York's District
Council 37, with 56 union locals, in which two dozen officials have
been indicted. Other corruption claims involved locals in Indiana,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, something has happened to this union in the past five
years,'' said Carl Biers, executive director of the Association for
Union Democracy, a New York-based watchdog group. ``Things have
fallen apart in many, many regions. It wasn't always like this.
Clearly, whatever McEntee's strengths are, he has been turning a
blind eye to a lot of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Weinberg, the union's general counsel, said that
considering how many locals are in the parent union, it is not
extraordinary that there were some corruption problems in a dozen
or two locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AFSCME is cleaner than most unions,'' Weinberg said.
``When you add up all this union's locals and chapters, we have
between 7,000 and 8,000 subordinate bodies, and what you're looking
at is a pretty small number out of that universe.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, union-sponsored audits uncovered the thefts
detailed in the report. In addition, officials accused of theft
have usually been stripped of their jobs, and some have been
indicted. Several of the District Council 37 officials involved in
the claims have pleaded guilty to embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the union said that in 1998 the union, concerned
about spiraling corruption in New York City and elsewhere, adopted
tighter auditing procedures, requiring, for instance, annual audits
of any union local or district council with more than 2,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an aggressive auditing program,'' Weinberg said. ``We
have a zero-tolerance policy for wrongdoing. We believe we're more
aggressive to cleaning up than any other union. They may be a price
to pay for that. This type of information comes out. But we're
doing all the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts said that the corruption in the union, while
lamentable, did not approach levels seen decades ago in three
unions that were controlled or influenced by organized crime: the
Teamsters, the International Longshoremen's Association and the
Laborers International Union of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the state, county and municipal employees' union,
Edward A. McDonald, former director of the Organized Crime Strike
Force for Eastern New York, said: ``Any time you have multiple acts
of corruption in an international labor organization, it doesn't
look good, but if there are 3,000, 4,000 locals and you're talking
about three dozen people, it's certainly not a crime wave. But the
corruption that's reported pales in comparison to the racketeering
activities that characterized certain mob-dominated unions
throughout the '70s and '80s.''

THE REAL MEANING OF WILLIE HORTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who says his first priority as president would be
to ``promote racial understanding,'' now implies that Al Gore is a
race-baiter for having been the first to raise the Willie Horton
issue in the 1988 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore introduced him into the lexicon,'' Bradley said in a
Boston Herald interview last week. ``I wouldn't have used Willie
Horton. . . . It proved in the course of the campaign to
essentially be a poster child for racial insensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley didn't go into details. He didn't have to. After all
these years, we know we're supposed to react with a shudder when
the words ``Willie Horton'' are pronounced. We've been instructed
countless times that ``Willie Horton'' stands for the dirtiest kind
of dirty politics. For playing the race card to besmirch an
opponent's record. For launching attack ads with coded appeals to
bigotry. For trying to score points by demonizing an unpopular
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bradley drapes Wilie Horton around Gore's neck, we know
what he is hinting: that the vice president is not above exploiting
race in order to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, this is true. Gore's capacity for shamelessness
on racial issues is immense. He has suggested, for example, that
Americans who oppose racial preferences are not too far removed
from the racists who lynched a black man by dragging him from a
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   But to be fair, it is (itals)not(unitals) true that Gore ``used
Willie Horton'' in 1988. In a debate with that year's Democratic
presidential hopefuls, Gore noted that the Massachusetts practice
of letting first-degree murderers take weekend ``furloughs'' from
prison had freed some killers to commit new crimes. He asked
whether Governor Michael Dukakis intended to grant similar
furloughs to federal prisoners. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore made a legitimate criticism,'' said Dick Gephardt,
himself a presidential candidate in 1988, in a statement defending
Gore from Bradley's charge. ``He never used Horton's name or image
and never resorted to race-baiting.''
</P>
<P>
   But hold on. Why should using Horton's name (as George Bush did
in 1988) or showing his picture (as an unofficial Republican group
did in a pro-Bush TV spot) be deemed ``race-baiting''? Horton was a
vicious murderer who had been sentenced to life without parole yet
was repeatedly set loose by the Dukakis administration. On April 4,
1987, he was arrested in Maryland, where he had pistol-whipped and
knifed Clifford Barnes, then bound and gagged him and twice raped
his fiancee, Angela. It was a shocking scandal, hugely relevant at
a time of soaring crime rates. Horton's race had nothing to do with
it. So what if he was black? Bush and his supporters would have
pounced on the story with equal enthusiasm if he had been white.
</P>
<P>
   What made the Horton case so powerful was what it revealed about
Dukakis's values. That he was a believer in furloughing violent
criminals was only the start. There was also the fact that he
favored furloughs even for murderers who were supposed to spend the
rest of their lives behind bars. And the fact that his support
didn't waver even when it transpired that 10 other first-degree
murderers had escaped while on furlough. Dukakis kept insisting
that freeing killers was a good idea. ``Look, we're running a very
tough, strong, well-defined furlough program in this state,'' he
said in July 1987, ``which by and large has been very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dukakis ever uttered a word of sympathy for Clifford and
Angela Barnes, it is not recorded. When asked if he would be
willing to meet with them, he was disdainful. ``I don't see any
particular value in meeting with people. I'm satisfied we have the
kind of furlough policy we should have.'' He was no less cold when
a group of women whose children had been murdered pleaded with him
to stop freeing killers. ``If you don't like the system, you can
change it,'' Dukakis snapped.
</P>
<P>
   So they did. They collected 60,000 signatures to put a repeal of
furloughs on the November 1988 state ballot. When it became clear
that the measure would pass in a landslide, the state Massachusetts
Legislature decided not to wait. In April, it approved a ban on
furloughs for first-degree murderers. Dukakis _ who wanted the
issue out of the way as he campaigned for the White House _
reluctantly signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Bush campaign took it national, the Horton
scandal had been a major story in Massachusetts _ a story about
crime, about liberal penal ideology, about Dukakoid arrogance. What
it was not was a story about race. The notion that Bush used Horton
as a racial wedge is a shibboleth the Democrats invented to explain
away Dukakis's 40-state defeat. It wasn't Dukakis's left-wing ideas
that did him in, they insisted, it was Bush's subliminal racism.
Some people actually believe this.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably forgotten in talk of the Horton ``issue'' is the boy
Horton killed. Joey Fournier was just 17 on Oct. 26, 1974. He was
working alone at a Mobil station in Lawrence, Mass. when Horton and
two accomplices drove up, flashed knives, and demanded money. Joey
gave them everything he had _ $276.37. Horton then stabbed him 19
times and stuffed him in a trash can. When he was found, there were
only a few ounces of blood left in his body. His last words were,
``Please don't hurt me.''

<P>
   Weinberg said one explanation for the corruption was that the
union is highly decentralized, meaning its locals more financial
autonomy than most other unions. One episode of corruption
described in the report involves Robert Gordon, who was ousted from
his job as treasurer of the Milwaukee local representing 220 sewer
workers after a bookkeeper discovered that some money was missing.
A union audit reported that Gordon had apparently embezzled $96,000
by writing 208 checks to himself that were not approved and were
not used for union purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold ourselves to very high standards, not only in AFSCME,
but in Wisconsin,'' said Richard Abelson, a top official with the
union in Wisconsin. ``Our expectation is things like that don't
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's lawyer, Gerald Boyle, said his client was talking to
law-enforcement authorities and was working with union officials.
``We will take care of making sure that whatever needs to be put
back into the union's coffers is put back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Steven K. Grubb, the treasurer of a
municipal workers' local in Elkhart, Ind., wrote $13,500 in union
checks for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ard, executive director of the council representing all of
the union's 8,000 workers in Indiana, said Grubb had been removed
from office when the local's other officers uncovered the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anybody's personal money,'' she said. ``This money
belongs to the members of the union.'' She said that Grubb had
admitted to union officials that he siphoned off the money.
</P>
<P>
   Another insurance claim made by the union involved the
controller of a district council in New Jersey, who the union said
stole $42,700 by forging checks and making unauthorized
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Another claim involved the president of a Long Island, N.Y.,
chapter of the union, who the union said stole $14,870 from the
union. The official, Pasquale Ferraro, was removed by a union
judicial panel, although he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Twigg, an agent for the union's insurance company, St.
Paul Cos., said, ``I don't know if they have more claims than other
unions. I don't find them to be extraordinary or unextraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other unions, the Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees has what is known as a fidelity bond insurance
policy that provides for reimbursing the union if an official
commits dishonest acts that cause the union to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Twigg said his company examines all such claims to make sure
they are valid.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention several prominent episodes of
corruption not covered by the claims report. In 1998, for example,
the secretary-treasurer of the union's district council in
Washington pleaded guilty to embezzling $761,000, while the
council's finance director confessed to stealing $73,500.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the claims that St. Paul Cos. processed between last Oct. 1
and Nov. 22, the report said, the company paid off $605,000 of $2.6
million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason the company paid off less than the claimed
amount was that the union claimed $2.2 million for money it said
was stolen by Charles Hughes, the former president of a local in
District Council 37, representing New York City's school crossing
guards and cafeteria aides. The policy covering Hughes provided a
maximum of $500,000 in reimbursement to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Kedia, Hughes' lawyer, said Thursday that her client was
innocent of wrongdoing. The report added several new details about
the District Council 37 scandal, asserting, for example, that
several aides to Hughes had improperly written hundreds of
thousands of dollars in checks that ultimately benefited him
personally.

GM OFFICIAL GIVES SALES A ONCE-OVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Questions may be italicized) 
(af) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   For decades, General Motors' piece of the United States auto pie
has dwindled, to a level that in recent years has raised serious
concerns on Wall Street. Despite increased unit sales and a record
$5.6 billion profit in 1999, GM ended the year with a market share
of 29.45 percent, barely above the 29.40 percent of 1998, when a
two-month strike by the United Automobile Workers shut GM's
factories, and well below GM's 31.29 percent share in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Roy S. Roberts, 60, the GM group vice president for North
American vehicle sales, service and marketing, announced last
Tuesday that he would retire this spring. A week earlier, during
the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, he took time
to explain some of the factors crimping GM sales. Here are excerpts
from the conversation. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There has been a lot of criticism about any number of
executives _ yourself included _ because GM failed to meet its
market share goal of 30 percent this year. How do you respond?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm responsible for market share in the short run. Everybody
in this organization is responsible for market share long term.
You've got to have the right products, you've got to have launches
_ you've got to have a number of things right. So I'll take my
responsibility and there are other people that will take theirs
also, I'm convinced of that.
</P>
<P>
   We came out of a strike at the end of the year. Arithmetically,
we couldn't build enough products to keep up with demand. We'd
forecasted the industry to be 15.5 million sales last year. We
couldn't possibly keep up with it, so I don't cry about that. We
did the next best thing _ we got our mix right, we got our costs
right and we made a lot of money. We had the best year we've ever
had in our history in trucks. December was a good month. The
organization is starting to click. Now we've got some inventory we
didn't have. I'm not delusioned about this marketplace, or the fact
that anybody will give up any market share. We're going to earn it
back incrementally.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you see the coming year? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see pricing restraint. I see incentives staying about where
they are. When you start January and you miss your goal, you count
it 12 times. I have no intention of missing more.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you able to reach the 30 percent market share last month
only because you put up some pretty stiff incentives or do you see
a more secular turn in the market? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. All of the above. Certainly we wouldn't have put the
incentives in place if we didn't think it would give us a lift. By
the same token, the products are strong. So I'm really optimistic
about our chances. My head is not in the sand about this. The key
to our market share this year: full-sized pickups, full-sized sport
utility vehicles, some vans and medium-sized cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Don't dealers say GM has been ruffling their feathers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. If you go through this last year, when we've reorganized
the entire company, we've never seen anything like that in the
history of General Motors. We took 1,000 people out of the system.
Thirty-eight percent of the people in the field made a geographic
move. One hundred percent of the people in the field got a new job.
We had six different computer systems for all the different
divisions for order-to-delivery moving to one, and it didn't work
so well.
</P>
<P>
   The order-to-delivery system, VOMS, was an issue because it was
inflexible. We assumed that dealers were much more computer
literate than they were. We assumed that our people were more
computer literate than they were. We thought we had properly
trained everybody, and they were not that well trained. We had to
go back and redo all that, plus change the systems and the
processes with dealer input. And that's going to continue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Didn't dealers also have trouble getting enough cars and
trucks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Remember now, we came out of a strike in 1998 and our
inventories were depleted. We started launching our trucks _ three
plants. If you had sat two dealers down in a room and said, now,
you've got a problem with distribution, and let's sort this out _
how many Buicks do you want? No problem. How many Oldsmobiles? No
real problem. They wanted trucks. Hell, we were just building them.
If I've got 10 and you want 100, we've got a problem. So they all
said it is VOMS. It was not VOMS. No distribution system can handle
pent-up demand if you don't have the product. Now we've built back
up.

FAMILY MAN GORE HOPES TO DISTANCE CLINTON IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALPOLE, N.H. _ ``Where's Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question Al Gore hears often on his presidential campaign
stops, and Wednesday the question came from a a middle-aged man who
managed to squeeze into Burdick's cafe and chocolatier to get a
chance to meet the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's answer _ ``she's campaigning in a different part of New
Hampshire today'' _ is far less significant than the fact that the
voter asked about her whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   It means Gore is succeeding at conveying an underlying theme of
his campaign, that he is a family man, crazy in love with his wife
of 29 years and devoted to his four children.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gore is not President Clinton, and voters
needn't worry that a President Gore would drag the nation through a
tawdry, painful ordeal such as the Monica S. Lewinsky episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could get strong Gore support, not Clinton support'' in
this picturesque, conservative town in western New Hampshire, said
Snow D. Gray, a 43-year-old farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost respect for Clinton a long way back _ the behavior, the
unreliability, the lying,'' Gray said. ``Al Gore restores my
confidence. I see a man who is a true family man. He doesn't fake
it, like Clinton or Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore seeks the nomination and the presidency, he is faced
with an uncomfortable quandary: he wants to take credit for the
economic successes of the Clinton administration, while separating
himself from Clinton's personal scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rarely mentions Clinton by name in his speeches, instead
talking about the progress he says has been made ``in the last
seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   The people Gore does mention frequently are his family members.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president frequently mentions his wife in speeches and
makes a point of noting that the couple will celebrate their 30th
anniversary in May.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Gore, the Gores' 22-year-old daughter, also campaigns
alone or alongside her father. At an event in Indianola earlier
this week, Kristen received a bigger round of applause than the
candidate when the two were introduced to a crowd of college
students and other locals.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president frequently tells stories about his late
father, former Senator Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee, and how the
elder Gore was an enemy of President Richard Nixon and an early
critic of the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's mother, Pauline, is also a standard inclusion in Gore's
speeches. She grew up at a time when ``poor girls weren't supposed
to be able to dream,'' was a waitress who eventually attended
Vanderbilt University Law School, he explains.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's favorite anecdotes are about being a
grandfather, a tact that works well with the middle-aged audiences
he has been wooing in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   His standard joke on his new role _ that he's decided the best
thing to do with a grandchild is to ``give him whatever he wants,
and if it causes any problems, give him right back to his parents''
_ always draws a conspiratorial chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said Gore isn't trying to
distance himself from Clinton with his family talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of running for president is introducing yourself to
voters,'' Lehane said. ``They have to understand who you are, what
your background is.'' Gore's unrelenting reference to his family
``is just part of who he is,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is Clinton's vice president and may benefit or be
tainted by that association, some voters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any way to separate them,'' said Linda
Spokowski, 47. ``He's been the vice president for two terms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's still some Clinton baggage'' attached to Gore,
said Jeanne Zimmerman, a 44-year-old editor. ``Some would argue
that he should'' tie himself to Clinton, ``because Clinton had a
pretty good run...but I think Gore is unfortunately saddled with
some baggage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be quite dificult for him'' to distance himself
from Clinton, said Edwin Sielewicz, 69, after listening to Gore at
the Half Moon Cafe in Claremont, N.H. But the association could
work in Gore's favor, Sielewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton as a president has done a very excellent job,'' said
Sielewicz, a committed Gore voter. ``I can't say I like his social
arrangements.''

BABY BOOMERS DISCOVER GUILT-EDGED LUXURY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   We baby boomers have been criticized for most of our lives. Our
parents weren't thrilled with our hairstyles, our social protests
or our music. When we told our parents we were going to backpack
around Europe instead of getting a job right out of college, they
thought they had raised a generation of bums.
</P>
<P>
   But now that we have helped lead the nation to the greatest
economic expansion in history, we are being criticized again, this
time for enjoying it. Our houses are too gaudy, our cars too big,
and we think too much of ourselves instead of the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   We often respond to the criticism with defensiveness and guilt.
A recent article, ``The Narcissistic 90's,'' in The Trend Journal,
a newsletter, says concern over social issues has been replaced by
the need to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signs of a narcissistic society are seen on city streets and
manicured suburban roads filled with gas guzzling, carbon-monoxide
spewing four-wheel-drive vehicles,'' it says. ``Trophy houses and
starter mansions consume land and resources beyond realistic
housing needs.'' The article does not swipe at baby boomers
directly, but its target is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Although the premise is hard to deny, it is not the whole story.
Financial advisers say some baby boomers are extremely
uncomfortable with their wealth and go out of their way not to let
the money show.
</P>
<P>
   ``One client said he pays in taxes three times what his father
made in salary,'' said Kyra H. Morris, president of Morris
Financial Concepts, a financial planning firm in Charleston, S.C.
``Some are uncomfortable that they are making so much more than
their parents or the people they run around with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morris told of a wealthy client who asked her advice about
the wisdom of buying a fancy sports car. He thought it was too much
money. ``I told him, ``If I can afford a $35,000 sports car, you
can afford a $35,000 sports car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who requested that his name not be used, said he was
worried about his image. ``Yeah, I really went back and forth on
that,'' he said. ``I still do not drive the car to work. It sends
out the wrong message that I'm displaying too much wealth and
flaunting my success.''
</P>
<P>
   To some boomers, the issue is not just about flaunting, but
about the social responsibility that wealth brings. Considering
that this generation once took to the streets over social issues,
the pull some feel to put their money at the service of their
idealism is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bauer, 36, owner of Bauer International, a furniture
importer and designer in Charleston, said his wealth had allowed
him to donate to various groups. He and his wife, Dee Ann, also
helped teach a village in Ghana how to make decorative brass
hardware for his furniture. The village is now one of his
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trophy house and the 80-foot yacht are not what kicks me
in the tail,'' he said. ``My main focus is, I have an obligation to
give back to the community because of my success.''
</P>
<P>
   James E. Carroll, 45, a partner at Carroll Realty in Isle of
Palms, S.C., is active in several charities and said he tried not
to flaunt his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost embarrassed about the amount of money I make,'' he
said. ``I have an old Mercedes to drive clients around in and a
Dodge Caravan. I wanted to buy a sailboat, but I can't see spending
that kind of money. My whole goal is to save the money and not
throw it around.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly wealthy are the most likely to feel conflicting urges.
David B. Yeske of Yeske &AMP; Co., a financial planning firm in San
Francisco, said people who come into wealth suddenly often lack a
well-developed idea of what the money means in their lives. Is the
money a goal in itself or a tool for social good?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are incapable of acting responsibly because they
haven't developed the framework that relates them to their money in
some meaningful way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are least comfortable with their wealth are the
most likely to ponder broader goals. ``Those who are thinking more
clearly and deeply what this money means,'' he said, ``are usually
very conflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also the most likely to feel responsibility to the
community. ``That resonates with them,'' Yeske said. ``Not those
who just go out and act like it's Christmas and buy a new boat or a
Mercedes.'' &QL;

ARRESTS ALONG BORDER UP 24%
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A high number of people illegally crossing into the United
States along the Southwest border with Mexico, coupled with
aggressive patrolling, resulted in more than 88,000 immigration
apprehensions this month _ a 24 percent increase over the same time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, thousands of undocumented immigrants cross into
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California with hopes of finding
work. January, February and March are typically the busiest months
for the U.S. Border Patrol because hundreds of thousands of people
are returning to jobs in the United States after spending the
holidays in Mexico and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Many undocumented workers are attracted to jobs in construction,
meatpacking and the service industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have individuals who are trying to come back illegally,
and then you have those who are trying to come back for the first
time,'' said Mariela Melero, regional spokeswoman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncertain if we have reached our peak,'' Melero said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports indicate that from Jan. 1 to Jan. 17, a
total of 88,196 undocumented immigrants were apprehended while
crossing the Mexico border into Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
California, compared with 70,860 during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Del Rio sector _ a 205-mile stretch in Texas _ 10,421
undocumented immigrants have been apprehended this month, INS
public affairs officer Carlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS estimates that about 5 million undocumented immigrants
live in the United States. Last fiscal year, about 1.5 million
undocumented immigrants were apprehended along the Southwest
border. Between 400,000 and 500,000 were repeat offenders, while
about a million were believed to be new crossers, according to
Border Patrol officials.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel, a native of the Mexican state of Coahuila, returned this
month to his apartment in Irving, Texas, and a butcher's job, even
though he no longer has a permit to be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone returns to work. To complete the Mexican dream, which
is to try to build your house, to make money _ not be rich but to
not be poor,'' Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, many undocumented immigrants have been trying to
cross at more more remote areas because the Border Patrol has
stepped up policing in Texas through Operation Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Apprehensions in the McAllen sector, traditionally a popular
illegal crossing area along the Texas border, are down 13 percent
from last year, while apprehensions in El Paso and Del Rio are up
30 percent and 31 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The routes are changing all the time,'' said Doug Mosier,
public affairs officer for El Paso's Border Patrol sector. ``We are
just staying one step ahead of them by deploying resources to those
areas that are hardest hit.''
</P>
<P>
   El Paso sector agents are focusing on blocking illegal crossings
through the remote New Mexico communities of Demming, Columbus and
Lordsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are little communities,'' Mosier said. ``It's a very
remote, open area. It's inviting for those who are persistent in
finding avenues into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dominguez, president of the North Texas Hispanic advocacy
group Familias Unidas (Families United), said she worries that many
immigrants travel in inhumane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder to cross. Each time people
cross, they are risking their lives,'' Dominguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosier said this is shown by encounters with large groups being
smuggled into the United States through the sector around El Paso.
Last week, a group of about 100 was found near Columbus, N.M. A
group of 50 was found Wednesday in a cargo van along a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, agents from El Paso sector's Anti-Smuggling Unit found
44 undocumented immigrants from Mexico in a tractor-trailer headed
to Dallas. The rig had no food, water or restroom facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how dangerous this stuff can be,'' Mosier
said.

CHINA TO REQUIRE REAL NAMES ON BANK ACCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update; how the new rule will work, explained in 2nd
sentence of graf 9, has been clarified and is different than
previously thought.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The head of China's central bank Thursday described
renewed efforts to turn China's giant state banks and ailing state
enterprises into sound commercial operations, able to withstand the
competitive pressures that are certain to follow China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the People's Bank of China, Dai Xianglong, speaking
at his annual news conference, also pledged a smooth growth in the
money supply and a stable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   But what grabbed public attention was something Dai said in
passing, with words that underscored how deeply China's financial
culture has differed from that in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a plan to adopt a real-name system for bank deposits
this year,'' Dai said in answer to a question. This simple step _
requiring people to put their names on their bank accounts _ is
intended to aid tax collection and the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anyone can open a savings account under any name, no
identification required, with only the passbook needed for deposits
and withdrawals. While most individuals use their real names, the
use of false ones is common enough to have attracted the concern of
top officials.
</P>
<P>
   The practice seems to have roots in the aversion many Chinese
have to revealing their often-sizable nest eggs. People have also
been known to open accounts under aliases to conceal money from
spouses, Beijing residents said, while companies sometimes hide
revenue from tax collectors in phony-name accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the technique is mainly used by individuals concealing money
gained through bribery, embezzlement or the stripping of the assets
of state corporations, said a corporate lawyer in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that officials and state enterprise managers
with questionable income often open several bank accounts under
different names.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adoption of a real-name mechanism is consistent with
inter- national practice,'' Dai said. Un- der the new rule, he
said, money in an account under a false name will have to be
withdrawn and deposited under the depositor's actual name.
</P>
<P>
   Several Beijing residents said Thursday that they welcomed the
plan as a blow against rampant corruption. In private conversations
and on Internet sites, rumors have been traded about what may be
the largest corruption case in decades. It reportedly involves
scores of officials, mainly in the southeastern province of Fujian,
who are accused of smuggling billions of dollars worth of cars,
electronic goods, firearms and oil, avoiding large duties and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has not been announced here, but in recent
days the Reuters news agency and The Wall Street Journal, citing
anonymous sources, have reported that the wife of a member of the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo has been implicated, making the
case an especially embarrassing one for the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under detention, these sources say, is Lin Youfang, head of a
trading company of the Fujian provincial government. She is married
to Jia Qinglin, who is a member of the 22-man Politburo and is also
Beijing's Communist Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are said to have taken over two heavily guarded
hotels in the southern port city of Xiamen, where witnesses and
suspects are being questioned.

   ROCK RAPIDS, Iowa _ One of the oddest features of the
presidential selection system is the way the candidates troop to
Iowa and rave about corn alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The brew is not moonshine, but ethanol, a gasoline additive that
here in the heartland is as American as hogs.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Flier, a hefty and amiable 44-year-old who grows corn and
soybeans on his 650-acre farm near Rock Rapids, in the northwestern
corner of the state, has watched with a bit of satisfaction as the
presidential candidates have come to Iowa, seeking support in
Monday's caucuses, and solemnly declared their support for tax
breaks for ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think they just come out and pander to us,'' Flier
reflected as he sat in his kitchen. Then he cocked his head
thoughtfully and added, ``Of course, that may not be the worst
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethanol, introduced after the 1973-74 oil crisis, is hailed by
its supporters as a way to avoid dependence on foreign oil and
because it is clean-burning as a solution to air pollution
problems. But many experts have been unimpressed, and a 1997 study
by the General Accounting Office, a research arm of Congress,
concluded that tax breaks for ethanol had cost the Treasury $7.1
billion while having ``little effect'' on the environment or on
American energy independence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, though, ethanol plays a critical role in the
agricultural economy. So perhaps it is not surprising that every
candidate who is campaigning in Iowa supports tax breaks for
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is challenging Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, has even reversed
his long-standing opposition to ethanol, saying that farmers he has
talked to changed his mind. Only Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
denounced tax breaks for ethanol. But McCain is not campaigning in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's a good man and has a strong character, but what he
said about ethanol _ that probably cost him my vote,'' Flier said,
shaking his head. ``Now I'm leaning to Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethanol debate underscores the peculiar effects of the
nation's presidential selection system, for Iowa's role as the
first state to vote in the presidential nomination process is
perhaps one reason the ethanol tax break has survived for more than
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime support of former Sen. Bob Doleof Kansas, a
powerful farm-state politician and three-time Republican
presidential contender, coupled with aggressive lobbying by the
Archer Daniels Midland Co., a major producer of ethanol, also
buttressed the tax break for ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   But ethanol is less a partisan issue than a regional one; it is
supported by Democrats and Republicans alike in major farm states.
And wherever they are from, ambitious politicians who see
themselves as presidential timber may feel inclined to support
ethanol just to preserve the option of campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the logic of ethanol is more about politics than
environmental protection, the fact that Iowa has an early caucus
looms large,'' said Daniel Esty, director of the Center for
Environmental Law and Policy at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, ethanol seemed an answer to energy and
environmental problems alike. It is clean-burning and is produced
from home-grown corn, so the federal government instituted a series
of tax breaks to encourage ethanol production. Ethanol-blended
gasoline is taxed 5.4 cents less per gallon than pure gasoline, and
most experts agree that the ethanol industry would disappear
without that advantage.
</P>
<P>
   To critics, ethanol is a prime example of an infant industry
that never grows up to become competitive on its own. In addition,
ethanol evaporates more easily than gasoline, and so in the hot
summer months this can create its own pollution problems of ozone,
or smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethanol helps with some air pollution problems and worsens
others,'' said A. Blakeman Early, an environmental consultant with
the American Lung Association in Washington. ``You begin to wonder
whether it's really worth it to have a subsidy when in some
circumstances it can make air pollution worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While making it clear that he did not condemn ethanol, Early
said that if the goal was to improve air quality, one might
accomplish more by using the money in other ways.

 ROCK RAPIDS, Iowa: other ways. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics also often note that it takes a tremendous amount of
energy just to produce ethanol _ plowing the fields, planting the
seeds, harvesting the corn, trucking it _ and some even suggest,
without much evidence, that ethanol may take more energy to produce
than it supplies. Moreover, almost half of the capacity to produce
ethanol is owned by Archer Daniels Midland, the huge agricultural
conglomerate that is a heavy campaign contributor to Republicans
and Democrats alike. Some critics see the ethanol program as
returning a favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of a corporate welfare-style
giveaway,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, a
public affairs lobbying organization.
</P>
<P>
   So it might meet seem odd that the presidential candidates would
be rushing around Iowa praising tax breaks for an alcohol fuel that
does not much impress many experts. But that is to miss the point,
because regardless of whether ethanol is a great fuel for cars, it
certainly works wonders in Iowa campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that everybody agrees on is that the ethanol tax
break raises corn prices, and in the Midwest, where family farms
are struggling to survive desperately low prices for their
products, that counts for a lot. Farming has been left behind in
the great economic expansion of the Clinton administration; in Iowa
alone, thousands of farmers have been forced out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The toll hangs heavy over entire rural communities as farmers
delay purchases and their families wonder which would be worse: for
the children to pack up and leave the farm or to stay on and risk
impoverishment. By some calculations, without ethanol, corn prices
would be 20 percent lower than they already are.
</P>
<P>
   Flier recalls that when he began farming in 1975, he was getting
$2.40 a bushel for his corn. This year the price was about $1.40.
Yet he said the same tractor that he bought in 1975 for $18,000
would now cost $75,000. And his other costs have also increased
enormously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have ethanol, that would take a lot of our
earnings away,'' Flier said. ``Ethanol allows us to maintain our
standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Breuker, a farm manager here in Rock Rapids, put it more
starkly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start peeling off another 20 or 30 cents a bushel out of
farm incomes,'' Breuker said, ``and there'd be a whole lot of hurt
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers, he added, would be driven to bankruptcy, and the
entire agricultural economy would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers also dispute many of the points made by ethanol's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Guthmiller, executive director of the American Coalition
for Ethanol, says the tax break was deserved because ethanol did
not entail the cleanup costs of gasoline pollution and did not
involve the expense of maintaining the military capacity abroad to
ensure steady supplies of imported petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Both the farmers and the ethanol industry view the Iowa campaign
period as a rare opportunity to make their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our work is educating people,'' Guthmiller said, ``and
we can do that because whether they're Democrats or Republicans,
they need to come through Iowa. And that's our chance.''

NERVOUS ABOUT A STOCK BUBBLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Please note subslug for BIZ-PROFILE-SYKES) 
(af) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Befuddled by the stock market? Don't understand why shares of
unprofitable Internet companies are soaring ever higher while
shares of old economy titans like General Motors go begging?
</P>
<P>
   You have some good company. The man who managed the United
States economy for most of the 1980s is as nervous about a bubble
as you are.
</P>
<P>
   Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman,
acknowledged as much earlier this month at his office at
Rockefeller Center. ``My God, everybody in the world owns stock in
the dot-coms except me,'' Volcker said, a wry smile creasing his
face. ``I am just behind the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wall Street, which looks always ahead, never behind,
Volcker, age 72, might seem a part of history. His fourth-floor
corner office, overlooking the Rockefeller Center skating rink and
featuring a museum's worth of knickknacks and testimonials, hardly
dispels that impression.
</P>
<P>
   But during a 90-minute discussion of the economy, the declining
attractiveness of public service, and his recent work heading a
commission on Swiss banks and the Holocaust, it became clear that
for Volcker, retirement does not mean full-time fly-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that Volcker helped pave the way for the
expansion of the 1980s _ and today _ by breaking the double-digit
inflation that in 1979 and 1980 threatened to stifle the United
States economy. On the day in 1987 that Volcker announced he would
step down as Fed chairman, bonds suffered one of their biggest
losses ever on fears that his successor (none other than Alan
Greenspan) would not fight inflation as well as Volcker had.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Volcker has successfully adopted the attitude that
former Federal Reserve chairmen, like former presidents, should be
seen but not heard, especially on matters of policy. He worked as
chairman of Wolfensohn &AMP; Co., a boutique New York investment bank,
until 1996, when it was acquired by Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Volcker made news once again, when an international
commission he headed announced the results of its audit of Swiss
banks that accepted deposits from Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report found that the banks threw up
unnecessary obstacles to victims and families trying to claim their
assets. But it exonerated the banks of charges that they
systematically destroyed records to keep the victims' assets for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Volcker agreed to lead the commission only because of an appeal
from an old friend who happened to head the Swiss National Bank.
Crafting the report, which was praised by both the banks and Jewish
organizations that brought the issue to light three years ago, was
often frustrating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few weeks before the report was due to come out, I thought
we'd never get a consensus, and I was prepared to put it out
whether we had a consensus or not,'' he said. But once the banks
and Jewish groups recognized that he was determined to issue the
report with or without their agreement, they decided to participate
to ensure their views would be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The commission discovered 54,000 accounts of possible Holocaust
victims that could be worth as much as $1.3 billion. His auditors,
Volcker said, ``found as close an approximation to the truth as
it's possible to find after all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   With the report released, Volcker has moved on to smaller
projects, including advising on the bailout of Japan's Long-Term
Credit Bank. He has also departed from his tradition of public
nonpartisanship to support Bill Bradley for president. Volcker
explained that because he had pushed Bradley to run, he felt he
should openly commit to the Bradley campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Volcker, one of a generation of public servants who came
to Washington after World War II and viewed working for the federal
government as the highest calling, admitted that even he has grown
cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud of being in government all my life,'' he said.
But now, ``public service at almost all levels has come into
various disrepute. You don't get the people in government that you
should.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't know the rewards of public service that they are
missing, he said. Even successful corporate leaders ``don't have
the same feeling of challenge and satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 6-foot-7 Volcker, who remains a commanding

   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore opened his final,
four-day push for the Iowa vote at a rally here Thursday by
countering Bill Bradley's attempts to cast him as the candidate of
entrenched power, but he began his day with a private meeting with
20 gay and lesbian leaders at his residence in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Stonewall Democratic Federation, which
has about 10,000 members across the country, said the vice
president had invited them last month to discuss civil rights and
other policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley, his lone rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, have been fiercely competing for the gay vote, which
accounts for about 9 percent of the primary vote in New York and
California. Both states vote March 7. Bradley is to meet with the
Stonewall leaders in February.
</P>
<P>
   The Stonewall group was formed two years ago principally at the
urging of Rep. Barney Frank, an openly gay Democrat from
Massachusetts, to counter the efforts of the more visible Log Cabin
Republicans, another gay group.
</P>
<P>
   The Stonewall Democrats, like other major gay groups, have yet
to endorse a candidate for president. But the Gore campaign is
working hard to capture the endorsement and plans to release soon
an extensive list of endorsements from gays and lesbians, mainly in
New York and California.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The active competition for the gay vote on the Democratic side
is not being replicated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Republican National Committee said Thursday it was
paying for a television commercial to begin Monday to showcase
Gore's comments about gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley support allowing gays to serve openly in
the military, but Gore went a step further and said he would
require his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to support such
a policy. A few days later, he backpedaled on that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said it is that reversal, not Gore's support for
gays in the military, that they want to highlight. Jim Nicholson,
chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Gore was
``pandering to the far left while at the same time trying to hide
from the general public the fact that he would compromise U.S.
security to socially engineer the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on the campaign trail, Gore held a rally at Iowa
Western Community College in Council Bluffs. With Gore, who has the
backing of organized labor, leading in the polls here, Bradley had
said that Iowa was a state ``that rewards entrenched power.'' Gore
tried to turn that statement to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting for people is what the Iowa caucuses is all about,''
Gore growled to a crowd of about 300 people. ``Fighting to reduce
the high cost of pharmaceuticals, fighting to save Medicare, that's
not entrenched power, that is fighting for people! Fighting to save
the family farm is not entrenched power, that's about fighting for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting down the minutes to the Monday night caucuses, the
first voting in the nation, Gore added, ``This fight is going to
take place right here in Iowa 99 hours and seven minutes from
now.''

more than $1.3 million on television ads, and shuttled more than
400 volunteers here to help get out the vote. In addition, Bradley
stumped in Iowa about 75 days last year, nearly double the number
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But confronted by weeks of polls showing that Bradley's early
surge has stalled _ he trails Gore by at least 20 points in most
surveys _ some of the former senator's aides, speaking out for the
first time in interviews, said Gore had waged a more energetic
drive than they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lucas, a veteran labor organizer who runs the Bradley
operation in Iowa, acknowledged that when he arrived in the state
last summer, and his candidate was coming on strong, he had higher
expectations for victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In July, I just didn't know what I know now,'' Lucas said,
explaining how onerous it was to organize in this state,
particularly against a sitting vice president who has the unions on
his side. While he is proud of what his organization has
accomplished against Gore's onslaught, Lucas said he might have
been lulled into a sense of optimism because early on the Gore
campaign did not seem focused on the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would be easy,'' Lucas said. ``But I
thought if these guys could stay asleep at the switch, I could
surprise them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said the Bradley campaign suffered last fall when Gore
retooled his campaign, installed Donna Brazile as his national
campaign manager and opened seven weeks of attacks _ which Bradley
shrugged off. ``It was a very rough seven weeks here,'' he said.
``Donna really made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas said he did not know if firing back would have worked
either. ``If we had done that, we would not have attracted all the
people we attracted,'' he said. ``It's a trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bradley's aides said there had been disagreements
among his top staff about whether he should have responded more
fiercely to Gore. Some advisers said that they had pressed Bradley
to be more assertive in debates, but that he resisted because he
felt it would turn off voters, and violate his pledge to run a
positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who has campaigned here for
Bradley for months and knows the state well, said he would have
favored a more aggressive strategy. ``Would my approach be
different?'' he asked. ``Yes. When you're five-five and a half, I'm
always looking for the scrappy approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he, too, would counsel to fire back at Gore
sooner, Lucas said: ``I may think some things are not such a good
idea. But this is the way Bill wants to run it. I sure hope Bradley
was right to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wellstone dismissed those supporters who questioned whether
Bradley should have invested so much into Iowa. ``When you've got a
two-person race, I don't think you can walk away from Iowa. You're
walking away from farms and walking away from the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradley, opening a four-day bus tour Thursday through
central and eastern Iowa, said Gore's attacks might have hurt him.
``Most voters don't understand, yes, there were two negative ads
run; to a certain extent voters might have been swayed by that,''
he said in Des Moines. ``But we're countering that now. And I think
we're making up our distance very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley came close to committing a political faux pas _
insulting the Iowa caucus system _ by saying, ``We knew all along
that Iowa is a state that rewards entrenched power.'' He was
referring to how caucuses tend to favor incumbents with potent
organizations, like the one backing Gore. Asked if he meant to
dismiss the system, Bradley said, ``Absolutely not'' adding, ``I
respect the people of Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have warned against a repetition of 1988, when
their nominee, Michael Dukakis, failed to respond to George Bush's
assaults, and lost the election.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Aronoff, a senior Bradley policy adviser, explained the
predicament, saying: ``You're damned if you do and damned if you
don't. If you don't respond, they say you are letting attacks
stand. When you do, they say you are going negative.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beyond his reluctance to attack, some Democrats have questioned
the effectiveness of Bradley's organization in Iowa. Late this
summer, Rob Tully, the state party chairman, said Bradley could win
the caucuses. Now he said it was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say this,'' Tully said. ``But I've got to be
truthful. I'm not sure the campaign has caught on. A caucus
organization is a different animal than some people who may have
been brought in understood.'' He added, ``Bradley did everything he
was supposed to do. The campaign just didn't follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bradley's advisers also questioned why he has begun
running a commercial that is a tribute from Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., when the two other senators who back him here _
Wellstone and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. _ are far better known in Iowa and
have demeanors that may be more suited to the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I have anything against Moynihan,'' said state Sen.
John Kibbie, one of Bradley's most prominent backers in the state,
``but Wellstone or Bob Kerrey would have been more effective in
Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some campaign officials insisted Moynihan was revered in
Iowa as an elder statesman, and would also appeal to elderly
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moynihan is pretty well known and very highly regarded, and
certainly regarded on the issue of trust and character,'' said Eric
Hauser, Bradley's press secretary. ``We didn't go into it
blindly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Bradley campaign also began running a commercial
featuring Kerrey.

FCC REVISES RULES ON HIRING OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday
adopted new rules intended to increase job opportunities for
minorities and women in the broadcasting industry, replacing
previous guidelines that a federal appeals court said had
unconstitutionally imposed quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, adopted by a vote of 4-1, are a carefully
fashioned effort by the commission and especially its chairman,
William Kennard, to retain some kind of pressure on the
broadcasting industry to seek members of minorities and women as
job applicants without violating the court's 1998 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   If the new approach withstands court challenges that it may
produce, it could provide a model for other government agencies and
public institutions to introduce affirmative action programs that
will not run afoul of federal courts, which have been generally
hostile to anything that smacks of forcing employers to hire
minorities and women in specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules explicitly state that a company's record in hiring
women and minorities is not to be used as a factor in deciding
whether to renew a broadcaster's license. Under the old rules, if a
broadcaster failed to hire women and minorities at less than half
of their percentage of the local population, it would touch off a
review of their recruitment practices.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting executives believed the old rules made a company's
record in hiring minorities and women a factor in getting a license
renewed, although commission officials have disputed that
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules roughly fit what has sometimes been called the
original concept of affirmative action: reaching out broadly to
advertise jobs and make them available to minorities and women but
without any requirement that they actually succeed in getting hired
or promoted in any specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The rules require broadcasters to disseminate news about job
openings to any group that asks to be notified. They also ask
broadcasters to select from a menu of other methods to publicize
job opportunities, such as by sending representatives to job fairs
or maintaining internship programs for minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   If a broadcaster ``believes it can accomplish broad outreach
without these recruiting measures,'' the commission said in a
statement, it can work out its own outreach program.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, who conducted Thursday's commission meeting, said it
was particularly appropriate to adopt the rules on the same week as
Martin Luther King Jr. Day. He said the rules were necessary in a
society that had not yet reached King's dream of a colorblind
society, which he said was evident by the current debate over ``the
virtual absence of minorities in prime time television.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry M. Rivera, a former commission member who is now chairman
of the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council, a lobby
group, said on Thursday that the promulgation of the new rules was
especially laudable since it showed that Kennard did not simply
acquiesce in the face of the court ruling. Instead, Rivera said,
Kennard and the commission have fought back with a new approach to
pressing broadcasters to widen their employment pool.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters, the powerful trade
association and lobby that represents most of the nation's 12,615
radio broadcasters and 1,616 television broadcasters, has long
chafed at the commission's equal opportunity policies, particularly
the requirement for keeping detailed records of a license holder's
hiring history.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the broadcasters association,
said on Thursday that its lawyers would study the new proposal ``in
the hope that this won't increase the already considerable
paperwork burdens on broadcasters.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules require that license holders continue to file
reports on both their efforts to publicize job openings as well as
how many applicants they get for each position. But the rules say
that the records will be kept by the commission ``only to monitor
industry employment trends and prepare reports to Congress.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue in the broadcasting industry began in April 1998, when
a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled that the equal employment policies of
the commission, some of which dated to 1969, were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the program amounted to a ``soft quota,'' because
hiring records were scrutinized and, if broadcasters had been
hiring minorities or women at a level less than 50 percent of the
local population, they came under special scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The full appeals court upheld the ruling by a 6-to-4 vote, with
the judges dividing largely along political lines; those who were
appointed by Democratic presidents dissented in a ruling supported
by Republican appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Both the administration and lawyers for civil rights groups then
made a tactical decision not to ask the Supreme Court to consider
the case, fearing that the justices might give the ruling even more
force.

 &HT;    Baseball's step won't restore balance
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, can we expect to see the Expos vs. the Brewers in
the National League Championship Series some year soon? Or,
perhaps, the Pirates vs. the Royals in the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   Did Major League Baseball really take the first step toward
parity, toward a level playing field for all teams, with
Wednesday's unanimous resolution in Phoenix requesting that
commissioner Bud Selig ``take such action as he deems appropriate
to ensure ... long-term competitive balance''?
</P>
<P>
   Well.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not get carried away.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, for the moment, that Selig will find various ways to
benefit the downtrodden, small-market teams. Let's say he gives
them extra amateur draft picks or institutes a preseason waiver
draft in which the weak teams can pluck a player from the strong
teams _ just two ideas kicked around at the Phoenix meetings. Let's
say he eventually gets the Players Association to go along with a
new system of revenue-sharing in which the big-market teams would
get far less of the national-TV money than the small-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   Do such things, and Selig would be making progress. He'd be
helping the Pirates, Expos, Royals, Twins, et al. But, alas, it
would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish the desired end, which is an industry in which
every team has a chance to compete on the field, revenue-sharing
would have to be combined with some sort of salary cap, as in the
NFL and NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: No matter how Selig might redistribute the sport's
shared revenue _ the national TV money, the Internet money, etc. _
the big-market teams always will have more in their coffers than
the small-market teams. That is because of their superior streams
of locally produced revenue, which would not be subject to sharing.
In other words, the Yankees always will be in position to spend
much more on players than the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Only a cap, combined with revenue-sharing, can assure that all
teams spend roughly the same amount on players _ that all teams
have a roughly equal chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, of course, is no closer than ever to having a cap.
That can only be achieved in collective bargaining, and the chances
are slim and none. (I'd bet on ``none.'') So this week's move by
the owners is not a panacea. But it is a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anyone to think we are putting our heads in the
sand,'' Braves president Stan Kasten said from Phoenix on Thursday.
``We don't like the fact that the same six or eight teams make the
postseason every year and the fact that when we leave spring
training 20 teams know they won't be (in the playoffs). It's a
concern to everybody, and I say that as one of those six or eight
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the eight playoff teams were among the top 10 teams
in payroll size; only once in the past five years has a team with a
bottom-half payroll made the postseason. By this week, the owners
had seen enough of the trend to restore the
``best-interests-of-baseball'' powers taken from the commissioner's
office in January 1994 and to give Selig unprecedented power in
dealing with revenue-sharing. Basically, it'll be his call, subject
to union approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these changes, there's no question there is awesome power
there,'' Selig said. ``But these people (the owners) know me. They
know I will use it judiciously.... But they also know I'll proceed
with fierce determination.''
</P>
<P>
   And they know that Selig knows what happens to commissioners who
use their power in ways that those who gave it do not approve. As
Kasten put it: ``Like the CEO of any company, he has to do things
that promote continued confidence in him staying in his job.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that this week's empowerment of Selig is a
strong statement about the seriousness of the competitive-imbalance
problem _ and a desperate plea for someone to do something about
it.

 &HT;    Old guard's taking trip to new turf
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ In 17 years of playing pro football, the
closest Bruce Matthews has come to the Super Bowl was lying on his
couch watching older brother Clay play linebacker for Cleveland in
the 1986 AFC Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl was scheduled for Pasadena, one town over from
where Matthews then lived. He was all set to go.
</P>
<P>
   Along came ``The Drive.'' A year later, it was ``The Fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They got sidetracked a little bit in those two Denver games,''
Matthews said charitably.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's his turn to try. Finally. The player who personifies
the term ``old guard'' for the Titans will experience his first AFC
Championship Game on Sunday against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long having watched other teams play, you kind of
hardened yourself to what it might mean to play in a game like
this,'' said Matthews, 38, who will start at left guard. ``I told
myself, `It's no big deal.' But now that we're in it, it's pretty
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He grinned. ``And it's a shame I had to wait this long. We
probably shouldn't have messed around 16 prior years.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews has spent his whole career with the Houston
Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise and has been around so long that
young teammates are stunned to learn he played college football
with coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched the team develop,'' Matthews said. ``We were
horrible back in '94. We were 2-14 and we knew it was going to be a
rebuilding thing. I guess I could have had the opportunity to go
other places, but it was always in my heart to stay here and see it
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if we ever did make it, it would be that much
sweeter, and it really has been this year. ... But by no means are
we satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, no one paid much attention to Matthews. Of
course, as an offensive lineman, he didn't really have any stats.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthews is the NFL's reigning Iron Man, with 264 games,
more than any active player except kickers Gary Anderson of
Minnesota (278) and Morten Andersen of the Falcons (276). Matthews
has the record for offensive linemen and is No. 7 all-time. He has:
</P>
<P>
   _ Played in 200 consecutive games, starting 197 of them. Both
are NFL records for active players. His streak would be even longer
if not for a contract holdout at the start of the 1987 season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blocked for 26 different running backs and 15 different
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Played in 38 different stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   _ Made 12 Pro Bowls _ tied with Jerry Rice and one fewer than
Reggie White.
</P>
<P>
   _ Been part of eight 1,000-yard rushing seasons and seven
3,000-yard passing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And now it all boils down to one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get Bruce his ring,'' said running back Eddie
George, who follows the 6-foot-5, 305-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews got the game ball after the Titans defeated the
Indianapolis Colts 19-16 last Sunday. He was touched by the
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   However, the father of six is uncomfortable talking about
himself. He said he'd rather talk about George, quarterback Steve
McNair, or even a holding penalty or a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing offensive line because you get to be part of a
bigger thing,'' Matthews said. ``You can kind of go about your
business. Usually when you go out in a community, the only reason
you stand out is you're a lot bigger than everyone else. I like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when pressed, he'll speculate on why he's been able to
take the abuse heaped on him during 200 consecutive games on the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, he ventured, it's ``my great diet that I'm on with
cheeseburgers and Diet Coke, my great offseason workout plan, and
just God has given me a body that can take this pounding. I'm
humbled that I've been able to play this long.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday, Matthews will need 13 games to pass brother Clay,
who played for Cleveland (1978-93) and Atlanta (1994-96). George
Blanda has the all-time record of 340 from 1949-75.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews has two years left on his current contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother's (record is) another season away,'' said Matthews,
whose father, Clay Sr., played linebacker for the 49ers (1950,
1953-55). ``Part of me wants him to have it. Part of me's selfish
and I wouldn't mind having it. ... I'm not looking to retire
anytime soon, but I also realize that it's a lot closer than it
used to be.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Bill Bradley does not have advisers in the
traditional sense _ and does not need any, according to a number of
those who are acting, as the candidate's friend Dan Okimoto put it,
``more as a sounding board, raising doubts here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His mastery obviates the need for close policy advisers,''
said Okimoto, a college buddy, now a professor of international
relations at Stanford, and someone with whom Bradley discusses a
number of matters, including foreign policy. ``There is no such
structure in place on foreign policy or any other issue. The
candidate is in charge of tone, direction, vision and those around
him provide support. Both in a political sense and on policy, Bill
Bradley is his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But after several perceived missteps recently _ a somewhat
confused response during an agriculture debate here, and especially
the decision to spend so much time in Iowa, where his campaign
appears to be lagging, instead of concentrating on New Hampshire,
where he's in a tight race _ even some supporters say the holes in
the campaign are starting to show.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Joe Trippi, an unaligned Democratic consultant who ran Walter
Mondale's Iowa campaign in 1984 and has had generally positive
things to say about Bradley's campaign over the last year, said,
``He really is running his campaign the way he wants to run it, and
I'm not sure he's taking any advice. That's always a bad sign. The
move to Iowa definitely was a risky gambit and I don't think I
would have advised it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, it is only after next Monday's caucuses that
``we'll see if Iowa was a big mistake _ or brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of Bradley's sounding boards, his wife, Ernestine
Schlant, a professor of comparative literature, has a theory about
politics that might apply: Any candidate's greatest asset almost
always turns out to be his greatest liability as well, she said in
an interview last summer, citing Bill Clinton and his personal
warmth and empathy as an example.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While both Bradley's broad knowledge and his determination to
``run a different kind of campaign,'' as he likes to say, have been
keys to his appeal, they have also left him vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore
and the Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, have
been criticized for relying too much on consultants of all sorts.
But those in opposing camps _ advisers themselves, of course, with
a clear interest in the perceived importance of their work _ insist
that the lack of a more formal advisory structure in the Bradley
campaign is a problem. And they say a truly smart candidate is
smart enough to know he needs help.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really arrogant and characteristically Bradley,'' said a
Bush adviser. ``The truth is that politics is a team sport. The
quarterback gets the credit, but you still need a defensive line,
and I haven't seen that in Bradley's camp, which is a huge
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics have called Bradley glacially slow in responding to
attacks, particularly on his health care plan, leaving Gore's
assertion that it would end up hurting poor people virtually
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   And because he chose to disarm unilaterally, when he finally did
fight back, for example by criticizing Gore's complicated history
with tobacco companies, what may have been perfectly legitimate
questions were seen as out of bounds because he had set himself up
as a candidate who was above that kind of give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   On those and other campaign decisions, it is not that Bradley
listens to no one, but that , on the contrary, he listens to a
great number of people _ and then makes the important calls
himself. It was Bradley who chose child poverty, health care, race
relations and gun control as the central issues in his campaign.
And who, to a surprising degree, mapped out the plans he wanted to
see put in place.
</P>
<P>
   His staff insists that he does not micromanage, and is happy to
leave mechanical, logistical details like booking planes and
deciding which field directors go where to others. Even in this,
though, ``he does like to be keep informed, and will tell us if
we're going the wrong direction,'' said his campaign chairman,
Douglas Berman.
</P>
<P>
   And the list of ways Bradley is in control of his campaign is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Back when nobody but Bradley, Berman and a couple of other
Bradley die-hards thought it was possible to raise even a fraction
of the money the campaign has raised, the senator showed how it
could be done, by pulling in people who had not been politically
active before.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Aronoff, his point person on policy, said that he had
been refining ideas for a health care plan for years and reached
out to hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   '`I don't think you're going to see every decision coming back
through him, but on health care _ the cornerstone _ or child
poverty, he takes an active interest. Or improving race relations.
Or key economic and foreign policy decisions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Cutler, a Harvard economics professor considered one of
the chief architects of his health care plan, said, ``I don't
consider myself to be an incredibly important adviser.'' Told that
nobody else seemed to, either, he said, ``I had a sneaking
suspicion that was true.
</P>
<P>
   He's a very intelligent man, so he didn't need the getting up to
speed that a lot of candidates need.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is so loose, he added, that ``I don't think I've
ever actually met him. And I don't know if he's ever made a formal
decision that, `Oh, now you're x adviser.' I found him very
impressive _ and I don't know him well, so it's kind of the same
way I find the pope impressive _ but he listens to a lot of
voices.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Al Garber, a Stanford professor who was one of those ``putting
the details together'' for the basic plan that Bradley wanted said
the most surprising part of the process was the lack of
``dissension'' among those discussing the options. ``Everyone liked
Bill's idea, and it really is his plan,'' he said. ``He
incorporated diverse views and listened to a lot of people, but
within the campaign there was tremendous consensus, and that
probably reflects Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   On political strategy, too, he is also the final arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   And his staff includes a number of people who have been with him
so long that they often reflect the way he thinks. His campaign
chairman, Berman, who met Bradley when he was an adoring high
school senior, on the morning after the Knicks won an NBA
championship, has been with him since his first Senate campaign in
1977. His finance director, Rick Wright, played basketball with him
at Princeton 35 years ago. Ms. Aronoff was his longtime chief of
staff in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, a friend and former aide to Bradley says, ``It would
only be a slight hyperbole to say Doug is the first person he calls
in the morning and the last one he talks to at night. On political
strategy, it's Doug and Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Berman describes his job this way: ``If I have a role,'' he
said, ``it's being clear and helping people understand the values
that course through the organization as a reflection of Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the proof that Bradley was not too much of a one-man
show was in the campaign's organizing successes: `We filed in 31 of
31 districts in New York, he was first to file in Oklahoma, we
raised twice as much money as the vice president in the fourth
quarter, and more people in California signed up to be delegates
for Bill Bradley than the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   And Berman suggested that the campaign had, in fact, taken some
recent hits on purpose. When asked about Bradley's confused
response to a question about whether he had voted against flood
relief while in the Senate _ in fact, he had voted for the bill,
but against an amendment, Berman said, ``We never talk about
specific decisions. But Bradley has said, `I want to run a campaign
as an extension of the way I want to govern, to restore trust and
bring back civility.' And if you say that, you have to operate that
way. It's not that at times there's not the impulse to operate at a
different level. But those who elevate tactics, we disagree with.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, of course, the Bradley campaign's position that
it is above all that is itself a tactic. Whatever advice Bradley
does get is purposely underplayed by the campaign, which does not
want to be seen as doing much of anything in the usual way.
``Advisers,'' Berman said, ``are never the story.''
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Ravitch, who has reviewed some ideas about housing
and urban development with members of Bradley's staff, suggested
that the status of some of them was still a bit of a mystery _ even
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd you get my name?'' Ravitch asked. Told he was
considered someone Bradley listens to, he said, ``Glad to hear
it.''

<P>
   HAJVALI, Yugoslavia _ A construction magnate at the center of a
kickback scandal involving former President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
and his family, acknowledged Thursday that he helped supply the
family with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the executive, Beghjet Pacolli, whose company had major
construction contracts in Russia in the 1990s, including renovating
the Kremlin, said he gave only an international financial guarantee
for the Russian bank that issued the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli, a Kosovo Albanian, insisted that the scandal was
``nothing.'' He said that he did not pay the bills and that the
family might not have been aware of his help.
</P>
<P>
   When the scandal became public in the fall, Yeltsin denied all
knowledge of the cards in a phone conversation with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli, 48, has until now denied involvement. But in an
interview Thursday he said that he had helped arrange five cards
with a Swiss bank for Yeltsin's daughters, Yelena Okulova and
Tatyana Dyachenko; their husbands, and Yeltsin's wife, Naina. No
card was issued to Yeltsin, Pacolli said, adding that he never saw
or paid any bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only gave technical help,'' Pacolli said. ``In 1995, no
Russian banks had credit cards, and they had no convention with
credit card companies,'' he said, relaxing by a fire in his house
outside the Kosovo capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli said he was in Moscow in 1995 working on a new building
for a Russian bank, the Industrial International Bank, when the
head of the bank asked him about credit cards for the Yeltsins. The
Yeltsins had accounts at the bank, and Tatyana Yeltsin had asked
about cards. The director reportedly said that he would arrange it,
but that without an agreement he could not issue the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `OK, I will speak to my bank,''' Pacolli
recalled. Back in Switzerland, where his company, Mabetex, has its
headquarters, Pacolli asked his bank about the cards. Because the
bank, Banca del Gottardo, had not heard of the Russian bank,
Pacolli gave a personal guarantee, vouching for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not make any guarantee to cover the bills,'' Pacolli
recounted. ``I just gave a guarantee for the IIB bank.''
</P>
<P>
   He carried the cards in a sealed envelope to Russia and
delivered them to the bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement lasted two months, because the Russian bank
later signed a contract wa in the United States and canceled
its guarantee for the Swiss cards. Pacolli then canceled his
guarantee, and the cards were returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the truth I am speaking in my own house,'' he said.
Pacolli, here to present ideas to rebuild the capital, spoke openly
about Mabetex's worldwide activities. He said although he had
excellent relations with top Russian officials, as a Kosovar he
also often encountered hostility, especially from members of the
nationalist-dominated lower house of parliament. He said
investigations by the state prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov, whom Yeltsin
had tried to oust unsuccessfully two times, had been prompted by
such figures.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card scandal became public, he said, because of
information from Felipe Turover, a former employee of the Swiss
bank. ``He was fired and he was very angry and denounced the bank,
and my guarantee was revealed and was made into an iceberg,''
Pacolli said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mabetex had obtained contracts in Russia and other
former Soviet states through a good reputation. He said Yeltsin and
the former prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, had sought out
Mabetex for state projects after having seen its first Russian
project, a conference hall in Yakutsk.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacolli conceded that Mabetex had paid the necessary dues,
when required, ``in the interests of my business.'' He agreed that
no company could conduct business in Russia without paying
kickbacks, bribes or making ``donations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it,'' Pacolli said, ``and every foreign company
does it.''

COMMENTARY: GREENSPAN SPEAKS SOFTLY, WITH BIG STICK  (jw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity Alan Greenspan. Suddenly the talk around Wall Street is
that the Federal Reserve just doesn't have the power it once had
over the economy. The Fed has raised interest rates three times,
and the economy _ and the stock market _ just keep rolling along.
Interest rates are no longer important.
</P>
<P>
   If such talk brings on a feeling of deja vu, it may be because
you remember the days of 1991 and 1992, when this economic
expansion was young and widely derided as weak and fragile. Then
the talk was of ``profitless growth'' and ``pushing on a string.''
The Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy were faltering.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the economy has changed, and there probably is a longer
lag before the Fed can have a major impact. But the Fed is far from
impotent. If Greenspan and his colleagues really want to slow the
economy, they can. And it appears that Greenspan wants to do just
that; he just doesn't want to take the blame for it.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the way I read the most intriguing part of his
speech to the Economic Club of New York a week ago. In it he
pointed out that consumption is rising much faster than incomes or
productivity, and attributed a large part of that to the booming
stock market and the feeling of wealth that it has produced.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot last, he said: ``What will stop the wealth-induced
excess of demand over productivity-expanded supply is largely
developments in financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it is the markets that will slow the economy,
not vice versa. ``He sees rising interest rates as the force that
will ultimately cap the equity market's advance, contain equity
wealth effects, and thereby rein in excess demand,'' said Robert
Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan would like us to think that he is a passive observer,
with the market raising long-term rates and the Fed just following
along. He would like to avoid being blamed for bringing down the
stock market, so he avoids talk about overvaluation and thus
reassures investors.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the Fed's medicine (or is it the bond
market's?) is starting to work. Much of the stock market is
stuttering, although technology stocks have recovered from their
early-January swoon and are setting records. There is unprecedented
volatility within the stock market, as the Dow Jones industrial
average plunges while the Nasdaq composite zooms, or vice versa.
There have been just six days in the last decade when one of those
indexes rose at least 1 percent while the other fell by that
amount. Four of them were in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Technology mutual funds have taken in $12.7 billion from
investors since mid-November, reports AMG Data Services, while the
rest of the equity-fund universe received just $4.5 billion. ``I've
never seen it this concentrated,'' said Bob Adler, AMG's founder.
``Technology is the only focus.'' The trade deficit sets new
records each month, as wealth-effect-driven consumption pulls in
imports.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on 10-year Treasuries has climbed from 5.9 percent to
6.8 percent since mid-November, while the Nasdaq composite is up 30
percent. You can take that as evidence that the Fed cannot stop
this runaway economy, or the technology bull market. Or you can
agree with the wisdom of the late economist Herbert Stein, as
quoted by Greenspan: ``If a trend cannot continue, it will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan thinks interest rates will rise enough to offset, if
not end, the wealth effect. Do you want to bet he is wrong?

CANADA ADDS DETAILS ON ALGERIANS' SUSPECTED BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Vt.)  (rk) 
 By CRAIG PYES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canadian prosecutors Thursday offered the most
detailed picture to date of a bomb plot they said stretched from
Canada to Brooklyn and involved a number of Algerians, including
one they said was trained at camps in Afghanistan operated by
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the plot was coordinated by Mokhtar Haouari, a
31-year-old Algerian who was arrested in Canada last week after a
Manhattan grand jury indicted him on charges of taking part in
plotting an attack. A judge here ordered him held without bail
Thursday after a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, prosecutors in Seattle, New York, Vermont and
Canada have brought charges against a wide array of Algerians and
their associates. Thursday's hearing, in a Montreal courtroom,
marked the first time in the unfolding case in which anyone has
publicly tried to assemble the pieces of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing raised as many questions as it answered. It remains
unclear whether the Algerians had decided to attack a particular
target in the United States and, if so, where it was. Nor is it
clear whether Haouari was following the lead of some more
internationally known terrorist leader, for instance Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile who is charged by the United States of
masterminding the bombings of American Embassies in Africa in 1998
that left more than 200 dead. Intelligence officials say bin Laden
has operated training camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began on Dec. 14, when Customs officials at
Port Angeles, Wash., stopped a man who was trying to drive his car
off the ferry from Vancouver, British Columbia. That man, Ahmed
Ressam, broke into a dead run after a few questions and was
arrested. A search of his car found several jars filled with RDX, a
military explosive, and four Casio watches fashioned as homemade
detonators.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's hearing, a Canadian detective, Serge Haineault,
sketched the biographies of three of those accused of taking part
in the plot, saying two of them had known each other as schoolmates
in Algeria. He provided new details about how they allegedly tried
to pull off a bombing, and sought to draw links between them and
radical Islamic movements.
</P>
<P>
   Haineault said Ressam, known by the nom de guerre Abu Reda, had
received military training at camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan run
by militants.
</P>
<P>
   Offering the prosecutors' first detailed account of the
Algerians' frantic efforts to carry out their operation, Haineault
drew a picture of a flawed effort. He said Ghani Meskini had been
sent by Haouari on Dec. 11 to meet Ressam in Seattle and serve as
his translater and driver as well as provide him with cash drawn
from a stolen bank debit card.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, by the detective's account, made contact by telephone
with Ressam, who was staying in a hotel in Vancouver, just over the
border from Washington state. On Dec. 14, Ressam told Meskini that
he would be on the noon ferry and that he should ``stay calm.''
</P>
<P>
   But things did not work out as planned, Haineault said. Ressam
was arrested, leaving Meskini wondering what had happened.
According to Hainault, he made a series of phone calls over several
days to Haouari, trying to understand what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Meskini left Seattle and returned to Brooklyn. He
did not know it, but he was being watched. Federal investigators
had found a piece of paper on Ressam with Meskini's home phone
number, and they began watching his apartment and listening to his
phone calls soon after. According to the Canadian detective,
Haouari instructed Meskini to destroy all records of his trip to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The precautions were not sufficient. On Dec. 30, a team of
police and federal investigators arrested Meskini and announced
that they had seen him discarding airplane tickets and other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   According to Haineault, Meskini responded to federal agents with
a series of admissions about his travels and dealings with Haouari.
Challenged in court Thursday to support his allegations, Haineault
said that much of his information on the case had come from
statements Meskini made to the FBI after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini's lawyer, Roland Thau, said any statement his client
made was ``not a confession of his own involvement in the knowing
transportation or assistance of a bomb carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Thau said Meskini had not offered to assist American
investigators. The ``statement'' referred to in the Canadian court
proceedings, he said, was not signed. Meskini has pleaded not
guilty, as have all other defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Haineault testified that Haouari had known Meskini since their
school days in Algeria. In fact, he said, Meskini was eager to
become a full-fledged member of the Armed Islamic Group, known as
GIA for its initials in French. The group, which has been involved
in the killing of tens of thousands of Algerians, has not
previously attacked Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Several Clinton administration officials have said the Algerians
involved in the plot are linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   American officials speculate that bin Laden is linked to the
bomb plot, but have not offered specifics to support their
assertion.

 &HT;    Sapp recycles controversy with quotes
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ For four days, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the
St. Louis Rams kept the peace. But the teams that meet Sunday for
the NFC title finally got controversial at midweek.
</P>
<P>
   The main dispute stems from Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp calling St.
Louis coach Dick Vermeil a ``recycled coach,'' among other things,
in the December issue of Sport Magazine. Sapp renewed the issue
when he refused to retract the statements on Vermeil during a
Wednesday night interview on ESPN. It drew the ire of a few St.
Louis players.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp added more fuel to the fire at Tampa Bay's practice on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis players ``are the same people who called the NFL
Players Association on their coach (last year) and said their coach
was killing them,'' Sapp said. ``I wasn't the only person saying
anything about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some friends on the Rams, and I just took what they had
told me and then made a comment. If they don't like it now, so be
it. (Tell them to) line up Sunday and do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, numerous St. Louis players complained about Vermeil's
three-hour practices, demanding conditioning program and extra-long
film sessions.
</P>
<P>
   With problems of last season a distant memory for the Rams, the
St. Louis players are planning on using Sapp's statements this week
as extra motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine if they want to do that,'' Sapp said. ``But if
that is what they got to use as a rallying point, then they are in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In another brewing war of words, a television station reported
St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner as saying, ``The only team that
can beat the Rams is the Rams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is how most good teams feel _ that if they
execute their game plan the way they should, they are going to be
tough to stop,'' Tampa Bay safety John Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the same way about our defense. The only way we are
going to get beat is if we beat ourselves. I don't see (Warner's
quote) as being a negative or overly cocky, it's just the way good
football teams think about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Tampa Bay players weren't as understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if that is the way they feel _ but they don't want to
overlook us,'' defensive back Ronde Barber said. ``We're a good
football team, too. We have the second-best record in the NFC, and
that shows a lot coming from the NFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Warner) wants to say that, then the only team that can
beat Tampa Bay is us, too,'' Barber said. ``Whichever team executes
the best and makes the least amount of turnovers and mistakes on
Sunday is going to win. Talk is cheap; we'll see what happens.'' A
few minutes later, Sapp was asked how the defense plans to stop
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get in his face, and I want to get on top of him as
many times as I can,'' Sapp said. ``That is going to bode well for
me and our ballclub, but it is going to be a task in itself because
their offensive line is playing well.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey officials sketched a $300 million
vision Thursday for the redevelopment of Ellis Island, most of
which has been concealed behind overgrown weeds and chain-link
fences from the millions who visit every year.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the plan would turn the long-neglected island in New
York Harbor into a setting for meetings ranging from local
corporate conferences to global peace talks, with new museums
devoted to America's immigrant heritage and the study of public
health.
</P>
<P>
   As a more urgent _ and realistic _ first step, Gov. Christie
Whitman said that $8.6 million had been secured from state, federal
and private sources to stabilize dozens of decrepit buildings
around the island, especially on its tumbledown southern half, the
so-called sad side, where immigrants too sick to be allowed entry
were housed in hospital wards until they recovered or died.
</P>
<P>
   ``As New Jerseyans, we take great pride in our history,'' the
governor said. . ``But we must also take care of our history so
that future generations can share our pride and visit these
landmarks of our national journey. We owe it to our future to
preserve our past.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements Thursday marked a dramatic and, by
governmental standards, rapid turnabout in the status of Ellis
Island, which after decades of neglect by the federal government
was labeled one of the country's most endangered historic places in
1997 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In the spring
of 1998, the Supreme Court ended a long border dispute between New
York and New Jersey by awarding Trenton sovereignty over all but 5
of the island's 27.5 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Although the island remained under federal control _ the
National Park Service owns and operates it _ Whitman immediately
asserted herself in determining its future. A 15-member commission
she appointed in May 1998 quickly ruled out a commercial project,
cheering those who had feared the island would be turned into the
site of a hotel or a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists greeted Thursday's news with enthusiasm. ``I
think New Jersey has been a wonderful thing to happen to Ellis
Island,'' said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks
Conservancy. ``They've put their money where their mouth is. They
understand the importance of the heritage of Ellis Island and have
respected it with these recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breen noted that inmates from New Jersey prisons began
pulling up weeds and carting away garbage from the overgrown parts
of the island last April, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars
in contracting and hauling fees. ``With all due respect to New
York,'' she added, ``New York never did any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final report to the governor Thursday, the commission
recommended three main uses for the island.
</P>
<P>
   A Center for Immigrant Contributions and Ethnic Learning would
research and mount exhibitions celebrating the immigrant
experience, encompassing not only those Americans who passed
through Ellis Island, but also those who arrived in slave ships
from Africa and the Caribbean, and more recent immigrants from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only appropriate,'' the commission wrote, ``since
during the current decade, the U.S. may experience the highest
volume of immigration in the past century.'' One objective of the
center would be to illuminate ``the nation's seemingly
contradictory practices of ethnic exclusion, discrimination,
pluralism, assimilation and tolerance,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Though the report states that the center would avoid ``overly
focusing on specific immigrant or ethnic groups,'' Finn Casperson,
the commission's chairman, said that many ethnic groups could be
expected to help in either lobbying for money or contributing it,
among them the descendants of Irish, German, Scandinavian, African
and Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The second use, a Public Health Learning Center, would build
upon the island's history as the birthplace of the U.S. Public
Health Service. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, is
leading an effort to build a public health museum in Washington,
and Rep. Robert Franks, R-N.J., has introduced legislation that
would create a satellite of that museum on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   Third, an International Conference Center would be the first in
the United States on a publicly owned, nationally recognized site,
according to the report, and the combination of its proximity to
New York City and its ``insulated and tranquil, internationally
revered site'' could place it in the elite company of Versailles
and Geneva as a suitable setting for peace talks or global economic
meetings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The center would be publicly developed, but financed largely
with private money, Casperson said. New Jersey's many
pharmaceutical companies, ``who are renowned for their
conferences,'' could be expected both to pay for its construction
and to make use of the center, he added. Needed hotels could be
built on available land a short distance away in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Casperson, a prominent Republican contributor who
is a former chief executive of Beneficial Corp., said much of the
$300 million it would take to fully rebuild Ellis Island would have
to come from Washington. ``I strongly believe, and maybe I'm naive,
but this happened on the federal government's watch,'' he said.
``They were the ones who let the buildings go. They were the ones
who walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual financing announced Thursday was paltry by
comparison, but of no small importance, officials said. Whitman
said she would include $1 million in her proposed budget, which is
due within days, to preserve the Baggage and Dormitory Building,
the largest on Ellis Island and the one in the gravest danger of
collapse. The National Park Service will match that with another $1
million. Of the $6.6 million needed to stabilize the hospital
buildings, Congress has contributed $2 million and Trenton $2.3
million, and the rest is still being sought. A $2.3 million project
to save the pedestrian passageway is expected to be fully funded
soon, half from the federal government and half from a private
donor yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence,'' Casperson said. ``The buildings are
falling apart. They need to be restored. We have momentum, but we
must act now. We cannot afford to put it off for another decade.''

   Assessing Your Skills With an Online Survey &QL;

<P>
   Recent college graduates and executives in midstream may have
more in common than they know. A new Web site,
www.careervectors.com, is promoting career counseling to people who
are entering the work force for the first time or veteran workers
who may be looking for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers can fill out a self-assessment survey online that
takes about three hours to complete and costs $69.95. The questions
are designed to determine whether the applicant is, for example, a
physical/biological/scientific type or a
creative/self-expressive/intuitive type. Career Vectors says there
are nine categories that applicants fit into.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also provides Internet links to job banks and other
career-oriented services.
</P>
<P>
   After applicants finish soul-searching, they submit their
answers and within minutes the software program on which Career
Vectors is based delivers an analysis, including such insights as
``I may become bored with repetition and routine,'' or ``I may not
think things through before taking action.'' The report also
suggests jobs ranging from locksmith to physical anthropologist
that match the applicants' profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be strong themes that emerge,'' said Gail Magalife,
chief operating officer for human services at Federation Employment
and Guidance Service, the New York-based organization that
developed Career Vectors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Magalife said Career Vectors was not meant to take the place
of the human touch. ``Ideally,'' she said, Career Vectors ``is for
someone who can meet with a career counselor in addition.'' &QL;

   Weinberg said one explanation for the corruption was that the
union is highly decentralized, meaning its locals more financial
autonomy than most other unions. One episode of corruption
described in the report involves Robert Gordon, who was ousted from
his job as treasurer of the Milwaukee local representing 220 sewer
workers after a bookkeeper discovered that some money was missing.
A union audit reported that Gordon had apparently embezzled $96,000
by writing 208 checks to himself that were not approved and were
not used for union purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold ourselves to very high standards, not only in AFSCME,
but in Wisconsin,'' said Richard Abelson, a top official with the
union in Wisconsin. ``Our expectation is things like that don't
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's lawyer, Gerald Boyle, said his client was talking to
law-enforcement authorities and was working with union officials.
``We will take care of making sure that whatever needs to be put
back into the union's coffers is put back,'' he said.
</P>

the union's 8,000 workers in Indiana, said Grubb had been removed
from office when the local's other officers uncovered the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anybody's personal money,'' she said. ``This money
belongs to the members of the union.'' She said that Grubb had
admitted to union officials that he siphoned off the money.
</P>
<P>
   Another insurance claim made by the union involved the
controller of a district council in New Jersey, who the union said
stole $42,700 by forging checks and making unauthorized
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Another claim involved the president of a Long Island, N.Y.,
chapter of the union, who the union said stole $14,870 from the
union. The official, Pasquale Ferraro, was removed by a union
judicial panel, although he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Twigg, an agent for the union's insurance company, St.
Paul Cos., said, ``I don't know if they have more claims than other
unions. I don't find them to be extraordinary or unextraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other unions, the Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees has what is known as a fidelity bond insurance
policy that provides for reimbursing the union if an official
commits dishonest acts that cause the union to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Twigg said his company examines all such claims to make sure
they are valid.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention several prominent episodes of
corruption not covered by the claims report. In 1998, for example,
the secretary-treasurer of the union's district council in
Washington pleaded guilty to embezzling $761,000, while the
council's finance director confessed to stealing $73,500.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the claims that St. Paul Cos. processed between last Oct. 1
and Nov. 22, the report said, the company paid off $605,000 of $2.6
million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason the company paid off less than the claimed
amount was that the union claimed $2.2 million for money it said
was stolen by Charles Hughes, the former president of a local in
District Council 37, representing New York City's school crossing
guards and cafeteria aides. The policy covering Hughes provided a
maximum of $500,000 in reimbursement to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Kedia, Hughes' lawyer, said Thursday that her client was
innocent of wrongdoing. The report added several new details about
the District Council 37 scandal, asserting, for example, that
several aides to Hughes had improperly written hundreds of
thousands of dollars in checks that ultimately benefited him
personally.

CLINTON ACTS TO CHANGE TAX THAT AFFECTS MIDDLE CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Kan., Texas)   (jw) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton moved Thursday to change a tax intended to
make sure that all wealthy Americans pay some income taxes but that
has also become a fast-growing burden on the middle class,
particularly families with children.
</P>
<P>
   The tax, known as the alternative minimum tax, was enacted in
1969 after it was disclosed that some families with incomes of more
than $200,000 were paying no income taxes. It aimed to force
wealthy Americans who were avoiding taxes through tax shelters to
pay at least something to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so Congress decided to treat exemptions for
children and deductions for  expenses and state and local
taxes just like special tax breaks allowed for investments in tax
shelters like oil wells and real estate. When those deductions
reach specific amounts set by Congress, at which the taxpayer
typically owes little or no tax, the alternative minimum tax kicks
in and the taxpayer must pay it.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, a single mother making less than $28,000 can be
stuck with a bigger tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal would guarantee that starting this year
exemptions for all but two children could be claimed and every
child could be claimed by 2010 without setting off the alternative
minimum tax. Taxpayers would also be guaranteed the standard
deduction, which was $7,200 last year for a couple filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of middle-class Americans' owing a tax intended for
the wealthy was identified in an article in The New York Times last
year. The article described David and Margaret Klaassen, a Kansas
couple with 13 children, who owed money under the alternative
minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday, Klaassen called the president's proposal
excellent. But Klaassen, whose family would not have owed the tax
if it had had six or fewer children, said that the president's
proposal did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, families could still owe the tax just because they took
deductions for the expense of treating costly illnesses. The
Klaassens owed the alternative minimum tax in 1997 when a son
battling cancer ran up big medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal would also not help families that owed
the tax because of factors like deductions for high state and local
taxes, credits for foreign taxes and losses from running a farm.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal prompted a renewed call by Republicans
in Congress to repeal the tax. A repeal would save wealthy
Americans billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's proposal is only half the loaf,'' said Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, and who wants repeal of what he called ``this tax-hike
time bomb'' that will apply to an estimated 9 million taxpayers by
2009. Archer noted that last month Val Oveson, the IRS taxpayer
advocate, urged repeal of the alternative minimum tax to simplify
the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year for which data is available, about
618,000 individuals and couples paid the tax, 29 percent more than
in 1996. The tax raised more than $4 billion, a 42 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan would cost the government $32.8 billion in
revenue over the next 10 years. Archer's proposal would cost about
$105 billion over the same period, with much of the savings going
to the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Talisman, the acting assistant Treasury secretary for tax
policy, described the proposal as ``a down payment on correcting
the serious defects'' with the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Talisman said his office ``looked at other scenarios and how
many people would be left on the AMT and we thought this was the
most important'' problem to solve. He also noted that large
families in any state could be affected, while high state and local
taxes pushed people into the alternative minimum tax only in
certain states.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal requires the approval of Congress to
become law. If it is enacted, the number of people who are paid
$30,000 to $75,000 who are subject to the alternative minimum tax
would fall nearly by half in 2002 and by more than 80 percent in
2010, a Treasury analysis showed, while among those making more
than $200,000 the decline would be just 2 percent in 2002 and 13
percent in 2010.

BRADLEY DISCLOSES MORE BOUTS OF AILMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley disclosed
Thursday night that he had suffered four bouts of irregular
heartbeat, a chronic condition known as atrial fibrillation, since
Dec. 10, when he first disclosed that he suffered from the aliment.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who takes daily medication for the condition, said all
four incidents were brief, with his heartbeat returning to normal
without treatment. Several times he campaigned despite his
fluttering heart, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just the nature of the particular situation that, time
to time, its spins out,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Atrial fibrillation occurs when the heart's upper chambers
contract faster than the lower ones.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bradley said one incident occurred just after Christmas
when Bradley was on vacation. The others were on Jan. 6, 9 and 16.
They said they lasted as long as 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said he had been late in taking his medication before
one incident, but not the others.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley disclosed the incidents after his campaign spokesman was
asked about his heart condition by an ABC reporter Thursday. Asked
why he had not been more forthcoming, Bradley said, ``You don't
want me to go around disclosing every time I flip out for an hour
or two.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would tell reporters if he needed medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the frequency of the incidents, which he
acknowledged were unusual, was not caused by campaign stress. His
aides also said that Bradley's doctors said he did not need to cut
back his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 10, Bradley canceled an afternoon of campaigning and
went to a hospital after a bout of irregular heart beats.

A PLAN TO OVERCOME INVESTORS' HOME BIAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ask investors how the ``stock market'' did last year,
most of them will think of the Dow Jones industrials or the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Sure, a few will remember that
the market contains more than the stocks in these indices.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the rare investor who remembers that there are many
more stocks that trade beyond these shores.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to recognize overseas markets is an enormous oversight,
especially in this era of global markets. According to Morgan
Stanley Capital International, the combined market capitalization
of all United States stocks amounts to less than one-half of the
world's total market value. Still, investors in this country
allocate more than 90 percent of their equity investments to the
stocks of American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what this means to an individual who has invested in
the Vanguard Index 500 fund, this country's most popular index
fund, which is dominated by large-cap growth companies. The fund
represents only three-quarters of the United States market, which
in turn accounts for less than half of the total world market. This
individual may think he is investing in ``the market,'' but when
viewed from a global perspective, he is investing in barely more
than a sector fund.
</P>
<P>
   The average foreign investor overweights his own countries'
stocks to the same extent that American investors do theirs.
Investors in Britain, for example, invest nearly 80 percent of
their equity portfolios in British companies. By contrast, American
investors have less than 1 percent of their equity portfolios
invested in British stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This tendency of investors to favor their own country's
securities is so pronounced and so universal that researchers have
given a name to it: home bias.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when you think about it, home bias should not be so
pronounced. After all, one suspects that the British investor wants
to maximize returns just as much as the American one does. Why
then, should his or her portfolio be so very different?
</P>
<P>
   Hypotheses for why home bias exists to the degree it does have
focused for years on structural factors, such as the fact that
investing outside one's country entails higher currency risk and
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   But after examining each of these factors in detail, most
researchers have concluded that these factors can at best explain
only a small portion of investors' home bias. Many now believe that
investor psychology is the major factor.
</P>
<P>
   And this suggests that overcoming home bias will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if investors preferred domestic equities
even when they thought that foreign equities would do better: that
would just be a case of rooting for the home team. But it appears
to run deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Home bias is so ingrained in investors' psyches that it clouds
their judgments _ causing American investors to be overly
optimistic about United States stocks while leading foreign
investors to be overly optimistic about their countries' markets.
</P>
<P>
   Two British academics _ Norman Strong, a professor of accounting
and finance at the University of Manchester, and Xinzhong Xu, a
senior lecturer in finance at Lancaster University _ recently
completed a survey of fund managers in four parts of the world: the
United States, Britain, Continental Europe and Japan. Specifically,
they tallied the managers' 12-month forecasts for United States
stocks, between October 1995 and June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results: There were far more bulls than bears among United
States fund managers over that period. But among fund managers in
the other parts of the world, there were far more bears than bulls.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when these professors tallied fund managers'
12-month forecasts for stocks in Britain, Continental Europe and
Japan, the opposite trend emerged. In each case, United States fund
managers were far more pessimistic than those regions' domestic
managers.
</P>
<P>
   So, how can an investor hope to combat home bias, if fund
managers cannot? I propose a solution that may appear radical. All
other things being equal, an investor's stock portfolio should be
divided among the world's markets based upon each country's share
of global stock market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   An investor would then deviate from that allocation only when he
or she had reason to believe that a particular market would do much
better or worse than average, after taking into account currency
risk and the high transaction costs of investing foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   No, this will not overcome home bias altogether, but it would
focus attention on how bullish an investor ought to be to justify a
major overweighting in domestic stocks. And while my suggestion may
seem like heresy to those financial advisers who routinely advocate
a cap of 10 percent or 15 percent on investors' foreign exposure,
at root it simply suggests using some common sense: An investor
should be able to justify the geographical diversification of his
or her stock portfolio. &QL;

<P>
   The losses claimed by the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees are covered by a form of insurance often
referred to as a fidelity bond.
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of coverage, widely bought by corporations and
nonprofit organizations like unions and pension plans, the
organization is reimbursed for theft or embezzlement by officials
and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Premium calculations are based on the type of business _
gambling casinos, for example, are considered riskier and thus more
expensive to insure than consulting firms _ plus the number of
employees and workplaces, said Fred Podolsky, a senior vice
president at Willis Corp., one of the nation's largest insurance
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   To collect from an insurance company, an organization submits
evidence of a loss. The insurance company investigates and, once
the loss is confirmed, pays the loss. Often, determining the exact
amount of the loss is difficult, leading to negotiations with the
insurance company on a settlement.

 &HT;    Leaving comfort of home
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ There is no place like home, but the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers will be forced to leave it today.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers, winners of eight in a row at home, are scheduled
to fly to St. Louis around 3 p.m. today. Rather than the
traditional routine of leaving from the team headquarters directly
to the airport, special events are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coaches and players will depart on buses from Raymond
James Stadium to the hollering and cheers of the Tampa Bay fans at
2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Once arriving in St. Louis, the Bucs will have the rest of today
off. Curfew will be at 1 a.m. Coach Tony Dungy said the team will
have meetings and do a normal walk-through of the Trans World Dome
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   SILENCE OF SAPP
</P>
<P>
   You have a better chance of winning the lottery than catching
Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp at a loss for words. But he turned quiet
when reporters on Thursday brought up the subject of his right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp injured the hamstring during the victory over the Redskins
last Saturday and he left practice early in obvious pain on
Wednesday. He appeared to be back at full strength during
Thursday's drills.
</P>
<P>
   When asked ae specifics of the injury on Thursday, Sapp
quickly replied, ``There is no such thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in franchise history, Dungy had more to say
about a topic than Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren is going to be fine,'' Dungy said. ``He practiced and
made it through the whole day fine. So we don't anticipate any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp could be downplaying the injury so his hamstring won't be a
constant target for St. Louis offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Brad Culpepper also left practice early this week,
but it was planned. His practice time has been limited since
injuring a foot Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   OPERATION HEADSTART
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs and the Rams have not played since the 1994 season,
when the Rams were still located in Los Angeles. The unfamiliarity
between the two teams has resulted in endless hours of studying
film for both both coaching staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay may have a slight advantage in preparation. In last
week's NFC divisionals, the Bucs defeated the Redskins. Mike Martz
was the offensive coordinator for Washington during the 1997-98
season before joining the Rams in a similar capacity this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big for us to beat Washington last week because there
are a lot of similarities between the offenses of the Redskins and
Rams,'' Tampa Bay safety John Lynch said. ``And from watching film,
you can see there was a lot of carryover from Washington to St.
Louis (by Martz). Now there are a lot of new wrinkles in his
offense at St. Louis, but at least we had a good headstart by
facing Washington last week.''
</P>
<P>
   HANDLING THE HOOPLA
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to tell that Tampa Bay has not been in the NFC
Championship Game in 20 years. With the exception of Sapp, the
players seem overwhelmed by the media attention. Dungy even had to
stand on a stool at one of his news conferences so he could be seen
by the hordes of video cameras. ``I think our guys know the urgency
and magnitude of the situation,'' Dungy said. ``It's a special time
and, with everything going on media-wise, you know it is a big
game.''

 &HT;    Don't key too much on Kearse
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ It might be worth heeding the words of Leon
Searcy, the Jacksonville offensive tackle, who cautions against
getting too freaked out about ``The Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   If you concern your offensive scheme too much with neutralizing
Tennessee defensive end Jevon Kearse, you just might get
blindsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all week, you've got to treat `The Freak'
like Michael Jordan,'' Searcy said. ``Everybody used to rally
around stopping Jordan. You'd try to keep Jordan from scoring 50 or
60 points and then the rest of the guys would beat you.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got other guys on that team that make plays, too _
(defensive linemen) Josh Evans, Henry Ford and Kenny Holmes and
(strong safety) Blaine Bishop. The Jordan factor comes into effect
when you're talking about `The Freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the redemption factor. Searcy said the second
loss to Tennessee, 41-14 in Week 15, was a true ``butt-kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been playing football,'' the former Steeler said,
``I've never been handed to the way we were handed to in Tennessee.
But we've got a chance to redeem ourselves Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   BRUNELL KEEPS IMPROVING
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell is, in coach Tom Coughlin's
opinion, ``much better than he was last week'' in moving on his
previously injured left knee. ``I'm not going to say he's 100
percent, but maybe 85. ... This will be his fourth week of
recovery. Most of the time our MCLs (injuries to medial collateral
ligaments) have come back in four weeks.'' ... Jaguars owner Wayne
Weaver said the only two other people besides Coughlin on his final
head coaching interview list five years ago were Tony Dungy, now
the Tampa Bay head coach, then an assistant at Kansas City, and
Mike Shanahan, who was hired by Denver. ... Coughlin has termed
practices ``spirited, with lots of energy.'' He will reduce
repetitions today. ... Coughlin on the rhetoric between team sites:
``The game will be decided on the field, not by verbalization.''
... Speaking about the extra attention from the national media and
its accompanying pressure, ex-Titan Gary Walker said, ``With or
without the media, the game will be played.'' ... Coughlin, on the
extra media attention: ``At this time of the year, we've earned
this right. We're fortunate to be in this position to have the
national media here. I think it's a very positive sign. It's good
for our city. It's good for our team. You learn to deal with it,
like anything else in this game. Hopefully, the experience of
having been there before (in a 20-6 loss to New England in the 1996
AFC title game) will help.''
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars wide receiver Keenan McCardell is prepared to see a
Titans defense that double-teams both him and Jimmy Smith. For
Smith, it's almost a certainty. ``We're going to have to go out
there and attack,'' McCardell said. ``We're going to have to make
the plays in the double-teams. We're going to have to make plays,
period.'' ... Walker says that with a third game against his former
Titans approaching, it has grown stale to ask about his old
situation. ``That Tennessee stuff is behind me,'' he said. ``Our
goal is to get to the Super Bowl. Regardless of who you have to
play to get there, you have to play.'' ... Lower 50-yard line AFC
Championship seats with a face value of $175 are being scalped in
the Jacksonville area for as much as $750.

 &HT;    Wounded Wilkins will kick
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The one question mark for the Rams this week _ the
kicking game _ has been settled. Sorry, Nick Lowery. Jeff Wilkins
will do the placekicking after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going,'' said Wilkins, who will kick in Sunday's NFC
Championship Game despite the painful patella tendinitis in his
left knee. Wilkins spoke after kicking in practice Thursday. He
experienced some pain but nothing like earlier in the week, so
Wilkins will play against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts and it's going to hurt and I've accepted that,''
Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil has accepted that Wilkins, who'll need postseason
surgery to clean out the knee and correct the condition that's
bothered him on and off for two years, can kick effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leg bothered him (Thursday) but he kicked well, firmly and
accurately,'' said the head coach. ``As of right now, he'll be our
kicker, and that's a relief. He hit some 50-yarders here, so I
think he'll have the range.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins was inconsistent this season, hitting on 20 of 28
attempts. He aggravated the injury on last Sunday's opening kickoff
and later missed a 42-yard field goal attempt against Minnesota.
Vermeil brought in three kickers to work out Tuesday and was
prepared to go with Lowery, 43, who hasn't kicked in a game since
retiring three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN, NOT WITH ENVY
</P>
<P>
   Trent Green can only wonder, what if? The St. Louis native
signed a four-year, $16 million free-agent contract last February
with his hometown Rams and was still working under Mike Martz, his
quarterback coach in Washington and now the Rams' offensive
coordinator. But after tearing up his knee in the third preseason
game, Green has had to watch Kurt Warner's record-setting success
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the injury, I was playing at the highest level
I've ever played,'' said Green, who was 28-for-32 (87.5 percent)
for 406 yards, two touchdowns and a quarterback rating of 126.6.
``Whether I'd be able to put up the numbers Kurt has, who's to say?
Maybe I put up better, maybe I don't. Those are all
hypotheticals.''
</P>
<P>
   LYLE EAGER TO PLAY
</P>
<P>
   After missing the past eight games with a bruised nerve in his
neck and left shoulder area, free safety Keith Lyle said he is
ready, and eager, to return Sunday. Vermeil isn't so sure. Lyle has
been practicing with the second-team secondary and in nickel
situations, but Vermeil said, ``He has maybe a little better chance
of being able to play this week than last but I don't know how much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Falcon Devin Bush has played well in Lyle's absence. But from
the start of the 1995 season through '98, Lyle led the NFL in
interceptions with 23. He's eager to play against the Bucs because
he lives in Tampa in the offseason. And to be just a win away from
the Super Bowl is ``Unbelievable. I've been here six years. Two
cities. Three head coaches. Five defensive coordinators. And I live
in Tampa. So it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil on the Bucs' defensive front: ``To me, they've got four
D'Marco Farr's (the Rams' Pro Bowl defensive tackle). Four
explosively quick defensive linemen. And, of course, they've got
Warren Sapp (the NFL Defensive Player of the Year). They're
extremely quick off the ball, probably the quickest front we've
faced all year.''

 &HT;    Attentive Del Greco on target
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Kicker Al Del Greco was as valuable for his
eagle eye as his accurate foot last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC Player of the Week after his four field goals against
Indianapolis, he also made an impact on a kick return when he
wasn't on the field. Del Greco saw the Colts' Terrence Wilkins step
out of bounds on a return to the Titans' 4. After an instant replay
review, officials brought it back 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just watch,'' said Del Greco, who has kicked around the
league for 16 years, the last nine with the Oilers/Titans. ``I just
happened to be standing right where he stepped out. I always kind
of look at stuff like that just in case. I don't know how the refs
missed it, but they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about this team being a team of destiny, with the
Music City Miracle. If that return happens on their sideline, it
never gets reviewed. Things are working in our favor. Hopefully
that'll continue for two more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Greco said teammates are telling him, ``Four more field
goals!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, four extra points,'' he said. ``Twenty-eight points
would be a heckuva lot easier to win with than 12.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING CATCH-UP
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Miracle, Kevin Dyson is best known for scoring
the 75-yard touchdown after Frank Wycheck lateraled the ball to him
on a desperation kickoff return against Buffalo in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full season as a starting wide receiver, Dyson had
career highs in receptions (54), yards receiving (658) and
touchdowns (4). If you compare his stats with someone like
Minnesota's Randy Moss, who could blame him for wanting to play on
a pass-happy offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``What receiver wouldn't want the ball 12 times a game?'' Dyson
asked. ``But I'm 15-3, I'm in the AFC Championship Game. They're
not in the NFC Championship Game. It doesn't bother me that much.
I'm still playing.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHARGERS' LOSS ...
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was playing for the University of Georgia. This
year, Titans tight end Larry Brown wasn't sure where he'd be.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't drafted after lackluster workouts, so he signed as a
free agent with San Diego and went to two mini-camps. When he got
to the airport in Atlanta to pick up his ticket to California in
late July, ``They told me the ticket hadn't been paid for,'' Brown
said. ``I thought I'd pay for it, and when I got there they'd
reimburse me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found out he'd been cut. Tennessee picked him up,
and he has played in seven games, primarily on special teams.
However, with the injury to Mike Roan, he has moved up to
second-string tight end. FEAR NOT A FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck said the Titans, who have won four of the five games
they've played in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, really enjoy it by
virtue of ``just the fact that we're not afraid,'' he said. ``You
know, some people go in there intimidated to go against
Jacksonville at their place, but we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   TITAN TOWN
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Denard Walker said everybody's talking about the
Titans. ``The city has just exploded,'' he said. ``Everywhere you
go, you see the Tennessee Titans logo, the Titans T-shirts, people
wearing the jerseys.''
</P>
<P>
   If the team goes to the Super Bowl, ``I think this will just
blow the city up,'' he said, ``and it would make Nashville the
Mecca of the NFL instead of saying they're just a little town that
just got a team. It'd be a great boost for all of us.''

ON JETS' FRONT, IT'S STILL TALK, TALK, TALK, AND PLEASE STAY TUNED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entwined coaching careers of Bill Parcells and Bill
Belichick will very likely be resolved Friday.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who was
expected to make a ruling Thursday, is leaving Saturday morning for
the NFC championship game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Parcells had his third face-to-face meeting over the
last nine days Thursday with the Jets' new owner, Robert Wood
Johnson IV. The meeting was held at an undisclosed location away
from the club headquarters in Hempstead, N.Y., a Jets spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wants Parcells to return as coach, or at least take a
major role in running the team.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson persuades him to return as coach, Parcells may not
want the responsibility of running the entire football operation.
The Jets would then be in the market for someone such as the
respected Tom Donahoe, a former director of football operations for
the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick quit two weeks ago as the Jets' coach after holding
the post for a day. He said his contract was invalid and that he
wanted to be free to coach elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe Tagliabue will reiterate the opinion he
made the day after Belichick quit that he thought the contract was
valid.
</P>
<P>
   At just about the same time that the Jets elevated Belichick to
succeed Parcells, the Patriots, not knowing of the move, had asked
for permission to interview Belichick as their coach and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   A New England Patriots spokesman, meanwhile, said Thursday that
he was not aware of any contact between the commissioner's office
and Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots' owner. Since then, New England
has interviewed four head-coaching candidates, but none for the
dual roles. Thus, it appears the Patriots' job is waiting for
Belichick when his future is decided.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick's contract is ruled valid by Tagliabue, then the
Patriots would have to compensate the Jets if the team was willing
to let Belichick go. Tagliabue would not get involved in that
discussion between the teams unless both sides asked him to.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells is leaning toward a return to the sideline, he has
not let on. Several assistants said this week that they had not
heard from him, but that Parcells had made it clear he was finished
with coaching. Most of the Jets' assistants, who were in Mobile,
Ala., Thursday for Senior Bowl week, headed back to New York. If
allowed to leave, Belichick would likely want some assistants to go
with him.

MERCEDES E430 -- A CAR TO BELIEVE IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have just finished driving the Mercedes Benz E430 and I am
looking back more than 25 years to one of the first newspaper
stories I ever wrote, for the National Observer, and I remember it
involved a court ruling on an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   A man had purchased a brand new car with a faulty transmission _
it turned out it had been in a flood _ and despite repeated
attempts by the dealership to fix it, it had never run right. He
asked for a new car. A New Hampshire judge named Charles Douglas
ruled he should have one because, as I recall, Douglas said that a
new car is worth more than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   When you purchase a new car, he ruled, you are buying more than
just parts in good working order. You are also buying faith in that
automobile, and if you don't have that faith, you've been sold a
lemon. Made sense to me _ especially the ``sum of its parts'' bit.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. The E430 is no lemon, and if I owned one,
I'd have complete faith in it.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the sum of its parts: It is solid, comfortable,
fast, safe, quiet on the road, and has the Mercedes record of
remarkable reliability. Problem is, it's no fun to drive. But that
may be no problem for some.
</P>
<P>
   You could hurtle from Caribou, Maine, to Carmel, Calif., in this
rig and never once feel the road. On the other hand, that's the way
some folks like to travel, so if long and effortless trips are your
thing, this is the car for you.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I got spoiled before I drove the E430. I drove the E55 _
hot-rod version of the same car. Tons of power, great suspension
for corners, meant to help executives who fear kidnappings get away
quickly when they have to.
</P>
<P>
   Not every car has to be the E55, of course. But at nearly
$60,000, I'd like at least some opportunity for adventure. Instead,
I get a cruise _ much like I'd get sitting on my couch watching the
desert wash toward me on a travel show beamed on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   It is a most comfortable car.
</P>
<P>
   Leather seats so wide you wonder where the ottoman is. Firm
leather seats that hold up your thighs, support your back, grip you
on the sides. In the rear, legroom is expansive.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical in a Mercedes, ergonomics are crisp and right at
hand. Dials and buttons may be a bit small, but once you learn
where everything is, it's like typing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car that approaches two tons in curb weight, yet it
has plenty of power to haul that load. It's got a 275-horsepower V8
with an unusual three-valves-per-cylinder design _ two intake, one
exhaust _ and two sparkplugs per cylinder. It got just over 19
miles per gallon _ pretty respectable for a V8 _ in a week of
driving.
</P>
<P>
   It produces smooth acceleration, even at higher speeds,
accompanied by a throaty rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunatley, the five-speed automatic had a noticeable
shift-up lag when the gas was stomped. The driver-adaptive feature
that supposedly puts you in command didn't add much spark to the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're running Caribou to Carmel and want only a quiet,
smooth ride without the bother of driving too much, that won't
matter to you. In fact, it may be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to make that run and push the car a bit _ get
off the straights and onto some twisting roads _ then it's less
than perfect. And that's surprising, suspension-wise.
</P>
<P>
   It's got upper and lower A-arms up front, complemented by coil
springs, tube shocks, and anti-roll bar. In the rear, you get a
multi-link setup with coil springs, tube shocks, and anti-roll bar.
</P>
<P>
   That's all supported by an automatic slip control system that
senses drive-wheel slip and uses braking or engine power to get
things back under control. That's aided by an electronic stability
program that senses what the driver is trying to do _ it pays
attention to where you are steering and how you are using your
brakes _ and, again, uses engine and brakes to make up for your
mistakes. It's also got a front/rear torque split called 4MATIC
all-wheel drive (this in a rear-wheel-drive car) that incorporates
all of the above when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Now that is high tech, and that is complicated, and that all
sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Why then, I ask myself, does this rig feel boaty in the corners?
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean boaty as in you're about to lose control because of
lateral sway and a nose dive to the outside front wheel. Or even
boaty as in riding on dad's lap in the old Buick on a twisty
country road.
</P>
<P>
   I do mean a floating sensation, a lateral, gentle, rock and roll
that feels more lumbering luxury sedan than sport sedan, and since
so many new cars have managed to put sport performance into luxury
sedan, I don't know how Mercedes missed on this one.
</P>
<P>
   Performance-wise, I'd rate the Audi A6 and the Jaguar S-type as
better. I may even put the Lincoln LS _ at almost half the price _
in the same class.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a bad car? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   For the right person and for the right reasons, this is a
wonderful car.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou-Carmel in total comfort? Go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh Lawd, wontcha buy me, a MER-CAY-DEEZ-BENZ . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Janis Joplin sang that.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a picture of her behind the wheel _ of a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The placement for front-seat adjustments _ bottom, sides,
headrest _ on the door where you can see them, as opposed to down
on the side of the seat, where you end up groping.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The small exterior mirrors. If they're not positioned just so,
you get blocked out.
</P>
<P>
   --The clock _ left side of main display panel _ right where only
the driver can see it. What time is it, Dad?

A CLINTON INITIATIVE IN A SCIENCE OF SMALLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to announce an ambitious
program Friday to accelerate basic research in the field of
nanotechnology, the design and fabrication of devices of
ultramicroscopic size.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology is widely considered an extremely promising area
of science and engineering, but it has realized only limited
commercial success to date.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a speech at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, President Clinton will stress the importance of expanding
basic research in both the physical and biological sciences. As
part of the speech, he will announce plans to ask Congress to
finance a National Nanotechnology Initiative to encourage basic
research in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The president will set out these ``grand challenges'': shrinking
the entire contents of the Library of Congress into a device the
size of a sugar cube; assembling new materials from the ``bottom
up'' (from atoms and molecules); developing ultralight materials
that are 10 times as strong as steel; creating a new class of
computer chip millions of times as fast as today's Pentium 3;
doubling the efficiency of solar cells; using gene and
drug-delivery technologies to detect and target cancerous cells,
and developing new technologies to remove the smallest contaminants
from water and air.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative will double federal spending in the field over
the next five years. The plan calls for an increase in
nanotechnology research spending to $497 million in the coming
fiscal year, about 70 percent of which will go to university
scientists for basic research.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Kalil, special assistant to the president for economic
policy, said: ``Nanotechnology is a perfect example of the kind of
investments that President Clinton and Vice President Gore believe
are necessary for America's future. It's long term, high risk and
high payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology _ broadly defined as the ability to manipulate
and move matter _ is rapidly developing as a promising approach to
a wide range of sciences and technologies. For example, researchers
at both corporations and universities have made significant strides
in the last year toward building computers that will be several
orders of magnitude smaller and more powerful than today's
silicon-based machines.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, nanotechnology is believed to have great potential in
biomedicine in applications ranging from improved drug delivery to
disease detection.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of mechanical devices, nanotechnology has already
created billion-dollar markets for devices like ink-jet printer
heads and accelerometers for automobiles. But researchers are
optimistic about even bigger payoffs. For example, researchers
believe they are on the track of new materials that are as much as
10 times as strong as steel, yet weigh only a fraction of it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation, the Pentagon, the Energy
Department, NASA, the Commerce Department and the National
Institutes of Health are all financing nanotechnology research now.
The National Nanotechnology Initiative calls for increasing
spending by these agencies _ as much as 400 percent in the case of
NASA _ in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an explosion of nanotechnology-oriented research
proposals coming from university campuses in the last year, a
government official said, and it has only been possible to finance
a fraction of them under the current spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Spending under the new program will be broken down into
financing long-term fundamental research; support for grand
challenge efforts; the creation of new research centers; the
establishment of a research infrastructure, and the study of
ethical, legal and societal implications of nanotechnology.

DETROIT SHOWS OFF ITS CONCEPT VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that concept cars were Jetson-like flights of
fancy: fun to look at but unlikely to ever be produced. That's
changed, as this year's North American International Auto Show
illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles that were concepts just a short time ago were unveiled
in Detroit this week as production models. Concepts on display
appeared well-targeted and developed with future production in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   These are boom days in the auto industry, with shared platforms
galore helping to make the types of cars and trucks and SUVs being
built a seemingly endless array.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are getting ever more power out of cleaner, regular
gasoline engines. Companies , notably Ford at this show, are also
looking to appear ``greener'' with a range of environmentally
friendly offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think that powerful cars, trucks, and SUVs are losing
their popularity. For those of you who hate SUVs and trucks, the
news from Detroit is not good: They are flourishing as ever more
manufacturers offer them up.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights of this year's show:
</P>
<P>
   --Acura rolled out the MD-X, a V6 SUV that clearly has Mercedes
and Lexus SUVs in its sights. Even Porsche has an SUV in the works,
due for the 2002 model year.
</P>
<P>
   --Ford caught attention on the SUV front with two products.
First was the anticipated Escape, a small SUV meant to compete with
Toyota's RAV4 and the Honda CR-V. The company also quietly, with no
formal presentation, dropped a rig called the Equator on the show
floor. Very Hummer-like in its wide stance and rugged, high-box
silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   --Toyota, as had long been expected, showed off its new SUV _
the Sequoia. It's built on the same platform as the critically
acclaimed Tundra pickup truck and will have the same smooth,
powerful V8 engine. With the RAV4 getting a makeover that makes it
a bit bigger, I have to wonder if the 4Runner's days are numbered,
pinched between the Sequoia and the RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   --Hummer _ now being built by GM _ matched Ford with a smaller,
less-military version of the big beast, the H2. Softer corners, not
quite as big, definitely less eclectic than the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   --DaimlerChrysler, saying it was aimed at boulder and boulevard,
offered the Jeep Varsity with a distinct Jeep grille, a wide body,
and a profile that looks like an old Volkswagen Thing on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   News on the pickup-truck front was equally rich as vehicles that
seem part truck/part SUV continue to sprout like weeds.
</P>
<P>
   --Dodge unveiled its MAXXcab, a cab-forward, four-door pickup
with a plush, SUV-like interior and a reasonably good-sized bed at
the back.
</P>
<P>
   --Perhaps the biggest surprise in pickup trucks came from
Volkswagen, which showed its Advanced Activity Concept, an
all-wheel-drive, turbocharged V10 diesel with a short bed.
</P>
<P>
   --Chevrolet added to the ``is-it-a-truck-or-something-else''
movement with two offerings: the Avalanche, an SUV with a bed, and
the SSR, a wild-looking pickup that may also be a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of minivans it was a relatively quiet show with one
exception:
</P>
<P>
   --Chrysler, still top dog but having lost some market share,
looked to recoup by adding more powerful engines to its lineup and
offering such features as power tailgates, power sliding doors, and
adjustable foot pedals.
</P>
<P>
   And while Chrysler was making this move in the sedate world of
minivans, it also showed a concept car that we can only hope it
will build:
</P>
<P>
   --The Chrysler 300 Hemi, a sleek piece of machinery evocative of
an Aston Martin or a Jaguar. It's a four-seater with about 350
horsepower and 350 lbs.-ft. of torque. Beautiful possibility in a
four-passenger convertible.
</P>
<P>
   And droptops continue to flourish:
</P>
<P>
   --Audi showed its TT roadster; the Honda S2000 and the Toyota
MR2 Spyder continued to draw crowds, even though photographs of
them had long ago made the rounds in all the auto magazines.
</P>
<P>
   --But the two-seater roadster that got the most attention came
from Jaguar, which unveiled an F-Type that is small for a Jag, but
promises plenty of power if they build it: either the AJ-V6 with
240 horsepower from the S-Type, or a 300-horse supercharged version
of that engine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of unveiling power and size, Ford took a more subtle, if
very broad, approach to its future.
</P>
<P>
   They've hooked up with Yahoo to get Ford owners on the Net. The
Internet, said one official, is the moving assembly line of the
21st century. To get consumers there, Ford offered its Think series
of products: Think City, a small electric car; Think Neighbor, a
jazzed-up golf cart that should sell in retirement communities; and
Think electric bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   --In the race to be green, Ford and GM went head-to-head, with
Ford showing the Prodigy, a Taurus-sized five-passenger sedan that
uses a diesel engine/electric motor hybrid to achieve 80 miles per
gallon. It also showed the Think Focus, based on the
gasoline-powered car of the same name, but this one is a fuel-cell
concept. GM unveiled its Precept, a hydrogen fuel-cell sedan that
could well be part of the long-term solution to ending dependency
on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, in what was certainly the most futuristic
unveiling, Ford displayed three boxy vehicles _ coupe, wagon, small
pickup _ called 24.7, the latter meaning these are vehicles from
which you can be linked to the outside world around the clock. They
offer voice-activated controls, Internet access, even stock
updates. It was truly a case of what's inside being far more
important than the vehicle that enclosed it.

GROUP OF 7 GEARS UP FOR AN EXPECTED NONEVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The meeting here this weekend of the men who chart the
financial and economic policies of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations may turn out to be a nonevent.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what their Japanese hosts are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the last two years, the global economy is in a
relatively fortunate state. Europe is enjoying a strong recovery,
the Asian economies have rebounded from crisis to post impressively
high growth rates, and the U.S. economy continues to defy the
naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Even Japan, recently treated as the naughty child of the
international economy, is feeling rather prosperous. The economy
appears to have bottomed out for now, and criticism from the United
States is likely to be subdued, thanks to a hefty package of
pump-priming measures Japan approved last fall and followed up with
a generous budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general the global economic situation has improved, so we
may not have difficult or _ how shall I say it? _ adversarial
discussions this time,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda, vice minister of
finance for international affairs at the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Japanese may pay a high price for harmony. The
advance teams that have been working to hammer out language for the
communique that will be issued at the end of the meeting have
failed to reach an agreement on a statement about foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese have been pushing for a reiteration of the
statement issued after the last G-7 meeting in September, when the
yen's rapid appreciation was perceived as a threat to the feeble
economic recovery here. The yen soared to a high of 124.32 against
the dollar last year, and stands now at 105.29 to the dollar. ``We
shared Japan's concern about the potential impact of the yen's
appreciation for the Japanese economy and the world economy,'' that
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rise of the yen has abated somewhat since then,
Japanese officials are still concerned that a failure to
acknowledge some concern about its level will lead to a renewed
effort by traders and speculators to increase the value of the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tricky thing,'' said one senior official at the
Ministry of Finance. ``If the market expects there to be some
strong language on exchange rates and that doesn't happen and there
is disappointment, the reaction could be to force an appreciation
of the yen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans are pushing hard to exclude any mention of
exchange rates in the statement this time, fearing that would turn
attention to what many regard as the weakness of the euro, which
now stands at 1.0166 to the dollar. Some in the U.S. and Japanese
contingents suspect that the Europeans are quietly fostering a
weaker euro to avoid more painful economic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been trying to work out the language of the final
ministerial statement are still wide apart on the issue, with the
Japanese pushing for strong language on exchange rates or at least
the yen and the Europeans arguing for no mention of exchange rates
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are in the middle, and may agree to make at least
a nod toward Japan's concerns. In exchange, they would expect yet
another promise from Japan to continue to work hard to encourage
domestic consumption and to stop flirting with the notion of
raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation, too, is piqued at Europe's seeming lack of
concern over the value of the euro and may use Japan's concerns as
leverage to gain a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But many think a statement does not matter one way or the other,
since the Group of Seven is not likely to back its words up with
action. ``There's a lot of talk about whether the G-7 communique
will include any expression of concern over a strong yen, as it did
in September,'' Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at the Bank
of America, wrote in a report Thursday. ``We expect that it will,
but we don't think it matters because we don't expect the G-7 to
act on those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   As various Bank of Japan officials have pointed out, the
stronger yen has not wreaked the havoc that many predicted it
would. Japanese companies have managed to post profits despite the
yen's higher value, and corporate sentiment continues to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers will also discuss Russia's economic situation,
although they are not likely to come to any conclusion about
whether the International Monetary Fund should resume its lending.
U.S. concerns about Russia's role in the war in Chechnya and the
interim nature of the current Russian government are hurdles most
consider too high to surmount.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeying to promote various candidates to replace Michel
Camdessus as head of the IMF is likely to generate considerable
interest, although the topic is not part of the agenda. ``Formally,
of course, the subject is not up for discussion,'' Kuroda said.
``Anyway, with so many potential candidates among the participants
in the meeting, how can we discuss it except in the corridors?''
</P>
<P>
   Japan will be pushing its dark-horse candidate, Dr. Eisuke
Sakakibara, the outspoken former occupant of Kuroda's office. He is
considered a long shot, but Japan is still lining up support for
him from its Asian neighbors and others.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Ministry of Finance acknowledge that if the
fund's European shareholders stay united, a European candidate will
be unbeatable since those countries control more than 30 percent of
the voting shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese have taken heart in the European failure thus
far to coalesce around a candidate, in spite of the stepped-up
lobbying efforts by the Germans to promote Caio Koch-Weser, a
senior bureaucrat in that country's finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The post has traditionally gone to a European, but the Japanese
are pushing against convention. ``We have significant support for
Sakakibara, and we will not be embarrassed to offer him as a
candidate,'' one Finance Ministry official said. ``It's very
important to make the point that this is not a decision that is
only to be made by the Europeans.''

   GORE'S LEAD GROWS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley in
New Hampshire is growing, though it is still within the margin of
sampling error, the latest American Research Group tracking poll
found. A survey of 600 likely Democratic primary voters from Monday
to Thursday found 46 percent favored Gore and 40 percent favored
Bradley. The margin of error was 4 percentage points. A poll that
had been taken from Sunday to Tuesday had found Gore with 2 percent
less support and Bradley with 2 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   FRIEDAN ENDORSES BRADLEY
</P>
<P>
   Betty Friedan, the feminist author and a founder of the National
Organization for Women, endorsed former Sen. Bill Bradley for
president Thursday. Among women, Bradley is trailing Vice President
Al Gore by a wide margin, polls show.
</P>
<P>
   FORBES ON ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes said Thursday that his two leading Republican
opponents, Sen. John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush, ``have become
what you might call the timid twins on tax cuts.'' Campaigning in
Iowa, Forbes said he would actively fight against abortion, and in
prepared remarks given to reporters that he did not deliver he
said: ``On the issue of life, Governor Bush and Senator McCain are
pacifists. When it comes to life, we can't afford a pacifist in the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   STAGING A COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who became a high-tech
multimillionaire after being voted out of office in the 1994
Republican surge, has announced that she will seek the Democratic
nomination for senator in Washington. She will face the state's
insurance commissioner, Deborah Senn, in the September primary for
the right to take on Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican.

TAYLOR IS GRANDMA'S NOT-SO-LITTLE BOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Nearly 11 years ago, when Fred Taylor was
13, his uncle, his grandfather and his grandmother left from his
hometown of Belle Glade, Fla., to drive to nearby West Palm Beach.
Taylor was too young to remember why they left and exactly where
they were going, but he remembers the story and that they left in a
black Beretta. The tragedy and the glory in it remain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were going to visit my mom,'' said Taylor, the
Jacksonville Jaguars' running back ``They drove down the highway
and ran into a deep canal full of water. My uncle got out and swam
to shore. A truck driver passed by and saw the accident. He jumped
in and saved my grandmother, pulling her to shore, because she
could not swim. My grandfather must have been pinned under the car.
He never made it; he drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor grew up fond of the uncle, Eddie Lusane. His grandfather,
Earthell Allen, was ``a man who could do anything well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to play together,'' Taylor said. ``He was the
Incredible Hulk, and I was Spiderman. I remember the hot Florida
days growing up with him with air conditioners that didn't always
work so well and on the cool nights using kerosene heaters. It was
rough sometimes. I know that I'm blessed a thousand times over.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially because his grandmother, Rosetta Lusane, was saved on
that night. She raised him. Even today, Taylor calls her mom and
his real mother by her first name, Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have and everything I know, I owe all to my
grandmother,'' Taylor said. ``Everything I do, I do for her. I
don't know what would have happened to me if she didn't make it out
of that accident. I probably would have gone down the wrong road.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Taylor sat abruptly upright and added: ``Or maybe I
would have become the man of the house and said, `It's going to be
this way,' and just lead everybody in our family. I'll say this:
I'm just glad it didn't happen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, every game he plays, every handoff he takes or pass he
catches, Taylor, the elusive and exciting running back, is always
driven by his grandmother. She now lives in a new home in West Palm
Beach that Taylor bought two years ago when he signed a six-year,
$10.7 million rookie contract that included a $5 million signing
bonus. His grandmother has never attended any of his games, and she
will not be in the stands when Jacksonville battles the Tennessee
Titans in the AFC championship game here on Sunday. She cannot
stand seeing him hit.
</P>
<P>
   But she loves to watch him run.
</P>
<P>
   And Taylor has done plenty of that. He owns nearly every
Jacksonville franchise rushing record and last week, in
Jacksonville's 62-7 playoff thrashing of Miami, Taylor ran 90 yards
for a touchdown in the longest run in NFL playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor keeps running toward greatness even though he has
been slowed in each of his two pro seasons by injuries. In fact,
this season he missed six games with a hamstring injury in his left
leg and played sparingly in two others because of that injury. But
with Taylor in the lineup, the Jaguars are a more formidable threat
to reach Super Bowl XXXIV and to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 6 feet 1 inch and a deceptive 230 pounds. makes the
Jaguars more gritty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has speed, quickness, power and makes good decisions with
the ball in his hands,'' said Jaguars defensive end Tony Brackens.
``Fred can make a play that turns a game completely around like
Deion Sanders. The nation does not know just how good he is but if
we get to the Super Bowl, they will find out.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Jacksonville must beat Tennessee. That could happened if
Taylor can outplay Tennessee's star running back, Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Eddie and I think the difference between us is he's
a little bigger and he has to get going for his speed to be a
factor,'' Taylor said. ``But I'm 230 pounds with 185-pound feet and
speed. Sometimes I think teams watch tape on me and think I'm
smaller, like 210 pounds, because I'm quick. I see linebackers try
to run up on me and think they are going to get the best lick, but
I do. I see defensive backs rush up and try to tackle me high, and
that is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt my hamstring in the second game of the season, and I'm
only 95 percent even right now. I've had to alter my running style
a little bit. Some of the cuts I know I can make I'm not doing now
because I can't plant the same way off my left leg. But it's coming
back. I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready for the Titans' defense and its rookie sensation, end
Jevon Kearse, Taylor's former teammate at the University of
Florida. Taylor said that he and Kearse are planning an off-season
trip together to Costa Rica with other friends. He calls Kearse ``a
monster now.'' But that is how Taylor describes the Jaguars, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an apt description of Taylor. He became a high school
star in south Florida, did the same in central Florida in college
and now, in northern Florida, in Jacksonville, is becoming a pro
football staple.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV, his biggest and brightest stage, is within
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be crazy here on Sunday,'' Taylor said. ``We've
got to grit our teeth and hit them back. I expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they have destiny on their side, but why can't
destiny be on our side? My life has been full of destiny and hope
and dreams against great odds. My grandmother could tell you
that.''

BUSH, PRESSED TO CLARIFY VIEWS, REPEATS OPPOSITION TO ABORTION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Iowa)   (jw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PELLA, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday that the Supreme
Court had interpreted the Constitution too broadly with its 1973
ruling that established the right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roe vs. Wade was a reach,'' Bush said crisply and
unequivocally at a news conference here Thursday afternoon. ``It
overstepped the constitutional bounds, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the governor of Texas, also said that if elected
president, he would probably oppose any approval by the Food and
Drug Administration of RU-486, the pill that essentially causes a
miscarriage in the very earliest stages of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's abortion,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said that he had stated similar feelings and
positions before, but his comments on abortion Thursday were more
emphatic, if no more conclusive, than usual. Bush was also kept on
the subject of abortion longer than he likes to dwell there, and
grew more and more visibly uneasy as the questions kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has sent out hazy signals about the degree of
passion he brings to the issue of abortion, simultaneously
conveying a deep personal disapproval of it and a disinclination to
put it anywhere near the top of his political priorities.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly said that he will not use opposition to
abortion as a litmus test for nominees to the Supreme Court, but
that any judge he considers will have to be what he calls a
``strict constructionist.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked Thursday what that kind of judge, interpreting
the Constitution in the literal manner that Bush favors, would be
compelled to conclude about the legality of abortion, Bush gave his
response about Roe vs. Wade being a reach.
</P>
<P>
   But he clearly did not want to elaborate, his body tensing and
his voice assuming a slightly perturbed edge as reporters continued
to press him for greater clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is heavily favored to win the Iowa caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican voters in this state include many Christian
conservatives, and the wealthy publisher Steve Forbes, who places
second to Bush in most polls of Iowa voters, has firmly stated an
opposition to abortion and sought to portray Bush as soft on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout his campaign, Bush has said that he will not push
for a constitutional amendment to ban abortions, though he favors
one, because the requisite support for such a measure does not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his twin 18-year-old daughters felt about abortion,
Bush testily said that reporters should respect their privacy, and
he did not budge when a reporter pointed out that he had recounted,
in his autobiography ``A Charge to Keep,'' that one of his
daughters argued with him about the death penalty. Bush
emphatically supports it.

   Weinberg said one explanation for the corruption was that the
union is highly decentralized, meaning its locals more financial
autonomy than most other unions. One episode of corruption
described in the report involves Robert Gordon, who was ousted from
his job as treasurer of the Milwaukee local representing 220 sewer
workers after a bookkeeper discovered that some money was missing.
A union audit reported that Gordon had apparently embezzled $96,000
by writing 208 checks to himself that were not approved and were
not used for union purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold ourselves to very high standards, not only in AFSCME,
but in Wisconsin,'' said Richard Abelson, a top official with the
union in Wisconsin. ``Our expectation is things like that don't
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's lawyer, Gerald Boyle, said his client was talking to
law-enforcement authorities and was working with union officials.
``We will take care of making sure that whatever needs to be put
back into the union's coffers is put back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Steven K. Grubb, the treasurer of a
municipal workers' local in Elkhart, Ind., wrote $13,500 in union
checks for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ard, executive director of the council representing all of
the union's 8,000 workers in Indiana, said Grubb had been removed
from office when the local's other officers uncovered the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anybody's personal money,'' she said. ``This money
belongs to the members of the union.'' She said that Grubb had
admitted to union officials that he siphoned off the money.
</P>
<P>
   Another insurance claim made by the union involved the
controller of a district council in New Jersey, who the union said
stole $42,700 by forging checks and making unauthorized
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Another claim involved the president of a Long Island, N.Y.,
chapter of the union, who the union said stole $14,870 from the
union. The official, Pasquale Ferraro, was removed by a union
judicial panel, although he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Twigg, an agent for the union's insurance company, St.
Paul Cos., said, ``I don't know if they have more claims than other
unions. I don't find them to be extraordinary or unextraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other unions, the Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees has what is known as a fidelity bond insurance
policy that provides for reimbursing the union if an official
commits dishonest acts that cause the union to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Twigg said his company examines all such claims to make sure
they are valid.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention several prominent episodes of
corruption not covered by the claims report. In 1998, for example,
the secretary-treasurer of the union's district council in
Washington pleaded guilty to embezzling $761,000, while the
council's finance director confessed to stealing $73,500.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the claims that St. Paul Cos. processed between last Oct. 1
and Nov. 22, the report said, the company paid off $605,000 of $2.6
million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason the company paid off less than the claimed
amount was that the union claimed $2.2 million for money it said
was stolen by Charles Hughes, the former president of a local in
District Council 37, representing New York City's school crossing
guards and cafeteria aides. The policy covering Hughes provided a
maximum of $500,000 in reimbursement to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Kedia, Hughes' lawyer, said Thursday that her client was
innocent of wrongdoing. The report added several new details about
the District Council 37 scandal, asserting, for example, that
several aides to Hughes had improperly written hundreds of
thousands of dollars in checks that ultimately benefited him
personally.

`HIDDEN' WHITE HOUSE-NETWORK ALLIANCE WAS LARGELY OUT IN THE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Like all good conspiracy theories, this one
features at least a germ of truth.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that in a few instances _ perhaps as few as two _ the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, or ONDCP,
effected changes in the scripts of prime-time television series.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact of government involvement in TV programming is
disturbing because it raises the specters of censorship and social
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is a more benign explanation than readers of
Salon.com, an online magazine, were afforded in last week's
headline-making expose.
</P>
<P>
   The WB network said this week that it sent scripts of episodes
for two now-defunct comedy series, ``Smart Guy'' and ``The Wayans
Bros.,'' to the drug czar's office because it sought the
government's technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to accept the innocent explanation, much like the
makers of a TV movie about an airplane crash soliciting expertise
from the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the extent of the the drug office's participation in
network storytelling might be considered bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   The single most documented case in the Salon expos &LR; e &LR;  was about
a ``Smart Guy'' episode in which the show's underage lead
character, played by Tahj Mowry, drank beer at a party. The drug
office apparently suggested, and won, substantial changes in the
depiction of the party and the characters who induced Mowry's
character to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Other key aspects of the Salon report appear to be overblown or
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The story outlined a ``hidden'' alliance between the drug office
and the TV networks. In fact, the relationship was not secret.
</P>
<P>
   Salon also said that through a complicated swap of program
content for advertising time, the networks realized a financial
windfall by packing anti-drug messages into TV shows. That doesn't
appear to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   First, the secrecy question. Dr. Donald Vereen, deputy director
of the White House drug office, told reporters Friday that the TV
initiative was the subject of three congressional hearings, none of
them secret.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Fili-Krushel, president of ABC, said her network
subsequently organized an open, two-hour informational seminar for
the drug office to talk with program producers about working
substance-abuse themes into TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had another discussion with our producers,'' she
added. ``We did not follow up. We did not ask whether they were
incorporating these into story lines or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB network issued press releases that noted the drug
office's ``technical assistance'' in shows where it was relevant.
At the close of the ``Smart Guy'' and ``Wayans Bros.'' episodes,
the WB also inserted public service messages, featuring the shows'
stars, and publicly noting the ``technical guidance'' from the
office.
</P>
<P>
   These moves aren't exactly indicative of an effort to hide the
networks' contacts with the drug czar. Instead, they're typical of
what the networks view as fulfilling public service obligations.
They're workaday examples of networks trying to mix responsible
broadcasting with public pats on their own backs.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation that the networks profited is the thorniest in
the Salon story, and requires the most explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress authorized $1 billion for the White House drug office
to buy TV advertising over five years, beginning in 1998. The main
thrust of the commercials would be to discourage youthful drug
abuse, smoking and underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got complicated. The drug office was required by
Congress to obtain a matching commitment from the private sector.
In the case of TV commercials, that meant the networks were to
meet, dollar for dollar, the time they sold to the government with
an anti-substance abuse effort of their own. That presumably
entailed the networks setting aside free public service
announcements, or PSAs, to complement the government's paid
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug office approved another method of meeting the
matching obligation. If the networks could demonstrate that they'd
carried anti-substance abuse themes in their shows, they'd be given
matching credit, reducing the obligation to televise PSAs.
</P>
<P>
   The office loved this approach. Getting the right messages
inside TV shows presumably would be far more effective than
commercials and PSAs. ``That means they're getting (the message)
again in a different way,'' said Vereen.
</P>
<P>
   Salon alleged that the networks used the programming loophole to
reclaim time from free PSAs and convert it into millions of dollars
of commercial time they could sell to regular advertisers. In
effect, this allegedly gave the networks a financial inducement to
fulfill their match by working anti-drug themes into the body of TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the networks responded, sending scripts and cassette
tapes to the drug office for matching credit. Vereen said 109
programs were counted against the match. Besides ``Smart Guy'' and
``The Wayans Bros.,'' they included ``ER,'' ``7th Heaven,'' ``Home
Improvement,'' ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Sports Night,'' ``General
Hospital,'' ``Cosby,'' ``Boy Meets World,'' ``Beverly Hills,
90210,'' ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' and ``The Drew Carey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But the networks deny ordering up anti-drug or anti-booze
stories. Generally speaking, they scoured their schedules for
episodes that seemed to have satisfied the requirements and sent
scripts or cassettes to the office as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been too difficult to find anti-substance abuse
story lines that arose separately from the drug office initiative.
The networks air these sorts of so-called ``very special episodes''
as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did we call any producers to ask them to include
anti-drug messages in their programs,'' said ABC's Fili-Krushel.
</P>
<P>
   After the Salon story, the drug czar's office issued a statement
last weekend saying that it had ``always assumed that any
transcripts or programs submitted for public service value
qualification were final products and not subject to further
change.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't account for the apparent script modifications to
the two WB shows, ``Smart Guy'' and ``The Wayans Bros.'' It could
be that the drug office regarded those situations, at least when
the scripts were first sent to it, not as match submissions but as
routine requests for technical advice.
</P>
<P>
   That's the explanation of Jamie Kellner, chief executive officer
of the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consulting has nothing to do with the match,'' he said
Monday. ``The match is made by the advertising agency. ONDCP has
technical expertise in the area, and it seemed logical to us to do
that. We do that with many other groups as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In its press statement, the office acknowledged that ``the
creative community has occasionally asked ONDCP to provide
technical assistance and advice on the depiction of illicit
substances and issues during its creative process. ... ONDCP has
responded to every such request.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the money? There is no credible evidence, at least
not yet, that the networks returned any recouped PSA time to their
sales departments to be sold as advertising availabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The WB's Kellner said that when programs were credited for their
content, thus reducing the matching PSA obligation, the saved time
simply reverted to the network's general inventory of available PSA
and promo time.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner, who was president of the Fox network before he came to
the WB, said, ``The PSA inventory comes out of our (promo) ad and
PSA pool, not our commercial pool. There's a certain number of
commercial spots we sell per hour on our shows. That's not our PSA
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PSA inventory comes out of a place you might see a spot
for `Felicity' promoting next Sunday's episode. So there's not an
economic benefit in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Wallau, president of administration and operations at ABC,
also said his network returned none of the recaptured PSA spots to
the sales department.
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said the White House office bought $45 million in
advertising time on ABC during the 1998-99 TV season, the first
year of the initiative. ``We matched with $40 million worth of PSA
time,'' she said. ``We covered the rest of the match with
programming by submitting cassettes after the show had aired.''
</P>
<P>
   Fili-Krushel said ABC stopped claiming matching credit for
programs in 1999 because the drug office began asked for tapes in
advance, and ABC refused. ``It wasn't something we were comfortable
doing,'' she said. ``We had a meeting internally. We decided no. I
don't know the exact details of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the remaining mysteries in the controversy. No
other network noted a change in the drug office's policy between
the 1998-99 season and the 1999-2000 season, and the office insists
that it never demanded advance scripts from anyone. There has been
press speculation about possible miscommunication between ABC and
the drug czar's office.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who witnessed a flustered and imprecise Vereen trying
to detail his office's initiative Friday could hardly be surprised
that the drug office might be accused of miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   It does appear, in hindsight, that what Salon ascribed to an
unholy collusion between the federal government and the TV networks
actually sprang from a long-standing network policy of mixing
normal profit with a dollop of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the issue here,'' Kellner said. ``I certainly
think it's worth exploring. But from the side of the business that
we come from, we enjoy putting those messages into the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy watching our network when we feel we're doing
something that pro-social and responsible, especially because we
have such a large number of younger viewers. This is a really
important issue to us, and we've been doing this for many, many
years.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Schwab Top Suitor for CyBerCorp Union  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Charles Schwab Corp. has emerged as the most likely buyer of
CyBerCorp.com, an Austin, Texas, online broker that does business
exclusively with hyperactive stock traders, according to people
familiar with the situation.
<P>
   While CyBerCorp is talking with several other suitors, Schwab,
the nation's largest online and discount broker, appears to be the
most motivated to pay the $100 million or more the firm is
demanding, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   CyBerCorp founder and Chief Executive Officer Philip Berber
wouldn't name names but said he is talking with a major online
broker, two traditional Wall Street firms and a company that
operates an electronic stock trading system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been engaged in material discussions,'' Berber said.
``No announcement is imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the situation said that while Schwab has
the inside track, other potential buyers are Lehman Brothers,
Merrill Lynch and Instinet Corp., operator of the largest
after-hours stock trading system. Merrill couldn't be reached.
Schwab and the other companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   For San Francisco's Schwab, which traditionally has courted
long-term investors, buying a firm whose clients are full-time
speculators who typically buy and sell several stocks in a single
day would be a sharp departure. Indeed, Schwab officials have
declared that frenetic ``day traders'' are not the kinds of
customers they seek.
</P>
<P>
   CyBerCorp customers are nothing if not frenetic. The firm's
2,500 clients carry out a staggering 20,000 trades per day, almost
10 trades per day each, making the 4-year-old firm the 10th-biggest
online broker. By comparison, Schwab's 3.3 million online customers
seem almost somnolent, executing 234,000 trades per day _ which
works out to an average of about 2 trades per month each.
</P>
<P>
   CyBerCorp's business is mushrooming, with revenue nearly
quintupling to $24 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What Schwab apparently wants is not so much CyBerCorp's
itchy-fingered clients as its technology. Analysts said the firm
owns the industry's most advanced software for locating the best
available stock prices from among all market participants, who may
be operating from a dozen or more separate computer trading
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to find out where the best possible pricing
is,'' said Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Gary Craft.
CyBerCorp's ``technology is pretty unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Berber, a 41-year-old, Irish-born entrepreneur who moved to the
United States in 1991, said CyBerCorp's software uses hunt-and-seek
technology. ``We can find the best bid and offer on Nasdaq in a
nanosecond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling such technology is a big competitive advantage in
attracting not only hyperactive day traders, but also moderately
active traders who, above all, are interested in buying and selling
securities at the best prices.
</P>
<P>
   Such customers, who may trade once or twice per week or more,
are a top-priority market for Schwab. It offers them a variety of
special services and Velocity, its sophisticated trading system for
active investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a commitment to those clients,'' said Susanne
Lyons, Schwab's chief of retail client services. ``We ask ourselves
what are the newest technologies we need to make part of our
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading software originally aimed at hyperactive traders, such
as streaming news and data, ``can become more mainstream,'' she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab insiders said the loss of such moderately active clients
to cheaper online brokers is a major headache. In an effort to keep
active traders from jumping ship, Schwab plans to offer volume
discounts from its $29.95 online commission, they said.

 Cnet Expands, Purchases MySimon.com  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco's Cnet, an Internet hub for tech news and gadgets,
will broaden its offerings by acquiring MySimon.com, an online
comparison shopping service for a wide variety of consumer goods.
<P>
   Cnet said yesterday that it will buy the closely held Santa
Clara company in a stock deal valued at roughly $700 million, based
on yesterday's closing price. The deal should close by the end of
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company also will change its name to Cnet Networks to
reflect the growing diversity of sites _ including Builder.com and
Computers.com _ under its banner.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet, whose flagship site of the same name already lets
consumers compare and buy computers, software, printers and other
high-tech paraphernalia, said broader services like MySimon.com are
becoming more valuable as consumers look to navigate the exploding
number of e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet compares products from 150 vendors, while MySimon searches
scours 2,500 online merchants for products ranging from cookbooks
to golf clubs to power tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we started looking at the comparison shopping space, we saw
it was taking off, and the numbers were off the charts for
MySimon,'' said Halsey Minor, chairman and chief executive of Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, a New York firm that tracks Web
traffic, the number of unique visitors to MySimon.com skyrocketed
from 171,000 in September to 1.9 million in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes Cnet out of just the technology space and puts them
much closer to what the general public is buying online,'' said
Seema Williams, an analyst at Internet consulting firm Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   But some wonder how Cnet will compete with better-known names
like Amazon.com and Yahoo's shopping channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cnet is definitely a known place for tech, but I don't know if
it's going to be a place where people who want a new frying pan are
going to go for comparison shopping,` said Zona Research chief
analyst Clay Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Minor said, MySimon will remain a separate site
with separate offices for its 66 employees. Its management team,
including chief executive Josh Goldman, will also stay at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like MySimon and Dealtime.com let Web surfers select a
category such as ``home and garden,'' or ``sports and recreation,''
type in a brand name (and sometimes a price range) and let
so-called `shopping bots' _ short for robots _ search the Web for
the specific product.
</P>
<P>
   While sites like these pride themselves on drawing from an array
of e-tailers, few are completely objective in their searches.
Merchants don't pay to be part of MySimon.com searches, but they do
receive top billing in search results for buying ads on the site.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, 650-employee Cnet has promoted an image of
cutting through the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   In opposition to many of the frenetic, quick-cutting television
ads for dot-coms, Cnet recently launched a series of strangely
simple spots. In one, a man wearing a Cnet T-shirt leads a man
wearing a shirt that says ``You'' away from a fellow whose shirt
reads ``The Wrong Digital Camera'' and toward one whose shirt says
``The Right Digital Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Cnet stock closed down 50 cents yesterday at $62.19.

 Saks to Close Bullock &AMP; Jones  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bullock &AMP; Jones, an upscale clothier that has catered to San
Francisco's elite since 1853, will close next month.
<P>
   Saks Inc., which purchased Bullock &AMP; Jones in July 1998, said
the Union Square retailer did not make enough money to justify
keeping it open. After 147 years in business, the store will close
its doors on February 19.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock &AMP; Jones' prime three-story location at 340 Post St. is
now up for grabs. Club Monaco, a casual clothing chain owned by
Polo Ralph Lauren Inc., is close to a deal on the space, which was
custom-built for Bullock &AMP; Jones in 1923, real estate sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Saks will continue to operate the Bullock &AMP; Jones catalog and
will introduce Bullock &AMP; Jones clothing in a limited number of Saks
stores this year, said Carolyn Biggs, executive vice president for
the Birmingham, Ala., department store operator.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Bullock &AMP; Jones store, which sells conservatively
tailored, high-end menswear and a smaller selection of womenswear,
has been an underperformer, said Biggs. Saks ``sets return
expectations on every investment and unfortunately this project
wasn't making it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Goodwill, who sold Bullock &AMP; Jones to Saks a year and a
half ago, said yesterday that he is heartbroken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold the business in good faith,'' Goodwill said. ``I
nurtured that business and built it up over 20 years. Then I
reached a point in my life when it was time for me to move on and I
thought they were going to take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks ``may have had good intentions, but I think they weren't
able to execute it,'' said Goodwill, who still owns the Post Street
building, which is worth an estimated $30 million. ``There's a
difference between running a family-run, hand-run business and a
corporate business.''
</P>
<P>
   Saks declined to say whether the store was losing money. Sales
have been static in recent years, even as many other Union Square
retailers have seen dramatic increases, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock &AMP; Jones was founded in the Financial District during the
Gold Rush. Goodwill and his wife, Susan Goodwill, bought the
company in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock &AMP; Jones' strength was that they merchandised things
together beautifully and created their own look,'' said one Union
Square retail watcher. Since Saks came in, ``the windows, the whole
store has not been right.''
</P>
<P>
   From Saks' point of view, it probably makes more sense to offer
Bullock &AMP; Jones merchandise in the Saks Men's Store at 220 Post St.
than for Saks to run two upscale men's stores a stone's throw from
each other, this observer said.
</P>
<P>
   Saks also runs a full-line Saks Fifth Avenue department store in
the same block as Bullock &AMP; Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Saks is responsible for finding a sublessee for the Bullock &AMP;
Jones space. With the downtown real estate market so hot, Saks may
be able to rent it out at a profit, sources speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Saks paid $25 million for Bullock &AMP; Jones' inventory and catalog
business in 1998. Annual sales at the Post Street store were
reported at the time as $10 million and catalog sales as $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs declined to disclose current sales of either division.
Bullock &AMP; Jones' catalog operation, formerly based in South San
Francisco, was moved out of state shortly after Saks took over.
</P>
<P>
   Club Monaco, a Canadian chain that was purchased by New York's
Polo Ralph Lauren last year, is likely to be the next new tenant on
Union Square, sources said. The first Club Monaco store in the Bay
Area is located in the San Francisco Shopping Centre on Market and
Fifth streets.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call to Polo Ralph Lauren was not returned
yesterday. A Saks spokeswoman declined to comment on lease
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Club Monaco sells cosmetics and colorful, trendy clothing, with
most items retailing for under $100. It is best known as the source
of the lipstick Monica Lewinsky wore during her interview with
Barbara Walters; a waiting list quickly developed for the lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock &AMP; Jones' 29 sales associates will receive transfer
opportunities or severance packages, Saks said.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Holdings, owner of the chi-chi Saks Fifth Avenue chain, was
purchased by Proffitt's Inc., a Southern department store holding
company, in 1998. Proffitt's subsequently changed its name to Saks
Inc.

 Wine Study Lauds State's Grapes of Wealth  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The California wine industry uncorked its first comprehensive
economic impact study yesterday. Label the findings impressive.
<P>
   Wine is the leading finished agricultural product from the
nation's leading agricultural state and generates $33 billion in
annual revenues, wages and economic activity, according to a report
commissioned by the Wine Institute and the California Association
of Winegrapecq &LR;  Growers. Nationwide, the California wine industry
has a $48 billion economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 847 wineries and 4,400 grape growers produce $12.3
billion in California wine sales. The industry creates 145,000 jobs
in the state and $4.3 billion in annual wages. It also attracts
10.7 million visitors, accounts for $1.2 billion in tourism dollars
and pays $3.1 billion in taxes and fees, including $1 billion to
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This validates the position of the California wine industry as
one of the crown jewels in the state's economy, culture and
world-class image,'' said Wine Institute President John De Luca.
The wine Wine  &LR; industry files plenty of production reports each
year, but until now, it has not developed hard data on its full
economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   Because winemakers wine makers  &LR; and wine sellers are fighting
various distribution, labeling and taxation battles in Washington,
D.C., De Luca acknowledged that the new report ``is a political
document as well as an economic document.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry hopes to use the study to show that it pays its
fair share of taxes and to combat proponents of so-called ``sin
taxes'' against alcohol producers.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-month study conducted by Motto, Kryla &AMP; Fisher LLP in
St. Helena ``shows how important we are not only to the
agricultural community, but to urban communities,'' said De Luca.
``We're not just manufacturers of booze, but vitally involved in
many different sectors of California economic life. We need to be
understood and supported.''
</P>
<P>
   To put the wine industry's $33 billion economic impact on
California in perspective, MKF partner Vic Motto noted, ``total
U.S. online sale of goods over the Internet is projected to be $29
billion in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the research findings:
</P>
<P>
   _This year, Americans will spend about $20 billion on wine, with
about 72 percent of it coming from California.
</P>
<P>
   _During Over  &LR; the past five years, California's wine sales have
grown at a compound annual rate of 12 percent, about double the
U.S. economy as a whole. The state produces 93 percent of all U.S.
wine, and the only larger producers are France, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   _Wine grape acreage has increased by nearly a third in
California, to 427,000 from 324,000 acres (equivalent to 55 percent
of the area of Rhode Island) in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   _Napa and Sonoma counties account for a third of the state's
grape growers, nearly half its wineries and nearly 60 percent of
the $1.2 billion in wine industry tourism revenues. (Twenty-seven
percent of visitors to San Francisco also take in the ``Wine
Country.'')
</P>
<P>
   _The wine industry has a large ripple effect. Besides tourism,
other wine sub-industries include glass (3,000 employees, $1.2
billion annual revenues); cooperage (240 employees and $212 million
revenues); corks and capsules (270 employees and $175 million
annual revenues) and wine labels (1,100 employees, 3 billion labels
and $106 million revenues).

 Barber Schools Still Buzzing Around  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Clebert Triggs settled into a chair at San Francisco Barber College
and said to the student who would be doing his hair, ``You cut
before?''
<P>
   The student, Shan Zhen Yin, stared back. It was her first day at
the school. She spoke no English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go with the grain,'' Triggs instructed, running a hand over
his hair. ``With the grain?''
</P>
<P>
   Shan said nothing. She gazed at Triggs' hair, and then at the
razor in her hand, and then again at Triggs' hair. Finally, at a
loss for more decisive action, she handed the razor to her
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Triggs, a regular at the barber college, calmly set the razor at
the correct level and handed it back. Shan proceeded to give him a
trim.
</P>
<P>
   Not all haircuts at barber colleges begin on such a dubious
note. But then again, for $5, what do you want?
</P>
<P>
   Some say old-fashioned barber shops are dying out. They rightly
observe that beauty salons and hair stylists are proliferating,
while traditional shave-and-a-haircut providers are no longer to be
found in many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that there are more job openings for licensed
barbers than there are barbers to fill them. And while the number
of barbers at work today is just a tiny fraction of the number of
cosmetologists _ the industry term for a salon stylist _ barber
colleges continue to turn out new graduates, just as they have for
the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barber business went into a slump during the long-hair
era,'' said James Knauss, owner of San Francisco Barber College and
affiliated institutions in Sacramento, Stockton and Fresno, as well
as serving as executive director of the California Barber College
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guys these days are getting tapered cuts again,'' he said.
``And if you want a tapered cut done right, you go to a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 barber colleges statewide, and no fewer than three
in San Francisco alone.
</P>
<P>
   However, the total number of licensed barbers statewide has held
steady around 22,000 for the past quarter-century, according to the
California Department of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The number of licensed cosmetologists, meanwhile, has soared to
about 244,000.
</P>
<P>
   These days, San Francisco Barber College, which has been on
Sixth Street near Mission for more than 40 years, caters primarily
to female Asian students _ women who may have been professional
haircutters in their home countries and are now undergoing required
classroom training for a California license.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away is Moler Barber College, established in 1910
by barbering legend A.B. Moler, who is credited with opening the
nation's first barber college in Chicago back in 1893.
</P>
<P>
   The current owner is Donald Forfang II _ he doesn't like to be
called ``junior'' _ whose father, Donald Forfang I, purchased the
school in 1954 after about 25 years running his own barbershop. The
younger Forfang took over the college in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more job opportunities than I have graduates,'' he
said. ``There are more shops open now than there were 10 years ago,
simply because hair is shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorter hairstyles, of course, require more frequent
maintenance, which means more visits to the barber.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans, many of whom favor close-cropped ``fades'' or
intricate designs in their hair, are the most frequent patrons of
Bay Area barbershops. Most of the students at Moler are themselves
African American, and many are now looking to barbering as a way of
turning their lives around.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Scott, 24, will graduate in March after more than a year
at the barber college. He has big plans after pulling earlier
stints as a construction and warehouse worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an entrepreneur and open my own business,'' he
said. ``I don't want to work for nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Guardado, 38, used to be a gang member, until a bullet in
his back two years ago convinced him that a lifestyle change was in
order. After four months at the barber college, he already has
plans for his own shop _ ``a real high-class place, sort of Art
Deco.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Allen, 55, has been at the college just two months, and
his wife worries that close proximity to his old downtown haunts
will compel him to return to some bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not going to happen,'' he said. ``You can't come in
here high. The others wouldn't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right. Even a casual visitor can sense the loose
familiarity among students, making the barber college a
surprisingly upbeat place to hang around. Maybe it's not quite as
chummy as Floyd's barbershop on the old ``Andy Griffith Show,'' but
it rises above the generally downtrodden surroundings outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that barber colleges usually are located in
fairly rough-and-tumble neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to get clientele,'' said Moler's Forfang. ``People are
hesitant enough to go to a barber college. In an upscale area,
people will frequent upscale shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Moler charges $5.25 for a haircut. But, along with San Francisco
Barber College and Bayview Barber College on Third Street, it also
cuts hair for free for low-income people receiving vouchers from
local charities and churches.
</P>
<P>
   At Bayview, owner Dwayne Robinson said demand is strong in his
neighborhood not just for $5 haircuts but also for a new generation
of barbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only five shops here and about 49,000 African
Americans,'' he said. ``There's no way five shops can handle
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayview Barber College was established in 1998 with grant money
from City Hall. Robinson said the school has attracted 33 students
since opening.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy, or cheap, to become a licensed barber. To become
qualified to take the state licensing exam, aspiring cutters attend
39-week programs _ or longer if part time _ that cost about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Along with on-the-job training, instruction includes classroom
sessions on such topics as shaving, coloring and proper hygiene.
There are also lessons on management of one's own shop and various
barber-related laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among these laws is a state ruling that only establishments with
a licensed barber on the premises can display a striped barber pole
out front.
</P>
<P>
   The state also mandates that the blue liquid in which barbers
soak their combs must be ``an EPA-registered disinfectant with
demonstrated bactericidal, fungicidal and virucidal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Whitney, who oversees California's barber industry on
behalf of the Department of Consumer Affairs, said she is unable to
disclose other things that an aspiring barber must know because of
``security considerations'' surrounding the licensing exam.
</P>
<P>
   She did reveal, though, that exam-takers are allowed to use an
interpreter when demonstrating their skills and knowledge, which is
why some students at San Francisco Barber College can go through
the entire program without speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   Willem Kamal, an instructor at the college, said he uses ``body
language'' to communicate with his students, who he said often take
jobs in Chinatown after graduating.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Moler's Forfang believes would-be barbers are best
advised to keep chitchat to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach my students to be cautious about having lots of people
hanging out at barbershops,'' he said. ``Too much hanging out will
discourage business.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are occasions as well when a barber must exercise
self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people come in here with an attitude,'' said Jimmy
Ford, a Moler student. ``You got to bite your tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, though, the barbering experience remains largely
unchanged today from decades before. ``Playboy'' still even gives
free subscriptions to barbershops so patrons will have something of
interest to peruse prior to a trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of great things about this industry,'' said
Forfang. ``Everyone who comes to see you wants to, and once you get
a license, you can work wherever you like for as long as you
like.''
</P>
<P>
   The average barber, he noted, pulls down as much as $40,000
annually and stays on the job for 25 years. A cosmetologist, by
comparison, typically remains at the same shop no more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Those now entering the barbering trade seem mindful of its long
history and say they take pride in what they offer customers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, barber-college customers appreciate the low-cost
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy can come in here and get himself fixed up,'' said the
Rev. James Boyd, a homeless advocate who was paying a social call
on the patrons of San Francisco Barber College. ``There's no reason
to be looking shaggy.''
</P>
<P>
   He took in his own reflection in one of the mirrors and noted
that he'd have to return soon for a trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look good,'' Boyd said, ``you feel good.''

 Pac Bell Plans to Fight Big Fine  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   A month after Pacific Bell was ordered to pay $44 million for
sleazy sales practices, the telephone company plans to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company will formally ask the California Public
Utilities Commission to throw out the judgment as ``legally
flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it was wrong,'' said company attorney Colleen O'Grady
Diamond yesterday. Pacific Bell plans to file a 50-page appeal
today.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a PUC administrative law judge fined the company
$20 million and ordered Pacific Bell to spend another $24 million
on a consumer-education campaign after finding the company had
misled customers into buying extra features they didn't want or
need.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Pacific Bell bundled call forwarding, three-way
calling and other extras into a package called the ``basics.'' The
company was also fined $16.5 million for marketing abuses in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific Bell says the decision was based on only 15 isolated
complaints collected by consumer groups. Executives said its
customer surveys show most customers are satisfied. ``There was a
dearth of complaints,'' said Pacific Bell President Bill Blase.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pacific Bell insists it complied with existing
regulations. For instance, commissioners OKd a request to call some
of its calling packages names like the ``basics'' and
``essentials.'' And regulators never specifically ordered the
company to tell customers they could opt to automatically block
their number from showing up on Caller ID; Judge Maribeth Bushey
ruled that Pacific Bell purposely didn't mention the option to help
promote its lucrative Caller ID business.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell's Blase said he feels optimistic that either the
judge or commissioners will modify the fine. But a watchdog group
didn't give the appeal much chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the company were smart, they would recognize this as a
wake-up call,'' said Charles Carbone, a consumer advocate with the
Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego, which filed the
initial complaint that led to the ruling. ``The final opinion went
easy on them,'' he said, pointing out the company took in $391
million last year for custom calling features.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 15 complaints Pacific Bell cited, Carbone
said customer service representatives testified that they had
misled customers and spotted widespread patterns of complaints that
were never recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Carbone also said the company violated numerous laws and
regulations by misleading customers, even if commissioners didn't
spell out every detail.
</P>
<P>
   He said Pacific Bell is still on the hook for misleading
customers by using terms like ``essentials.'' Although the PUC did
agree to the use of the term, he said the commissioners only
``rubber stamped'' the term in a fast-track process called
tariffing.

UPN THINKS IT KNOWS WHAT BOYS WANT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ UPN is testament to the power of the survival
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 months ago, its top executives oozed sincerity in
outlining the network's unshakable core belief in general audience
programming.
</P>
<P>
   That strategem led UPN into a near-fatal 1998-99 season, after
which many observers wrote the network off for dead. Without
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Pasadena, the same UPN execs oozed sincerity in
outlining their unshakable core belief in niche programming.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that this time, they brought graphs and charts
with them. Do you know what graphs and charts mean? They mean
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Homes, up 35 percent. Adults 18 to 34, up 60 percent. Men 18 to
34, up 90 percent. Male teens, up 158 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It must be noted, before anyone swoons from the majesty of it
all, that it's easier to post spectacular growth percentages if
your base figures are tiny. And UPN started this season with
teensy-tiny numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage guys are the current objects of UPN's core beliefs.
Fortunately, it's easy to figure out what guys like. Guys like
wrestling, explosions, fast cars, fat trucks and big bosoms.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like to have their hormones yanked, and UPN aims to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it has high testosterone, we'll air it,'' said Dean
Valentine, the president and CEO of UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Smackdown!'' on Thursday nights is charged with enough
testosterone to knock down a rhinoceros, and it single-handedly
accounts for most of UPN's ugly resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   This week, UPN premiered ``I Dare You! The Ultimate Challenge,''
a series in which stunt experts set themselves on fire, blow
themselves up, crash fast-moving vehicles into stationary objects,
and dive from great heights into little pools of water. But hey,
says UPN, it's clean entertainment, just like the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Where to go from there? February is supposed to be when young
men's hearts turn to sweet romance. It's also a big sweeps month,
but there are no valentines in Valentine's vision. No, the UPN
February centerpiece will be a monster truck special that, for the
moment, is called ``Monster Trux 2000: The New Thrillennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster trucks are trucks with big wheels. They crush smaller
trucks. These events are as popular as barn dances in some parts of
the country, but UPN is promising a new wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monster truck thing is an experiment for us because
frankly, it's been done poorly in the past on cable,'' says UPN
programming chief, or ringmaster, Tom Nunan. ``These things are
just 11-second bursts, so what we're going to try to do is create
characters and story lines not unlike the WWF.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll throw trucks against a giant turnbuckle, or smash
windshields with folding chairs.
</P>
<P>
   UPN has some legitimate shows in the works, too, including ``The
Beat,'' a cop show from the ``Homicide'' creative team of Barry
Levinson and Tom Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more fun to look ahead to more, uh, creative
expressions of boyish fantasy on UPN. You won't believe this, yet
it's true.
</P>
<P>
   To the stunned laughter of critics in Pasadena, Nunan said one
projected series is ``Hip-Hop Bounty Hunters.'' Oh boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the title of that one says it all,'' Nunan said drily.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a series about undercover female spies, modeled
ever so slightly on the old NBC show ``I Spy.'' This time, the
spies' cover is that they're professional volleyball players.
Presumably, professional volleyball players in small bikinis.
</P>
<P>
   It's called ``I Spike.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd McFarlane of Marvel Comics is working on ``Gorilla World''
for UPN. It's touted as a futuristic look at evolution, though it
might also be a documentary about running UPN.
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that boys' attention spans are nearly as
diminutive as the ``I Spike'' bikinis, UPN is also developing
15-minute comedy shows. Nunan had no details to report.
</P>
<P>
   One critic wondered what all this said about the male half of
America's youth. Another questioned Valentine about UPN's image,
and whether cockfights might find a home on some future UPN
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I remember there was a whole thing
about how terrible comic books were,'' Valentine said. ``Somehow in
every generation, whatever young guys seem to like is what's bad
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   I think it's still a ``no'' on the cockfights. Female mud
wrestling probably isn't out of the question, though.
</P>
<P>
   UPN says its idea of giving boys what they want has made the
struggling network viable, and in the nick of time.
</P>
<P>
   The impending merger of CBS and Sumner Redstone's Viacom empire,
which includes Paramount, raises questions last year about the
future of UPN, which is half owned by Paramount. One company can't
own two broadcast networks, at least not yet. So UPN's fate is up
in the air. A waiver might be sought. Or UPN could be sold. The
roster of possibilities, Valentine said, is ``virtually count
less.''
</P>
<P>
   But UPN is all about survival, and its ratings spurt means that
it isn't the white elephant it appeared to be a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes me feel best is, when these questions
first started about six months ago, when the merger was first
announced, everybody was sort of worrying _ `I don't want UPN, you
take it,''' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now in a very different position, where we're pleased to
have people fighting over us, as opposed to who has to keep us.''
</P>
<P>
   People fighting over them? Give 'em live ammo and grab a camera.
It could be a UPN series.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years after Don Mattingly retired from the New York
Yankees, he will resume his relationship with the only baseball
organization he has ever known by working as a spring training
instructor in February. Mattingly said the details of his role had
not been completed, but he expected to spend about three weeks in
Tampa, Fla., and then work with minor leaguers during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly will join the likes of Goose Gossage, Ron Guidry and
Mickey Rivers as former Yankees whom George Steinbrenner invites to
camp each spring, but Mattingly's return is especially noteworthy
because it apparently signals his intention to eventually re-enter
the major leagues as a coach or manager.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly admitted Thursday that this was a possible scenario
and said that he wanted to tutor minor leaguers so he would feel a
kinship with the current generation of players when, and if, he
decided to seek a full-time position. While Mattingly stressed that
he was not close to seeking a major league job that would separate
him from his wife, Kim, and three sons for eight months a year, he
conceded that he had envisioned the aspects of a return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told everyone that, in my mind, if I really wanted to get
back into baseball, I'd really want to start as a hitting coach and
be able to sit there and watch a great manager work and learn and
learn,'' Mattingly said. ``And then, at one point, be able to
manage. So that would be something I would like to do. If I had to
say right now, `Would you ever want to manage?' I'd say yes. Ten
years from now, I might say no. But I know I don't want to do it
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever so methodically, Mattingly is dipping his toes back into
the baseball pool to gauge the temperature and see if he wants to
dive in. Mattingly has made a few appearances at Yankee Stadium
since ending his glorious 13-year career after the 1995 season, but
he had been reluctant to get too close to the Yankees. Now the
38-year-old Mattingly, who is eligible for the Hall of Fame next
year, said he was eager to be an instructor because it revived the
types of associations he cherished as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was great that Catfish and Whitey and guys
like that were there with us,'' said Mattingly, referring to the
Hall of Famers Catfish Hunter and Whitey Ford. ``I loved being able
to ask Whitey something for no reason, but just be able to talk
about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In reviving the past, Mattingly could influence the future and
start the process in which he emerged as an intriguing candidate to
manage the Yankees at some point. Mattingly was a diligent worker
while batting .307 with nine Gold Glove awards, and his class and
his marquee value would appeal to Steinbrenner, who would probably
love to have Mattingly follow manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Yankees barreled to their second straight World
Series title last year, there was speculation that Steinbrenner was
dissatisfied with Chris Chambliss, the batting coach, and that
Mattingly could replace him. Chambliss, who was privately
criticized by some players, was rehired because the Yankees, who
were fourth in the American League in batting average, won it all.
Still, Mattingly's willingness to become more involved and gain
valuable experience looms ominous.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre was appointed in 1996, he told Willie Randolph, the
third-base coach, that he would prepare Randolph to succeed him,
but Torre is entering his fifth year and has two more years on his
contract. The Yankees' new first-base coach, Lee Mazzilli, is
another managerial candidate, but Mattingly might someday prove too
tempting a choice for Steinbrenner to bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly was asked if he would wear any uniform besides the
Yankees' if he decided he did want to come back to baseball and
manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really made my mind up that's what I wanted to do,
obviously, to me, that would be the best thing, to be in New
York,'' Mattingly said. ``I would like that. But it's one of those
things where you've got to do what you've got to do. If I was dead
serious about it, you can't limit your options. That's a bridge I
don't have to cross right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly is the proud owner and operator of a horse farm in
Evansville, Ind., and a doting father to his sons, who are 14, 12
and 8. To stay closely involved with what his boys are doing,
Mattingly said he even listened to the music they like. The father
and horse farmer sounded content with his life. But how will
Mattingly react if Steinbrenner ever calls with a persuasive offer?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I decided that was it, one of the reasons was to be
around the kids,'' Mattingly said. ``I don't want to leave them
now. If you decide to do something like coach or manage, it's a
commitment of time and energy because you have to learn so much.
Playing is different than managing or coaching. When I played, I
was worried about first base. I wasn't worried about every guy in
the field. As a manager, you've got to worry about everything.'' &QL;

CUBAN BOY'S GRANDMOTHERS ARE SET TO FLY TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) 
 (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration issued visas on Thursday
to the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, allowing the two
women to travel to the United States from Cuba and setting up a
showdown on American soil between two sets of the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomatic mission in Havana granted the visas as
representatives of the National Council of Churches flew a
chartered plane to Havana to meet the grandmothers. They planned to
take them to New York on Friday, administration officials said on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments in the international custody case
virtually guarantee that a dramatic tug-of-war over the boy will
occur in the United States between Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
who wants permanent custody of the boy, and Elian's grandmothers,
who have said repeatedly that the boy should be reunited with his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's rescue from an inner tube off Florida on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 other people drowned fleeing Cuba, he has
been living with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, and maternal
grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, applied for the visas late on
Thursday afternoon, and the visas were granted in a matter of
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were found to be eligible and the visas were quickly
granted,'' said James P. Rubin, the spokesman for the State
Department. ``We understand they will travel tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintana has told the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that
she wanted to travel to Miami ``for just five minutes'' to pick up
her grandson. Ms. Rodriguez, whose daughter died trying to reach
the United States, has been equally emphatic that the youngster
should return to Cuba to live with his father.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, who insisted on anonymity, said the
grandmothers had chosen to fly to New York rather than Miami, where
hundreds of anti-Castro Cuban-Americans have demonstrated against
the boy's return to Cuba. The National Council of Churches, whose
leaders have said that the boy should be reunited with his father
on the island, is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Thursday night that they
welcomed the visit by the grandmothers because they assumed that it
would create sympathy for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's position.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said on Thursday night
that Rangel planned to meet with the two women in New York City on
Friday. Rangel will offer to help the women make their case that
the boy belongs in Cuba, said Emile Milne, a press secretary for
Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   Milne also said it was his understanding that the women intended
to fly to Miami eventually to take Elian back to Cuba. ``They want
to stay away from the hostile environment of Miami,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, filed a
lawsuit in federal court in Miami on Wednesday that challenged the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling on Jan. 4 that the
youngster should be sent back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had considered going to court to ask
a federal judge to enforce the immigration ruling in an effort to
quickly resolve what has evolved into a highly emotional, extremely
difficult political and diplomatic quandary.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official denied that the grandmothers' visit
was intended to circumvent the legal process. ``Presumably,'' the
official said, ``the two grandmothers can speak better for the
father's interests than the boy's great-uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed the father did not
come because he did not want to be drawn into the court battle over
his son's custody.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that Justice
Department officials would move as quickly as possible to resolve
the matter in federal court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at everything that can be done to have the matter
heard appropriately and promptly, with the recognition that it does
the child no good to be in limbo,'' Reno said at her weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The small corporate jet chartered by the church group arrived at
Havana's international airport at 6 p.m. on Thursday, but returned
to the United States at midevening, with only the flight crew
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 14 people who tried to sail to the Florida coast
from Cuba in a 17-foot aluminum boat, which capsized. The boy's
mother and stepfather and nine others drowned. Elian, and two
others, were rescued after clinging to inner tubes in Florida
waters for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his fate has become the subject of an intense fight
between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Miami. The boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has made it clear that he wants Elian
to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit filed on Wednesday, lawyers for Elian's great-uncle
argued that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had violated
Elian's due-process rights. They asked a federal judge to prevent
the agency from returning the boy before it granted him an asylum
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the great-uncle, Spencer Eig, told the Cable News
Network on Thursday night that the grandmothers would be welcome to
visit Elian in Miami, but that they would not be permitted to take
the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers whose expertise is family and immigration law
support the position of the Clinton administration, saying the
reunification of a parent and child is a cornerstone of immigration
law and INS practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is rather clear on this,'' said Eliot Lichtman, a
veteran immigration lawyer based here. ``This is a federal issue
for the immigration service. They have interviewed the father and
decided the father has a loving relationship with the son.''

   DETROIT _ Profits fell as sales rose at General Motors in the
fourth quarter, when the company ran short of high-margin models
and offered discounts to keep sales booming for its less-profitable
cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the results were better than Wall Street analysts
had expected, driving GM's stock price up 75 cents, to $81.25. And
even with a 35 percent drop in fourth-quarter profits, GM finished
the year with record profits of $6 billion, up from $2.96 billion
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GM set a revenue record of $176.6 billion last year, rebounding
from $155.4 billion in 1998, when a strike depressed sales.
</P>
<P>
   GM earned $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.86 a share,
down from the $1.77 billion, or $2.61 a share, in the period a year
earlier. Revenue rose 3.7 percent in the quarter to $46.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives said they were happy with the results. ``We did
beat expectations, and it wraps up what I think was a very strong
year for us,'' said J. Michael Losh, the company's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company emphasized that it had prospered in 1999 despite a
market that while growing, allowed little room to raise prices.
``We're pleased that our financial performance remained on track
even as we faced unceasing competitive pressures,'' GM's chairman
and chief executive, John F. Smith Jr, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, GM's net profit margins were 2.5 percent,
just half of the company's 5 percent goal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the fourth-quarter performance was mediocre. GM
``should be doing a lot better than that,'' said Nicholas
Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   GM beat analysts' earnings expectations largely because its tax
rate was lower than expected, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good quarter in quantity if not in quality,'' said
John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``Very strong
industry volumes are propping up the whole industry's results,
including GM's.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is expected to report record 1999 earnings Wednesday, and
DaimlerChrysler, which is scheduled to report its earnings Feb. 28,
will turn in the first full-year results since Daimler-Benz bought
Chrysler in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   GM's profits declined in North America and Europe, while losses
turned to profits in Latin America and losses were trimmed in the
Asia-Pacific region. In the fourth quarter, the North American
market accounted for $1.01 billion of GM's $1.05 billion in profit
from selling cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   GM's lending unit, the General Motors Acceptance Corp., brought
in another $367 million, and added a record $1.54 billion in net
income for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes Electronics, a unit GM is considering partly spinning off
to shareholders, lost $61 million in the fourth quarter and $105
million for the year, a reversal from the $119 million in net
income in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the $272 million in net
income in 1998. Nonetheless, its revenue rose 25 percent, to $7.6
billion, because its DirecTV unit added 1.6 million subscribers
last year, GM said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, GM was not able to produce as many of its
highly profitable Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon
full-size sport utility vehicles as expected because their
factories geared up slowly after the models were redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are rising, nearing $30 a barrel Wednesday, and
gasoline prices are climbing with them. This has had limited effect
so far on the hot sport utility market. But today's earnings
figures underlined how GM, the world's largest corporation, is
dependent on several models _ all hulking, gas-guzzling trucks _
for a large chunk of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   GM's earnings Thursday included a blizzard of one-time after-tax
gains and losses that largely canceled each other out. The company
reported a $553 million gain as many workers, once thought to have
been permanently laid off, were pressed back into service to keep
factories running in a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But GM also took a $408 million charge for higher pension costs
in its new contract with the United Automobile Workers union, a $90
million charge for terminating white-collar workers and a $165
million charge from the Hughes division's wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Thursday, GM's Saturn unit announced that it had
hired Internet specialists to better link its dealers with its
buyers online.

N.Y. TIMES AND ABC IN NEWS DEAL THAT WILL INCLUDE TV AND INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times and ABC News said Thursday that
they had agreed to share news coverage in several fields, with the
information to be delivered both on television and over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, announced jointly by Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the
publisher of The Times, and David Westin, the president of ABC
News, will include the creation of a daily 15-minute video report
on politics to be delivered on each organization's World Wide Web
site. The program, entitled ``Political Points,'' will begin Monday
with coverage of the Iowa presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, The Times is to participate in producing reports
for two programs on the ABC television network _ the ``20/20''
newsmagazine and the morning program ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, The Times will contribute reports in the areas of
technology and health, and executives of the two organizations said
that the topic list could be expanded. One area already discussed
involves specialized Times features like obituaries and the Vows
column, informally known as ``wedding of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times has agreed to supply 4 to 6 reports to ``20/20'' over
the next year and as many as 16 reports on ``Good Morning,
America.'' Some morning segments may involve appearances by Times
reporters or political commentators to discuss articles in the
day's paper.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is essentially limited to this political season. Bill
Keller, managing editor of The Times, said, ``The election gives us
an exit strategy if we're all disappointed.'' But he added, ``We
all hope it works.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The arrangement between The Times and ABC News follows a similar
one announced in November between NBC and the Washington Post Co.
in which reporters from The Post and its cousin Newsweek magazine
will appear on the all-news cable network MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/ABC deal is emphasizing the daily political program,
to be posted on each company's Web site at 1:30 p.m. each weekday
starting Monday. It promises to cover developments in the political
campaigns that occur after the morning publication of the paper and
the broadcast of ``Good Morning America'' and before the evening
newscast on ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The joint program, based in Washington, will be moderated
jointly by Michael Oreskes, the Washington bureau chief of The
Times, and Mark Halperin, the political director for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Times executives, Oreskes called the agreement an
experiment for the newspaper. ``I think the show will be
top-quality political journalism,'' he said, ``but it's going to be
a learning experience. We're not feeling any trepidation. We're
going into a new world, and we need to learn new skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He said each news organization would safeguard any exclusive
report it develops. ``There will still be stories we withhold for
the newspaper,'' Oreskes said. ``But at other times, on a totally
different type of exclusive _ the kind you get in the morning but
you know the world will know by 6 o'clock _ those we'll be putting
on the webcast.''

GERMAN PARTY FINANCE OFFICIAL COMMITS SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Adds that Barschel's death was later investigated as a
murder in last graf.) 
 (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ A leading finance official of Germany's
embattled Christian Democratic party committed suicide Thursday
after leaving a note indicating he had become aware of crimes of
embezzlement, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Huellen, the head of the Christian Democratic Union
parliamentary delegation's finance and budget department over the
last 18 years, hanged himself in his Berlin apartment as a
parliamentary investigation is getting underway into a web of
illicit payments to the party in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin prosecutor told the daily Bild that a criminal inquiry
into embezzlement had been opened based on a passage in Huellen's
suicide note. The Friday issue of the Berliner Zeitung reported
Huellen had said in his suicide letter that he was afraid of an
audit of the party's finances and that he had transferred money
from the parliamentary group's account. No further information on
the nature of the embezzlement was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Huellen, 49, the father of two children, became the first
casualty of a widening scandal that has prompted repeated
comparisons to the web of corruption whose revelation brought down
Italy's Christian Democrats after the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, several prominent public figures, including the former
head of the state-owned oil company, killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   German Christian Democracy is not Italian Christian Democracy _
it is better organized, it has not held a monopoly on postwar
power, it represents a respectable German right in a way that may
be irreplaceable. Still, the headlines of ``Deutschland alla
Romana'' have resonated, not least for the sheer operatic intensity
of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Hoerster, a chief whip of the Christian Democrats in
parliament, announced the suicide to the lower house of parliament
and said first indications were that it was ``of a personal
nature.'' Parliamentary proceedings were briefly suspended.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to elaborate on the term ``personal nature,'' and
police accounts of the suicide note later suggested strongly that
the background to Huellen's death was in fact political. For
several weeks, pressure has been mounting on the Christian
Democrats to explain several million dollars in undeclared, and so
illegal, payments to the party.
</P>
<P>
   The search for answers centered Thursday on the Reichstag
building, focus of many German troubles over the last century and
now home to the parliament. The committee investigating illegal
payments under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl began its proceedings
by hearing his successor as party leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble,
apologize for his acts.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble, who last week admitted taking 100,000 marks ($52,000)
in cash from an arms dealer named Karlheinz Schreiber, said: ``A
few weeks ago in this chamber I didn't react as I should have to
calls made from the coalition benches. I regret that and I
apologize for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, although he did not say it clearly, Schaeuble was
apologizing for having lied.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, 1999, under questioning about Schreiber from
Hans-Christian Stroebele, a Green member of parliament, the
Christian Democrat leader said he ``may have run into Schreiber on
one occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without a suitcase?'' Stroebele shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a suitcase,'' Schaeuble replied. ``That means I may
have had a briefcase with me. I don't know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has now conceded, Schaeuble met Schreiber not once but
twice and, on the second occasion, accepted a bag containing a pile
of cash that he says he passed on to the party treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   It is this sort of behavior that has led many people to conclude
that Schaeuble cannot now restore his party's shattered
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary committee, headed by a Social Democrat
politicians, Volker Neumann, has summoned 26 people to testify,
including Kohl and several of his former ministers. One central
figure who will have to testify is Horst Weyrauch, long the man in
charge of party finances under Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, who has said that during Kohl's 16-year term as
chancellor ``the government was for sale,'' has indicated the
inquiry could go on for as long as two years. It seems evident that
the Social Democratic party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is
eager to draw out the positive impact of the scandal on its own
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is true that there is much to investigate, including
payments to the party by Schreiber totaling over $550,000, the
source of the more than $1 million that Kohl says he took between
1993 and 1998, and how millions of dollars from the party branch in
Hesse reached bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will also examine the suspicious sale in 1992 of
the former East German refinery Leuna to Elf Aquitaine of France.
Kohl was highly enthusiastic about this transaction, a
demonstration, he said, of renewed French-German friendship after
France's long hesitation over German unification.
</P>
<P>
   But tens of millions of dollars from the sale have not been
properly accounted for, prompting judicial investigations by
prosecutors in Switzerland and France into possible payments of
bribes. Documents relating to the sale disappeared mysteriously
from Kohl's chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted taking more than $1 million in secret
payments, but insisted that none was a bribe. He has said his
``honor'' prevents him from identifying the donors because he gave
his word he would not.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the truth so terrible that Helmut Kohl places his word of
honor above the German Constitution?'' asked Gabi Bauer, the
anchorwoman on Germany's main television show. The question clearly
echoed the thoughts of millions of people in a country where the
law says any contribution over $10,500 must be declared.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Kohl's defiance, and in the absence of any
``donors'' coming forward to identify themselves, suspicions have
been growing that some or all of the money that the former
chancellor says he received may in fact have come from overseas
bank accounts maintained to manage illegal payments and kickbacks
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   For unless the source of the money was illegal, it is
increasingly hard for many Germans to understand how Kohl can
continue to place his honor above the oath of office he took and
above the well-being of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor'' is a resonant word in the history of German political
scandals. It was repeatedly used by Uwe Barschel, the former
Christian Democrat premier of Schleswig-Holstein, who gave his
``word of honor'' that he had not used dirty tactics against his
Social Democratic challenger in an election in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the election he was forced from office when his
denials were disproved. A month later Barschel was found dead in a
Geneva hotel, in what was first ruled a suicide and later
investigated as a murder.

POPULAR AND FULL OF PRIDE, BARBARA BUSH CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, N.H. _ ``I want to thank all of you who are helping
George W. Bush get elected,'' Barbara Bush said Thursday, in the
pleasant but rather flat tone of a practiced campaigner on yet
another stump.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. Bush paused and beamed at the hundred or so people who
had come to see her at the airport here, and in an instant her mien
was that not of a surrogate campaigner, but of a proud mother. ``I
can't tell you how overwhelming that is for a mother to say,'' she
declared. ``This guy,'' she went on, smiling even more broadly,
``is just a great son and father and husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, 74, has done several fund-raisers for her son around
the country, but the stop here, the first of a two-day, eight-town
swing across New Hampshire, was her first foray directly into the
primary campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the former first lady can hardly be
overstated. A CBS News poll last year found that 63 percent of
Americans had a favorable view of Mrs. Bush, and only 3 percent had
an unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Fifield, a 95-year-old Republican stalwart from Orford,
N.H., called Mrs. Bush ``the most respected woman ever to represent
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Mrs. Fifield had one of the first receptions
in New Hampshire for George Bush in his first, unsuccessful race
for president. ``Twenty years later, we're back calling on our
friends again,'' Mrs. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll keep his promise'' not to run a negative campaign, ``or
his mother will come after him,'' Mrs. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said that after 1992, when her husband lost a bitter
re-election campaign to Bill Clinton, she had sworn never to
campaign again, and quickly added, ``Maybe I should have said,
`Read my lips.'''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., came to the Security
Council offering a ``hand of friendship'' Thursday but delivered
the sort of clenched-fist message that has made him the symbol of
right-wing hostility toward the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, the most powerful congressional voice in foreign policy
as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, contended
that Congress had the right to dictate conditions for the payment
of American debts to the organization. He warned the United Nations
to keep its ``utopian'' visions away from American sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United Nations respects the sovereign rights of the
American people, and serves them as an effective tool of diplomacy,
it will earn and deserve their respect and support,'' he told
council members. ``But a United Nations that seeks to impose its
presumed authority on the American people, without their consent,
begs for confrontation and _ I want to be candid with you _
eventual U.S. withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Helms, asserting that he was speaking for the
American people, delivered a clear-cut conservative manifesto on
the United Nations, and did not leave anything open for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his address to an extraordinary gathering of
ambassadors, nearly every member of the Security Council challenged
Helms' bleak portrayal of the United Nations and criticized the
United States for letting the organization down.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Alain Dejammet of France, visibly agitated, said to
Helms, ``We hear you, but the idea in this house is that others
must be heard as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said: ``The United Nations
is not a separate organ to which we turn, like a fire service. It
is the member states, and the United States owns 25 percent of the
power and the resources of the United Nations. What it does well,
the U.S. gets credit for. What it does badly, the U.S. must bear
some responsibility for.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms had tried to put a positive face on his visit, arranged by
a North Carolina businessman _ Irwin Belk, who is a friend of the
senator and who was appointed an alternate delegate to the General
Assembly last fall _ and by Richard Holbrooke, the American
permanent representative to the United Nations and this month's
Security Council president.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has spent months trying to build bridges with a
hostile Congress that has held up payments of U.N. dues and delayed
the confirmation of ambassadors and other foreign policy officials
_ including that of Holbrooke himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' Helms said, ``that this body have greater
contact with the elected representatives of the American people,
and that we have greater contact with you.'' He invited Security
Council members to visit his committee in Washington. Before the
council meeting, he spoke for about 40 minutes with Secretary
General Kofi Annan and asked him to pose for pictures with the
Helms family.
</P>
<P>
   Helms told the Security Council that unlike Europeans, the
American people were moving away from ``supranational
institutions'' and wanted no part of ``utopian'' international
arrangements, including the international criminal court created
last year over the objections of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's session, which the council decided to open to the
press and the public only Wednesday, was a gamble for Holbrooke,
diplomats said. But it seems to have paid off both for Helms, who
was welcomed with fanfare and given an unusual stage to air his
views, and for his adversaries. Diplomats from around the world,
particularly Security Council members who have fumed quietly over
what they see as a deadbeat America bankrupting the organization,
got the chance to tell Helms directly what they thought _ however
diplomatically the comments were couched.
</P>
<P>
   After Helms praised the anti-communist Reagan doctrine for
having brought freedom and democracy to the world without the help
or approval of the United Nations, the Namibian representative,
Martin Andjaba, took impassioned exception.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan doctrine, he said, denied independence to Namibia and
its Southwest African Peoples Organization, gave support to
apartheid South Africa and empowered the UNITA rebel movement in
Angola, which has prolonged a quarter-century-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It contributed to a lot of suffering in Africa,'' he said.
``Some of us in SWAPO who were a legitimate and genuine national
liberation movement were called other names: terrorists. And those
that caused death and destruction in Africa were called liberators
_ and they were supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``That page has passed, but we have it fresh in our memories.''
</P>
<P>
   In a list of indictments against the organization, Helms revived
old criticism about votes in the General Assembly that ran against
the United States, he attacked a human rights monitor who reported
on allegations of human rights violations in the United States, and
he objected to accusations that American debts _ still more than $1
billion despite a recent payment _ were hampering the organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   He said that the United States had spent $10.2 billion on the
United Nations and its projects in 1999, a figure immediately
disputed by Steven Dimoff, vice president of the U.N. Association
of the United States and the director of its Washington office.
Dimoff said in an interview that the sum ``really does stretch
reality,'' because it included military activities planned and
executed by the United States without any advice or support from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Dimoff, whose organization supports and studies the United
Nations, said that the spectacle in the Security Council of a
member of Congress and not the president purporting to speak for
the American people on foreign affairs ``demonstrates how the
Clinton administration has ceded all the ground of U.S.
policymaking on the U.N. to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance today,'' he said, ``is symbolic of the extent
to which Congress is now ge.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of France and Canada also challenged Helms on
his budget assertions and his denials that the burden of American
arrears had fallen on poor nations. Helms had said that the
American people had ``heard U.N. officials declaring, absurdly,
that countries like Fiji and Bangladesh are carrying America's
burden in peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's representative, Robert Fowler, replied: ``Senator, I
don't know if I am a U.N. official. I don't think I am. But I am
somebody who has spoken recently about Fiji and Bangladesh. I noted
that in 1999 Bangladesh was owed approximately $18 million, or just
under 175 times its regular budget contributions to this
organization, and that Fiji was owed $4 million, or just under 100
times its regular budget assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that 60 percent of all monies owed to the United Nations
are owed by the United States, 60 percent of those numbers are owed
by Americans to Bangladeshis and to Fijians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, the representative of the Netherlands, told
Helms that he had been taught in school that the collapse of the
League of Nations, which the United States had refused to join, had
led to World War II. ``I am mentioning this,'' he said, ``because
you will realize that for not just Dutchmen of my generation but
for all of us, it is a nightmare to envision a United Nations
without the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to hope that one day the majority of the American
people, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will
appreciate everything this organization has done for the spread of
democratic ideas all over the world,'' he said. ``All the American
and Dutch taxpayers' money spent on this organization has been a
wise investment.''  &QL;

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ On Wednesday, state prosecutors charged
Michael C. Skakel with killing 15-year-old Martha Moxley in
Greenwich almost 25 years ago, tight-lipped but confident they had
finally solved a baffling case.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the case seemed to be moving right along. A court
date was set for Feb. 8, when Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy who
has long maintained his innocence, is to appear for a closed
hearing to set a second court date in which he can enter his plea.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the case will probably begin to bog down
faster than rush-hour traffic on Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Connecticut's criminal justice system said Thursday
that despite the huge break Skakel's arrest signifies in the case,
his prosecution would most likely encounter years of legal tie-ups,
and Skakel, a Florida resident who was released on $500,000 bond,
is not likely to be acquitted or incarcerated anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because of the amount of time that has passed
since Miss Moxley was found face down under a tree in her yard,
bludgeoned and stabbed to death with a golf club the police later
traced to a set owned by Skakel's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was only 15 when Miss Moxley was killed, Skakel was
charged as a minor, said Jonathan Benedict, the state's attorney in
Bridgeport who is expected to lead the prosecution team. So
Skakel's Feb. 8 hearing will be in Stamford Juvenile Court, not
state Superior Court, where adults accused of murder in Connecticut
are prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Skakel, 39, will be eligible for any meaningful
punishment, legal scholars said, is if he is convicted in Superior
Court, where he could face a maximum sentence if convicted of life
in prison. But the decision to move the case there will be up to
the Juvenile Court judge, Maureen Dennise. And there is debate
about whether she, viewing Skakel's case through the laws that
existed in 1975, has the authority to make such a move.
</P>
<P>
   If his case remains in Juvenile Court, Skakel could escape
punishment altogether, said David Rosen, a senior research
associate at Yale Law School. That is because the court system that
handled juveniles 25 years ago operated on a philosophy of
rehabilitating youthful offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juvenile justice system in 1975 was not trying to punish
people,'' Rosen said Thursday. ``Its aim was to assist youngsters
that ran afoul of the law, even in heinous ways. It was taking and
making them law-abiding adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was accused of committing a crime as a child,'' Rosen went
on, ``and he's now an adult. The juvenile justice system, which is
the system he ran afoul of, simply may not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Skakel had been one year older or two years younger
at the time of Miss Moxley's murder, the case against him now would
be entirely different, said Hillary Barger, the prosecutor in
Bridgeport Juvenile Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under Connecticut law, in 1975 as now, anyone older than 16 is
an adult in the eyes of the court system and is eligible to be
tried for murder as an adult, she said. But regardless of the crime
committed, the law prohibits a court from incarcerating children
younger than 14, preferring to rehabilitate them.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Moxley was killed in 1975, children 14 and 15 years
old were the only minors whose legal status as criminals was left
to a Juvenile Court judge to decide. And because the courts were
guided by the goal of treatment rather than punishment for juvenile
offenders, judges almost never moved cases involving youths accused
of murder to an adult court, said Hugh F. Keefe, a criminal defense
lawyer in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Keefe said he could remember that happening only once in
Connecticut. In 1974, a Juvenile Court judge in New Haven allowed
the murder case against 14-year-old Eric Washington, an accused
accomplice in the shooting death of a Yale student, to be
transferred to Superior Court, where a jury convicted him.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, as in Skakel's, Keefe noted, ``There was a
terrific amount of pressure because of the notoriety and nature of
the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But other quirks in Connecticut's changing child welfare laws
are likely to delay any trial in the Skakel case for some time,
legal experts said. And even if the case is transferred, Skakel's
lawyer, Michael Sherman, is expected to do something that, though
not possible today, was common in 1975: appeal. If he does, a state
Appeals Court will then decide whether to overturn any move to
Superior Court, a process that can easily take a year, and often
two years, to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the state Legislature enacted a statute that made
automatic the transfer to Superior Court of juveniles 14 or older
charged with major felonies, Ms. Barger said. Notably, the statute
also eliminated the ability of the juvenile to appeal the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had happened under the new statute, this is a
one-minute hearing and the case would proceed in adult court,'' Ms.
Barger said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as they began planning the best strategy to convict
Skakel, prosecutors in Benedict's office refused to take phone
calls from reporters. But there is no doubt the state's attorney
had Skakel arrested so that he could be tried in Superior Court as
an adult, even if it means enduring years of appeals from Sherman,
who did not return phone calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, the prosecutor, must build his case without the help
of any forensic evidence that could link Skakel to the crime, say
those who have written books about the case. So he must rely on
circumstantial, but powerful, evidence, said Mark Fuhrman, the
former Los Angeles police detective whose 1998 book, ``Murder in
Greenwich: Who killed Martha Moxley?'' named Skakel as the likely
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to paint a picture of Michael in every way that
they can paint a picture of his emotional state, his relationship
with Martha, his relationship to his brother,'' said Fuhrman,
referring to Thomas Skakel, who at one time was also a suspect in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly damning to Michael Skakel, he added, will be sworn
testimony from three people who attended a treatment center in
Maine with him 20 years ago, in which Skakel is recalled admitting
to Miss Moxley's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest evidence is that three independent people are
coming forward and testifying that he admitted that he killed
Martha,'' Fuhrman said. ``It's going to be long, drawn out and
protracted, but I think it's going to be a legal case, not an
emotional case.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the case is kept in Juvenile Court, everything changes.
There will be no jury, no evidence and no trial. A single judge
will decide Skakel's fate in a decision that will be sealed from
public scrutiny.

<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. _ Seton Hall University administrators
Thursday defended their fire safety procedures as investigators
continued to search for the cause of the dormitory fire that killed
three freshmen and injured dozens more early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Roman Catholic university's campus here, questions
swirled with the gently falling snow: How did the fire in Boland
Hall start? Why have false fire alarms plagued the dormitory, for
so many years? Why doesn't the dormitory have a sprinkler system?
Why weren't there fire drills at Boland Hall?
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Grider, a spokeswoman for Seton Hall, acknowledged Thursday
that there had been no fire drills at Boland, at least during this
academic year. But she said the university's lawyer, Katherine
Kiernan, had assured her that the university had been in compliance
with state fire safety laws. In addition, resident assistants are
taught how to evacuate the dormitories, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, investigators continued to examine the third-floor
lounge where the fire began, and interviewed some of the 600 Boland
residents who had awoken to screams and smoke about 4:30 a.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the inquiry said investigators also wanted
to identity and talk to three young people who were in the Boland
lounge less than an hour before the fire began. The person said
that a resident assistant in Boland had encountered the three, whom
she did not recognize, and had asked them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Donald C. Campolo, the Essex County prosecutor, whose office is
leading the investigation, would not comment Thursday on the
resident assistant's account, which was first reported Thursday in
The Star-Ledger, other than to say, ``We are following up every
lead.'' The person close to the inquiry emphasized that the desire
to talk to the three people did not mean that investigators
believed they were responsible for the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo did, however, dispute a Star-Ledger report that
investigators had eliminated careless smoking and faulty electrical
wiring as possible causes. His executive assistant, Charlotte
Smith, later said, ``We are not making any determination as to
whether it's accidental or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire scorched the lounge floor, popped ceiling tiles,
consumed two couches and sent clouds of smoke throughout the
freshman dormitory's six floors, disorienting and frightening many
of the 600 residents who rushed from the building.
</P>
<P>
   Three 18-year-old male students were killed. Two were burned to
death in the lounge; the third, found in a room nearby, died of
smoke inhalation. More than 50 students were injured, including 4
who were in critical condition Thursday at St. Barnabas Medical
Center in Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a semester the resident assistants are required to hold
floor meetings with students under their supervision to discuss
fire safety, evacuation plans and the location of all exits from
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grider said the university would review its policies and
consider changes to ensure that ``something like this never, ever
happens again.'' When asked if such options included installing
sprinklers in Boland, she answered: ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the six dormitories on campus, the two oldest _ Boland Hall
and Aquinas Hall _ do not have sprinkler systems. The authorities
said that the buildings were constructed well before the state
required that all large residential buildings be equipped with
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether to retrofit buildings like dormitories
and high-rise apartments _ even without any legal requirement _ has
long spurred debate among developers and fire safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth O. Burris Jr., the chief operating officer for the
United States Fire Administration, a branch of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, said that experts had ``recognized for
quite a number of years that automatic fire suppression systems,''
like sprinklers, ``are the most effective method.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also the most difficult system to have developers and
buildings put in because of the perceived expense involved,''
Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Hutton, the spokeswoman for the New York State Dormitory
Authority, the agency that builds dormitories for the State
University of New York system, said that ``whenever we rehab an old
dorm or whenever we build a new dorm, we put sprinklers in.,''
</P>
<P>
   At Felician College in Lodi, N.J., administrators have been
considering installing sprinklers in its Milton Court dormitory,
which houses 50 students. But a college spokeswoman, Nancy Haidock,
said the Seton Hall fire would probably expedite the
decision-making process. Justin Harmon, a spokesman for Princeton
University, said that some of its older dormitories did not have
sprinklers, but added that the university hads a policy of
installing them whenever buildings awere renovated.
</P>
<P>
   At Seton Hall, where classes have been canceled until at least
Monday, several students talked about the lackadaisical culture
regarding fire alarms. False alarms ring so often in Boland Hall,
they said, that students often ignore them or try to hide from
resident assistants sweeping the floors. The culprits are often
pranksters, they said, or pledges seeking membership in a
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grider said that the university had taken several steps over
the years to curtail false alarms. Although she declined to be
specific other than to cite an article in the campus newspaper last
year that implored students to end the practice, the university has
offered rewards, threatened expulsion and posted notices saying
that the pranks are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, a fire alarm rang through another
dormitory, Xavier Hall, Thursday morning, prompting the evacuation
of about 200 students. Officials later said a student had pulled
the alarm after mistakenly thinking she smelled smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody took it seriously,'' said Sam Kissim, 22, a student
from Los Angeles. ``Two months ago, nobody would have gone out.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the university's students mourned the deaths of the three
freshmen _ Frank S. Caltabilota, Aaron C. Karol and John C. Giunta,
all from New Jersey _ stories emerged of quiet heroism and searches
for solance.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Nugent, a sophomore from Northfield, N.J., appeared at a
news conference to tell his story and to ask reporters to allow him
to be ``left alone to deal with the deaths of my friends and
residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, a resident assistant in Boland, recalled rousting
students from their rooms, and grabbing the arms of one student who
was ``in bad shape'' and escorting her down the stairs. He said he
returned to the smoke-filled third floor to lead more residents
out, this time by crawling, ``as I was taught in training.''
</P>
<P>
   After flames thwarted another effort to return to the third
floor, he said, he and another resident assistant went outside,
grabbed a ladder and helped some students escape through a window.
Nugent said that he and another student then spent time with a
badly injured young man, ``taking a wet towel to cool off his
burns,'' until firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Boland really pulled together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The recollections of Msgr. Robert Sheeran, the president of
Seton Hall, were more sobering. He said that after the fire had
been extinguished, he and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, the leader
of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, walked through the
dormitory's third floor. Together they knelt before the bodies of
the three young men who had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed over each of them,'' Sheeran said, ``and we blessed
them.''

RUSSIA'S BALLOT MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN NEW YORK'S, MCCAIN SUGGESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. John McCain chose the stretch of East 91st
Street that is home to the Russian consulate to offer New Yorkers a
piece of political theater Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the snow fell and the white, blue and red Russian flag
whipped back and forth, the Republican presidential aspirant said
citizens of Russia enjoy greater voting rights than their
counterparts in New York, given the Republican Party's tradition of
blocking bids by underdog candidates to get on the presidential
primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, there will be more than one name on the ballot'' in
its coming presidential election, McCain said. ``In New York,
unless something happens, there will be only one name on the
ballot. It seems to me that history has been turned on its head.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his backers have gone to court to challenge a move by
lawyers for the New York Republican State Committee to knock the
Arizona senator off the March 7 primary ballot in as many as 16 of
New York's 31 congressional districts. The committee has challenged
signatures on McCain's nominating petitions as not belonging to
registered voters or to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party leaders declined to comment. But Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, who is considered the leading contender for the
nomination, suggested that McCain should stick by the established
rules. ``People must get grass-roots support to get on the ballot
in New York,'' Bush said at a news conference in Pella, Iowa.
``It's been this way for every single campaign.''

POLITICS BLAMED AS STUDENT STRIKE DRAGS ON IN MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Julio Cesar Morales spent much of Thursday morning
searching for a place to vote in favor of ending a student strike
that has closed Mexico's largest university since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a copy of the thesis he needs to turn in before he can
graduate from its law school, Morales trekked to the campus of the
National Autonomous University on the south side of the Mexican
capital to vote ``yes'' to a proposal by the school's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He was turned away at the school's front gate by rough-looking
strikers whose leaders refused to allow any voting to take place on
university grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of interests involved in continuing this
strike,'' shrugged the nattily dressed Morales, who took time off
from his paralegal job to vote. ``There are manipulations by
political parties on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike began last April when the university administration
tried to raise tuition from the equivalent of 2 U.S. cents a
semester to around $70 per semester. Although cheap by U.S.
standards, $140-a-year tuition is high for many of the university's
students who come from working-class families.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, through street marches, media campaigns
and occasional brawls, the strikers forced the university's
administration to back down on the tuition increases and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But each time the university administration and the Mexican
government ceded to the students' demands, the strikers kept
changing them. The hard-liners who had taken control of the
strikers' committees seem guided by an often-vague leftist creed
that rejects everything from free-market economics to Mexico's
long-ruling political party.
</P>
<P>
   So, the university remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a student movement. It's political,'' said Pedro
Sanchez, a 30-year-old graduate of the university who works in its
administrative offices. ``If all this were just about student
demands, it would have been finished a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de la Fuente, the former health minister who was appointed
university president last November, hopes an overwhelming vote in
favor of returning to classes will give his administration the
moral force needed to bring an end to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente has called for creating a special congress of
students and university employees to determine the future of the
school, for canceling the tuition increase and for granting amnesty
to strike leaders who may have broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   But the strike leaders claim about 600,000 people voted in their
own ``consultation'' held Tuesday and Wednesday. The vote was open
to everyone and so poorly supervised that people could cast as many
ballots as they pleased. Student leaders said 85 percent of the
votes were in favor of maintaining the strike until their demands
were met.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the administration wants to do with their vote.
They are going to say a majority wants to return to class,'' said
Victor Garcia, a beefy 25-year-old striker who studied history at
the university until nine months ago. ``But we had our own vote,
and it supported us.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, one of a dozen strikers manning the barricaded front
gate of the three-square-mile campus Thursday, said, ``This isn't
about a few cents of tuition. It's about keeping the university
free and open to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The once-vibrant campus stands silent. Sprinklers pump jets of
water onto empty lawns. Gardeners trim the edges of walkways and
cut the grass. A few office workers take advantage of their lunch
break to exercise on the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Strike slogans have been splashed on every wall. ``All poetry is
revolution. All revolution, poetry,'' theorizes a scrawl on the
philosophy building. ``Mexicans against the system,'' urges
another. And this from Che Guevara, the long-dead Argentine
revolutionary who helped bring Fidel Castro to power in Cuba and
who has become the strikers' icon: ``He who consents to his
exploitation begins to acquire the soul of a slave.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, the strike reflects the profound changes
that have swept Mexican society and politics in the past decade and
a half.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the strike began, the National University had lost
much of its luster. In just 30 years, enrollment exploded from
around 85,000 to today's 270,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a degree from the National University was all
but a needed passport for entering the leadership of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Now, most children of
Mexico's political and economic elite study at expensive private
universities in Mexico or abroad. With their world-weary slouches,
sparse beards and knee-patched trousers, today's strikers evoke the
image of the leftist revolutionaries who once held this country and
the rest of Latin America in thrall.
</P>
<P>
   A 1968 student strike, which ended in the army's massacre of
hundreds of protestors in downtown Mexico City that October, helped
spur the push for greater democracy in this once-authoritarian
society.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the leaders from the 1968 strikes have become prominent
in national politics, both within the PRI and in the leftist Party
of the Democratic Revolution, which has governed Mexico City for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those former student rebels have publicly called for
an end to the current strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those old leaders are part of the system now,'' said Gomez,
the student striker. ``They use the same tactics against us now
that their oppressors did back then. They have forgotten the
demands they fought for.''

LABORERS UNION CLEANUP PRAISED; U.S. OVERSIGHT IS EASED 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: LABOR-CORRUPTION)  
(lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department agreed Thursday to relax its oversight of
the Laborers union after five years of threatening to take over the
union if the efforts by the Laborers to root out corruption
stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Thursday that they were so pleased with
the union's own cleanup efforts that the government was giving up
its option to run the Laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials praised the Laborers' five-year
cleanup effort, which union officials said removed 220 corrupt
officials from union positions, including 127 found to be members
or associates of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Thursday by the Justice Department
and Laborers International Union of North America, the union
pledged to continue its self-policing efforts through the year
2006. These efforts have involved an internal union prosecutor,
judge and appellate officer, as well as dozens of investigators,
including numerous former FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   In the new agreement, the Justice Department reserved the right
to seek an injunction that would order the 750,000-member union to
make good on its cleanup promises.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, said, ``We're not
walking away from reform in the union, but substantial progress has
been made.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Justice Department threatened to file a civil
racketeering suit that would have accused the union and its
leaders, including its president, Arthur A. Coia, of being
influenced by organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department decided not to pursue that lawsuit in an
unusual agreement in which the union pledged to set up what was the
largest effort undertaken by a union to clean its own house.
Republican officials attacked that agreement, asserting that the
Clinton administration had decided to go soft on the Laborers
because President Clinton was friendly with Coia.
</P>
<P>
   The two had given each other golf clubs, and Coia had served as
co-chairman for several Democratic Party fund-raisers, while his
union contributed generously to Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration defended the deal, noting that dozens of
union officials were ousted. Indeed, Coia agreed to retire last
month, saying that he had served long enough and was tired of being
hounded by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation cleared Coia of ties to organized
crime, but it found that he had violated some laws in purchasing a
$450,000 Ferrari from a supplier that leased cars to his union.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts said the Justice Department would never
have considered relaxing oversight of the Laborers until Coia had
stepped down. But union officials said Coia's retirement had
nothing to do with Thursday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Luskin, the Laborers' in-house prosecutor, said, ``In the
five years since these reform programs were first adopted, LIUNA
has made extraordinary strides in eliminating the influence of
organized crime and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the government has agreed to ease its oversight of the
Laborers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters can be
expected to intensify its campaign to get the federal government to
relax its far more intrusive oversight of the teamsters.

MRS. CLINTON TO MEET WITH ALBANY LEGISLATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y _ Hillary Rodham Clinton will meet on Monday in the
state Capitol with Democratic legislators, an unusual gathering
that shows how much each camp needs the other in this election
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, invited Mrs. Clinton, who
is running for the U.S. Senate, to speak to a closed-door
conference of the Assembly Democrats, the first time in three years
that an outside political figure has been asked to such a
gathering. The last person to receive such an invitation was
Charles Schumer, a former Assembly member who was then a
congressman, as he prepared in 1997 for his successful run for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also invited the Democrats in the state Senate, who are
the minority in their house, to attend.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton, the 124 Democrats in the Legislature represent
a powerful political network, with cadres of supporters in every
corner of the state who can do the legwork needed to run a
statewide campaign and get out the vote. She has worked hard in the
last year courting Silver, who is from Manhattan, and other
important members of the Assembly's Democratic majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely committed to running an on-the-ground,
grass-roots campaign in every part of the state,'' said Howard
Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, ``and in order to
do that, we're going to need the help of members of the Assembly
and the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she is expected to fare well in New York City, polls
show Mrs. Clinton lagging in the suburbs and upstate, so she
especially needs the help of people like the Assembly majority
leader, Michael Bragman, one of the most powerful figures in
central New York, and Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli, the Nassau
County Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For the potential Republican candidate for Senate, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, the Republican majority in the state Senate is expected
to play much the same role around the state, and the mayor has
spent a great deal of time building ties to the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in both parties believe that the stakes are high for
them in the Senate race. All 211 legislative seats are up for
election this year, and the leaders in both houses see having a
strong Senate candidate to draw voters to the polls as their best
bet for holding onto power.

ENBERG, PACKER TOGETHER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Movers 'n' shakers, matchmakers, fakers and
bellyachers for the new media millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Deja vu all over again: Dick Enberg and Billy Packer on the same
college basketball game broadcast? And it's not on ESPN Classic?
</P>
<P>
   With Enberg's jump from NBC to CBS finally official, his new
employer has put him on Saturday's Ohio State-St. John's telecast
(1 p.m.) with Packer. The last time those two crazy kids worked a
game together was the 1981 NCAA Championship between Indiana and
North Carolina when NBC was the college hoop king.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, Enberg and Packer are reunited with antagonist Al
McGuire for the UConn-Michigan State national telecast on CBS.
McGuire, who used to fondly refer to Enberg as ``Dixie'' on the air
at NBC, will be his right-hand man through the college basketball
season and into the network's tournament coverage. Enberg then goes
to the Masters, PGA Championship and U.S. Open tennis championship
before teaming with Dan Dierdorf for CBS' NFL coverage next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be part of the NFL again and college basketball has my
adrenaline flowing,'' said Enberg, the longtime L.A. Rams and UCLA
basketball voice on KMPC in the '60s and '70s before joining NBC 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Enberg, the former San Fernando Valley State (now CSUN) baseball
coach, may even be able to do Angels games in some capacity for
their 40th season celebration since his summer is less constrained
without the Wimbledon commitment with NBC (he's done 19 of 'em,
along with nine Rose Bowls, eight Super Bowls, five Final Fours,
four Olympics and one World Series), but it would likely be limited
to a very small number of games. The Angels recently hired Darren
Sutton, the 29-year-old son of former Dodgers and Angels Hall of
Fame pitcher Don Sutton, to replace Brian Barnhardt on radio play-
by-play with Mario Embemba.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgeball: Someone at KTLA Channel 5 didn't want Ross Porter as
part of the broadcast team for the Dodgers games on their station
anymore and sent a letter last October to the team telling them a
change to Rick Monday was going to happen, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Dodgers and KTLA released their 55-game schedule
last week, Porter and Monday were announced as sharing the second
play-by-play chair with Vin Scully.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Ross to be part of it _ everyone in the organization
did _ so we talked it over with KTLA and figured out a solution,''
said Derrick Hall, the Dodgers' VP of communications who started
his new position at the first of the year and had much to do with
remedying the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the KTLA letter was sent to the Dodgers, former
Warner Brothers chairman Bob Daly was named the Dodgers president.
The thought was that Daly could fix Porter's situation since he
knew the players at the WB-owned KTLA. Hall says Daly kept up with
the situation but never had to step in and assert his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the decision had actually been final by KTLA, he probably
would have,'' said Hall, who added that Channel 5 never made a
clear-cut decision to replace Porter with Monday despite what
Porter understood to be a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when I read the story in the Daily News last
fall (about the initial decision), but I'm happy the situation has
been resolved,'' said Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Porter and Scully will continue to be the only two play-by-play
men in Fox Sports Net 2's 80-plus game schedule, with Monday
working as the pregame co-host with Paul Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
   Unlucky 13: In a time when local TV sportscasters cram as much
(or little) into a four-minute segment of an unwatchable
``newscast'' as tolerable, something like the half-hour Sunday
night ``Talk About Sports'' show with viewer interaction that Newy
Scruggs had cooking at KCOP Channel 13 for the last four years was
more than a breath of fresh air. It was a chance for everyone to
breathe, period.
</P>
<P>
   But when contract talks between Scruggs and the station broke
down at the end of '99 and his deal wasn't renewed, the show simply
faded away, another fine idea tossed aside for lack of anyone else
capable of hosting it.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs, the co-host of the ``The Dawg Pound'' on all-sports
AM-1150 weekdays from 1 to 3 p.m., isn't hurting for local work.
But the fact is, he has out-of-state contacts that could pull him
out of the market entirely. To extricate one of the few
hard-working local TV sportscasters in town with a disrespectful
exit would be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but in five or 10 months from now, I think
they'll miss me,'' Scruggs said of KCOP.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance for him to stay involved in local TV is if he
becomes part of Fox Sports News' half-hour local segment, which has
been pushed back to a June launch because the Fox corporate
structure has been strangled in red tape trying to free up the cash
to get the project launched (all while it decides if it's going to
be a regional network with a national slant or visa versa).
</P>
<P>
   Former KTLA Channel 5 sportscaster Ed Arnold, who has applied to
fill Scruggs' opening at KCOP but would likely have to work as a
weekender, would be another critical acquisition for Fox Sports
News if it wants to establish local credibility. Since Arnold was
unceremoniously made the fall guy to make room for Claudia Trejos
last fall, he has continued his tireless community service work and
Monday begins co-hosting a weeknight show for the Orange County PBS
channel KOCE called ``Real Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden handshake: A funny thing happened to KAVL-AM (610)
since it was purchased by Clear Channel _ the measly Arbitron
ratings seem to indicate that many Valley folks actually find it
easier to pick up the simulcast of AM-1150 programming on the
Lancaster-based station instead of the L.A.-based signal for KXTA.
</P>
<P>
   When 1150's lineup changed at the first of the year specifically
the addition of the syndicated Bob and Tom Show put in tape-delay
from 5 to 9 a.m. weekdays KAVL was forced to eliminate Brian
Golden's local sports show that had been surprisingly running
strong in the 4 to 6 a.m. slot, supported by the many commuters who
have to leave for work early to get to jobs in the Valley and other
parts of L.A.
</P>
<P>
   So as KAVL celebrates its 50th year in operation, its only
regular local programming is Dan Sabastian's Saturday morning show
from 8 to 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Golden was given notice by station GM Larry Thornhill just two
days before the last show Friday, Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough and I feel bad about it, and so did Larry, but in
a perverse way it was good to hear the people who protested to the
station about it,'' said Golden, the Antelope Valley Press
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   His next radio gig could be working for One-on-One sports, aired
locally on 1540-AM. Golden will be teamed with Jay Mariotta's
morning show the week before the Super Bowl, which will be based in
Atlanta. The syndicated all-sports network has been looking to fill
a 10 p.m.-3 a.m. Friday night slot. Plans for a local L.A.-only
afternoon show from 1540 have apparently been discarded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   The Marion Jones Nike ad for the new cross trainer that ends
with a message about how it's continued on the shoe's special Web
site is ingenious. So much so that NBC and CBS have been so worried
that they'll lose viewers to the Internet, they've forced Nike to
revise the version of the ending on their networks. The former
Thousand Oaks prep phenom exclaims: ``Oh, you wanna race? You don't
have a chance,'' and sprints ahead of a POV camera as the chase
begins _ through houses, smashing through a glass door, dodging a
clothesline of laundry, before she goes past a street performer
juggling chain saws. The POV crashes into him and the saws are
falling from the sky _ and that's where the 30-second commercial
stops and says ``Continued at whatever.nike.com.'' From there, it's
four different endings to pick from (as long as you've got the
right stuff downloaded and the time to wait for it _ all while
you're not watching TV). On paranoid CBS and NBC, it just gives the
Web site address without the word ``continued.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Classic's ``Reel Classics,'' which started two weeks ago as
a way to work in Hollywood with sports events of the past. Sunday's
installment (6-8 p.m.) is ``Dead Solid Perfect,'' starring Randy
Quaid as a second-rate pro golfer leading the U.S. Open based on
Dan Jenkins' book. (Look closely: Playing the part of the TV golf
analyst is a former ESPN employee, Keith Olbermann.) It's followed
up at 8 p.m. by the 1967 U.S. Open golf tournament from
Springfield, N.J., when a promising young amateur named Marty
Fleckman held a one-shot lead over three guys named Nicklaus,
Palmer and Casper going into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   Please don't put this in the time capsule: It's only been out
two weeks, but the autobiography of WWF star The Rock, entitled
``The Rock Says...'' has hit No.1 on the New York Times,
Publisher's Weekly and The Wall Street Journal bestseller lists
simultaneously. The Rock, a former University of Miami football
player who looks like Deuce Bigelow on 'riods, overtook ``Have a
Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks'' by the WWF's Mick Foley,
which has been in the top six of the NYT list since its debut in
December and will be No. 3 this week. For the record: The books are
nonfiction; their employment is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods sells on news stands. On one hand, he made the
inaugural cover of Greensfever: The Magazine for Young Golfers. But
then he's also on the cover of Senior Golfer's January issue, a
story touting how he'll lead the game into the 21st century.
Somehow, Tiger missed out on the cover of Women's Golf Today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN execs won't even hide the fact that the network plans to
pair coverage of the Little League World Series tournament with the
X-Games from June 25-Aug. 17 because it'll be easier to bombard
homework-unburden kids with ads targeted for them right before
school starts, says a story in USA Today. Don't even think of
throwing coverage of the Spelling Bee in there, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Twenty-one years ago, when the Rams and Bucs met in the NFC
title game in '79, Pat Summerall did play-by-play for CBS, with Tom
Brookshier. Two years later, Summerall hooked up with John Madden.
Five years ago, Summerall should have retired.

MILD-MANNERED PAIR WITH A VERY SEXY PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Ind., Pa.)   (jw) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dan Gluck and Alison Maddex _ the stylish young
entrepreneurs who hope to build the Museum of Sex on Fifth Avenue _
always worry about revealing to reporters the story of how they
met.
</P>
<P>
   Their reluctance says less about the business partners than it
does about their experiences trying to get their decidedly
untraditional museum off the ground.It might be a little bit _ yeah, let's just forget it,'' Ms.
Maddex said. ``It's weird. Even though it's not really weird. It
could be weird to a lot of people.'' She pauses. ``Yeah, I think
we'd better not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gluck: ``We're being too vague.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex: ``It's not really a big deal. But people reading
about it _ you never know what goes on in people's minds, the way
they twist things.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``It's really no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Well, tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   Long pause.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``We had a shared lover. That's it.'' He adds quickly, ``You
can see how that might confuse a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not terribly confusing. The short version is that
while Ms. Maddex, 33, and Gluck, 31, were at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts together, she dated a very
attractive woman whom Gluck later also dated. As he describes it,
``We both kind of had our obsessions with this person.'' No
jealousy, really. No anger. Pretty tame fare even for a campus soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Maddex _ an artist, curator and art teacher who has been
the romantic companion of the writer Camille Paglia for the last
seven years and has been dating women much longer than that _ gets
nervous nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because of the attitudes that she and Gluck, a
thin, hyper-energetic former software company owner, have
encountered over the last three years while trying to find support
for what they see as a great idea, long overdue: a serious museum
about one of our most basic and entertaining urges and its impact
on art, popular culture and even science throughout human history.
</P>
<P>
   All of the big cultural foundations shied away from the idea,
they said. A newspaper ran a story about the proposed museum, using
``XXX'' in the headline and making Gluck's father, a diamond dealer
who works on 47th Street, very, very nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The partners could not even get permission from the New York
State Board of Regents, the group that oversees nonprofit cultural
institutions, to use the name Museum of Sex. The board cited its
guidelines, which discourage the use of the word ``museum'' in any
way that makes a mockery of the term.
</P>
<P>
   And so Gluck and Ms. Maddex had to register the museum as a
for-profit corporation in Delaware, much like a Fortune 500
company.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the two still find themselves trying to convince
people that they have no intention of becoming, as Gluck puts it,
the ``Ripley's Believe It or Not of sex.'' But they don't have to
do the convincing as often as before, and in their more optimistic
moments they have begun to allow themselves to believe things are
turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paglia has lent her name to the project. The museum has
begun to work with the famous Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex,
Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University. And this week, it
was included among the 29 institutions that received art from the
collection of Peter Norton, the California software entrepreneur,
and his wife, Eileen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the two were camped out in the shabby
building that Gluck and several partners bought and plan to tear
down to make room for the museum, at Fifth Avenue and 27th Street.
Their makeshift offices sit in a former shoe store, where
faux-bamboo shelves still line one wall. Instead of shoes, though,
the shelves are now filled with magazines, some pornographic and
many not.
</P>
<P>
   Gluck and Ms. Maddex _ who had fallen out of touch after college
and were then reacquainted by their common ex-girlfriend (``This
project is, in a weird way, predestined,'' he says) _ are the kind
of friends and partners who sometimes finish each other's
sentences. More often they talk at the same time and repeat the
ends of each other's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big ideas,'' Gluck says at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex echoes: ``Big ideas, right.''
</P>
<P>
   He was dressed in muted browns and blacks with lots of
pinstripes, and she was wearing a leopard-print shirt, short
pleated black skirt and tall black leather boots. But like most
people who are in the business of sex, from whatever angle, the two
do not seem to exude a tremendous amount of sexiness themselves.
They did not even say very many things that were unprintable in
this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And they added that most of the people who knew them as children
probably would not have guessed that they would go on to found a
cultural institution devoted to sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maddex grew up mostly in Washington, where her father was a
lawyer for the Justice Department and her mother was a publisher.
Briefly in high school, she says, she was a cheerleader. Gluck grew
up in Flushing, Queens, on Long Island and in Manhattan. His
father, who immigrated from Belgium, and his mother, who immigrated
from Iraq, are kind of ``Old World conservatives,'' he said, who
have slowly come to accept his new calling.
</P>
<P>
   Both partners are in long-term relationships. Gluck got married
in 1998, and sounding a lot like he is trying not to sound too
boring, he says he even wants to have children. ``Oh yes. We want
to breed. We're pretty traditional that way, I guess. I get that
question from a lot of people these days.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey officials sketched a $300 million
vision Thursday for the redevelopment of Ellis Island, most of
which has been concealed behind overgrown weeds and chain-link
fences from the millions who visit every year.
</P>
<P>
   They hope the plan would turn the long-neglected island in New
York Harbor into a setting for meetings ranging from local
corporate conferences to global peace talks, with new museums
devoted to America's immigrant heritage and the study of public
health.
</P>
<P>
   As a more urgent _ and realistic _ first step, Gov. Christie
Whitman said that $8.6 million had been secured from state, federal
and private sources to stabilize dozens of decrepit buildings
around the island, especially on its tumbledown southern half, the
so-called sad side, where immigrants too sick to be allowed entry
were housed in hospital wards until they recovered or died. The
total needed for this step is $10.9 million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As New Jerseyans, we take great pride in our history,'' the
governor said. . ``But we must also take care of our history so
that future generations can share our pride and visit these
landmarks of our national journey. We owe it to our future to
preserve our past.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements Thursday marked a dramatic and, by
governmental standards, rapid turnabout in the status of Ellis
Island, which after decades of neglect by the federal government
was labeled one of the country's most endangered historic places in
1997 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In the spring
of 1998, the Supreme Court ended a long border dispute between New
York and New Jersey by awarding Trenton sovereignty over all but 5
of the island's 27.5 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Although the island remained under federal control _ the
National Park Service owns and operates it _ Whitman immediately
asserted herself in determining its future. A 15-member commission
she appointed in May 1998 quickly ruled out a commercial project,
cheering those who had feared the island would be turned into the
site of a hotel or a theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists greeted Thursday's news with enthusiasm. ``I
think New Jersey has been a wonderful thing to happen to Ellis
Island,'' said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks
Conservancy. ``They've put their money where their mouth is. They
understand the importance of the heritage of Ellis Island and have
respected it with these recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breen noted that inmates from New Jersey prisons began
pulling up weeds and carting away garbage from the overgrown parts
of the island last April, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars
in contracting and hauling fees. ``With all due respect to New
York,'' she added, ``New York never did any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final report to the governor Thursday, the commission
recommended three main uses for the island.
</P>
<P>
   A Center for Immigrant Contributions and Ethnic Learning would
research and mount exhibitions celebrating the immigrant
experience, encompassing not only those Americans who passed
through Ellis Island, but also those who arrived in slave ships
from Africa and the Caribbean, and more recent immigrants from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only appropriate,'' the commission wrote, ``since
during the current decade, the U.S. may experience the highest
volume of immigration in the past century.'' One objective of the
center would be to illuminate ``the nation's seemingly
contradictory practices of ethnic exclusion, discrimination,
pluralism, assimilation and tolerance,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Though the report states that the center would avoid ``overly
focusing on specific immigrant or ethnic groups,'' Finn Casperson,
the commission's chairman, said that many ethnic groups could be
expected to help in either lobbying for money or contributing it,
among them the descendants of Irish, German, Scandinavian, African
and Asian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The second use, a Public Health Learning Center, would build
upon the island's history as the birthplace of the U.S. Public
Health Service. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, is
leading an effort to build a public health museum in Washington,
and Rep. Robert Franks, R-N.J., has introduced legislation that
would create a satellite of that museum on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   Third, an International Conference Center would be the first in
the United States on a publicly owned, nationally recognized site,
according to the report, and the combination of its proximity to
New York City and its ``insulated and tranquil, internationally
revered site'' could place it in the elite company of Versailles
and Geneva as a suitable setting for peace talks or global economic
meetings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The center would be publicly developed, but financed largely
with private money, Casperson said. New Jersey's many
pharmaceutical companies, ``who are renowned for their
conferences,'' could be expected both to pay for its construction
and to make use of the center, he added. Needed hotels could be
built on available land a short distance away in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Casperson, a prominent Republican contributor who
is a former chief executive of Beneficial Corp., said much of the
$300 million it would take to fully rebuild Ellis Island would have
to come from Washington. ``I strongly believe, and maybe I'm naive,
but this happened on the federal government's watch,'' he said.
``They were the ones who let the buildings go. They were the ones
who walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual financing announced Thursday was paltry by
comparison, but of no small importance, officials said. Whitman
said she would include $1 million in her proposed budget, which is
due within days, to preserve the Baggage and Dormitory Building,
the largest on Ellis Island and the one in the gravest danger of
collapse. The National Park Service will match that with another $1
million. Of the $6.6 million needed to stabilize the hospital
buildings, Congress has contributed $2 million and Trenton $2.3
million, and the rest is still being sought. A $2.3 million project
to save the pedestrian passageway is expected to be fully funded
soon, half from the federal government and half from a private
donor yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence,'' Casperson said. ``The buildings are
falling apart. They need to beed. We have momentum, but we
must act now. We cannot afford to put it off for another decade.''

TAIWAN CANDIDATE EASES ON CHINA POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to correct month of election in lede graf.)

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ In a move that could ease tensions between
Taiwan and China during the campaign here before the presidential
election in March, the candidate of the governing Nationalist Party
declined Thursday to reaffirm the government's policy of dealing
with China ``state to state.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, said the policy, which
President Lee Teng-hui announced unexpectedly in July, merely
reflected the reality of relations between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not reaffirming it, because that has been the constant
position,'' Lien said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lee's original statement was widely interpreted here
and in Beijing as a crucial step away from the premise that Taiwan
and China are two parts of the same country. The notion of ``one
China'' was the basis of sporadic talks between Taiwan and China.
Beijing angrily broke off contact after Lee's statement, and said
he was setting the stage for Taiwan's independence, something that
China has vowed to prevent, by military force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lien said Taiwan wanted ``parity'' in negotiations
with China, ``nothing more, nothing less.'' Political analysts said
with the election less than two months away and with Lien's
trailing in many polls, the vice president was trying to distance
himself from Lee, who has become a lightning rod for Beijing's
impatience toward what it views as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that at this moment we could make ourselves very clear
to them,'' said Lien, 60, a political scientist and protege of
Lee's. ``Taiwan will not go independent. But Taiwan cannot reunite
with the PRC for the foreseeable future, because it is simply
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   In another gesture, Lien said he would consider relaxing
restrictions on trade with China if relations improved. Under Lee,
Taiwan has maintained strict limits on trade in military and
technology-related products and on investments in Chinese public
works.
</P>
<P>
   Lien's campaign manager, Jason Hu, said the candidate would
offer more details about his China policy in a few days. Political
analysts here expect the vice president to offer a new linguistic
formulation that avoids the inflammatory phrase ``state to state
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the debate over Lee's statement is an
exercise in semantics rather than diplomacy. But words matter
greatly in the halting dialogue between Taiwan and China. And
Lien's more circumspect words are quite likely to be welcomed in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Chinese government issued yet another warning,
saying that the election, on March 18, ``must not lead to a split
or Taiwan independence.'' A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Zhu
Bangzao, said, ``No matter who becomes Taiwan's leader, it should
benefit the development of relations between the two sides and
China's peaceful reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lien has crept up in popularity polls recently, he
remains in second or third place in most surveys, behind Chen
Shui-bian, a former mayor of Taipei and the leader of the
Democratic Progressive Party, and James Soong, a former Nationalist
Party official who is running as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   As the vote nears, nerves are fraying. In 1996, in the last
presidential campaign, Beijing fired missiles into the ocean near
Taiwan to intimidate voters. Chen's party platform calls for an
independent Taiwan, although Chen has said he would make no
precipitous moves, and Lien is calculating that he can draw votes
away from his rival by promoting himself as the man least likely to
provoke a hostile response from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   While Lien is reaching out to China, he also appealed to the
United States not to abandon its support of Taiwan. ``After so many
years,'' he said, ``we find that American policy seems to lay more
emphasis on one side, the PRC side, and the Taiwanese side is not
emphasized as much as it needs to be.''

PLAN B FOR ANEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Alex Hassinger's tuxedo is back on the hanger. The
trainer wore work clothes _ blue jeans and a plaid shirt _ as he
sat behind his desk in The Thoroughbred Corp.'s barn at Santa Anita
Thursday morning and pondered the task ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger's job is to win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Anees, the colt he trained to a 30-1 victory in the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream Park in November, was named winner of
the Eclipse Award for the outstanding 2-year-old of 1999 at a
black-tie dinner in Beverly Hills on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, Richard Mulhall, racing manager for Saudi
Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp., said of Anees: ``I think
he'll win the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to put any pressure on Hassinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a lot of attributes going into his 3-year-old
campaign that anybody would want to have in a horse,'' Hassinger
said Thursday, demonstrating he shares the owners' confidence.
``Physical and mental capacity, pedigree for distance, conformation
for distance _ I think it adds up to a pretty nice horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like a Michael Jordan now. He's filled out, gotten a
little taller. He's one of those horses who, when they train, make
it look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy, though. Anees might be the winter-book Derby
favorite, but opponents are lining up. One of those opponents is
injury and another is bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Anees, a son of 1990 Derby winner Unbridled and grandson of 1978
runner-up Alydar, had to miss two weeks of training after bruising
his left hind foot in a December workout at Santa Anita. He
returned to the track to jog on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we lost time, which hurt,'' Hassinger said.
</P>
<P>
   He preaches the importance of following a firm schedule of prep
races _ with carefully chosen alternatives if weather or other
variables interfere _ leading to the May 6 Derby. Plan A, to start
Anees' season with the Jan. 30 Santa Catalina Stakes, had to be
scrapped because of the foot problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hassinger is aiming for the 1-mile San Rafael on March 4 or
the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe on March 19 _ or both _ as a prep for
the 1-mile Santa Anita Derby on April 8. Then on to Churchill
Downs, 1 miles from immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Anees will be nominated for all of the nation's major Derby
preps just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the colt, who won twice in four starts at age 2, does
start the new season, he'll have a new jockey aboard. Gary Stevens
retired suddenly on Dec. 26 because of painful arthritis in his
right knee. Hassinger said there's no hurry to choose a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger, 37, has been a trainer off and on for seven years.
Hired by The Thoroughbred Corp. last spring, he had an immediate
success when Patience Game won the Derby Trial, earning starts in
the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But his experience with good young horses goes back to 1991,
when, as assistant to Allen Paulson's private trainer, Dick Lundy,
Hassinger handled Dinard.
</P>
<P>
   Dinard and jockey Chris McCarron overcame a rocky first turn to
win the Santa Anita Derby and would have been favorites in
Louisville. But Dinard was injured in a workout a week before the
race and didn't compete again for months.
</P>
<P>
   The experience taught Hassinger how much can go wrong on the way
to the Derby. He thinks the mistake was running Dinard in a sprint
between two early-season routes. In other words, failing to follow
a firm prep schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger's planning has been complicated already by Anees' foot
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The colt also must overcome two jinxes _ no Breeders' Cup
Juvenile winner in that event's 16-year history has won the Derby,
and no 2-year-old champion has won it since Spectacular Bid in
1979. But Hassinger doesn't think Anees is one of those horses who
peak at 2 and don't grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks and acts like a different horse than before the
Breeders' Cup,'' the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   Anees, who showed the ability to come from behind after a rough
start in the Breeders' Cup, is easy enough to picture in the
Kentucky Derby winner's circle. But it won't be that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: The Bob Baffert-trained 4-year-old
Hookedonthefeelin, 5 for 6 after beating her age group in the La
Brea, takes on older fillies and mares in the Santa Monica Handicap
Saturday at Santa Anita. The 7-furlong race is the first Grade I
stakes of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cash Run will have Jerry Bailey in town to ride in Sunday's
Santa Ynez Stakes as she makes her first start since her long-shot
victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   There's always a catch: Oaklawn Park in Arkansas is taking bets
on races that have already been run. It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Video machines take bets of 25 cents or $1 on 10-horse races
from the past. Fans get skimpy past-performance information and
aren't told where or when each race was held or who ran.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are called ``Thoroughbred Mania.'' We prefer the
sound of the dog-track equivalent, in use elsewhere in Arkansas:
``Thundering Hounds.''
</P>
<P>
   A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (going into Thursday's races):
Corey Nakatani, 22 wins; Kent Desormeaux, 16; David Flores and Alex
Solis, 14; Pat Valenzuela, 13. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 10; Bobby
Frankel, 8; Ron McAnally, 7; Ron Ellis, 6; Richard Mandella, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay watch: Laffit Pincay, seventh in the Santa Anita
standings with 11 wins from 76 mounts, has extended his record for
career victories to 8,855. He rode Cee Dreams to a claiming-level
victory in Thursday's fifth race.
</P>
<P>
   On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $200,000 Santa
Monica Handicap, fillies and mares aged 4 and up, 7 furlongs, and
$150,000 San Marcos Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 1 miles on turf;
Sunday, $100,000 Santa Ynez Stakes, 3-year-old fillies, 7 furlongs.
At Gulfstream Park: Saturday, $100,000 Canadian Turf Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 1 miles on turf.
</P>
<P>
   Mileposts: Del Mar Futurity winner Forest Camp, considered a
Kentucky Derby contender before his poor effort in the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile, is being turned out for two to three months because
of unspecified soreness, said his new trainer Eduardo Inda. Also,
Prime Timber will miss the Feb. 5 Strub with hind-foot problems,
said Inda, who took over Aaron and Marie Jones' horses from Bob
Baffert recently.... Breeders' Cup Juvenile runner-up Chief Seattle
is on his way to the lavish training site in Dubai after being
purchased for undisclosed millions by Godolphin Racing, and could
be Sheikh Mohammed's Derby hope, this year's Worldly Manner....
Menifee, the horse who ran second to Charismatic in the 1999
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, is going to stud after injuring an
ankle in training.... The Hollywood Gold Cup will be held two weeks
later in 2000, on Sunday, July 9, allowing contenders time to run
in the Stephen Foster at Churchill Downs on Saturday, June 17.
Hollywood Park is owned by Churchill Downs, so such cooperation
makes sense. The schedule for the Inglewood track's April 28-July
24 season includes the April 30 California Gold Rush Day, featuring
five existing Cal-bred stakes and one new creation on a $1 million
card.... Bay Meadows, in San Mateo, opened a 49-day season
Thursday, with repairs made to the turf course that was closed
during the fall meet. First post most days is 12:45 p.m., Fridays
7:15. Marquee race: the March 11 El Camino Real Derby.... Santa
Anita's Frank Stronach is adding a sixth U.S. racetrack to his
holdings. It's Great Lake Downs, a western Michigan track that
opened in 1999.... Jockey Pat Valenzuela begins a three-day
suspension Saturday for being disqualified along with Outstanding
Hero in a Jan. 13 race at Santa Anita.... Handicapping feat of the
century: The Daily News' Bob Ike picked seven winners on Sunday's
nine-race card at Santa Anita.

KRAFT, BEEM SHARE HOPE LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES -- Greg Kraft shares the 36-hole lead with Rich
Beem in the $3 million Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, but the
35-year-old has more important things on his mind than winning a
golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He's worried about his favorite football team, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers, who play the St. Louis Rams in Sunday's NFC
Championship. The winner advances to the Super Bowl in Atlanta
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said he thinks he knows how the Bucs can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is to get that quarterback and hurt him,'' he
said. ``I like the underdog role, and I just hope the Bucs get in
there early.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft certainly is the hunt early this week. He has
back-to-backs 65s which leave him tied with Beem, a tour rookie
last season who once quit the game to sell cellular phones and
stereo systems in Seattle, at 14-under-par 130. Another shot behind
is a group that includes Brent Geiberger, who had a 61 at Indian
Wells, first-round leader David Toms (68), Barry Cheesman (62 at
PGA West) and Andrew Magee (65).
</P>
<P>
   Kraft did not have a single bogey in his round, which was played
at Indian Wells, which traditionally gives up the lowest numbers in
this 90-hole marathon. He birdied four consecutive holes in one
stretch of the front nine -- no putt was longer than 15 feet -- and
two of his three birdies on the back side were five-footers.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said his driving has made the difference so far this week.
He ranked 74th on tour last year in driving accuracy (69.9
percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting it well and the swing feels good,'' he said, ``but
I'm having a little trouble with in-between, feel shots. My timing
is a little off with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to address that the next couple days and try to tune
it up for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms, on the other hand, said he has not been driving the ball
well, despite fashioning a two-round total of 13-under 131. His
drive on the par-5, 564-yard 13th hole at Bermuda Dunes, for
example, went out of bounds and he wound up taking a double bogey.
He recovered with two birdies down the stretch, but that earlier
error did not sit well with him when the round was over.
</P>
<P>
   '``One of my amateur partners said, `I wish I could trade my par
for your double,' '' Toms said. ``It wasn't the first time, and it
won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lost my train of thought on it. Those things happen,
especially in a 90-hole tournament. But I hope that's the only time
it does this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Something unusual happened to Magee, who was Indian Wells.
Magee, who finished third in this tournament two years ago behind
Fred Couples (a playoff winer over Bruce Lietzke), hit a marshal
with his first drive of the day and bogeyed the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit him in a nice, soft spot,'' Magee said. ``It would have
ended up being a nice shot. I would have had a shot at the green.
He said he wasn't ready for the round to start and I said, `Well,
it started buddy. Let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking ominously behind the leaders are a large number of top
players, including Peter Jacobsen (64-133), last year's runner-up
Steve Pate (69-134) and the man he finished second to, David Duval,
who had a 67 and sits at 135.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who played at La Quinta Thursday, said he faced only one
troublesome shot when his approach landed in a greenside bunker on
the par-4 14th hole, but he sank it for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look very good, and then it went in,'' he said.
``That sort of turned things around for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval was paired with Rush Lumbaugh and called it an unusual
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of peripheral things that aren't
necessarily conducive to good play,'' he said. ``I guess you have
to enjoy it as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour rookie Casey Martin had an even-par 71 at Bermuda Dunes and
is at 139. Rookie counterpart Gary Nicklaus improved from his
opening-round 74 to a 69 Thursday at Indian Wells and is at 143.
Arnold Palmer also shot lower, but not by much. He followed
Wednesday's 82 at PGA West with a 79 at La Quinta and is last in
the field of 128 players at 17-over 161.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE RECOMMENDS A SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Responding to the growing threat of competition from
electronic trading systems, the directors of the Chicago Board of
Trade voted overwhelming Thursday to split the exchange into two
for-profit companies.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of the board of trade, a pioneer in the buying and
selling of grain, metals and financial futures for more than 150
years, said they would recommend that the members approve a plan to
demutualize the corporation and divide the exchange into one
company devoted to ``open outcry'' floor trading and another
dedicated to electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   The board's leadership hopes that the plan, creating two
independent and competitive entities, will help preserve and
enhance the old ways of doing business while developing a system to
capitalize on the growing movement toward low-cost electronic
trading.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, members of the board and top executives
have waged a nasty and often public internal battle over how best
to respond to the threat of electronic trading networks and whether
the rise of such trading foretells the demise of floor trading.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after several leading financial exchanges have decided to
move toward for-profit status and after the Chicago Board of Trade
lost its standing as the world's largest futures and options
exchange to Eurex, the Swiss and German electronic derivatives
exchange, the board says it is ready to create two companies that
will be more nimble, more competitive and less bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the exchange say that the marketplace will be the
final arbiter. ``The CBOT must change if we are going to thrive in
an increasingly competitive environment,'' David P. Brennan,
chairman of the exchange, said in a letter to members Thursday.
``This restructuring plan is the `best of all worlds' because it
will help us to better serve the trading community, while providing
a more stable financial future for our members and customers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the proposal, which requires approval by a
two-thirds vote of the exchange's 3,600 members, the board of trade
would have a privately held for-profit corporation behind the open
outcry system that has been used since 1848.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic trading operation, which the exchange expects to
spin off in an initial public offering, would compete directly with
the exchange as well as other electronic trading networks. Members
of the exchange, who own seats that allow them to trade on the
floor, will acquire an interest in both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the change was inevitable. ``It's clear
electronic trading is the wave of the future, and everyone on the
equity and derivatives side is trying to come to grips with it,''
said S. Craig Pirrong, a professor of finance at Washington
University in St. Louis. ``There have been key tensions that
underlie all the exchanges _ those between the floor community and
the broker community. The brokerage community essentially wants
speed and low execution costs, and the floor community views
electronic trading as a clear threat to their livelihood.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, the board is expected to outline more
details about the restructuring plan, and Thursday several members
said they largely applauded the move, but there are serious
questions about how it would work.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob J. Morowitz, a soybean trader who has been a member of the
exchange for about 30 years, said that he was concerned about the
relationship between the two companies, who will run them and
whether the electronic unit should compete directly with the floor
traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the wisdom of this,'' he said. ``As soon as you
set two corporations in competition, you're going to empower one to
eat the other one. I don't know if that's in the best interest of
the customers or the members. If I made you chief executive of the
electronic side, you'd say what can I do to boost volume? Kill open
outcry. You'd want to kill the other guy, create a monopoly and
then raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traders, however, say that the decision to split into two
companies is the best solution for an exchange where the price of
seats has dropped more than 50 percent from their high last year,
partly over fears of electronic competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the world is electronic exchanges are going to
be created,'' said Jay Homan, a grain trader for more than 25
years. ``I will argue the two will coexist. But why would you want
to lose anything to someone else doing electronic trading when you
can do it yourself?''

 FIRST ONLINE OFFERING OF BONDS AT RETAIL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Joe Moriarty, a computer consultant from
Parsippany, N.J., it was as easy as point and click to buy his
small share of the $3 billion in three-year notes sold by the World
Bank Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new issue, with lead underwriters from Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
and Lehman Brothers, broke more Internet ground by taking a global
bond offering to the retail investor for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the use of the Internet for bond issues, which
is the direction the corporate bond market is moving, is raising a
question about the future role of sales representatives on Wall
Street _ the people who have dealt with customers for years,
providing information and points of view, taking orders and
sometimes just holding customers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Simone, Goldman's managing director for e-commerce, said:
``We do not envision a world without salespeople. We don't want our
customers to order on the Internet and then not hear from them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Bacik, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Alliance
Capital who bought World Bank notes through the Internet on
Thursday, said, ``It appears that the role of the salesperson as it
currently exists will be diminished by the Internet.'' One of the
key roles that would be cut out is the provider of information on a
bond sale, because all of that can now be posted on an Internet Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why Alliance used the Internet rather than the
traditional phone dealings with a sales representative, he said,
``We believe that the corporate bond market is moving in this
direction, and we want to keep on top of this development.'' He did
say that because Wall Street was still learning about Internet
sales, his transaction was backed up by a call from a sales
representative.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the new World Bank notes were sold over the
Internet, bought by the traditional large institutional investors
that always show up and the middle-level institutional investor,
including insurance companies and banks, and the retail investor,
which the World Bank was making an extra effort to reach in order
to broaden its audience.
</P>
<P>
   The retail sales were done through www.schwabbondsource.com, the
bond Web site for Charles Schwab. A Schwab spokeswoman said that
about 400 customers ordered the notes, with a third of those coming
over the Internet. The total sales were about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty, who said he was buying notes to help rebalance his
equity-heavy portfolio to 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds,
said he would not have bought the World Bank issue any other way.
``I don't have a financial relationship with any financial house
dealing in bonds,'' he said. He got his information on the bond
sale, including the expected yield, from the same Web site. But he
was informed of the coming sale, he said, by postcard.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank notes, which are rated AAA, were priced to yield
7.122 percent, 48.5 basis points, or hundredths of 1 percentage
point, over the comparable Treasury issue.

   ``The entire nation is watching and listening to us,'' said Gov.
Jim Hodges of South Carolina, using his annual State of the State
Message on Wednesday to implore the legislature to remove the
Confederate battle flag that still flies ignominiously over the
Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to break a longstanding legislative logjam over the
issue, which has led the NAACP to declare an economic boycott
against the state, Hodges called for a compromise. He proposed
moving the flag, a symbol of slavery and segregation to many
citizens, from its inappropriate place of prominence on the dome to
``a place of historical significance'' on the Statehouse grounds.
The legislature ought to take his advice and also heed his call to
end South Carolina's dubious distinction of being the sole state
that does not recognize Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday as a
state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges' challenge to the legislature makes the cowardly mumbling
on the issue by the leading Republican candidates for president,
Gov. George Bush and Sen. John McCain, look even more disgraceful
than it already seemed. By now the nation should be beyond this
sort of cynical abdication of leadership by serious candidates for
the White House. This is a controversy that reverberates far beyond
South Carolina. As Hodges said, the whole nation is watching.

EDITORIAL: THE BARKSDALES' CHALLENGE

 (ATTN: Miss.)   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million gift from James Barksdale and his wife, Sally,
to increase literacy levels in their home state of Mississippi
confirms an increasing willingness among Silicon Valley's
entrepreneurs to divert some of their new fortunes to charity. It
also amounts to something of a political challenge. Like Bill and
Melinda Gates before them, the Barksdales seem to be saying that if
government cannot address the educational needs of the poor, then
private philanthropy will have to try.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the valley's newly minted millionaires _
Barksdale was president of Netscape, the Internet browser pioneer _
were defined as much by their stinginess as by their technological
wizardry and willingness to take risks. Then along came Gates, who
shifted $17 billion of his Microsoft stock into a private
foundation and put $1 billion of that into scholarships for
minority students in mathematics, engineering and education. Gates
said he thought that government had not provided minorities with
the boost they needed to succeed in an increasingly technological
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Barksdales' gift addresses an even more basic need _ the
ability to read. For years, Mississippi, which did not have
compulsory school attendance until 1985, has had the lowest
literacy rates in the country. The money will underwrite reading
programs in kindergarten through third grade, as well as intensive
training in reading education for aspiring teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The gift represents a transfer of wealth from people on the
cutting edge of society to people who are struggling just to get
started. It also sets an inspiring example for Barksdale's fellow
high-tech millionaires, many of whom are still in full
wealth-accumulation mode.

</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Security Council has long echoed with heated
confrontations. But there has never been anything quite like the
strained but polite scene Thursday as Sen. Jesse Helms sat in the
council chamber and warned that the United States would withdraw if
the U.N. sought ``to impose its presumed authority on the American
people without their consent.'' Several members of the Security
Council disputed Helms, but with utmost diplomacy. In the end, like
most disagreements at the U.N., the exchange was healthy for all
sides. It was even likely to increase understanding between the
United Nations and its critics in Congress and throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' visit, arranged by Richard Holbrooke, the U.S.
representative to the United Nations, was not just a ceremonial
drop-in by a prominent American legislator. Helms has been a
vociferous critic of the organization, charging it with
incompetence and inaction when he is not accusing it of trying to
become a coercive world government. Yet despite his criticism,
Helms, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
helped broker the deal that led to approval by Congress last year
of paying nearly $1 billion in back dues to the U.N. in exchange
for structural reforms there, some of them long overdue. If there
is a tradition of outsiders speaking at the U.N., Helms was a
reasonable choice.
</P>
<P>
   As both Holbrooke and Helms noted, the United Nations cannot be
indifferent to its standing in Congress. Both cited the example of
another chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Henry Cabot
Lodge, leading the Senate after World War I to reject President
Woodrow Wilson's treaty creating the League of Nations, with
disastrous consequences. It was good for Helms to visit and see for
himself that the United Nations is not a faceless institution that
exists outside its members, but a reflection of the members
themselves and their imperfect efforts to avoid conflict and
promote human rights in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of his speech the senator said he was extending
``my hand of friendship,'' and he hoped that listeners would accept
his criticism in that spirit. It was to the credit of the other
members of the security council that they did just that. They were
also right to rebut Helms' fallacious arguments, pointing out that
it is not right for any nation to decide whether to pay dues to the
United Nations based on the issues of the moment, or to equate
agreements on international norms with loss of sovereignty. When
Helms complained about the billions of dollars spent by the United
States on the U.N., other poorer nations rightly pointed out that
their support, with payments and peacekeeping troops, was an even
greater sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, the entire exercise proved to be a revealing
discourse on the nature of international law and order in the
post-Cold War world. Helms listened politely even as Martin
Andjaba, the Namibian delegate, criticized the Reagan Doctrine of
supporting anti-Communist insurgencies as having spread suffering
in Africa. At the end, the senator offered a salute to Andjaba,
said he was pleased to talk to people he had never met and
predicted that the disagreements ``will all work out.'' It was not
a bad day's business at an institution that needs greater
understanding in order to succeed. &QL;

TRUE TO ITS WORDS, LUCENT REPORTS A DISMAL QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks after warning that its financial performance for the
latest quarter would fall far short of analysts' expectations,
Lucent Technologies followed through Thursday ith its most
disappointing results since the company split from AT&AMP;T in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's shares are the most widely held in the nation. As North
America's No. 1 maker of telecommunications equipment, Lucent has
grown quickly as deregulation and the rise of the Internet have
combined to create surging demand for advanced network gear.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's management, led by Richard McGinn, Lucent's
chairman, made its first big mistakes last year, losing touch with
some customers' buying habits and falling behind the company's
archrival, Nortel Networks of Canada, in the fast-growing optical
networking market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company posted anemic revenue growth of less
than 1 percent for its fiscal first quarter, to $9.905 billion,
from $9.842 billion during the comparable period of the 1999 fiscal
year. Before Lucent's warning on Jan. 6, many analysts had expected
the company to generate revenue of around $11 billion in the first
quarter, which ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting off from AT&AMP;T, the No. 1 phone company, gave a huge
lift to Lucent. But last quarter may have been the first in which
Lucent grew more slowly than did its old parent.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two weeks ago, analysts had expected Lucent to
earn 54 cents a share during the quarter. But then the company
warned that it would earn no more than 39 cents a share. Thursday,
Lucent announced that it had earned 36 cents a share during the
quarter, or $1.175 billion, excluding one-time charges and gains.
On a per-share basis, that was 25 percent lower than the 48 cents a
share, or $1.523 billion, that the company earned during the period
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Including one-time charges and profits _ like merger expenses
and gains from sales of investments _ Lucent reported earnings of
$1.25 billion, or 38 cents a share. That was less than half the
$2.544 billion, or 80 cents a share, the company reported,
including one-time events, for the corresponding period of the 1999
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said, we're disappointed with our results for the
quarter,'' McGinn said in a statement. ``However, industry growth
is strong, and we are well positioned to take advantage of that
growth. The fundamental needs of our customers continue to grow,
and we intend to capitalize on this demand as we've done in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has not, however, fully capitalized on the fast-growing
demand for advanced optical communications systems, which transmit
information using pulses of light rather than pulses of
electricity. That has allowed Nortel to stake out a world-leading
position in the optical transmission market.
</P>
<P>
   At least as embarrassing, Lucent said on Jan. 6 that some of its
financial troubles in the quarter were a result of phone companies'
beginning to spread out their purchases of software more evenly
throughout the year, rather than making such purchases mostly at
the end of the calendar year. Shortly after splitting from AT&AMP;T,
Lucent had changed the beginning of its fiscal year to October, in
an attempt to begin each fiscal year with what was thought to be
the most robust quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent also said Thursday that it had agreed to acquire Agere, a
maker of programmable communications chips based in Austin, Texas,
for about $415 million in stock.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Makhmud Esambayev, a Chechen ballet dancer who achieved wide
recognition in the Soviet Union for his virtuosic folk dancing,
died in Moscow on Jan. 7. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The Itar-Tass press agency said he died after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Esambayev's artistry in theatricalized ethnic dances thrilled
Soviet audiences for decades, beginning with ``Dances of Many
Nations,'' a program he first presented in 1957. Leading ballet
choreographers, including Leonid Yakobson, created works for
Esambayev, who was considered a top-ranking Soviet dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Named a Hero of Socialist Labor in 1984 and a People's Artist of
the Soviet Union in 1974 by the government, he served as deputy to
the Supreme Soviet, the parliament of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Esambayev was born in the Chechen village of Stariya Atogi and
studied at the Grozny Ballet School from 1938 to 1941. During World
War II, which interrupted his training, he appeared with army
entertainment units on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   From 1944 to 1956 he performed with the ballet company in
Frunze, Kirghizia (now Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan), appearing mainly in
character roles or dramatic parts. In 1957 he returned to Chechnya,
where he taught in the 1990s. He also founded the Premier Ballet
Theater of Moscow. He was married and had a daughter, Itar-Tass
said.

JUGGY GAYLES, 86, PROMOTER WHO TURNED SONGS INTO HITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juggy Gayles, whose career in the music business stretched from
the Lindy Hop to hip-hop, died in his sleep Jan. 17 at the Parker
Geriatric Nursing Home in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Gayles promoted hit songs as a song plugger bringing material to
big bands and crooners, as a music publisher, as a promotion man
getting songs played on the radio and as a partner at a hip-hop
record label. ``My creative power has always been in publicizing
great geniuses,'' he said in a 1994 interview in Rolling Stone
magazine. ``I didn't make hits. All I did was help make a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayles was born George Resnick in the Brownsville section of
Brooklyn; Juggy was a younger brother's mispronunciation of
``Georgie.'' He danced the Lindy Hop at the big midtown Manhattan
ballrooms in the 1930s, and his friendship with big-band leaders
led to a job plugging songs for Remick Music, a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Most song pluggers performed new tunes for band leaders, but
Gayles' main method was to wine and dine the band leaders or join
them in betting on horses. Among the songs he plugged was Irving
Berlin's ``White Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He placed songs with Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra, and in the
1940s he started a publishing company, United Music, which had a
major hit with ``The Hucklebuck.'' But much of his publishing
profits disappeared at the race track.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s he promoted singles for companies including Carlton
Records. His job, he said in 1994, ofteded giving cash or
marijuana to disk jockeys as payola. From 1965 to 1969, he was a
promotion man for Atlantic Records, helping to gain exposure for
performers from Otis Redding to Led Zeppelin. He became an
independent promotion man in the 1970s, freelancing to promote hits
including Silver Convention's ``Fly, Robin, Fly'' and Herb Alpert's
``Rise.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, when he was 70, Gayles began promoting singles for
Sleeping Bag Records, an independent company that put out dance
music and singles in an emerging genre: rap. Seeing potential,
Gayles invested in the company and became a partner in Sleeping Bag
and its subsidiary, Fresh, until the late 1980s. Sleeping Bag
discovered the hip-hop group EPMD, who included Gayles' name in the
rap ``Listen to My Demo.''
</P>
<P>
   Failing health made Gayles leave the business. But in the 1990s,
after decades behind the scenes, he was heard on the air himself. A
phone conversation with the comedy team the Jerky Boys appeared on
their album ``Stop Staring at Me!'' and has been played frequently
on Howard Stern's radio show.
</P>
<P>
   Gayles is survived by a son, Ronald Resnick of Queens; a
daughter, Jacqueline Cowit of Boca Raton, Fla.; five grandchildren;
and two great-grandchildren.

POLICE EASE CAR SEIZURES IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Police Department disclosed Thursday a
major shift in its policy of seizing the cars of people charged
with drunken driving: Some drivers may be able to get their cars
back after completing an alcohol treatment program and paying
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials insist that the policy shift, which was made
public in testimony by Police Commissioner Howard Safir in a City
Council hearing Thursday morning, does not run counter to their
aggressive efforts to crack down on drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   But it may make the department's policy easier to uphold in a
court of law, said George A. Grasso, deputy commissioner for legal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The original policy, which city officials labeled the toughest
in the country, was announced by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with
fanfare last February. It called for seizing the car of anyone
arrested on drunken driving charges and only allowed for the
possibility of a car's being returned if the driver was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, the police had seized 1,458 cars; department
officials began forfeiture actions on 827 of those seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The modified policy applies only to drivers who had a blood
alcohol level lower than 0.20 percent when charged, have no
significant prior history of driving while intoxicated or impaired,
and have not been involved in any serious accident, Safir said. The
driver must see a state certified counselor for alcohol treatment
and the $1,000 _ in some cases less _ is charged to cover
administrative and litigation costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that in some instances, it might be appropriate
to find a less severe alternative, which allows the defendant to
address what might be an alcohol abuse problem,'' he told the
Council's Public Safety Committee, which called the hearing to
assess the car seizure policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going soft at all,'' Safir told reporters after the
hearing. ``What we're trying to do is, when we have somebody who
hasn't injured anybody, does not have an excessive amount of
alcohol _ it's not an egregious case _ who appears to be interested
in solving their problems, then we would look to give them a chance
to mitigate their violation and return the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the policy change was instituted in late November, the
department's legal affairs office has determined that 380 drivers
whose cars were confiscated were eligible to have them returned, as
long as the drivers met the requirements. No one has received a car
back yet, Grasso said, but as of Dec. 31, about 100 letters
offering drivers the opportunity to take advantage of the change
had been mailed out, and 41 responses expressing interest had been
returned to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso told reporters that the policy change also strengthened
the department's legal position, even though the policy on car
seizures has been upheld at the state Supreme Court and Appellate
Division levels. ``We're applying this program that is fair,
equitable and therefore that much more likely to be upheld at every
level of judicial review, up to the New York state Court of Appeals
and the United States Supreme Court, if it goes there,'' Grasso
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the city's seizure efforts welcomed the changes in
the program but were annoyed that the Police Department had not
made an announcement earlier. Grasso and other officials said the
policy was not made public because no one had inquired about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never heard of such a program,'' said Norman Siegel,
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and a
critic of the seizure policy. ``Moreover, I think it reinforces the
major points that we've been making all along, that when the city
of New York seizes people's cars without the requisite legal
authority, they make up the rules as they go along.''

BETTY CAGE, 82, ADMINISTRATOR WHO HELPED CREATE NEW YORK CITY
BALLET
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn.)  (rk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City
Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the
company, died on Dec. 19 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was
82 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her title for many years was simply that of general manager, but
Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the
limelight and was unknown to the general balletgoing public. A
woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers,
choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit
and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein described her role in ``Thirty
Years,'' his history of the City Ballet, ``at once labor
negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother
superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white
magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ``proficient in the science and
pursuit of the possible and impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo before she
moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an
assistant editor at John Bernard Myers' literary journal View and
an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that
introduced her to the world of poets, artists and intellectuals
involved in dance in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart,
where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a
precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired
formally in 1985, working first as an assistant to Frances Hawkins,
the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage
formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who as
chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948 extended a
crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of
the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's
1964 move to Lincoln Center on terms agreeable to the ballet
company and to City Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers
Emergency Fund at City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cage was also a practitioner and proponent of tai chi, the
Chinese exercise system. She collaborated with her husband, the
writer Edward Maisel, on ``Tai Chi for Health.''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband.

RAMS-WARNER TALKS COULD GET INTERESTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who expect that the St. Louis Rams' rags-to-riches,
storybook quarterback, Kurt Warner, will join 17 of his teammates
in the millionaire fraternity in the off-season might be in for a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Rams, who are paying Warner a mere $250,000, aren't
obligated to bump his salary beyond $280,000 for the 2000 season,
although it's doubtful they would have him perform at such a
bread-and-water level.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't look for Georgia Frontiere's notorious financial
hitman, John Shaw, who in an uncharacteristic gesture of
magnanimity recently bestowed a $500,000 bonus on Warner, to lavish
Warner with a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract. For one
thing, Shaw doesn't have to. In his second season with the Rams,
Warner won't be eligible for free agency until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw also has serious salary cap constraints to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' payroll this season is $55.7 million under the NFL cap
of $58 million that will increase to $62 million next fall and one
of the team's top defensive players, Pro Bowl cornerback Todd
Lyght, will become a free agent at the season's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   And four other key performers, receiver Isaac Bruce, defensive
end Kevin Carter and linebackers London Fletcher and Mike Jones,
will become free agents after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Lyght's current income is $3.4 million, and it's known the Ram
coach, Dick Vermeil, is strongly campaigning for the team to retain
his services, meaning Lyght figures to be earning in the $5 million
range if they do re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also have a quarterback on their roster in Trent Green
who hasn't thrown a pass this season and who they gave a $4.5
million signing bonus that was included in his four-year, $18
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a team drafting early is willing to give the Rams a first
round selection for Green and such a team reportedly might be the
Pittsburgh Steelers Shaw is planning to bring Green to Ram training
camp next summer if for no other reason than to keep Warner in
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' offensive coordinator and future head coach, Mike
Martz, is a passionate advocate of Green and has told intimates
that Green would have done as well as Warner had Green not gone
down with that knee injury during the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   If Shaw does re-sign Lyght and is unable to move Green, then
team sources say Warner won't necessarily be earning the
seven-figure wages next season that would be commensurate with his
remarkable achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agents play hard-ball with Shaw when they have the
leverage, and Shaw has a long history of playing hard-ball with
agents when he has the leverage,'' says one Ram source. ``And right
now, Shaw has the leverage on Warner. Shaw knows Warner is bound to
the Rams for two more years. If Warner decides to hold out, or do
something crazy like that, the Rams could turn to Trent Green. It's
going to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the Rams do trade Green, then John Shaw figures to
give Kurt Warner the lucrative contract he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   But until that happens, Kurt Warner will continue to be the most
underpaid star in the NFL, as was another Ram a long time ago,
fellow by the name of Eric Dickerson. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Las Vegas gambling figure Jimmy Vaccaro tells me the Rams were
200-1 to win the Super Bowl in Las Vegas in the summer, but that no
serious wagers were made on the St. Louis team to pull off such a
coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a few people stepped up pretty good when the Rams won
a few early games and the odds dropped to 60-1,'' reports Vaccaro.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Vaccaro makes the Rams 5 to 6 point favorites over
Jacksonville if the two teams make it to the Super Bowl. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Will someone please explain to me why two men who have proven
to be NFL head coaching duds, Bill Belichick and Dave Wannstedt,
suddenly have become such hot commodities? Wannstedt, who will
replace Jimmy Johnson in Miami, was a scandalous bust during his
tenure with the Chicago Bears. And Belichick, who's soon expected
to take over the New England Patriots, fizzled out lamely when he
had his opportunity with the original Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious these guys are far better at promoting themselves
than they are at inspiring their players, so help me Norv Turner.
...
</P>
<P>
   If Don Shula had still been coaching the Miami Dolphins in that
62-7 disaster last Saturday against Jacksonville, the tone of the
post-game analysis by the TV talking heads would have been that the
game had passed Shula by and that he was simply too old.
</P>
<P>
   But since that lovable media darling Jimmy Johnson was the
Dolphins' field commander, I didn't hear a negative word launched
in his direction. The reality with Jimmy Johnson is that he's
always been an overrated coach who benefited in Dallas from the
enormous wealth of talented players that fortuitously fell his way.
I thought he did a lousy job with the Dolphins. ../.
</P>
<P>
   _ The next time Kobe Bryant takes one of his indiscreet shots
which happens about three, four, five, six, seven, eight times a
game Phil Jackson should say this when he bawls him out: ``Stop
trying to be like Michael Jordan. You aren't Michael Jordan and you
never will be!'' Alas, Kobe continues to live with the grand
illusion that he is. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Felix Trinidad and David Reid were at the Biltmore Hotel
Thursday hyping their March 3 match at Caesars Palace that will be
promoted by Dan Goossen's America Presents by Don King in
association with Caesars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fight everyone has been waiting for,'' gasps
publicist Honest John Beyrooty, late of the Press Telegram who on
Saturday will join Mike Tyson's training camp in London where Tyson
has been preparing for his Jan. 29 fight in Manchester against
Julius Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least one person, David Reid, is excited about this
Showtime pay per view event, since he's set to earn $3 million in
only his 15th professional fight in defending his WBA super
welterweight title against Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad is expected to earn $4 million, slightly less than the
$15 million or so he would have made had negotiations not fallen
apart for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum has De La Hoya back to fighting a preordained setup, as
he has throughout De La Hoya's career, on Feb. 26 at Madison Square
Garden when he meets Derrell Coley in a match so unappetizing that
I plan to go bowling that evening to spare myself the discomfort of
watching it. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ I'm not sure what's worse, John Rocker's inane musings, or his
ensuing, pitiably contrived displays of public contrition. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ I never would recommend anyone to lay two touchdowns, but I
can't envision Tampa Bay staying within 21 points of the Rams on
Sunday. How are the Buccaneers going to score against the fast,
underrated Ram defense? ...
</P>
<P>
   _ I still don't understand why Michael Jordan retired, since he
obviously savors the limelight so desperately that he would subject
himself to overseeing the sadsack Washington Wizards. Such duty
will pose a terrible hardship on Jordan's golf game. Frankly, I'll
be surprised if Jordan, who's worth an estimated $100 million, is
still at the job a year from now.

JAMES CARD, 84, A LEADER IN FILM PRESERVATION, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio., Colo.)  (rk) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Card, one of the world's leading film preservationists, a
passionate devotee of silent movies and the founder and first
curator of the Department of Film at the George Eastman House of
Photography in Rochester, N.Y., died on Sunday at a hospital in
Syracuse, N.Y. He was 84 and lived in East Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Card joined the Eastman House in 1948, bringing with him his
personal collection of 800 films, which became the cornerstone of
the institution's archive. Under his direction, over a period of
almost 30 years, Eastman House was generally acknowledged as the
finest film collection in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Cherchi-Usai, the curator who holds Card's former position
at Eastman, said that the collection would not have existed without
Card. He added that his predecessor ranks as a preservationist with
three other major figures in the field, Jacques Ledoux from
Belgium, Henri Langlois from the Cinematheque in Paris and Iris
Barry of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others are better known, but he contributed very much the
same way,'' Cherchi-Usai said. ``The difference was that his
personality was so flamboyant that he didn't seem like an archivist
in the traditional sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Card frequently disagreed with Ms. Barry about her taste in
films and about the power that she held at her museum. He said that
her selections for preservation were crucial and that ``her
rejection of any film for preservation was tantamount to condemning
it to death.'' He added that the Museum of Modern Art and the
Eastman House were ``two of the very few places one may still see
projected, original, 35-millimeter nitrate films.''
</P>
<P>
   Card's book, ``Seductive Cinema: The Art of Silent Film''
(1994), is a personalized critical history of silent movies and
also a kind of memoir about his life in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some of us with an addiction, with fierce passion
for the medium,'' he wrote. ``We were militant and protective, and
we didn't want to change it in any way. We loved its silence. When
dialogue arrived and the silent film almost vanished, some of us
were so infuriated that we actually refused, for many months, to
even look at a talkie.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his many accomplishments, Card was instrumental in
reviving interest in the silent film star Louise Brooks. As a
longtime admirer of her work, he persuaded her to live in
Rochester. When Miss Brooks arrived, Card screened her films for
her, and she said it was the first time she had seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a working actress,'' Kenneth Tynan wrote in a profile of
Miss Brooks in The New Yorker, ``she had never taken films
seriously; under Card's tuition, she recognized that the cinema was
a valid form of art, and began to develop her own theories about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon she began writing articles for film magazines. Among Card's
other enthusiasms were Theda Bara, Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford
and John Barrymore.
</P>
<P>
   He was always in search of lost films. As he said, ``From barns,
abandoned warehouses, attics, basements, even from bedroom closets,
these old nitrate prints are still being discovered, for every good
silent-film historian is a film hunter as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Card's dedication to film began very early in his childhood in
Shaker Heights, Ohio, where he was born. He said that while others
chose to collect baseball cards or postage stamps, ``For me there
was never any question _ I had to have film, motion picture film of
my own.'' He began by inhabiting ``the Elysian fields'' of movie
theaters in downtown Cleveland, and by the mid-1920s he was seeing
five movies a week. An obsession, he said, soon turned him into a
monomaniac.
</P>
<P>
   By 1921 he had his first hand-cranked film projector, and he
began buying movies. Even before he left high school, he said,
``the mania to show and share wonderful films became an intense
concern,'' and he started showing them to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' was the film that changed his
life and ``shaped what would ultimately become a kind of career.''
That film, he said, ``influenced every film to come'' and ``served
dramatic notice that film was a graphic art rather than a
theatrical form or a branch of photography.'' While studying drama
at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, he bought a print of
``Caligari.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States he became head of a documentary film
and photography project for the federal government, and then was
drafted into the U.S. Army. He was grateful for the end of World
War II, at least partly because ``the collection could be
resumed!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 he became curator of the film department at Eastman
House, and the following year the movie archive was opened to the
public. In 1974 he was a founder of the Telluride Film Festival in
Colorado. He also taught film at Syracuse University and the
University of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jeannie; two daughters, Callista,
who lives in California, and Priscilla Card-Fuller of Deerfield
Beach, Fla.; and a sister, Dorothy Grove of South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot conceive of living without showing films,'' he said
in his book. ``Movies have been the ambrosia of my life. To offer
that gift to others, sharing in their enjoyment of the movies I
love, is my greatest joy.''

NYC PRINCIPALS BACK DEAL CALLING FOR LONGER DAYS, MUCH HIGHER PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By a 2-1 margin, New York City's public school
principals and assistant principals Thursday approved a contract
that allows inadequate principals to be removed quickly, requires
all principals to work longer days and summers, and significantly
increases salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which will increase paychecks by 33 percent for
all supervisors and up to 70 percent for the top 5 percent of
principals based on performance, comes when policy-makers have
complained that low salaries have cut the number of applicants for
principals' jobs while stifling innovation and improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Because of tradeoffs during negotiations, union leaders said,
principals still maintain their right to tenure through a due
process procedure that requires the school system to prove
incompetence or misconduct. Nevertheless, they were concerned that
the concessions would make approval difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, union leaders said, the union's members ratified the
contract because they had been working for four years without a
raise and because they were reassured that remaining job
protections seemed satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Harold Levy, the newly selected interim schools chancellor, said
Thursday that he was pleased by the strong show of approval,
because, he said, it indicated that ``principals are willing to
work to the kind of standards that I think are critical for the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been feuding with the Board of
Education over its selection of Levy, said the contract was ``an
important step in the effort to bring critical changes and
restructuring to our city's education system.'' He added, ``Only by
creating a system that puts children first, rather than job
protection, can we bring accountability to the New York City school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials, who had been anxious about the vote until the
final hour, were clearly relieved but a bit wary about how the deal
would work out as it is implemented over the next months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good for our members,'' said Donald Singer,
president of the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, who
announced this week that he was resigning to take a job with the
union's national counterpart. ``Let's just hope it works. With a
strong chancellor and a strong Board of Education working with one
voice, I think this will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The contract maintains the pattern of 11 percent raises in base
salary negotiated with other municipal unions. But in addition, it
provides a 19.97 percent salary increase for principals to work a
12-month year, with five weeks of vacation, rather than the current
10 months, and for them to extend their working day by half an
hour, to seven hours. Other union members also got extra raises in
exchange for relatively minor concessions, like cutting 10 minutes
from their lunch periods.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which extends through March 2001, will give
principals an average salary of $93,200. With incentive pay, the
highest-paid principals, who now earn $83,921, could earn more than
$143,000, an increase of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,498 votes in favor of the contract to 1,207
against.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest battle, which kept the contract talks from being
resolved for four years, was over tenure. City and school officials
said the new contract provisions, which will be enshrined in state
law, would give superintendents more discretion to remove
principals for unsatisfactory performance and would make the
process much quicker.
</P>
<P>
   The new process calls for principals to be removed for
incompetence only during a 20-day period every year in June, so as
not to disrupt the school year. Superintendents who want to remove
a principal will have to document their reasons with an annual
performance review.
</P>
<P>
   The performance review will be based on criteria negotiated by
the union, the superintendent and the individual principals. The
decision will be reviewed by an arbitrator and may be appealed to
the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Under law, the process will be limited to 60 days, while the
current appeals process often drags on for years. ``We have the
ability to get rid of turkeys a lot faster,'' said a city official
who was involved in the negotiations. ``That is a wonderful thing.
We obviously will have to make sure we have our ducks in order to
prove our case.''

CANADA ADDS DETAILS ON ALGERIANS' SUSPECTED BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Vt.) (Eds.: CORRECTS ``charged'' to ``accused'' in 4th graf; CORRECTS
name to Abdel Ghani Meskini in 8th graf; ADDS 2 grafs at end with
more charges being filed in   Seattle) 
 (rk) 
 By CRAIG PYES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canadian prosecutors Thursday offered the most
detailed picture to date of a bomb plot they said stretched from
Canada to Brooklyn and involved a number of Algerians, including
one they said was trained at camps in Afghanistan operated by
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the plot was coordinated by Mokhtar Haouari, a
31-year-old Algerian who was arrested in Canada last week after a
Manhattan grand jury indicted him on charges of taking part in
plotting an attack. A judge here ordered him held without bail
Thursday after a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, prosecutors in Seattle, New York, Vermont and
Canada have brought charges against a wide array of Algerians and
their associates. Thursday's hearing, in a Montreal courtroom,
marked the first time in the unfolding case in which anyone has
publicly tried to assemble the pieces of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing raised as many questions as it answered. It remains
unclear whether the Algerians had decided to attack a particular
target in the United States and, if so, where it was. Nor is it
clear whether Haouari was following the lead of some more
internationally known terrorist leader, for instance Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi exile who is accused by the United States of
masterminding the bombings of American Embassies in Africa in 1998
that left more than 200 dead. Intelligence officials say bin Laden
has operated training camps in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began on Dec. 14, when Customs officials at
Port Angeles, Wash., stopped a man who was trying to drive his car
off the ferry from Vancouver, British Columbia. That man, Ahmed
Ressam, broke into a dead run after a few questions and was
arrested. A search of his car found several jars filled with RDX, a
military explosive, and four Casio watches fashioned as homemade
detonators.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's hearing, a Canadian detective, Serge Haineault,
sketched the biographies of three of those accused of taking part
in the plot, saying two of them had known each other as schoolmates
in Algeria. He provided new details about how they allegedly tried
to pull off a bombing, and sought to draw links between them and
radical Islamic movements.
</P>
<P>
   Haineault said Ressam, known by the nom de guerre Abu Reda, had
received military training at camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan run
by militants.
</P>
<P>
   Offering the prosecutors' first detailed account of the
Algerians' frantic efforts to carry out their operation, Haineault
drew a picture of a flawed effort. He said Abdel Ghani Meskini had
been sent by Haouari on Dec. 11 to meet Ressam in Seattle and serve
as his translater and driver as well as provide him with cash drawn
from a stolen bank debit card.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, by the detective's account, made contact by telephone
with Ressam, who was staying in a hotel in Vancouver, just over the
border from Washington state. On Dec. 14, Ressam told Meskini that
he would be on the noon ferry and that he should ``stay calm.''
</P>
<P>
   But things did not work out as planned, Haineault said. Ressam
was arrested, leaving Meskini wondering what had happened.
According to Hainault, he made a series of phone calls over several
days to Haouari, trying to understand what had gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Meskini left Seattle and returned to Brooklyn. He
did not know it, but he was being watched. Federal investigators
had found a piece of paper on Ressam with Meskini's home phone
number, and they began watching his apartment and listening to his
phone calls soon after. According to the Canadian detective,
Haouari instructed Meskini to destroy all records of his trip to
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The precautions were not sufficient. On Dec. 30, a team of
police and federal investigators arrested Meskini and announced
that they had seen him discarding airplane tickets and other
documents.
</P>
<P>
   According to Haineault, Meskini responded to federal agents with
a series of admissions about his travels and dealings with Haouari.
Challenged in court Thursday to support his allegations, Haineault
said that much of his information on the case had come from
statements Meskini made to the FBI after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini's lawyer, Roland Thau, said any statement his client
made was ``not a confession of his own involvement in the knowing
transportation or assistance of a bomb carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Thau said Meskini had not offered to assist American
investigators. The ``statement'' referred to in the Canadian court
proceedings, he said, was not signed. Meskini has pleaded not
guilty, as have all other defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Haineault testified that Haouari had known Meskini since their
school days in Algeria. In fact, he said, Meskini was eager to
become a full-fledged member of the Armed Islamic Group, known as
GIA for its initials in French. The group, which has been involved
in the killing of tens of thousands of Algerians, has not
previously attacked Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Several Clinton administration officials have said the Algerians
involved in the plot are linked to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   American officials speculate that bin Laden is linked to the
bomb plot, but have not offered specifics to support their
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle later Thursday, prosecutors filed new, more serious
charges against Ressam and another Algerian, Abdel Majid Dahoumane.
The indictment for the first time formally accuses Ressam of
attempting to carry out a terrorist act, and it charges Dahoumane
as an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   American and Canadian authorities are continuing to search for
Dahoumane, who entered the United States separately from Ressam and
remains a fugitive.

MANNESMANN REBUFFS VODAFONE'S HINT OF A SWEETENED OFFER
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone AirTouch said Thursday that it was prepared to
offer a modest sweetener to its all-stock bid for Mannesmann AG,
now valued at $155 billion, but the German company spurned the
overture as ``wholly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer, which would increase Mannesmann shareholders' stake
in a combined group to a level somewhat less than 49 percent from
47.2 percent, is conditional on Mannesmann's approving the bid, a
Vodafone statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, said his own
stockholders would not countenance a bigger increase. ``They made
it totally clear to me that anything with 49 in it was a bridge too
far,'' he told the Reuters news service Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's hostile takeover attempt, the largest ever, was begun
on Nov. 19. At that time, the offer of 53.7 of its shares for each
Mannesmann share valued a deal at $127.7 billion, but that has
increased with Vodafone's share price. At current stock prices,
Vodafone's bid values each Mannesmann share at $305, compared with
$247.20 on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Esser, the Mannesmann chief executive, contends that
Mannesmann shares are worth as much as $354 each.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that Vodafone's newest conditional offer
for Mannesmann might have been intended to tempt the Mannesmann
board into recommending the bid to investors, pre-empting the high
costs associated with hostile bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look as if Chris Gent is holding out an olive branch
to Klaus Esser,'' said Kevin Sheil, telecommunications analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``If you ended up getting a
recommendation for the offer, you would see cooperation with the
Mannesmann management and Vodafone may look at this as a reasonable
price to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Thursday, Vodafone reiterated that its offer
for Mannesmann would close on Feb. 7. But the statement also said:
``Vodafone AirTouch recognizes that a recommendation from
Mannesmann would benefit the shareholders of both companies. There
will be no increase in the exchange ratio of Vodafone AirTouch's
offer in the absence of a recommendation from Mannesmann or a
higher competing offer. Even in the event of a recommendation from
Mannesmann, Vodafone AirTouch would only be prepared to consider a
modest increase in the exchange ratio of offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was made after Gent disclosed his readiness to
increase the offer in interviews with The Financial Times and The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The Vodafone statement also came as Mannesmann was reported in
talks with the French company Vivendi on a complex form of merger
or other deal that would give it control of Vivendi's Cegetel unit.
Cegetel owns the French mobile phone company SFR.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably seeking to counter such a maneuver, Vodafone
executives said Thursday that their company was also negotiating
with Vivendi, in its case to create European Internet and
interactive pay-television services. Vodafone plans to introduce an
Internet site this summer linked to new-generation mobile phones
and devices like personal organizers.

KRAFT IS DRIVING HIMSELF INTO SHAPE FOR HIS FIRST TOUR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. _ The closer Greg Kraft comes to winning,
the more his motivation increases.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing second in two tournaments last year, and having
his best season on the PGA Tour, Kraft believes he is ready to win.
Perhaps his time will come this weekend at the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic, a tournament where birdies are always plentiful, and where
Kraft obviously feels comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Posting his second consecutive 65, Kraft led by one stroke after
Thursday's second round of the 90-hole tournament, as players
continued to post low numbers in near-perfect conditions. Kraft was
at 14-under par (130), a stroke ahead of three players _ Rich Beem,
Brent Geiberger and Andrew Magee.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm, calm day, and a barrage of birdies occurred at
all four tournament courses. Geiberger's 61 at Indian Wells Country
Club tied the course record set by Bert Yancey in 1974, and equaled
by David Edwards in 1987. This is the same tournament where David
Duval shot a final-round 59 to win last year, and if conditions
remain calm this weekend, more records could be set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to keep making birdies,'' said Kraft, who shot
Thursday's 65 at Indian Wells. ``It's a five-day tournament, and I
know 14-under is not going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Kraft, Thursday's round was further confirmation that at
age 35, he is moving closer to being one of the tour's top players.
He finished with more than $810,000 in earnings last year, 52nd on
the money list, and posted three top-ten finishes, including a
second place at both the Doral-Ryder Open and the Mastercard
Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Doral-Ryder finish still haunts Kraft. He reached the
final hole needing a par to force a playoff with Steve Elkington,
the eventual champion, and a birdie on the final hole would have
given Kraft the victory. Instead, Kraft hit a terrible 5-iron
approach shot into the water, leading to a bogey that cost him a
chance for victory.
</P>
<P>
   That memory pushed Kraft during the off-season, as he undertook
a physical fitness program that has left him in the best shape of
his career. If Kraft never wins on tour, lack of effort will not be
the reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't forgotten it, and I don't ever want to forget it,''
said Kraft about last year's Doral-Ryder event. ``That was like a
knockout punch. Am I going to get up, or am I just going to lay
there? It still motivates me.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, Kraft's career has been on the
upswing. He finished 139th on the money list in 1997, 94th in 1998
and 52nd last year. If Kraft continues to improve, he will have a
chance to join some of the tour's elite players, but he is taking
nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm close, but to be one of the guys out here, you
have to win, and you have to be on the leader board a lot,'' said
Kraft, whose strength is his accurate driving. ``I'm not there yet,
but I'm giving myself every opportunity. When I look back, I won't
have any regrets. I'm working as hard as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kraft left the course with the lead, the day was not as
enjoyable for Casey Martin, who shot an even-par 71 at Bermuda
Dunes Country Club, leaving him four under par for the tournament.
One of Martin's amateur partners was Richard Ferris, a PGA Tour
board member, who testified against Martin in the 1998 court case
that resulted in Martin being granted the right to use a golf cart
in competition. Martin suffers from Klippel-Trenauney-Weber
syndrome, a rare circulatory condition that causes severe pain in
his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his day with Ferris went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could've been tension because of how he testified,''
Martin said. ``But I got to know him, and he's a nice guy. I
enjoyed playing with him.''

EDITORIAL: A SLOWER PATH TO MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The failure of a prototype missile interceptor to hit its target
in a crucial test this week makes it glaringly clear that the
Pentagon has not yet perfected the technology needed for an
effective national missile defense, even one of limited scope.
President Clinton, who has said under political pressure that he
will decide this summer whether to start building such a system,
should defer his decision until a fuller testing record can be
established.
</P>
<P>
   This week's test was the second of a scheduled three. Last fall
an interceptor missile successfully destroyed its target, but
almost by accident. It suffered initial navigational mistakes and
found the target only after luckily homing in on a nearby decoy
balloon. On Tuesday the interceptor completely missed the incoming
missile it was supposed to destroy, apparently because of the
last-minute failure of two heat-sensing devices.
</P>
<P>
   One more test will be held this spring, the last before
Clinton's scheduled decision. Even if it proceeds flawlessly, the
White House will not know for sure whether the system will
consistently work as intended. Missile defenses have to be highly
reliable to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will need to resist any impulse to approve the missile
system as a political tactic to protect Vice President Al Gore from
charges that the administration has left the country defenseless
against missile attacks from terrorist states. The latest test
failure may help him there by weakening support for immediate
deployment. Although Republican leaders in Congress are still
urging speedy deployment, some Republican senators are now urging
that a decision on the system be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive system under consideration is not meant to provide
a shield against the substantial missile forces of Russia or even
China, but to shoot down the handful of missiles that unpredictable
countries like North Korea or Iran might soon be able to launch
against the United States. It would still be one of the most
complicated weapons systems ever built. Sophisticated sensors would
have to find incoming missiles during their brief descent through
the atmosphere. Interceptors would then have to shoot these
missiles out of the sky, ignoring possible decoys as the two
rockets closed in on each other atined speed of 15,000 miles
an hour. The technology for doing this has progressed remarkably
far, but not yet far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding whether to go ahead with missile defenses, Clinton
must also weigh the possible effect on arms control treaties.
Russia currently rejects amending the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty to permit building the system Washington envisions. That may
just be an initial bargaining position that could change as
Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, reconsiders policies
inherited from Boris Yeltsin. But there is no harm in giving Putin
more time to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Until reliable missile defenses can be mounted without wrecking
arms control, Washington should continue to meet threats from North
Korea and Iran the way it met missile threats from Russia during
the Cold War _ through America's capacity for devastating
retaliation and efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear materials
and missile technology. &QL;

<P>
   OLD SAYBROOK, Conn. _ How better to assess the prospects for the
2000 Ford Taurus than to consult the salespeople who have to sell
it? A month or so before the new model reached dealerships, I took
the new Taurus to the local Ford store to gauge reactions.
</P>
<P>
   One might have expected the staff to be unimpressed with the
car's reskinning; after all, car salesmen are not usually described
as car enthusiasts. But I was surprised; they were interested and
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   They enthusiastically noted the new grille, the trunk and the
rear window. They commented on how the highlights of the hood
complimented the edgy new Ford design theme so noticeable on the
Mercury Cougar and Ford Focus. They were especially pleased to note
that the previous Taurus's oval rear window and awkward taillights
were gone. And they did not notice that the doors and windshield
are unchanged, saving a lot on production costs. The designers had
done their job well.
</P>
<P>
   Restyling a successful mainline car is always risky. Since the
Taurus was introduced for 1986 as a daring all-new design, it has
undergone several minor changes and one complete revamping, for
1996. It has been one of the top-selling models in the United
States, even taking the No. 1 spot for several years. Clearly, the
formula worked.
</P>
<P>
   But the '96 redesign was never universally embraced. The car's
styling theme was oval: oval rear window, oval grille opening, oval
central instrument panel incorporating the audio and climate
controls. The Taurus station wagon became especially oval, to the
detriment of practical considerations like access to the rear-seat.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought that the oval was going to be Ford's new look,
spreading to other models. But the public did not warm to that
approach. The 2000 Taurus steps away from the oval toward the
mainstream of current design.
</P>
<P>
   While the Taurus kept the doors and windshield of the previous
model, the rest of the sheet metal has changed. The result is a
much cleaner design incorporating a bit of Ford's new styling theme
of sharp angular lines. Along the way, the Taurus picked up more
room in the rear seat and in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from body and styling changes, the Taurus remains, under
the skin, basically the same car. Hundreds of thousands of previous
owners will not be surprised by the way it rides and drives. They
may notice snappier response, especially from the dual-cam Duratec
V6 engine, and they will likely notice more responsive steering
from the new, larger 16-inch tires and wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Steering and handling are now competitive with the best in the
class, foreign or domestic. The feel of the steering is much
improved and there is little body roll on corners. The brakes are
smooth and progressive in normal driving, but I worried a bit about
the small rear drum brakes of the sedan. (The station wagon has
four-wheel disc brakes.) An antilock braking feature is standard on
the SES and SEL models, $600 on the LX and SE.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is softer than in previous Tauruses, and becomes a bit
floaty on certain bumps, but it is still well controlled. The
Duratec V6 in my test car felt powerful and was quiet on the
highway, yet sounded aggressive when the car accelerated
forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   The Duratec, a modern, dual-overhead-cam power plant, is the
engine of choice; the base engine, an old-fashioned pushrod design
called the Vulcan, is the same size but much less powerful and not
much more fuel-efficient. Both V6s meet the low-emission standards
of California and 13 Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the 2000 Taurus looks, rides and drives is not the
main marketing thrust anymore. The emphasis is now on safety. Ford
says the Taurus was ``designed for enhanced performance in crash
tests and real-world accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   To this end, the Taurus (and its fraternal twin, the Mercury
Sable) have what Ford calls ``advanced restraints system safety
technologies.'' The crucial part of this system is a
restraint-control module that takes into account the driver's
seating position, whether the driver and front passenger are
wearing safety belts, and the severity of the crash to determine
the level of air bag protection to deploy _ or whether a bag is
needed at all. The module also knows when to activate the
pretensioners for the front-seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   This is a significant step forward in air-bag crash technology,
in advance of any federal requirements. Several luxury cars have
advanced air bag controls, but none have gone this far. In
real-world crashes, the Taurus will be better able to protect
occupants without the danger of an air bag firing when it is not
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The safety thrust does not end with new technology for front
crashes. Side air bags that help to protect both head and chest,
are a $390 option. The interior is designed with more
energy-absorbing trim; tether anchors are provided in the rear seat
for the new child safety seats that use them; and the trunk now has
an emergency inside release. This simple, T-shaped handle, which
glows in the dark, was added in response to reports of children
dying after they became trapped in car trunks.

A RUN FOR OFFICE MEANS A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Fla., Iowa, Mass., N.C.)   (af)  
 By VIVIAN MARINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alberta Hipps, an experienced registered nurse, gave up a secure
career as a hospital staff director several years ago for a
position that pays about half her former salary, has no job
security and requires her to spend several nights a week away from
her family.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might call her foolhardy. Mrs. Hipps, 56, prefers to
think of herself as a servant of the public _ or rather
Jacksonville, Fla., where she has held one of 19 city council seats
since July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more like Mrs. Hipps _ civic-minded individuals
willing to sideline careers, spend hundreds or thousands of dollars
from their own pockets and countless hours on the road for one of
the estimated 513,200 local, state and federal elected offices. In
any given year, between 100,000 and 150,000 seats are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the finances of high political office-holders _ like
members of Congress, who earn six-figure incomes and often can
leave for choice jobs with lobbying or law firms _ get the
attention, it is a different story on the local front.
</P>
<P>
   Some successful candidates for lesser posts do move on to
higher-paying offices or parlay their experiences into lucrative
careers in the private sector. But few can expect significant
financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some individuals must make serious financial
sacrifices, which could at least temporarily alter their standards
of living. And some in more high-profile offices like leadership
roles in the legislature have to rework their investment portfolios
to avoid conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Corbett, a former House speaker in the Iowa Legislature,
recalled having to sell shares of a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, start-up
telecommunications company named McLeodUSA Inc. soon after buying
them a few years ago because, as he said, ``There were pieces of
legislation pending that may have had an impact on the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he kept the shares, he said, they would have been worth
about $18,000 today, or six times what he paid for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ancillary effects to consider,'' said Hank
Madden, a financial planner in Jacksonville. As with any business
venture, he said, ``You will need to have a formal financial plan
before you get started. You will have to ask yourself, `what will I
have to give up to do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a candidate who left a job or worked part time
while campaigning might lose group discounts for health care and
disability insurance. The candidate may no longer have the
eligibility or the money to participate in an employer-sponsored
retirement plan. Saving for the children's college may be postponed
because money earmarked for them may have to be diverted to the
campaign or living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And professionals like doctors, lawyers or small-business owners
may be forced to curtail their schedules, and therefore sustain
income losses that could take years to recoup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at how all this will affect your immediate
and long-term plans,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners and campaign consultants suggest obtaining as
much money as possible through contributions first, then using
personal savings, before taking out loans or dipping into
retirement or life insurance plans. If borrowing is necessary, a
home-equity line of credit may be best since a portion may be tax
deductible, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say never borrow to buy a depreciating asset, and
let's extend that to running for public office,'' said Jonathan
Pond, a financial planner from Watertown, Mass., and author of
several personal finance books. ``Chances are, even if you're
successful, your income probably is going to suffer,'' Pond said.
``Nobody goes into it for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those planning to run for office can expect to spend between
$15,000 and $200,000 to conduct a successful citywide campaign in a
mid- to large-size city, and between $25,000 and $300,000 for a
state legislative office, according to Ron Faucheux, the editor of
Campaigns &AMP; Elections magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and gubernatorial candidates easily can run up
bills well into six- and seven-figures. ``Campaigns have become
increasingly costly and technologically driven, and candidates have
to prepare for a tough fight,'' Faucheux said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Faucheux (pronounced FOO-show) said it was crucial that all
candidates stick to budgets. He suggested drawing up ``high,''
``medium'' and ``low'' budget plans, or ``ideal'' and ``bare
bones'' plans. These budgets will help dictate how much candidates
need to raise or kick in themselves. ``Candidates have to figure
what the threshold is to be competitive,'' he said. ``It might be
nice to have $200,000, but you may need $150,000 to have a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The amounts vary greatly by state, said Joel A. Thompson, a
political science professor at Appalachian State University in
Boone, N.C., and co-author of ``Campaign Finance in State
Legislative Elections,'' (Congressional Quarterly, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's book, written with Gary F. Moncrief, a political
science professor at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho,
analyzes the cost of winning in 20 competitive state houses of
representatives from 1986 to 1994. ``In some states, the costs are
so high relative to the pay,'' Thompson noted, citing North
Carolina, with costs about twice as high as the base legislative
salary of around $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the larger the state, the bigger the expense. For
1994, candidates in California spent on average $431,000;
candidates in Illinois averaged $190,000; in Oregon, $78,000; in
Wisconsin and North Carolina, $38,000; in Montana, $6,500, and in
Wyoming, $4,500. New York was not included. Costs are substantially
higher today.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the state, incumbents almost always have an easier
time raising money than their challengers, and usually do not have
to use personal savings, experts agree. But some who had hoped to
continue working at another job find they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hipps, a Republican who represents the southwest corner of
Jacksonville, was re-elected to a second four-year term last year.
During her first campaign, she scaled back to part time at St.
Vincent's Medical Center in Jacksonville. For the last two years,
she has worked full time in her council job, which pays $32,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two grown children, she has had to spend a few
thousand dollars from her own pocket on her two campaigns _ the
bulk of which went for filing fees and, the first time around, a
fund-raising barbecue at her home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was fortunate, however, to have had strong
financial backing from supporters, thanks to the long hours spent
pounding the pavement, and the health benefits and income of her
husband, Frank, 66, a retired terminal operator for Chevron Oil.
The Hipps also raise cattle on a 17,000-acre family farm in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had young children and was at another point of my life I
don't know if I could act on what I wanted to do,'' said Mrs.
Hipps, whose foray into politics stemmed from her displeasure with
the city's plans to build a prison on a closed Naval air station,
near her home. ``I really do enjoy what I do a lot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For some public officials, though, the sacrifices are too great.
Corbett, 39, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, resigned last year after 13
years in the legislature, the last five as House speaker. He said
he tired of having to solicit contributions for re-election every
two years, and wanted to earn more.
</P>
<P>
   He now heads the Cedar Rapids Chamber of Commerce and earns more
than double the $31,000 base salary and an $86-a-day stipend during
sessions, he was paid as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start thinking about things like college and my
children and a bigger house,'' said Corbett, the father of five
children, aged four months to 8. ``We didn't miss any meals, though
my wife was driving around in an '84 Ford van with 109,000 miles on
it. I drove a newer car _ an '87 Cavalier with 180,000 miles on
it.''

ON PRO FOOTBALL: EVEN IN TRIUMPH, VERMEIL'S HIRING IS A SORE POINT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Last summer, Warren Sapp, the Tampa Bay defensive
end who never met a microphone he didn't like, was asked about St.
Louis coach Dick Vermeil. Sapp didn't mince words, claiming Vermeil
was a ``washed up'' coach who got his job only as a result of the
old-boy network.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sapp was asked whether he wanted to, well, rethink
his inflammatory comments, especially considering that Vermeil was
named coach of the year after his Rams went 13-3 in the regular
season. Sapp didn't back down, saying his feelings had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   As harsh as Sapp's words about Vermeil may have been, they were
not necessarily untrue. When Vermeil was put in charge of the Rams
in 1997, he was 60 years old and had not coached a game since 1982,
when he was the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. Vermeil had spent
the time in between as a television analyst for college football
games.
</P>
<P>
   So Vermeil was a retread. Many in the news media blasted the
hiring at the time as yet another indication that a white coach,
even one out of the profession for 15 years, always had an edge
over a black coach because of race. At the time, black assistants
privately asked what was so special about Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil's hiring, in some ways, is still a sore point with many
black assistants. While coaches like Vermeil get a second chance,
they say, most black coaches do not. Ray Rhodes, formerly of the
Philadelphia Eagles and recently let go as the head coach in Green
Bay after an 8-8 season, is the only black head coach to get a
second job after being fired. The Atlanta Falcons offensive line
coach Art Shell coached the Oakland Raiders and was 54-38. He is
considered one of the smarter coaches in the game. Still, his phone
has not been ringing with offers. He has not received the second
chance that white coaches do.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams and the Buccaneers meet in the NFC championship game on
Sunday, and it must be said that Vermeil, despite the opposition by
so many to his hiring three years ago, has proven Sapp, and many
others, wrong. Vermeil did something that other older coaches would
not, the most notable being Mike Ditka, who was stuck in the 1980s
and was as old school as an eight-track tape.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil adapted.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil changed.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil refused to go the way of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a 180-degree turn between last year and this year,''
Rams linebacker London Fletcher said of Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   His change in personality is something that Vermeil will not
address fully, mainly because that is the way of NFL coaches. They
do not readily admit that they may have made a mistake. Football is
too macho for that.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence is clear. When Vermeil went to St. Louis, he
made several crucial errors. He drafted the troubled running back
Lawrence Phillips in the first round, something that proved to be a
disaster after he got into a number of off-field difficulties. The
Rams eventually cut Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil also alienated players with brutal practice sessions. In
training camp, he held three-hour, hard-hitting sessions twice a
day. Once the regular season began, Vermeil held practice once a
day, but it was still harsh, and the players became so irate that
there was almost a mutiny; especially irritated were the older
players, who would be worn down by the end of the season. Players,
as well as high-ranking officials throughout the organization,
spoke to Vermeil about easing up, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   That was the beginning of Vermeil's change. ``I think what he
did was that he kept an open mind about things,'' St. Louis
defensive back Todd Lyght said.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil also began making smart draft and personnel moves, such
as trading for running back Marshall Faulk, who this year had an
NFL-record 2,429 all-purpose yards. ``We wanted guys who could
move,'' Vermeil said. ``As you can see, we don't have any fat guys
who can't run.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil also delegated much of his authority to his offensive
coaches and allowed them to open things up, despite his strong
affinity for the more conservative ground game.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a happy Vermeil as well as happy players, some of
whom are winning for the first time in their careers. ``Not only
would we lose games due to the fact that our personnel didn't match
up,'' Lyght said, ``we would be outcoached. And that hasn't been
the case this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Vermeil and Ditka is startling. Ditka, the
longtime Chicago Bears coach, never adapted after returning to the
New Orleans Saints. He made questionable personnel decisions, such
as trading the rest of his entire draft for running back Ricky
Williams last April. One Saints player said privately last month
that the team saw Ditka more as a caricature than a respected
coach. The owner, Tom Benson, recently fired Ditka after going
15-33 during his three-year stint in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Why Vermeil was able to make the transition and Ditka was not is
one of those interesting mysteries. All Vermeil cares about now is
that he is a heartbeat away from taking the Rams to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And his team just might run over Sapp on the way there.

WAREHOUSE PROJECTS SPROUT IN DIGITAL AGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 23) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., Texas, Calif. Va., Conn.)   (af)  
 By TODD MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two buildings will spread themselves over some 160,000
square feet _ more than three football fields _ on the south side
of the airport in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But when their construction is complete at the end of this year,
don't call them warehouses. Call them ``pass-through facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   And call them one developer's answer to a vexing issue in
electronic commerce these days _ actually delivering the goods
ordered through point-and-click shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Trammell Crow Co., one of the country's largest commercial
real estate businesses, is helping to develop the Portland project,
with the hopes of leasing space to e-retailers and to the companies
that provide warehousing and delivery for them.
</P>
<P>
   For many e-commerce retailers, selling a product online is
becoming astonishingly easy; the tricky part is finding an
efficient way to have that product immediately available, and
quickly getting it to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has brought digital-age e-commerce companies back to
industrial-age concerns _ to roads, trucks, warehouses and airports
_ and to a search for ways to speed up the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that e-commerce is going to effectively compete
with local retailers is if a customer logs on and orders something,
and they can get it within a day,'' said Steven Bradford, a vice
president with Trammell Crow. ``If I have to wait for three or four
days, I'm going to just go out and buy the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns have led e-commerce companies, and the companies
who want their delivery business, to a range of options.
</P>
<P>
   The $16 million Portland project represents one of them. The
Dallas-based Trammell Crow and its partner, the AMB Property Corp.,
a San Francisco real estate investment trust, are building the
Portland locations not so much to store goods as to whisk them on a
whirring conveyer belt from Internet order to the customer's door.
</P>
<P>
   When finished _ completion is expected at the end of this year _
the buildings will be configured to make it easier for loading
equipment to maneuver. The buildings are being constructed at
Portland International Airport and will have direct access to its
taxiways. Four 747s and 68 large trucks will be able to load and
off-load goods at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the developers were working to attract air cargo
companies, freight integrators and e-commerce concerns. ``We feel
like it's the next generation _ it's the logical extension of
e-commerce,'' Bradford said of the Portland project. ``The closer
you can get your product to the air cargo center, the quicker your
delivery time.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership will pay $523,000 a year to lease the property.
Trammell Crow would not discuss specific rental rates for its
sites, but airport authorities in Portland said on-airport rentals
went for a premium _ perhaps double the commercial rate for the
area. Analysts say the project developers should have little
trouble renting the space in Portland, either to e-retailers
themselves or the companies that provide shipping services for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's going to gobble up that space, no doubt,'' Stacie
McCullough, a senior analyst with Forrester Research, said of the
Portland project.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Trammell Crow and AMB completed a similar development
at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Tenants there include a priority
mail operation of the Postal Service, the air cargo division of
Lufthansa and a fresh-flower e-commerce company. And Bradford said
the partnership was looking to develop other such locations.
</P>
<P>
   But projects like these _ located right on airport property _
represent only a fragment of the delivery systems being built for
or used by e-commerce companies nationwide. Because on-airport land
is limited, most new warehouse developments are built near large or
geographically important airports _ especially airports that serve
as a hub for package delivery companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's e-commerce subsidiary, hpshopping.com, for
example, has its warehouse near Memphis, the largest air cargo hub
for Federal Express, hpshopping.com's primary delivery service. By
locating the warehouse there, the unit extends how late a customer
can order a product online and still get it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if you're going to be playing in this next day or
two-day kind of space, you're got to be near a hub, near an
airport,'' said James Morales, the logistics manager of
hpshopping.com.
</P>
<P>
   For other e-businesses, proximity to large airports seems
relatively unimportant. Amazon.com, for example, added about 2.7
million square feet of distribution center space across the country
from December 1998 to last November, in places like Fernley, Nev.,
Coffeyville, Kan., and McDonough, Ga. _ paying more attention to
their proximity to potential customers, said Bill Curry, a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon delivers more than 60 percent of its products through the
Postal Service, he added, noting that, in general, they are not the
kind of products customers expect the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're selling books and hammers and TVs and Walkmans and
stuff like that, you can get a book or a Walkman to a customer
faster and less expensively with a set of regional facilities,''
Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has invested $300 million on its entire warehousing and
delivery system. But the vast majority of e-commerce retailers,
said Elissa Myers, president of the Electronic Retailing
Association in Arlington, Va., are outsourcing the delivery of
their products to catalog companies and other businesses with
existing warehouse and delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, the Minneapolis-based Fingerhut Companies has been
shipping home furnishings, knickknacks and clothing sold through
its catalog. Now, the company _ purchased last year by Federated
Department Stores for $1.5 billion and an e-retailer itself _ does
much more: it uses its warehouses and distribution system to
provide ``order fulfillment'' for a number of online retailers,
including eToys and the online operations of Pier 1 and Wal-Mart
Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've reinvented themselves, basically,'' Irving Chernofsky,
research director for the consulting firm Gartner Group in
Stamford, Conn., said of Fingerhut and a few other formerly
catalog-only companies. ``They're now e-commerce fulfillment
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   For many e-retailers, paying _ usually by volume _ to use such
an established system and for the expertise to make it work makes
much more sense than paying the huge cost of building a system
themselves, Ms. Myers said. That is especially true, she added, for
online sales that are seasonal. ``You may need 100 people packing
packages for two weeks, and one person for the next two months,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   What e-commerce companies need most, of course, are happy
customers. And many in the industry believe that having happy
customers has almost nothing to do with fancy Web sites and
everything to do with getting the goods to the customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner you get the customer something,'' said Morales of
hpshopping.com, ``the more likely they are to be happy with the
whole product and purchase, and with you.''
</P>
<P>
   That, some say, will only become more true. ``The next level of
competition is going to be time shopping: who can get it to me
quickest?'' Chernofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies that fail that test won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Web sites have nothing if they don't have brand
loyalty,'' Chernofsky said. ``Bad word of mouth spreads very
rapidly.''

CLOSS A NO-SHOW AT PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phenomenon known as Keith Closs-trophobia _ &UR;  &LR; an apparent
fear of closing in on NBA success _ has filled this week's quota
for bad Clipper karma.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that six-game losing streak is no slouch.
</P>
<P>
   Closs was a no-show at Thursday's practice, one day after
skipping out early on his weight-lifting assignment, a maneuver
Coach Chris Ford responded to by saying the 7-foot-3 backup center
would not suit up for tonight's game with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not here,'' Ford said. ``Elgin (Vice president of
basketball operations Baylor) will deal with it. We put in our
calls like we do for people who don't show up. We haven't heard
from him. It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   According to team sources, the birth of Closs' first child is
due, which might explain why the third-year Clipper would miss
Thursday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't figure to excuse Wednesday's incident or get him
off the hook for not phoning it in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the Clippers said Closs still had not been
reached. An official decision on his status for tonight's game will
be made today.
</P>
<P>
   T'wolves at the door
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves, who are a toasty 7-3 in their last 10 games,
scored a 91-88 victory over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday at the
inhospitable Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been playing extremely well,'' Ford said. ``They're on
a nice roll. They're finding ways to win. ''
</P>
<P>
   The best way seems to include frequent passes to budding
superstar forward Kevin Garnett. Garnett put up 31 points against
Karl Malone and the Jazz, and another 37 in Monday's victory over
the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford may be even more impressed with Garnett's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played defense on Karl (Malone) as well as I've seen anyone
play defense on Karl,'' said Ford, a dedicated follower of the NBA
on DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks
</P>
<P>
   One visitor to Thursday's practice at Veterans SportsComplex in
Carson was Lamar Odom's agent, Jeff Schwartz. Schwartz, who lists
Odom as his only NBA client, did have an extended chat with
shooting guard Derek Anderson. Anderson is believed to be
considering a change in agents, joining the growing ranks of NBA
players set to abandon the representation of rap star Percy
``Master P'' Miller's No Limit Sports. ``DA'' continues to pass on
the opportunity to testify about his agent situation.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is midafternoon, two days before Y2K, and Sarah
from Brooklyn is calling WLIB, the city's premier black talk radio
station. She is dismayed about Rudy Crew's exit as the schools
chancellor, and she has her own take on the reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe this, and I told this to a number of
educators the day after the Board of Education raised Crew's salary
to over $200,000,'' Sarah said, just getting started on her, um,
unique theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more money than the president of the United States of
America makes. Did one African-American really think that that
amount of a raise was really for a black man in office? That amount
of money was raised because the mayor knew Rudy Crew's time was
short, and that raise was secured for the next Caucasian female,
who is an educator and who I happen to know and I happen to believe
will be the next chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, Puffy Combs was the subject on WLIB, and the
phones were ringing as if the station were conducting a cash
giveaway. Several callers were supportive of Combs, the rap star
and promoter who was arrested late last month on a gun charge. But
one listener was riled at the self-described ``ghetto fabulous''
impresario.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man of Puffy's caliber, his status, which they allege that
he has millions of dollars, shouldn't he get security and not these
nitwit brains he has securing him?'' the caller sniffed. ``A gun in
the car. I mean this is really ridiculous, and you see it over and
over again with these so-called millionaire rappers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Riley, the host of ``Politics Live'' on WLIB-AM (1190),
agreed. ``If you're going to have somebody who's going to be armed,
have somebody who's licensed, a professional,'' he said. ``What
happens is these guys pick the biggest cat they used to run with.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, day after day on WLIB and a handful of other
stations that broadcast talk shows geared to the full range of the
city's black listeners. On some shows, the talk can be angry and
conflicted, with hosts and callers tackling everything from trouble
hailing cabs to Amadou Diallo to the use of the word ``niggaz'' on
a popular DMX record.
</P>
<P>
   Other conversations can be more mainstream, where, for instance,
one might hear sad, knowing talk about the people from Princeville,
N.C., the nation's first black-governed town, which was ravaged by
rains last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black talk radio is the drum of the community,'' said Imhotep
Gary Byrd, a popular former host at WLIB.
</P>
<P>
   But if much of the city, black or white, is aware of black talk
radio's existence, its various conversations _ irreverent,
emotional, academic and, yes, sometimes conspiratorial _ are not
regularly heard by the city's mainstream. Several weeks of
sustained listening, then, revealed a rich and varied dialogue, one
that made it easy to understand why black talk radio has long
functioned as a roiling, playful and galvanizing lifeline for
blacks in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Roger Green of Brooklyn was recently a guest
on ``The Open Line,'' a Sunday morning talk show on WRKS-FM (98.7),
better known as KISS-FM. Green compared the current foster care
system to chattel slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mothers who are coming into my office on a weekly
basis who have literally had their babies in some cases torn from
their breasts,'' he said. He also called ``the prison-industrial
complex'' a menace to black children, ``who are being picked like
cotton and being shipped upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York state last year the only growth in the governor's
budget was in prisons, he said. ``There's no question that people
come to Albany to lobby to create prisons,'' he said. ``It's become
a perverse economic stimulus package for poor whites in rural white
areas.'' In reality, the governor did propose modest spending
increases in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Such conversations have been going on a long time. Black talk
radio had its genesis in Chicago in 1948 on WSBC, where Jack I.
Cooper was the host, said Bob Law, a veteran of both talk and
rhythm and blues radio. Law, now on WWRL-AM (1600), a
black-owned-and-operated station in Woodside, Queens, recently
wrote a book about black radio, ``Voices for the Future,''
published by African-American Images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black talk was the only outlet for the frustration and the
attainment of information,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without black talk,'' he added, ``the community becomes
voiceless. White talk is not neutral or impartial. It's
Eurocentric. White talk raises no critical questions. Right now,
Clinton has encouraged European countries not to buy bananas from
Caribbean farmers. He wants them to buy only from Chiquita or Dole.
The bananas they were selling to European countries were just
enough to sustain them. This issue is never examined on white
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days at WLIB, talk radio was an outgrowth of public
affairs requirements imposed by the Federal Communications
Commission. ``There was no real energy in it,'' Law said. ``It was
not a priority. Some of the disc jockeys had to come back and do
these public affairs shows about health, housing and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, four New York City stations have black talk shows. Judy
Ellis, general manager at KISS-FM, said ``The Open Line'' had
139,200 listeners, while the station's Sunday night show, ``The
Week in Review,'' had 36,300 listeners. (KISS's overall
listenership for people 12 and older is 1,288,500, which puts it in
the top 10 in the New York market.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WLIB management said it did not have figures for individual
shows, but the mostly talk radio station has a listenership of
280,300 for people 12 and older. WBAI-FM (99.5), which has five
black hosts, including Elombe Brath, the activist and artist, has
about 200,000 listeners, according to management. And WWRL, which
has a show by Tony Brown, a well-known broadcaster, has 250,000
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   James Mtume, a member of KISS-FM's talk team, said there was
tremendous growth potential in black talk radio. ``Given the
landscape, I think black talk radio is a sleeping giant ready to
blow up,'' he said. ``People would love something else other than
the next love songs. Blacks are starved for information.''
</P>
<P>
   Black talk radio has not been without controversy over some of
its content. In the early 1990s, for example, the Jewish Action
Alliance held protests over comments made during the Crown Heights
riots. ``On WLIB and WWRL there was an unbelievable amount of
anti-Semitism,'' said Beth Gilinsky, president of the group. ``We
held demonstrations. It was 1991, during the year of the Crown
Heights riots. We located their sponsors and they started pulling
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   But employees of black-owned and black-programmed stations say
their shows are held to a different standard than the white
mainstream. Steve Rendall, a senior analyst at Fairness and
Accuracy in Reporting, a national media watch group, echoed the
sentiment. ``We've noted and quoted the occasional black talk radio
host,'' said Rendall. ``But in New York City, the irresponsible
comments from black radio hosts are nothing compared to the torrent
of bigoted talk that comes from white hosts on big mainstream radio
stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, black talk radio is chiefly driven by the city's
great engine of emotional discourse: race. And virtually every week
brings a new framing question.
</P>
<P>
   After the actor Danny Glover's problem getting a cab in New York
in the fall, the mayor's offensive on cab drivers who bypass blacks
dominated the shows. At KISS-FM, a panel of pundits discussed the
improvements they had already witnessed since the mayor announced
that he would revoke the hack licenses and impound the taxis of
drivers who whiz by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday was one of the days that a brother could get out there
and put his arm out and a cab would stop,'' said Bob Slade, a talk
radio veteran and the moderator of the Sunday night show, ``The
Week in Review.'' ``You could be talking, making an expression and
the arm would accidentally go up and the cab would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on WLIB, Riley, the host of ``Politics Live,''
discussed Dr. Lenora Fulani, a black radical former presidential
candidate who has endorsed Patrick Buchanan, the Reform Party
candidate, for president. ``What some people thought was the
strangest match in this century or in any other century, for that
matter,'' Riley began, ``was Pat Buchanan and Dr. Lenora Fulani,
late of the New Alliance Party, but obviously functioning now
within the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, she is Buchanan's most prominent black backer. She
has promised to take him to Sylvia's and some other places. Somehow
Pat Buchanan and soul food don't work well with me. But I have an
open mind. Hey, Dr. Fulani could have him rioting before this is
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was something loopily hilarious about Pat Buchanan
eating at Sylvia's in Harlem, things got heated when Minister
Conrad Muhammad took over the mike at WLIB last week during his
show, ``One on One.'' Muhammad, the minister of Mosque No. 7 in
Harlem, invited Karl Evanzz to discuss his book, ``The Messenger:
The Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad.'' The author made a case for
the Nation of Islam leader's resilience in the face of years of
monitoring by the FBI. But then, Evanzz, as others have, accused
Elijah Muhammad of being the father of several illegitimate
children.
</P>
<P>
   A livid caller lashed out at Evanzz, an online editor at The
Washington Post. ``The Messenger was 100 percent true to what he
taught until his departure in 1974,'' the caller said. ``This FBI
business about producing children at Temple 2, a temple which is
full of hypocrites since the 1930s, making children by sisters and
charging the messenger with this evil. So this person writing this
book does not have his facts. Stop slandering the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers on black talk radio stations, not unlike on other radio
stations, can be unpredictable. Several months after the fact, Mark
from Brooklyn wanted to talk about the Klan's anemic march in
downtown Manhattan, although Utrice Leid, the host of Talk Back, a
call-in show on WBAI, was discussing Hillary Rodham Clinton's run
for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Klan was marching I didn't see no responsible black
leadership speaking against the Klan,'' Mark said. ``Did you notice
anybody?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, maybe it's just me. Those same voices that said, `Oh,
no, Khallid this, Sharpton that, and Farrakhan, the other one' and
always the ones denouncing. I ain't seen those same voices saying
no they shouldn't march. It's just one of those things that make
you say hmmmm.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Ms. Leid said: ``Did you say hmmmm?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said hmmmm,'' Mark said.
</P>
<P>
   And on to the next caller.

DROP SCHOOL PROJECT, LOS ANGELES IS URGED BY NEW SUPERINTENDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his first major decision, the acting
superintendent of the Los Angeles school system has recommended
that officials abandon a $170 million investment in an urban school
construction project that has been troubled by environmental
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   In a report made public Thursday, Ramon Cortines, who assumed
control over the Los Angeles district on Sunday, and Howard Miller,
the chief operating officer, said open-ended cleanup costs and an
additional $55 million needed to finish construction made the
project, the Belmont Learning Complex, unfeasible, especially when
the money would have to come from funds needed for books and
teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the report said that the site should be used as a new
headquarters for the city's school administration and that quickly
finding space for students in the crowded area should become a
priority. Board members are scheduled to consider the
recommendation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to realize that this is not a question of
mathematics, but of judgment,'' the report said. State energy
officials had warned of the site, a former oil field, and it has
been found to have dangerous concentrations of methane and hydrogen
sulfide.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation raises the stakes in one of the most
politically sensitive issues in Los Angeles in recent years. If
board members were to reject it, it would put them in the position
of spurning the advice of an official they avidly courted last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Political fallout from the project was a significant factor in
the departure of the previous superintendent, Ruben Zacarias.

INTERNAL REPORT DETAILS CORRUPTION WITHIN UNION

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An internal union report lays out a picture of extensive
corruption in the nation's largest union of government employees,
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was made available by a union official eager
to have the federation take a tougher stance on corruption,
provides an unusual look at a major union's internal problems, and
describes corruption far beyond the well-known scandal at the
union's giant New York City affiliate, District Council 37.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the report describes corrupt activities by 35 union
officials, ranging from the $2.2 million known to have been
misappropriated by an official at District Council 37, to $96,000
stolen by the treasurer of Local 366 in Milwaukee to $51,000 taken
by a mid-level official at District Council 20 Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In dry language, it describes how union officials forged checks,
made unauthorized withdrawals from union accounts, siphoned union
dues into their personal accounts and used union credit cards for
personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a comprehensive list detailing the $4.6 million in
claims that the union made to its insurance company, seeking
reimbursement under a policy that covers fraud by union officials.
The report involved claims pending last November.
</P>
<P>
   Since many unions do not release information about internal
corruption, it remains unclear how the amount stolen compares with
what has happened at other unions, particularly those better known
for struggling with corruption. But the report offers an unusually
detailed portrait of internal problems at a union that is on the
rise in influence and power.
</P>
<P>
   The federation is the nation's second-largest union, a
1.4-million member organization that recently surpassed the
Teamsters in size, while remaining behind the National Education
Association. The union's president, Gerald McEntee, is chairman of
the AFL-CIO's political committee. He is one of labor's most
prominent backers of Vice President Al Gore, and he has overseen
more than $4 million in contributions to Democratic causes over the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the accuracy of the information contained in
the report, officials with the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, known as AFSCME, insisted that corruption
was no worse in their union than in many other unions. These
officials said that the report attested to the success of the
union's stepped-up up efforts to audit locals and uncover financial
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the claims arise out of New York's District
Council 37, with 56 union locals, in which two dozen officials have
been indicted. Other corruption claims involved locals in Indiana,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, something has happened to this union in the past five
years,'' said Carl Biers, executive director of the Association for
Union Democracy, a New York-based watchdog group. ``Things have
fallen apart in many, many regions. It wasn't always like this.
Clearly, whatever McEntee's strengths are, he has been turning a
blind eye to a lot of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Weinberg, the union's general counsel, said that
considering how many locals are in the parent union, it is not
extraordinary that there were some corruption problems in a dozen
or two locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AFSCME is cleaner than most unions,'' Weinberg said.
``When you add up all this union's locals and chapters, we have
between 7,000 and 8,000 subordinate bodies, and what you're looking
at is a pretty small number out of that universe.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, union-sponsored audits uncovered the thefts
detailed in the report. In addition, officials accused of theft
have usually been stripped of their jobs, and some have been
indicted. Several of the District Council 37 officials involved in
the claims have pleaded guilty to embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the union said that in 1998 the union, concerned
about spiraling corruption in New York City and elsewhere, adopted
tighter auditing procedures, requiring, for instance, annual audits
of any union local or district council with more than 2,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an aggressive auditing program,'' Weinberg said. ``We
have a zero-tolerance policy for wrongdoing. We believe we're more
aggressive to cleaning up than any other union. They may be a price
to pay for that. This type of information comes out. But we're
doing all the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some labor experts said that the corruption in the union, while
lamentable, did not approach levels seen decades ago in three
unions that were controlled or influenced by organized crime: the
Teamsters, the International Longshoremen's Association and the
Laborers International Union of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the state, county and municipal employees' union,
Edward A. McDonald, former director of the Organized Crime Strike
Force for Eastern New York, said: ``Any time you have multiple acts
of corruption in an international labor organization, it doesn't
look good, but if there are 3,000, 4,000 locals and you're talking
about three dozen people, it's certainly not a crime wave. But the
corruption that's reported pales in comparison to the racketeering
activities that characterized certain mob-dominated unions
throughout the '70s and '80s.''

</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said one explanation for the corruption was that the
union is highly decentralized, meaning its locals more financial
autonomy than most other unions. One episode of corruption
described in the report involves Robert Gordon, who was ousted from
his job as treasurer of the Milwaukee local representing 220 sewer
workers after a bookkeeper discovered that some money was missing.
A union audit reported that Gordon had apparently embezzled $96,000
by writing 208 checks to himself that were not approved and were
not used for union purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold ourselves to very high standards, not only in AFSCME,
but in Wisconsin,'' said Richard Abelson, a top official with the
union in Wisconsin. ``Our expectation is things like that don't
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has not been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Gerald Boyle, said Gordon was talking to
law-enforcement authorities and was working with union officials.
``We will take care of making sure that whatever needs to be put
back into the union's coffers is put back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Steven K. Grubb, the treasurer of a
municipal workers' local in Elkhart, Ind., wrote $13,500 in union
checks for his personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ard, executive director of the council representing all of
the union's 8,000 workers in Indiana, said Grubb had been removed
from office when the local's other officers uncovered the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not anybody's personal money,'' she said. ``This money
belongs to the members of the union.'' She said that Grubb had
admitted to union officials that he siphoned off the money.
</P>
<P>
   Another insurance claim made by the union involved the
controller of a district council in New Jersey, who the union said
stole $42,700 by forging checks and making unauthorized
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   Another claim involved the president of a Long Island, N.Y.,
chapter of the union, who the union said stole $14,870 from the
union. The official, Pasquale Ferraro, was removed by a union
judicial panel, although he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Ferraro has been charged with grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention several prominent episodes of
corruption not covered by the claims report. In 1998, for example,
the secretary-treasurer of the union's district council in
Washington, Thomas Waters, pleaded guilty to embezzling $761,000,
while the council's finance director, Barbara Wood, confessed to
stealing $73,500.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Twigg, an agent for the union's insurance company, St.
Paul Cos., said, ``I don't know if they have more claims than other
unions. I don't find them to be extraordinary or unextraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other unions, the Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees has what is known as a fidelity bond insurance
policy that provides for reimbursing the union if an official
commits dishonest acts that cause the union to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Twigg said his company examines all such claims to make sure
they are valid.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not mention several prominent episodes of
corruption not covered by the claims report. In 1998, for example,
the secretary-treasurer of the union's district council in
Washington pleaded guilty to embezzling $761,000, while the
council's finance director confessed to stealing $73,500.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the claims that St. Paul Cos. processed between last Oct. 1
and Nov. 22, the report said, the company paid off $605,000 of $2.6
million in claims.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason the company paid off less than the claimed
amount was that the union claimed $2.2 million for money it said
was stolen by Charles Hughes, the former president of a local in
District Council 37, representing New York City's school crossing
guards and cafeteria aides. The policy covering Hughes provided a
maximum of $500,000 in reimbursement to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes has been charged with embezzlement. Sarita Kedia, Hughes'
lawyer, said Thursday that her client was innocent of wrongdoing.
The report added several new details about the District Council 37
scandal, asserting, for example, that several aides to Hughes had
improperly written hundreds of thousands of dollars in checks that
ultimately benefited him personally.

FAA EASES RULES ON BOEING 777 LONG-HAUL ROUTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Federal Aviation Administration has decided to
ease restrictions on how far Boeing's 777 can fly from emergency
landing sites on long-haul routes across the North Pacific, the
Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change will become final in 60 days, and will provide a
marketing boost to current models of the 777, as well as the even
longer-range 777X that is expected to be launched soon.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's policy statement regarding the change will go into the
Federal Register on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer obtained a copy of the 30-page statement.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said safety will not be compromised as a result of the
change. It said the 777 has proved itself to be extremely reliable.
</P>
<P>
   A number of airlines, including Continental, United, Delta and
American, have pushed hard for the FAA rule change because it means
they can fly their 777s on shorter, more fuel-efficient routes with
fewer schedule changes that inconvenience air travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has mounted an intense campaign against the change in
so-called ETOPS regulations. ETOPS stands for extended range
twin-engine operations.
</P>
<P>
   The European airplane maker's long-haul, A340 widebody jet,
which competes with the 777, has four engines and is not subject to
the same restrictions as the twin-engine 777. Industry analysts say
this has given Airbus an important advantage in sales competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly eliminates a potential disadvantage to our
airplane,'' Chet Ekstrand, Boeing's vice president responsible for
ETOPS, said Thursday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the FAA decission) provides an advantage to the 777 which
is consistent with its remarkable design and capabilities. ... This
action by the FAA recognizes that capability and eliminates a
disadvantage that is wholly inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA decision will become final 60 days after it is entered
into the Federal Register, though the agency will allow an
additional 45 days for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   It already has taken hundreds of pages of public comment since
last April.
</P>
<P>
   The change was sought by the Air Transport Association, which
represents more than two dozen U.S. and international airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Although some smaller pilot unions and groups have opposed
easing the current restrictions on how far the 777 can fly from
emergency landing strips, the transport association's request for
the change has the backing of the Airline Pilots Association, which
represents more than 55,000 airlines pilots with 51 airlines in the
U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Under current ETOPS regulations, the 777 flight must be within
180 minutes (three hours) at all times from an emergency landing
site on northern Pacific routes, such as from Tokyo to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The change approved by the FAA will allow a 15 percent extension
to 207 minutes (three hours and 27 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The most optimal way for airlines to fly across the North
Pacific takes the plane on a Great Circle route for which the
half-dozen emergency airports are in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands
and the Russian Far East.
</P>
<P>
   If these alternate landing sites should be closed because of
weather, there is a 5- to 13-minute gap that exists where the plane
would be beyond the current 180-minute restriction. In that case,
twin-engine planes must fly a more southernly route, which can add
as much as 45 minutes or more to a flight from Los Angeles to
Tokyo, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The new extension to 207 minutes will close that gap. It applies
only to the 777.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, in its statement that will go into the Federal
Register, said a study by United Airlines found that 10 percent of
its flights would benefit from the extension to 207 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the extension to 207 minutes, Airbus has said it
would further erode safety in the event of an in-flight emergency
such as an engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA said adding the 27 minutes actually will improve
safety, since it will bring planes closer to more enroute alternate
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus last year caused something of an industry uproar with an
ad campaign that suggested its four-engine planes were safer than
two-engine planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Ekstrand said studies do not support the Airbus
position.
</P>
<P>
   He said twin-engine planes actually have a lower rate of
engine-related accidents than four-engine planes.
</P>
<P>
   And the 777, he added, has the highest flight completion rate of
any widebody passenger jet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 777 entered service, he said, it has only been
diverted one time to an alternate airport because of an
engine-related problem.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to safey issues, the Allied Pilots Association,
which represents mostly American Airlines pilots, submitted
comments to the FAA that Boeing wanted to ease the current ETOPS
rules for marketing reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, in its statement, did not agree, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``... The FAA rejects the notion that the safety decision to be
made for 207-minute ETOPS operations are related to the marketing
of airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it will closely monitor the applications by
airlines for the 207-minute extension. Only airlines that currently
have approval for 180-minute ETOPS operations can apply for the
extension, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also said it will ask its aviation rulemaking
advisory committee to recommend safety standards and procedures for
extended range operation of aircraft regardless of the number of
engines.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean the Airbus planes that compete with the 777
might have to have additional equipment or requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's four-engine 747 would be included in such a review.

ENBERG GETS HIS WISH AT CBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Enberg has always been one of the more sincere, upbeat men
in a field, sportscasting, that breeds insecurity. Regardless of
how tilted things may be, Enberg usually finds some redeeming
quality.
</P>
<P>
   But for several months late in 1999, the former voice of the
Rams, Angels and UCLA basketball admittedly was in a funk. A second
NFL season was passing him by, he had a contract offer in hand to
return to NFL-less NBC, and he wasn't sure if any other network
wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much I'd miss the NFL,'' said Enberg ``I
had done NFL games for 32 consecutive years, starting with the 1966
Rams, and I never wanted to accept the possibility that I might
never work a NFL game again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When NBC lost the NFL, I sent a passionate letter to (NBC
Sports President) Dick Ebersol asking if he would consider allowing
me to move on. But with two years left on my deal, the network was
unwilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six months, from May on, were pretty down emotionally
for me. I couldn't say yes to NBC's offer. Dick went the extra mile
by contacting CBS and Fox and asking if they were open to me doing
NFL games for them on loan, but they understandably didn't want
that kind of arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   What it did was open CBS' eyes to hiring Enberg full-time for a
variety of events, which they officially did on Wednesday. Enberg
will become the network's No. 2 NFL play-by-play man, do regular
season and tournament college basketball games, serve as a
commentator on golf tournaments like the Masters, and host CBS'
U.S. Open tennis coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The deal worked well for Enberg financially, and he's excited
about his work schedule. He may not fill any particular No. 1 chair
at CBS, those being filled by Greg Gumbel and Jim Nantz, but he's
unconcerned about it and excited by the new events and new (and
some old) people he'll be involved with.
</P>
<P>
   On NFL games, he'll be paired with former ABC Monday Night voice
Dan Dierdorf, who restored his reputation with a strong 1999. On
college basketball, he'll be reunited with Al Maguire, the former
Marquette coach who was a partner when NBC had the NCAA package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pay to work with Al,'' Enberg said. ``He taught me more
about life than anyone outside of my own father.'' Enberg and
Maguire will work Saturday's Ohio State-St. John's game, and before
the regular season ends, the two will be joined by Billy Packer for
a reunion telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot like going through a divorce,'' said Enberg.
``When you've been with someone for 25 years, you can take each
other for granted. I'm starting a new relationship that has all of
the unknowns, challenges and excitement that I haven't experienced
for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss a lot of events and people I love, like
Wimbledon. But you can't hold on to old girlfriends. I can't have
it all. I feel a real nice glow now from being wanted (by CBS).''
</P>
<P>
   The other perk is more free time than he usually had at NBC. He
has three kids moving through their high school years, and he wants
to be available to see their games and school events.
</P>
<P>
   It will also add events to his resume. By the time Enberg
decides to stop talking for a living, he'll have touched virtually
every base in the business.
</P>
<P>
   He has 32 years with the NFL, starting with the Rams and
including eight Super Bowls. He was the voice of the Angels on KTLA
and KMPC for many years before being hired by NBC, and worked one
World Series and several other big games during his time there. He
did UCLA basketball games for KTLA during John Wooden's magnificent
run, and seven years of Final Fours at NBC.
</P>

   He did eight Rose Bowls with ex-Ram partner Merlin Olsen as well
as three Olympics, world championships in track, figure skating and
gymnastics, and horse racing's Breeders Cup and Arlington Million.
He now will add tennis' U.S. Open to his Wimbledon and French Open
coverage, and the Masters to a shot sheet that already has the U.S.
Open and Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who have forgotten, Enberg was the blow-by-blow
announcer on boxing at the Olympic Auditorium for three years
(1966-68) at KTLA; covered one of Muhammad Ali's fights in Munich,
with Candace Bergen as an analyst; and cut his teeth as a
play-by-play man by doing L.A. Blades hockey in their last year
here before the NHL expanded and the Kings were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's funny about that is that Rams' owner Dan Reeves thought
he was going to get the L.A. NHL franchise, and I probably would
have had the chance to be the Kings voice,'' Enberg said. ``And
then Jack Kent Cooke swooped out of Toronto without warning and got
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things considered, I've been blessed and privileged.
Someone has been looking over me since that first audition at KTLA,
and now I have a new opportunity that has me excited.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY GOT GAMES: The NFL's version of the Final Four is set for
Sunday, and the voices are gargled and ready. Fox's Pat Summerall
and John Madden will do the Rams-Bucs game and CBS' Greg Gumbel and
Phil Simms the Jags-Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Madden respects Tampa Bay's defense and expects it to play well,
but says the team will have to do other things well if it wants to
be in the game in the fourth quarter. ``Tampa needs to intercept a
ball and run it in, or block a punt, or return a kickoff,'' he
said. ``They can't win just by playing good defense. At some time,
Tony Dungy is going to need some points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember an offense exploding like the Rams have all
season. It's comparable to the 49ers when they had Joe Montana,
Roger Craig, Jerry Rice and John Taylor. They're built to play on
that domed carpet, and they always look like they're going 100
miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms says the most relevant aspect of Jacksonville and
Tennessee meeting for a third time is the lack of any surprise
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotions are never the same in a game and there are always
different angles,'' he said. ``Both teams are emotionally high and
generally healthy, so the only advantage is Jacksonville being at
home. I would be shocked if either team does something that catches
the other by surprise. They know each other too well. It should be
a close, hard-hitting game.

   And now the news
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner Sports signed three-year deals to air Wimbledon
coverage, with Turner taking the cable package once held by HBO.
TNT will air 61 hours of coverage and CNN/SI 28 hours, which is a
25 percent bump over the 57 hours HBO aired last year. NBC's usual
schedule of coverage over three weekends and a late night wrapup
show stays the same. ... HBO's Real Sports on Tuesday (10 p.m.)
updates the story of now ex-homeless former NFL quarterback Joe
Gilliam, and examines why so many former Super Bowl players have
had to hock their rings. ... ESPN and ESPN2 will provide coverage
of the Australian Open through the finals next weekend, including
airings at 9:30 p.m. this Saturday and Sunday. ... And this just
in: A new syndicated TV show that is being pedaled to the networks,
The Consultants, features a former basketball player named Dennis
Rodman in the role of a whacky fellow who blames his behavior on
the bullet lodged in his brain. Man, these shows are getting more
realistic all the time. &QL;

MARBURY AND FEICK HELP NETS WIN NAIL-BITER OVER PISTONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For nearly three quarters of play of a
New Jersey Nets 122-120 victory over the Detroit Pistons, the story
at Continental Arena Thursday night revolved around Jamie Feick.
After being all but benched in the Nets' loss to the New York
Knicks on Wednesday, Feick, the league's fifth-leading rebounder,
returned with a vengeance, grabbing 19 rebounds against the Detroit
Pistons in the first half alone.
</P>
<P>
   The backboard brilliance of Feick, who started the game after
playing just 8 minutes against the Knicks, had helped the Nets
build a 14-point halftime lead that increased to 17 late in the
third quarter. But the Pistons interrupted the Nets' cruise to
victory with a 17-4 run over the final three minutes of the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After a seesaw fourth period, the story was no longer Feick but,
for the fourth straight game, the Nets' late-game execution. With
10.2 seconds left, they led 121-120 thantephon Marbury's
outstanding 12-point fourth period, and were inbounding the ball at
midcourt. Twice, the Nets were forced to call timeouts because they
could not inbound the ball, but finally they got it to Johnny
Newman, who was fouled immediately by Michael Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, an 81.8 percent foul shooter, made 1 of 2 free throws
with 9.4 seconds left. Thus, the tables were turned, and Detroit
diagrammed a final play in the huddle. The Pistons got the ball to
Jerry Stackhouse, who scored 14 of his 28 points in the fourth
quarter, and he passed to Lindsey Hunter. Guarded tightly by
Marbury, Hunter put up a contested 15 footer with 3 seconds left,
and a wild scramble for the rebound ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the ball ended up in Feick's hands with 0.2 seconds
left with the Nets leading, 122-120. It was his career-high 25th
rebound of the game, one fewer than the Nets' franchise record for
a regulation game, and two fewer than Buck Williams' 27 rebounds in
a four-overtime game on Feb. 1, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who all but single-handedly kept the Nets in it in the
fourth, led everyone with 34 points and a season-high 15 assists.
Christian Laettner matched Stackhouse with 28 points for the
Pistons, and Grant Hill added 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   The victory broke the Nets' three-game losing streak and
improved their record to 16-23 heading into Saturday's home game
against Dallas. Detroit, which had won nine of its last 11 games,
dropped to 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   Down 93-89 entering the final period, Detroit took its first
lead since the middle of the first quarter when Laettner scored to
make it 103-102 with 6 minutes 21 seconds remaining. The clubs
exchanged one-point leads several times after that, but the Nets
were forced to battle without two starters, Keith Van Horn and
Kendall Gill, at game's end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn fouled out with 2:44 left after scoring 28 points, and
Gill fouled out 59 seconds later with 12 points. Scott Burrell put
the Nets ahead 119-118 with a scintillating layup with 48 seconds
to play, and then Marbury made a runner off the glass to push the
lead to three points with 19.6 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets did little wrong in building a 66-52 halftime lead, and
Feick was their catalyst. He outrebounded the entire Pistons team
by himself, grabbing 19 first-half rebounds to Detroit's 16.
Feick's dominance gave the Nets a 28-16 advantage on the glass and
helped them pull away despite shooting only slightly better than
the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   With Feick pulling down 13 rebounds, including five on the
offensive end, in the first quarter, the Nets outscored the Pistons
12-0 in second-chance points and took a 35-26 lead into the second.
By the half, Feick had grabbed seven offensive rebounds and nearly
every carom of a missed Pistons shot _ Detroit had only one
offensive rebound. Feick's 13 rebounds were the most in one quarter
by any player in the league this season.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's scoring was slow in developing, but he threw numerous
crowd-delighting passes from all sorts of angles. While not all of
them resulted in baskets, he recorded seven assists in the first
quarter and nine by the half. When his shooting touch kicked in,
there was no stopping him. Marbury made three of his last four
shots of the half, including a 37-footer at the buzzer, and his
first five attempts of the third quarter to help the Nets push the
lead to 17 points. His final two baskets in the string were
3-pointers
