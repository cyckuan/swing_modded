<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Japan to Settle Historical Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Wednesday called on Japan to settle problems of
the past as the top priority in talks on normalizing relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jong Thae Hwa, who heads the DPRK's delegation to the talks,
made the call at a press conference here after the first-day
session of senior-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Jong said, "we must address the past problems as the top
priority or else we see no reasonable grounds for continuing the
talks and we will seek other ways."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and Japan began their normalization talks in the late
1980s. Eight rounds of talks had been held before they were
suspended in 1992. Wednesday's talks marked a resumption of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Jong called for a package in settling problems of the past.
That involved an official written apology and compensation for
human and material losses, return of cultural treasures and
compensation for them, and improvement of the legal status of
Korean nationals living in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The apology must be made by the head of the Japanese government
before the establishment of diplomatic relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
This round of talks is expected to last three days, to be
followed by two more rounds scheduled for Tokyo and Beijing or
some other place.

<HEADLINE> Russian Births Down by 3.2 Million in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of births in Russia went
down by 3.2 million in the last five years, a medical panel said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow alone, the number of births in 1999 shrank 1.7 times
as compared with the previous year, the Interfax news agency
reported, quoting a group of health workers specializing in
perinatology, a medical field studying prenatal problems and
problems in the first days of postnatal development.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference attended by members of the Russian
Association of Perinatal Medical Specialists (RAPMS), the panel
said the infant death rate in Russia is 1.5-2 times higher than
that of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the death rate of prematurely born babies is even
higher. Out of the 68,000 babies born on average in Moscow every
year, 5,000, or 7 percent, are born prematurely.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 of these prematurely born infants weigh from 500 grams
to 1,000 grams and more than 70 percent of them die during their
first week of life and about 50 percent during their first year,
the panel said.
</P>
<P>
As treatment and care of premature babies often require
expensive imported diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, the RAPMS
called for more funding for the purchase of such equipment for
Russian hospitals specializing in this field.

TOKYO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Newly elected Japanese Prime

which were victimized by Japan's aggression before and during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference as prime minister, Mori

Japan cherishes peace, and has learned lessons from its wartime
past, Mori said.
</P>
<P>
Mori, 62, was appointed by Japan's Diet (parliament) early in
the day as new Prime Minister to succeed ailing Keizo Obuchi, who

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Forty-five Portuguese marines, who
were working in operations of humanitarian assistance for the
victims of flooding in southern and central Mozambique, said
farewell to the country on Tuesday after completing their mission.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest foreign military mission to leave the
country, following the departure of British, American and German
troops.
</P>
<P>
During the farewell ceremony, the Portuguese military offered
to the Mozambican navy the 20 motor boats they used in their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Rear-Admiral Pascoal Nhalungo, commander of the Mozambican
navy, said that the donation was more than a symbol of cooperation
between the two countries, and would "strengthen our navy's
capacity for intervention in future humanitarian rescue missions".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Portuguese Ambassador to Mozambique
Antonio Valente described the sending of the military mission to
Mozambique as the expression of "the feeling of solidarity of the
Portuguese people with the Mozambicans, particularly in this
difficult moment".
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that cooperative relations between the
two countries would be strengthened, particularly in the area of
military training.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Fresh Aggression by Turkish Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq strongly condemned and
protested the latest Turkish invasion of its northern part, and
preserved the right to retaliate against the aggressions, said an
Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the spokesman accused Turkey of violating Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 to 7,000 Turkish troops, backed by helicopter
gunships, crossed into northern Iraq early on Sunday in a claimed
operation against rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops pushed 10 kilometers into northern Iraq and
clashed with the PKK rebels in several places.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman demanded the Turkish authorities immediately
withdraw its troops from northern Iraq and stop repeating these
hostile actions that violate the United Nations charter as well as
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Iraq keeps the right to choose the time and place to retaliate
against the aggressions, and Turkey should be responsible for any
consequences, added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, northern Iraq has been under practical
control by two rival Iraqi Kurdish factions independent of
Baghdad's control. One of the factions has been fighting the PKK
alongside with the Turkish army.
</P>
<P>
Each time the Turkish troops intruded into northern Iraq, they
were condemned by Baghdad as an encroachment upon its territory.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Cancels Trips Abroad Due to Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana
suspended Thursday the trips abroad he had planned because of the
political crisis caused by his proposal of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The proposal divided the Great Alliance for Change, Pastrana's
political support in the Congress, and united in an unexpected way
the varios forces of the opposition Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
The various parties represented in Congress expressed their
opposition against the reforms proposed by Pastrana, because they
are directed to combat corruption in the legislature and not in
other entities.
</P>
<P>
The legislators are proposing the convocation of a
constitutional assembly for deeper reforms, including divesting
the president of his mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace press office said that Pastrana
cancelled his trips to the United States, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana had scheduled a meeting in Washington with congressmen
who oppose the Plan Colombia, aimed at combating drug trafficking,
strengthening the judicial system, and reactivating the economy of
the zones affected by the war.

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Acquire Aircraft Carrier From France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government is
analyzing the eventual acquisition of the Foch aircraft carrier
from France, which arrived Thursday at the Rio de Janeiro port,
Brazilian Navy Commander Admiral Sergio Chagastelles said.
</P>
<P>
Chagastelles said that technical examinations and joint
exercises with Brazilian Navy ships will be made before arriving
at any decision.
</P>
<P>
Nothing definite has been decided about the purchase, because
there are many variables in the evaluation and the talks about it
will take time and not just one month, as expected by the French
government, added Chagastelles.
</P>
<P>
The Foch, built in 1963, can work for another 10 years,
according to French technicians, and it is priced at between 50
million and 60 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the Foch is bought, it will substitute for the Minas Gerais
aircraft carrier, bought by Brazil more than 40 years ago and
which is being deactivated.
</P>
<P>
The Foch can hold up to 2,000 men aboard, its main deck is 266
meters long, with a surface of 8,800 square meters. It has two
landing strips and its speed is 55 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Its propulsion system was modified and modernized in 1997. Its
aircraft includes 18 Super Etendard planes, six interception
planes, four Etendard IV, six Alize of air security, two Super
Frelon, and two Dauphin.
</P>
<P>
In another of its versions, the ship can carry from 30 to 40
Puma, Super Puma and Gazelle type helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Parliament Approves Seizure of White-owned Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Parliament of Zimbabwe passed
the Constitution Amendment Bill on Thursday to allow the
government to seize mainly white-owned farms for redistribution to
blacks.
</P>
<P>
The bill states that if the former colonial power Britain does
not pay compensation for agricultural land compulsorily acquired
for  resettlement, the government of Zimbabwe had no obligation
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Minister Without Portfolio Edison Zvobgo said, "During the
liberation struggle we made it clear that we were fighting the
system that the minority has allocated itself large tracts of
land."
</P>
<P>
"We achieved our political power but it was clear that the
journey had not reached its destiny. There is no intention to
victimize anyone on the grounds of race," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fallen heroes and the living required this bill as
it restored peace, order and good governance.
</P>
<P>
Local Government and National Housing Minister Tony Gara said
he supported the bill as it was an important development in the
history of the country as the people would get back their birth
right which was taken away from them through colonialism.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised when the international community including the
media accuse us of land grabbing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The same countries bashing Zimbabwe are the ones which are
talking about democracy and human rights. You can't talk about
human rights and democracy when people have no land," he said.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira commended
indications by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cooke on Monday, at
a two-day Africa- European Union Summit, that the British
government would contribute to a resettlement fund.
</P>
<P>
That was a good move because the British government had been
denying that, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government plans to acquire a total of five
million hectares of land to resettle about 150,000 black families
throughout the country of about 12.5 million people at an
estimated coast of 40 billion Zimbabwean dollars (one billion U.S.
dollars).

ADDIS ABABA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada will provide Ethiopia
with a 34. 3 million birr (about 4.2 million U.S. dollar) initial
contribution for emergency food aid to Ethiopia, a press release
from the Canadian Embassy in Ethiopia said Thursday.
</P>

The contribution was the first step to get fast help to drought

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, Sweden Sign Accords on Debt Relief, Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican and Swedish
governments on Thursday signed two agreements on debt relief and
education, according to a press release issued by the Mozambican
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement on debt relief, Sweden agreed to put a
further 50 million crowns (about six million U.S. dollars) into
the Mozambican debt relief fund.
</P>
<P>
This fund is a mechanism whereby donors pay off Mozambique's
debt, thus saving money from the Mozambican state budget that
would otherwise have gone on debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement concerns a grant of 150 million crowns (about
18 million dollars) from Sweden to support the Mozambican
government's strategic plan for the education sector.
</P>
<P>
This support is aimed at "allowing the provision of equal
opportunities to men and women at all levels of education, through
expanding the school network, improving its quality, and
strengthening the institutional capacity of the sector".
</P>
<P>
Signing the accords were Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo
Simao, and General Director of the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) Bo Goransson.
</P>
<P>
Goransson is on a four-day visit to Mozambique to see for
himself the devastation caused by the flooding in the south and
centre of the country.

<HEADLINE> 14 Iraqis Killed in U.S., British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen Iraqi civilians were
killed and 19 others injured in U.S. and British air raids on
Thursday, which represents one of the heaviest casualties Iraq has
suffered since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
At 0855 local time (0555 GMT) and 1455 local time (1155 GMT), 18
formations of U.S. and British warplanes made 48 armed sorties from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, flying over the southern provinces of
Basra, Thi-Qar, Misan,Muthana, Qadissiyah, Wasit and Najaf,
announced an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian and service facilities, leaving
14 innocent people dead and 19 others wounded, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the heaviest casualties Iraq has suffered from U.
S. and British bombings since the two countries launched the
Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defense artillery fired at these planes and forced
them to flee back to their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that at 1025 local time (0725 GMT), 10 formations of U.
S. and British warplanes made 22 armed sorties from Turkey, flying
over the three northern provinces.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20,200 armed sorties have been made by U.S. and
British planes over the two no-fly zones in southern and northern
Iraq since December 1998, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that the continuous air raids have killed over
170 civilians and wounded more than 1,000 other people.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible persecution from the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones, which were not
directly covered by any U.N. Security Council resolution.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects NATO Comment on Its Military Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry on
Thursday rejected NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley
Clark's criticism of its military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
"Wesley Clarke seems to have read that document inattentively,
or else he had an incorrect translation," said Valery Manilov,
first deputy head of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff.
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to the former Soviet republic of Lithuania,
Clarke said the new Russian military doctrine focuses on the
protection of its own interests to the detriment of partnership.
</P>
<P>
Manilov, however, refuted Clarke's assertion.
</P>
<P>
"Partnership occupies a pivotal place in the new doctrine.
Maybe Mr. Clarke understands this term in his own way," the
Interfax news agency quoted Manilov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The doctrine calls for partnership and for efforts to be made
to forestall war and settle conflicts "without using force or
resorting to military means", he said.
</P>
<P>
Manilov also criticized NATO's latest strategic conception,
saying the alliance divides its partners into two types: "first
class" and" second class."
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable to Russia, which calls for an equal and
comprehensive security system to be created," he said.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Russia Ready to Expand Ties With IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin said Thursday that Moscow is ready to expand its relations
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Putin told IMF acting Managing Director Stanley Fisher that
since the end of last year, Russia and the IMF have been engaged
in a technical discussion of problems "that we regard as long
since solved, while the Fund takes a different view."
</P>
<P>
The two sides would be correct to get down to the problems that
Russia used to overcome with the Fund's aid, the Interfax news
agency quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"My colleagues have known you for a long time and cooperated
with you very productively in recent years," Putin said at the
meeting, which was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister Viktor
Khristenko and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Fischer agreed that a joint program for expanding
relations between the two sides would be worked out in July,
Khristenko said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The new program must draw lessons from "both the positive and
negative experiences of relations between Russia and the Fund,"
Khristenko said.
</P>
<P>
"The new program must be realistic and feasible," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Restraint Over Developments in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
on Thursday rejected opposition demand for interfering in
Zimbabwean situation, saying it had to keep a "cool head" over the
latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Democratic Party's calls for urgent action by the
government, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said that if
South Africa did so outside the rules and structures of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), it would alienate
the very people it should be speaking to.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "We must act with circumspection.... This is not
an election campaign."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that mistakes were being made in Zimbabwe, and
the South African government was not shy to say so.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Democratic Party foreign affairs spokesman Colin Eglin
said Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's government, and Mugabe
himself, were violating the provisions of SADC's founding
documents guaranteeing democratic rights and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the invasion of white farms by thousands of
former freedom fighters in Zimbabwe and the attacks on opponents
of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The time had come for the South African government, through
President Thabo Mbeki, to state quite clearly where it, as a
member of SADC, stood on these violations of SADC founding
principles, Eglin said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki should ask SADC chairperson Joaquim Chissano for an
urgent summit meeting of the organization so member states could
come to a collective decision on how to act on the crisis that
Mugabe had thrust on the region, he was quoted as saying by South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, collectively with other SADC countries, if
possible, but on its own if necessary, should ensure effective
monitoring of elections in Zimbabwe, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM on Africa-Europe Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said on Thursday that the recently held Africa-Europe
Summit in Cairo had given the country a ray of light as regards
the outcome of the Donor Conference scheduled for Italy's capital
Rome in early May.
</P>
<P>
This conference is aimed at convincing donors to finance
reconstruction of the infrastructure destroyed in the catastrophic
flooding of February, the prime minister said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day summit ended on Tuesday, the Mozambican
delegation led by President Joaquim Chissano had held talks with
various delegations who wanted to know what Mozambique's needs
were, and in what ways they could assist.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi declined to put a figure on how much aid the government
would request in Rome, but promised that the draft document to be
put before the donors would soon be made public.
</P>
<P>
He said the government "does not want to put forward any
figures, while we are still in dialogue with our partners". They
are making their own assessments, and sometimes there are
differences in numbers and in the costs of reconstruction, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Delegate Briefs UN Commission on China's Human Rights Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government attaches
great importance to the promotion and protection of civil and
political rights while being committed to the realization of
economic, social and cultural rights and determined to improve
people's livelihood, a Chinese delegate said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alternate Representative of the Chinese delegation Li Baodong
told the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights of China's achievements by illustrating them with examples
in the following four aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- To administer the state affairs according to law. In March
last year, the concept of running the country in accordance with
law was formally incorporated into the constitution. The key
essence is to ensure that the government functions as the law sees
it,law-enforcement and judicial bodies operate within the law and
citizens exercise their rights and fulfill their obligations
according to law and the state institution.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese society is now in the process of transition from
too much emphasis on the rule of person and insufficient emphasis
on the rule of law to establishing concept of the rule of law,
from supremacy of the power to supremacy of the law, from too much
emphasis on duties and insufficient emphasis on rights to
establishing a correct notion about rights and obligations.
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening legislation, popularizing legal education and
increasing supervision on law-enforcement. In recent years, a
series of important laws, including the Law on Prison, the Law on
Judges and the Law on Lawyers, have been adopted. In particular,
the revision of and amendments to the Criminal Law and the
Criminal Procedure Law have considerably improved the human rights
protection during criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Lately, the National People's Congress and its Standing
Committee have also passed the Law on Administrative Review and
the Law on Legislation. They are now drafting the Law on
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide education on legal provisions is developing in
depth. Citizens are quickly increasing the awareness of
safeguarding their rights and interests by making use of law. The
Chinese judicial bodies have moved ahead with comprehensive reform
to further enhance the fair administration of justice and to
upgrade the level of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
-- Effective guarantee of freedom of religion and belief. The
Chinese constitution provides that the citizens enjoy the freedom
of religious belief. They may freely choose and express their
beliefs and make clear their religious affiliations.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 85,000 sites for religious
activities in China, more than 300,000 clergy, over 3,000
religious organizations and 74 religious schools and colleges.
Various religions have witnessed the increase of followers in
recent years. For example, the number of Christianity believers
has grown now to more than 10 million from 700,000 in 1949.
</P>
<P>
-- Prohibition of and opposition to torture. Through its
legislation, China explicitly prohibits torture and metes out
severe punishment against the use of torture. In judicial practice,
China has installed a variety of vigorous mechanisms of
supervision, including legislative, administrative and social
supervision, and stresses the training of law enforcement
personnel in order to effectively prevent occurrence of torture.
In 1988, China acceded to the UN Convention against Torture. China
is serious about fulfilling its conventional obligations and has
thus far submitted three reports on implementation.
</P>
<P>
"China has made great efforts to strengthen the legal system
and develop democracy," said Li. "Remarkable achievements have
thus been scored in promoting and protecting all civil and
political rights.These achievements are acknowledged by any one
free of bias and certainly cannot be negated by the United States
and some other western countries or a handful of NGOs through
their lies."

<HEADLINE> UK Rejects Liability for Zimbabwe Land Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday it
rejected Zimbabwe's decision to make it liable for compensating
mainly white owners of farms seized for redistribution to blacks.
</P>
<P>
"We fully recognize the right of the people of Zimbabwe to draw
up their own constitution," the Reuters quoted a spokeswoman for
Britain's Department for International Development as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But equally, one sovereign and independent state cannot use
its constitution to impose conditions on another. The British
government does not accept that (Thursday's vote) imposes any
obligations on the United Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's parliament voted on Thursday to make Britain liable
for the compensation and said it would not accept responsibility
if London refused.
</P>
<P>
The Department for International Development spokeswoman in
London said Britain had already made a "major contribution"towards
land reform in Zimbabwe and had met all its obligations agreed
when Zimbabwe won independence from Britain 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 veterans of Zimbabwe's 1970s liberation war have
occupied about 800 mainly white-owned commercial farms in moves
declared illegal by the High Court, but condoned by President
Robert Mugabe, who has ruled since independence from Britain in
1980.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Swiss Test in Fight Against Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has decided
to adopt a Swiss test as one of the three to be used in fight
against the BSE, know as the mad cow disease, Swiss Radio
International reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The test, developed by the University of Zurich's spin-off
company Prionics, uses prion protein analysis to detect the
disease in dead animals.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has been using the test since 1999 as its standard
means to check for BSE in randomly sampled cattle, including cows
which did not die after displaying BSE-like symptoms. However, the
EU is not planning to adopt as rigorous an approach as Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Of the 41 million cattle in the EU aged over two years, one
percent is estimated to be at risk from BSE. Of this group of
around 400,000,one sixth of the animals will be surveyed in what
are termed "rapid post-mortem tests". The cows surveyed will be
ones which have shown BSE-like symptoms.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Introduce New Law to Cut Carbon Dioxide Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland will introduce a new
law aimed at cutting the emissions of carbon dioxide, the Swiss
government announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that the law would bring Switzerland into
line with targets for CO2 reduction adopted by the 1996 convention
on climate change in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation aims to cut CO2 emissions by 10 percent of
their 1990 levels by 2010. Most of the reductions are expected to
be achieved by big energy consumers in heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
"But individual consumers can play a role too," said Thomas
Stadler of the federal office for the environment. "It' s quite
easy to cut down on burning heating oil without making your home
uncomfortable.And people should consider buying cars which are
more petrol efficient."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government expressed wish that the reductions would
be achieved voluntarily, and is currently involved in talks with
Swiss industry aimed at drawing up energy saving contracts. But it
warned that a polluter-pays-tax could be introduced in 2004 if CO2
reductions are not on target.
</P>
<P>
"We'r e optimistic that we'll reach our targets for oil and gas
voluntarily, but in the field of traffic we are not so sure,
realistically see a tax in 2004," said Stadler.
</P>
<P>
In a further encouragement towards reducing CO2 emissions, the
government announced its support for a popular initiative aimed at
increasing Switzerland's dependency on renewable energy sources
such as solar, wind and water power.

GENEVA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation(
SBC) has raised 10 million Swiss francs (about six million U.S.
dollars) for the victims of last month's flooding in southern
Africa.

Humanitarian aid is now focusing on rehabilitation and
reconstruction efforts. Aid convoys first arrived in some of the
worst-hit villages a few days ago, the Chain said. Many routes are
still impassable, and the only access to some places is through
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The trucks are carrying seeds, blankets, water purification
equipment and food for 1,000 families. The distribution of maize
and bean seeds has been given top priority in order to prevent
starvation in the next few months.

The Swiss government has donated 15 million francs (about nine
million dollars) in aid to the region.

"That's enough. We will carry on without you, European teachers,
"the lower house speaker said in response to the decision reached
at Strasbourg earlier Thursday to begin the procedure for
suspending Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said the European body has made an "enormous and
colossal" mistake, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The PACE decision "is nothing other than a propaganda trick and
the wish to show that the so-called 'language of force' may be

The West "does not understand the entire scope of our problems"
and is "mocking economically weakened Russia," Seleznyov said.

"But we will rise to our feet. The 21st century will be the
century of Russia," the speaker said.

"They have forgotten who they are dealing with. But Russia will

Seleznyov said Europe lives according to double standards and"

</P>
<P>
Europe cannot speak the language of ultimatums with Russia or
set a date by which Russia must stop its anti-terrorist operation
in Chechnya, he said.

The Russian Foreign Ministry also reacted strongly to the PACE
decision, threatening retaliatory steps.

<HEADLINE> S. African Farmers' Organization Warns Against Subsidized Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The import of highly
subsidized agricultural products will have devastating
consequences for South Africa's rural economy, the South African
farmers' organization, the Federal Alliance, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a debate on the trade and industry budget vote
in the National Assembly, the alliance MP Kraai van Niekerk said
subsidized imports from Europe and the United States could
eventually destroy the agricultural industry in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The South African farmers can compete with any farmers
anywhere in the world, but they cannot compete with the millions
of dollars Uncle Sam spends on subsidies to his farmers."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government subsidized nearly all agricultural
surpluses sold on the international market, while more than half
of the income of European farmers could be attributed to a state
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
The import of these products had the potential to seriously
disrupt the South African economy as no proper import tariffs
were in place, Van Niekerk said.
</P>
<P>
Local producers could not compete against these low prices, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Van Niekerk urged Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin to put
in place regulations to protect local agricultural producers.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Ministers Pledge Commitment to Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from South Africa,
 Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe met in Cape Town, South Africa,
on Thursday to discuss joint programs to rebuild their countries
after the devastating floods .
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that a combined technical team should be
set up to coordinate efforts, share expertise, and exchange
information to enable longer-term planning and avoid unnecessary
duplication, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed the four countries' finance ministers should
collectively lead an approach for donor funding.
</P>
<P>
 South Africa was represented by Public Works Minister Stella
Sigcau, Zimbabwe by its Local Government Minister, John Nkomo;
Botswana by its Minister of Works, Transport and Communication,
David Magang; and Mozambique by its Deputy Minister of Transport,
Antonio Fernando.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in a joint statement after two hours of
talks that one priority was the resettlement of victims above the
flood level.
</P>
<P>
The quality of material and workmanship used for new dwellings
should also be borne in mind, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This may be an emotional issue, on which countries should
stand together. The housing crisis is not only costly, but also
essential to restore social structures and interaction. Quality
should also be a consideration for all reconstruction," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and their delegations agreed that rebuilding
border posts to facilitate trade and other activities between
their respective countries was also a priority, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The reopening of closed border posts will not only enhance
social mobility and direct economic activities, but also enable
the flow of relief measures and materials," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers identified three important areas of cooperation:
social effects and resettlement; commercial interaction and
activity; and day-to- day reconstruction work.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Sharif's Verdict Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The verdict of guilty against
Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday met mixed
reactions from different political parties.
</P>
<P>
Javed Jabbar, advisor to Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf on Information and Media Development said that the trial
of Nawaz Sharif and other six accused was "most transparent" in
the recent memory and the government will fully respect the
judgment.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Terrorism Court No. One (ATC-1) awarded the deposed
prime minister life imprisonment on charges of hijacking and
terrorism while acquitting the co-accused.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict substantiates the government point of view that
courts are free when the accused is convicted and the same is also
true when remaining accused are acquitted," Javed Jabbar said
talking to press outside the court after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"This is yet another clear manifestation of the independence
and integrity of the Judiciary," Javed Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League (PML) criticized the
verdict and termed it "faulty."
</P>
<P>
"Nawaz Sharif has been wronged through this decision. He
deserves the same reprieve the six others got," Raja Zafarul Haq,
head of PML Central Coordination Committee, said, adding that the
decision "bares the intentions to oust Nawaz Sharif from the
political scene."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), another main
political party led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,said
the hijacking case verdict is "a setback for the military
government regime which had sought the death penalty against Nawaz
Sharif."
</P>
<P>
Sharif was the third Pakistani prime minister who had been
convicted. The country's first elected prime minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto was awarded death sentence in late 1970s on charges of a
murder. His daughter Benazir Bhutto was sentenced to five-year
jail term in her absence on corruption charges by Nawaz Sharif's
government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Finds Another Large Natural Gas Reservoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading Israeli offshore oil
company announced Thursday that it found another large reservoir of
natural gas off the coast of Ashkelon, a town 48 kilometers south
of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in less than a month that the company,
Avner Oil &AMP; Gas, found gas in the Mediterranean sea areas along the
Israeli coastlines, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report didn't elaborate the exact reserve quantities of this
new finding. However, energy experts familiar with the discovery
said it is so large that the gas field can supply all of Israel's
needs for the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March, the company said that its "Mary 1" drilling
site off Ashkelon pointed to reserves of 100 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day, which it said could supply one third of
Israel's natural gas needs.
</P>
<P>
The company said Thursday that the new finding, along with a
series of initial gas discoveries off Israeli coast near Ashdod and
Ashkelon in the past few months, had made the talks on purchasing
gas from Egypt meaningless.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure Eli Suissa just
announced two days ago that he is scheduled to meet Egyptian
officials in Cairo next week to revive the talks.
</P>
<P>
The project has been discussed over the past six years, under
which Egypt would sell natural gas to Jerusalem by extending its "
pipeline of peace" into Israeli territories. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is currently being constructed from the Nile Delta
to El Arish in the Sinai Peninsula, some 25 kilometers from Israel
borderlines.
</P>
<P>
It is designed to provide gas to the Palestinian self-rule
areas, Jordan and in the future possibly to Lebanon, Syria and
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli oil companies have been lobbying extensively against the
project in the past few months, saying the import could deal a
severe blow to local gas-exploration industry and harm national
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts disagreed, however, saying that it is still too
early to determine the amount of natural gas that those areas can
provide and any additional suppliers would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
Amit Mor, director of a leading Israeli consulting group on
energy and environmental issues, said that more suppliers would
only enhance competition and reduce gas prices, which have a direct
effect on economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Industry experts say importing natural gas, a cleaner
and cheaper fuel than oil or coal, from Egypt would save Israel 150
million U.S. dollars annually as compared to any viable
alternative.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Apologizes to Aborigines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday apologized to Aborigines hurt by the government's
denial that the stolen generation existed.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron said on April 2 in a
report to the senate that only 10 percent of Aboriginal children
were separated from their families and the word of "stolen
generation" was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
During about 100 years before the 1970s, "half-caste" children
were separated forcibly by the then missionaries and government
agents to assimilate them and let those "full-blood" Aboriginals
conveniently die out. The separated children are the so-called "
stolen generation."
</P>
<P>
Herron's statement outraged the Aboriginal society and some
activists threatened to stage violent demonstration during the
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Howard had stood by his Aboriginal Affairs Minister and
therefor touched a division in his party. Having been attacked in
the parliament for four days, he found at last he was cornered.
</P>
<P>
Today's apology came as scores of angry Aborigines converged on
Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
Howard told parliament he was sorry for the understandable
offense the government report on the stolen generation had caused.
</P>
<P>
"Let me say very directly to anybody in the Australian
community who was in any way offended by that document, I'm sorry
about that," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Following in the prime minister's footsteps, Aboriginal Affairs
Minister John Herron also apologized. "I am sorry if I have
offended anybody. It was not my intent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Reduce Reliance on Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Thursday the country will lessen its dependence on crude oil
as he inaugurated a 1,000-megawatt natural gas plant in Batangas
in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidential Palace, Estrada said at the
inauguration ceremony of the Rita plant that it will contribute to
lower electricity prices and a cleaner environment by making full
use of natural gas from Malampaya.
</P>
<P>
The Rita plant is the first of a series that aim to take full
advantage of the natural gas from Malampaya in the nearby Palawan
province.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out that his administration will continue to
promote the use of indigenous resources for energy efficiency and
environmental friendliness.
</P>
<P>
"The more we use indigenous resources like geothermal, hydro
and now natural gas, the less we will rely on global sources of
fuel and the less vulnerable we will be to the turbulence of the
oil markets,"he said.
</P>
<P>
The president has repeatedly stressed his administration's
commitment to reducing the country's dependence on crude oil,
whose prices have shot up in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
Expected to benefit immediately from the 900-million-U.S.-
dollar Rita project are residents of Batangas.
</P>
<P>
The president also extolled the contractors for the 5-billion-
dollar Malampaya project, which has been ongoing since the
discovery of natural gas deposits in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Asks For More Aid From Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Thursday demanded more external assistance to accelerate
Cambodia's economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia has currently enjoyed favorable conditions, which
will enable economic take-off," said Hun Sen in his closing
address at the third donor monitoring meeting.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have many major challenges," he said, "our
capacity is still limited, therefore, we are in need for generous
assistance from our external partners in order to achieve our
ultimate goals."
</P>
<P>
Pledging to continue the reforms, Hun Sen said that Cambodia
needs massive influx of investment in the next few years to
generate economic energy and accelerate the speed for the take-off.
</P>
<P>
"According to the assessment of Cambodia's needs of public
investments for the medium term, from 2000 to 2002, a total of 1.5
billion U.S. dollars are needed over the next three years in
assistance," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, in his long speech, made a comprehensive
summing-up on his government's achievements and performance, its
current status, its potential and promise as well as its
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia agreed at the last Consultative Group (CG) meeting to
hold quarterly review meeting with donor countries, which has so
far given a broadly positive assessment of Hun Sen's reform
efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the attendants discussed many
issues,including the government's new anti-corruption and good
governance measures, military demobilization, civil administration
reform,forestry management, fiscal reform and social sector issues.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of donor countries, as well as international
financial institutions, international organizations and non-
government organizations attended the meeting with top government
officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was crucial for the government, which is planning
to ask donors for 536 million U.S. dollars at next month's
Consultative Group meeting in Paris. Last year, major donors
pledged 470 million U.S. dollars to help rebuild the nation.

<P>
During about 100 years before the 1970s, "half-caste" children
were separated forcibly by the then missionaries and government
agents to assimilate them and let those "full-blood" Aboriginals
conveniently die out. The separated children are the so-called "
stolen generation." (Australia-Aborigines)

</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in his meeting with visiting U.S.
Commerce Secretary William Daley here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The proper solution to the PNTR issue "is in the interests of
both China and the U.S.," Jiang said. The mutual granting of the
most-favored nation status forms "one of the essential principles
of the World Trade Organization," he pointed out. "China will, as
always, make an active contribution to the healthy development of
the world economy and trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daley told Jiang that the U.S. government values very much its
ties with China and actively works for the continuous growth of U.
S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation is
absolutely conducive to the prosperity and development of both U.S.
and China and in the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration will make efforts to push
the Congress to approve the PNTR bill so as to ensure the sound
development of U.S.-China trade relations.
</P>
<P>

efforts to maintain bilateral cooperation at all levels and lift
them to a new high.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Launch its Third Satellite in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will launch its third
satellite "Turksat-2A" to space from the French Guiana in August,
the Anatolia News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turksat-2A will be the most powerful satellite of Europe,
through which TV broadcastings can be watched from Atlantic to
China with very small antennas.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, which costed 60 million U.S. dollars, is expected
to bring an income of 1 billion dollars in 15 years, most from
broadcasting renter companies and channels.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was built by Eurasiasat company, which was founded
in November 1996 with the partnership of Turk Telekom and French
Alcatel Space. The company began to build Turksat-2A in January 1,
1998 and main fitting was completed in February, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Turksat-2A will be sent to Guiana in July and be settled in 42
degrees east longitude in the space, together with the previously-
launched Turksat-1C.
</P>
<P>
Constant transmission of Turksat-2A will reach nearly 620
million people by providing communication for Turkey, central and
eastern Europe, central and western Asia, Israel, Jordan and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
If equipped with a second moveable transmitter, the satellite
will be able to give service to the Middle East, western Russia,
Ukraine, South Africa, and Indian sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
The Turksat 2A, which will act in a wide fan, will allocate
satellite transmission capacity for television, live broadcasting
and internet service.

<HEADLINE> Sneh Rejects Lebanese Conditions on Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) - Israeli Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said Thursday that Israeli government will not accept
any preconditions set forth by Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on
Israel's planned withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Sneh threatened that Lebanon
had to choose between a quiet Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
redeployment, which is due to happen this July, and a continuation
of war situation along the border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sneh was commenting on a list of demands put forward by Lahoud
on withdrawal issue, which was conveyed to United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan through a U.N. special envoy.
</P>
<P>
Terje Roed Larsen was dispatched to meet Lahoud in Beirut on
Wednesday, hearing Lebanon's views on the Israeli withdrawal under
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed in 1978 after Israel launched a large-
scale aggression against Lebanon in the name of wiping out
Palestinian guerrillas there, calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli pullout from all Lebanese territory and for a
return of full sovereignty of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen is due to visit Damascus Thursday to sound out Syria, who
is the major foreign power broker in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to Annan later published by Lebanese media, Lahoud
warned that in case of Israeli unilateral pullback, the Palestinian
militias coming from refugee camps in Lebanon might try to launch
cross-border attacks in the framework of their right to return

</P>
<P>
Lahoud doubted if a multinational force deployed in the areas
vacated by IDF would have the authority and capability to disarm
those militant groups as Lebanon would not move quickly to send its
own forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He wanted U.N. pledges to prevent Israel from violating Lebanese
sovereign airspace and its territorial waters after the withdrawal.
He also asked for Israeli compensation for the damage it has
sustained in the 18-yearl-long occupation.
</P>
<P>
In response, Sneh claimed that all these demands are Lebanese
intentional leg-drag measures to hold Israel back in carrying out
withdrawal from the security zone on the basis of Resolution 425 by
July.
</P>
<P>
He accused that Syria is wire-pulling behind the demands to
fulfil its own national interests.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli cabinet endorsed Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
proposal to withdraw from the security zone, which was set up by
Israel in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of preventing cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its north, with or without a peace deal with
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon made
Syria, according to Israeli officials, undermined Syria's
bargaining chips in talks with Israel over the return of the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which resumed last December after a 45-month break,
fell apart again in January.
</P>
<P>
There are no visible signs that the sides will return to the
negotiating table in the near future after an inconclusive summit
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy met with Annan at the U.N.
headquarters in Geneva on Tuesday, garnering support from the
international organization for the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Israel officials have been promoting the
idea of extending authority of the current U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) to the whole security zone to ensure there will be
no vacuum left.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong peacekeeping troops from nine countries are
currently deployed primarily in the western and central sectors of
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Plane Detention Not to Dampen Anti-Embargo Efforts: Benjamin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Benjamin, one of the
three Europeans who defied the U.N. embargo by having flied to
Baghdad, said Thursday that Jordan's detaining of their plane will
not dampen their move to challenge the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Italian lawmaker Vittorio Sgarbi, French Roman Catholic priest
Jean-Marie Benjamin, Italian businessman Nicola Grauso arrived in
Baghdad aboard a plane Monday, in violation of the U.N. sanctions
that were imposed on Iraq in 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sgarbi and Grauso flied for Roma via Anman Wednesday, Benjamin,
who was left behind, was headed for Jordan by land Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement before his departure, Benjamin said that he and
his companions did not violate any U.N. resolutions, as there are
no relevant U.N. resolutions preventing civil flights to the
country, reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
Benjamin described their flight to Baghdad as a challenge to the
embargo on Iraq, stressing that the detaining of the plane will not
affect their efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stop our activities for getting the sanctions on
Iraq lifted," said Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
The plane, landed in Baghdad on Monday evening without getting
prior U.N. permission, was forced down by Jordanian aviation
authorities on Wednesday afternoon for alleged violation of the
Jordanian airspace and civil aviation laws.
</P>
<P>
The plane, along with its Italian pilot, was detained, while
Sgarbi and Grauso were allowed to leave for Vienna by taking an
Austrian plane, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
France, who has been calling for lifting the sanctions on Iraq,
said on Tuesday that the European plane violated no U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that there are
no U.N. Security Council resolutions calling specifically for an
air embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
People should not be banned from flying to Iraq as long as they
are not engaged in business activities, added the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> India Urged to Improve Infrastructure to Woo Investors </HEADLINE>

"India has good prospects to attract higher FDI with improved
economic environment and benefit from Info-tech revolution where
its world class skills are recognized," Ashoka Mody, the chief
economist in development finance for the World Bank, was quoted as
saying by the PTI.
</P>
<P>
However, to turn the prospects into actual inflows, India has
to improve its infrastructure, said Mody, adding that "even the
virtual economy and enterprises in IT (information technology)
sector require good telecommunication and power supply."
</P>
<P>
As the foreign investment flows to China are fast reaching a
stage of saturation, India has been provided with greater
opportunities to bring in foreign investments, the economist noted.
</P>
<P>
"If India has to closely integrate with global economy, it
would have to relax capital movement control. However, that does
not mean free run for the short term flows," he added.
</P>
<P>
The PTI said that Mody was a senior member of a team that
drafted the "Global Development Finance Report 2000 of World Bank,
" which forecast growth prospects for the developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Criticizes Exploitation of His Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the
father of the Cuban boy who is living with his relatives in
Florida, criticized the relatives, some anti-Cuba elements and the
U.S. media for their exploitation of his six-year-old son after
the father arrived in Washington Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez hopes to meet his son soon and bring him back home in
Cuba. He, together with his second wife and baby son, was seen off
at the airport in Havana by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Washington, the
father said he wanted to express his "deepest gratitude" to the
American people for supporting him and his efforts to get Elian
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, he also criticized his relatives and some anti-Cuba
elements for exploiting his son and gain "political advantage"
from his family tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures," Gonzalez said, noting that his son
had been forced to live for 137 days with "some distant relatives
who have never seen him before."
</P>
<P>
The father said he still did not know when he could see his son.
In Miami, Elian's uncle Lazaro Gonzalez said that he and his
family were willing to meet with Elian's father at their home, but
nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuban politicians in the United
States, asked the boy to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) ruled that the boy belongs to his father and should
be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle in Florida filed a political asylum for him. But a U.S.
district judge ruled last month that the decision of the INS
should be respected.

<HEADLINE> EU Economic Confidence Rising, Says European Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The economic confidence indicator
rose to new all-time highs for both the euro zone and the European
Union (EU) as a whole in March this year, the European Commission
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The economic confidence indicator, based on strong rises of
confidence in the industrial, construction and retail trade
sectors as well as strong consumer confidence, "rose by 0.2 points
to new all-time highs in both the euro area and the EU. All member
countries except the United Kingdom and Finland registered
increases. Sweden with 1.2 points displayed the largest rise,"
said the commission, the EU's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The industry confidence indicator rose one point in the 15-
nation EU and the 11-country euro area in March. The main cause
for the rise was progress in order books, according to the
Business and Consumer Survey.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in the construction sector seemed to pick up in
March after a fall in the previous month, although this indicator
was being held down by the negative evolution in the construction
sector in Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, consumer confidence in March remained steady
in the euro area as well as in the EU at the same level as was
recorded in February, and there seemed to be a widespread optimism
among consumers about the general economic situation over the next
12 months, the survey said.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today released
the full text of Vice Premier Li Lanqing's speech on March 2 which
called for the improvement of education in an effort to let
Chinese youngsters grow up in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Li urged the nation to study President Jiang
Zemin's important speech made early this year on the improvement
of educational work, saying that the people should have more
awareness and make their minds work as one.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, noted
that teaching in schools must be enhanced. He said that the
fundamental task of China's education is to improve the nation's
overall capability rather than attain a high university enrollment
rate.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that there should be a reform of textbooks which
are already out-dated and not conductive to cultivating students'
various abilities, such as creativity and imagination.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more attention should be paid to students' morale and
practical abilities, according to Li, who added that schools
should not only work as knowledge instillers; they must also help
the students create a correct value system.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Recommend Closing Investigation Against Weizman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police recommended
Thursday to the Attorney-General's Office end of the investigation
against President Ezer Weizman due to lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
The police investigating team said in their report that no
evidence was found that Weizman had violated the law in receiving
large sums of money from a French businessman between 1988 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
Lack of evidence, absence of guilt and offenses no longer
subject to prosecution due to the statute of limitations were the
three reasons for the police to recommend to close the file, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Now, it is up to Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein to make a
decision on whether to publish a public report regarding Weizman's
actions.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said Wednesday he would publish a detailed opinion on
the investigation of Weizman after receiving the police
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Justice Ministry explained Thursday that
Rubinstein's opinion would include a reaction to the ethical
aspects of Weizman's behavior, even if there is not enough evidence
to bring criminal charges against the president.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's attorney, Ya'akov Weinroth, has expressed his sharp
opposition to the publication of an opinion discussing the ethical
aspects of the affair, saying the attorney-General only has the
authority to open or close files.
</P>
<P>
The investigation against Weizman was touched off by
investigative reporter Yoav Yitzhak on December 30, 1999. Yitzhak
said in a press conference that Weizman had received some 453,00 U.
S. dollars from Edouard Saroussi in monthly payments of various
accounts.
</P>
<P>
The money was allegedly deposited into a trust account managed
by a mutual friend of Weizman and Saroussi, attorney Hanina
Brandes, and from there the money was moved to accounts held by
Weizman and his family members.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak also claimed that Weizman had not reported this income
to the income tax authority and that he had also allegedly violated
a law that forbids public servants from receiving gifts.
</P>
<P>
On January 12, 2000, Rubinstein and State Prosecutor Edna Arbel
ordered a police "examination" of the allegations, and five days
later, following the discovery of a document showing that Weizman
and Saroussi had maintained unreported business connections, they
upgraded the examination into a full-fledged criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
However, it later emerged that their business connection had
terminated before Weizman began to receive the money, thus ruling
out a possible bribery charge. The investigation therefore focused
on possible tax violations and a possible breach of the gift-taking
clause of the Public Service Law.
</P>
<P>
A senior judicial source said that whatever tax violations there
may have been were technical in character and did not warrant an
indictment.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's office refused to comment on this issue Wednesday,
saying only that the president will accept whatever the police has
recommended.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has been questioned by the police investigation team
several times and he repeatedly told the police that the money he
received was from a close family friend and the money has been used
mainly for recovering his son's health who was badly injured during
the Israeli-Egyptian war.
</P>
<P>
Weizman also said that there was a political motive behind the
allegations and he would probe that even after the case was over.

<HEADLINE> Former Tunisian President Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Tunisian President Habib
Bourguiba who was credited with founding modern Tunisia died at the
age of 97 on Thursday, said a statement issued by the president's
office.
</P>
<P>
Bourguiba died at 9:50 a.m. (0850 GMT) in his hometown of
Monastir, 160 kilometers south of capital Tunis. However, there was
no immediate report on the exact cause of Bourguiba's death.
</P>
<P>
He had been hospitalized on March 5 in critical condition in the
military hospital in Tunis. Then he returned to Monastir on March
13. Just two days ago, his family members said that he was doing
well. Bourguiba was born on August 3, 1903, and once known as
president for life.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, he founded the Neo-Destour nationalist movement,
dedicated to ending French colonial rule over Tunisia. He spent
more than 11 years in French prison on sedition charges before
Tunisia won independence on March 20, 1956.
</P>
<P>
Bourguiba held the power as president if the republic from 1957
to 1975 and was elected president for life in 1975.
</P>
<P>
But on November 7, 1987, Ben Ali, former interior minister who
had been newly appointed prime minister, removed Bourguiba from
office for "incompetence," saying he had become too old, senile and
sick to
rule the small North African nation.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has been living in solitude in his hometown until
his final days.
</P>
<P>
President Zine Ben Ali has declared a seven-day period of
national mourning for the former president and his body will be
placed in the headquarters of the ruling Democratic Constitutional
Party in Tunis for people to bid their last farewell and pay
tribute to before a national funeral is held.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: E-Commerce to Boost Australia's IT Industry (Part 1)  By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- As the e-commerce is emerging in
Australia, the country's information industry embraces new
opportunities for a further boom.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts predict that within five to 10 years, the bright
economic prospects and hi-tech requirements of the e-commerce will
bring in fundamental change in the information technology (IT).
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that Internet-based commerce in
Australia could grow from 61 million Australian dollars (37.82
million U.S. dollars) in 1997 to 1.3 billion Australian dollars (
806 million U.S. dollars) in 2001.
</P>
<P>
With 8,000 companies that have a relatively secure, web-based
ordering system, another 30,000 companies with access to the
Internet technology are still to make the leap into the e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The National Office for the Information Economy (NOIE)
estimated that the overall level of economic output, or gross
domestic product (GDP), may be higher by around 2.7 percent by the
year 2007 if Australia adopts greater use of e-commerce than if it
does not. And the country's information industry has already laid
solid grounds for the new way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
Australia, which has the world's 15th biggest GDP, ranked 10th
in IT spending in 1998 and seventh in IT spending as a proportion
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the workplace personal computers in the
country had internet access at the end of 1999 and 40 percent of
Australian employees were on intranets compared to 17 percent
globally.
</P>
<P>
But the e-commerce fever is expected to see a substantial
growth of the investment in the IT.
</P>
<P>
The International Data Corporation, a U.S.-based technology
research organization, said recently at a conference in Melbourne
that businesses are expected to spend more than 2.64 billion
Australian dollars (1.64 billion U.S. dollars) on Internet
technology in 2000, more than double the amount spent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, web-site and e-commerce capability development will
account for 30 percent of the country's IT market that will be
worth a total of 21 billion Australian dollars (13.9 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
By then, Australian organizations are expected to spend 6.3
billion Australian dollars (3.9 billion U.S. dollars) on web
technology, data released by the corporation showed.

<HEADLINE> More Political Commitment Called for Peace in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Political Committee
(JPC) opened its fifth session here Thursday afternoon with a call
for more political commitment to the substantial implementation of
the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Real progress can only be achieved when we match our words
with our actions," said Ugandan State Minister for Regional
Cooperation Amama Mbabazi, who is also chairman of the JPC.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that although a lot has happened since their
last meetings in Harare and Lusaka, "what stands out above all
others has been the persistent reports of violations of the
cease-fire in ever-increasing frequency."
</P>
<P>
"We must find the cause if we are to prescribe a realistic
cure," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbabazi, the international community has awaken to
the dangers of no support for the peace effort on the DRC and
though slowly, has begun the process of getting involved.
</P>
<P>
All is set for the immediate commencement of the implementation
of the Lusaka agreement with the international community thus
galvanized for action and all the parties renewing their
commitment to peace in the vast central African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The JPC is composed of ministers of foreign affairs and defense
of the countries involved in the DRC conflict. The present session
is in the wake of a two-day meeting by the Joint Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission has been meeting here over the
last two days, trying to work out plans for immediate
disengagement of troops and thus ruling out any possibility of any
more clashes and violations of the peace accord in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned About Situation in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A special representative from U.N.
 Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Thursday that the United
Nations is very much concerned about the deteriorating situation
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Kamel Morjane told some reporters after the opening
ceremony of the fifth session of the Joint Political Committee
that the United Nations is following the situation closely and he
would report the results of the meeting to Annan.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties to the 19-month-long conflict to show
their real will to respect the agreement they penned in Lusaka,
Zambia, last July.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the parties themselves to honor their promises,"
he said. "The U.N. would not have an interposition army in
between. They should disengage themselves so that no violations
and fighting happen there."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that all the parties should bypass the violations
of cease- fire and put aside their differences in order to
disengage themselves.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his views about the meeting, he said it would
be a great achievement if they can agree on disengagement and he
hoped to get a positive answer from the parties meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military disengagement and national dialog should go
hand in hand in the DRC, he said, hoping that more efforts will be
made to launch the national dialog because it is the base for the
ever-lasting resolution of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations would continue with its efforts to help
achieve peace in the DRC if the current meeting fails to achieve
the expected goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations passed a resolution on February 24 this
year, giving go-ahead to a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cosmonauts Start Work Inside Mir Station  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The two-member crew on Russia's 28
th mission to Mir started work inside the space station at around
noon Moscow time (0800 GMT) Thursday, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Zaletin and Alexander Kaleri, who earlier successfully
docked their Soyuz spaceship to Mir, are expected to spend 45 days
aboard the 14-year-old station, although their stay could be
extended to 60-75 days if additional funding is found.
</P>
<P>
Mission commander Vladimir Solovyov said the cosmonauts' first
day on the station will be "organizational."
</P>
<P>
"The cosmonauts will bring in their personal belongings and
food from the spaceship. They will make a general inspection of
the station and open the hatch of the Progress-M1-1 cargo ship
that arrived earlier, but will not unload it yet," Interfax quoted
Solovyov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Progress M1-1, loaded with fuel and water, docked with Mir
last month. Zaletin and Kaleri are expected to receive another
Progress cargo spaceship later this month.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's docking occurred shortly after 10:30 a.m. Moscow
time (0630 GMT) in a manual mode after the ground mission control
failed to do it in an automated mode.
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz spacecraft was launched Tuesday from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Zaletin, the flight commander, is on his first mission to Mir,
but the mission is the third for Kaleri, the flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
It is the first manned flight since Mir was put on auto-pilot a
year ago prior to its planned scrapping. Moscow decided to go
ahead with a new mission after securing 20 million U.S. dollars
from a group of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mir was to have been brought down this year by plunging it
toward earth and burning up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The task for Zaletin and Kaleri is to reactivate the station
and conduct maintenance operations and repairs on onboard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important and complicated tasks is to detect
tiny cracks from which air escapes from the station.
</P>
<P>
The leak of air, which led to a pressure drop in the station,
does not affect the safety of flights because air is disappearing
very slowly and can be compensated from the stores on Mir,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The mission control expressed the hope that at least the module
from which the air is leaking should be discovered. Even if the
escape of air is not stopped, it would be very useful for the
future operation of the International Space Station now under
construction.
</P>
<P>
The crew also has to analyze the reliability of the station and
its capability to function. Any further decisions on Mir's use
will be made based on this analysis.
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts will also conduct a series of scientific
experiments and make a space walk.

<HEADLINE> China Lauds Achievements in Patent System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China today held a high-profile
meeting to laud the country's achievements in protecting
intellectual property rights since the adoption of the Patent Law
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, hosted by the State Intellectual Property
Office (SIPO), Ren Jianxin, vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said that the country still has a long way to go to
perfect its patent protection system and train skilled personnel.
</P>
<P>
After its entry into the World Trade Organization, China will
shoulder much more responsibility in multilateral trade and
intellectual property protection, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the SIPO to cultivate a great number of senior
professionals who are familiar with the international covenants in
the field, as well as the laws and regulations of major countries.
</P>
<P>
China revised its Patent Law in 1992 and is considering a
second revision.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Ying, commissioner of the SIPO, summarized China's
achievements during the past 15 years at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
By this January, the total number of patent applications in
China had exceeded one million, ranking fourth in patent
application in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang said, China lags behind many developed countries
in legislation and patent personnel.
</P>
<P>
She urged nationwide patent administrations to effectively
protect patents and help enterprises wisely use patented
technologies.
</P>
<P>
A five-day exhibition displaying the country's 15 years of
patent achievements ended Wednesday in Beijing, and the SIPO
organizers said that technology trades during the exhibition were
valued at roughly 1.2 billion yuan (144 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier on Taiwan Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen has
called on the new leader of Taiwan region to take substantial
steps, instead of merely making gestures, to win trust from others.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the call here today while delivering a report to a
group of officials from central departments of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), the CPC municipal committee of Beijing, and the
General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Qian analyzed the current situation in Taiwan
and cross-Straits relations, criticized the impact of Lee Teng-hui
's "two-state" remarks, exposed the nature and plots of the
separatist forces in Taiwan, and reiterated the consistent
principles and positions of the CPC and the central government on
the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
After Taiwan elected its new leader, the Taiwan affairs offices
of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued an
announcement spelling out the basic stance of the central
government, and stressing the need to watch how Taiwan's new
leader will act and hear what he will say, in order to see what he
will do on the issue of cross-Straits relations, the vice premier
said.

Yulin Prefecture, in northern Shaanxi, is one of China's major
energy and heavy chemical bases. It is home to the country's
largest land-based gas field, with a proven reserve of 340 billion
cu m. The Shenfu-Dongsheng Coalfield in the northern part of
Shaanxi and the southern part of Inner Mongolia has a verified
coal reserve of 140 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
However, poor transportation facilities have been a key factor
hindering economic growth in both Shaanxi and the western part of
China as a whole. Consequently, the central government regards
infrastructure construction as a matter of top concern in economic
development of western China.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi plans to invest 80 billion yuan in infrastructure
projects this year, according to a provincial spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The province is building four expressways, and plans to build
another six. By 2010, the mileage of expressways in Shaanxi will
come to 3,074 km, equivalent to the total length of expressways in
an average medium-sized country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, which served as the capital of 13 dynasties, is a
pivot linking eastern and western China. It will be the main
beneficiary of China's ongoing move to invigorate the resource-
rich, economically backward western China, according to
specialists.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Surges in First Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's tax revenue amounted to
233.7 billion yuan by March 20, an increase of 30.8 percent year-
on-year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT), the tax revenue rose by 41
billion yuan in the first two months compared with the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
A SAT official said that steady economic growth was the major
driving force behind the surge.
</P>
<P>
The booming stock market also contributed significantly to the
growth of taxation, with stamp duties amounting to six times the
amount in the same period of last year. Stamp duty collected on
the trading of securities was worth more than seven billion yuan
over January and February.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a continuous crackdown on smuggling and tax
evasion also helped to increase the tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
China's tax revenue broke the historical level of 1,000 billion
yuan last year, registering a growth of over 10 percent. It is
expected to rise by 7.3 percent to 1,106.3 billion yuan this year.

<P>
President Jiang Zemin said not long ago that whoever is in
power in Taiwan is welcome to visit the mainland, and that central
government leaders could also visit Taiwan, according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
But there must be a premise for talks, namely recognition of
the One-China Principle, he said, emphasizing that under this
premise, everything can be negotiable.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to get a complete response to the issue," Qian
said, "as a complete response is very important, and other things
are less important."
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated that the change of leadership in Taiwan region
will by no means bring any change to the status of Taiwan as part
of China. Currently, he noted, the majority of countries in the
world adhere to the One-China Principle and have promised to
handle their relations with Taiwan within the framework of one
China.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" has no room in the world and most Taiwan
compatriots do not accept the prospect of "Taiwan independence"
and a turbulent cross-Straits relationship, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the central government's positions of adhering to
the One-China Principle, firmly opposing "Taiwan independence",
and making no promise to renounce the use of force. "Taiwan
independence" forces will come to no good, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The central government will absolutely make no compromise on
important issues concerning adherence to the One-China Principle
and safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity, Qian
said, adding, "We are determined to, and confident and capable of
reaching a final resolution on the Taiwan issue, to realize the
complete reunification of the motherland."

<HEADLINE> Nepali Tourism Hit by Suspension of India Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's tourism industry has
been severely hit by the suspension of Indian Airlines flights
after the hijacking of its flight from Kathmandu last December,
travel agency sources told the press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The tourism sector is suffering losses of some 12.2 million
rupees(about 170,000 U.S. dollars) daily which mounts to some 1.24
billion rupees (about 17.5 million dollars) so far," said Yogendra
Shgakya, president of the Nepal Incentive and Convention
Association.
</P>
<P>
An Indian Airlines passenger plane was hijacked on route from
Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24, 1999, prompting the
airlines to suspend its flights to Kathmandu on security reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nepal Association of Travel Agents, the
remaining days of the present tourist season (until the end of May)
and the coming one in fall will also be severely affected if this
crisis is not resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the resumption of Indian Airlines flights between
Nepal and India have so far failed to solve the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the flights has caused a 54-percent drop in
the number of Indian tourists and tourists coming via India,who
account for 48 percent of the total tourists to Nepal. Accordingly,
hotel occupancy has dropped by 30 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nepali tourism entrepreneurs have been pressing the government
to allow private airlines to fly to major cities in India to
improve tourism, which is the third largest foreign currency
earner for the Himalayan kingdom.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 6 (Xinhua) -- New rules and measures to
control ships and boats were announced by the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport in an effort to improve safety, the state news
agency AKP reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, ships and boats are to be limited in
numbers, licensed and subject to regular and surprise inspections.
In addition, they must have approved mechanics or engineers on
board and their skippers should reach the minimum age limits set

</P>
<P>
The new rules and measures were contained in a decree issued to
ensure the orderly operation of ships and ensure the safety of
passengers to prevent hijacking and robbery in waterways.
</P>
<P>
The new rules were adopted after a boat was hijacked by seven
gunmen while it was sailing from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap with
about 90 passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh can register up to 1,500 boats while Koh Kong and
Sihanoukeville can have 1,000 each and the rest of the cities and
provinces,500 each.
</P>
<P>
Ships must have their routes marked on them along with their
names and license numbers.
</P>
<P>
Skippers should be at least 22 years old for ships under 50
tons, 25 for those under 300 tons and older for vessels over 301
tons.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the ministry would inspect ships before
licensing and every six months after that for wooden ships and
once a year for metal- and fiberglass-made vessels. Moreover,
there will also be surprise checks from time to time.

<HEADLINE> India Faces Severe Shortage of Safe Blood: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The region's requirements for safe blood are 15 million units
each year, but only 7 million units are collected, said Dr. Uton
Muchtar Rafei, the WHO's regional director for South-East Asia, on
the eve of World Health Day to be observed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Health Day is "Safe Blood Starts
With Me -- Blood Saves Lives."
</P>
<P>
Rafei said that about 80 percent of the global population, who
live in developing countries, have access to only 20 percent of
the world's supply of safe blood.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Geofrey Denis, head of the International Red
Cross regional division, India alone needs 7.5 million units of
safe blood each year and faces a deficit of 3.5 million units.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the gap between demand and supply of blood is
widening, Denis said a cause for concern is that 30 percent of
India's blood needs are met through commercial units.
</P>
<P>
"This is a really dangerous situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts also warned that safety of transfused blood is a
crucial issue as diseases transmitted through blood transfusion
such as AIDS and Hepatitis B and C have caused incalculable harm.
</P>
<P>
Of the 5.5 million people estimated to have HIV (Human
Immunodeficiency Virus) infection in the region, 5 to 10 percent
are due to blood transfusion, said the experts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Breed New Variety of Tomato </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers announced today
that they have bred a new variety of tomato from seeds once
carried by satellite.
</P>
<P>
The new variety of tomato is "an unusual leap forward" from
previous species in terms of quality and quantity, according to
the scientists with the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural
Sciences (HAAS), in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, HAAS placed tomato seeds called "Beijing Yellow" in a
satellite, which traveled in outerspace for eight days.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this experiment, Chinese experts successfully bred new
varieties of rice and wheat with the help of aerospace technology.
</P>
<P>
Deng Liping, a researcher with HAAS who heads the experiment,
said that scientists analyzed the tomatoes grown from the seeds
and found changes in a main enzyme which carries the genetic
character.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the yield of the new tomato is ten times as large
as previous species, and it has stronger resistance against plant
diseases and insect pests. The breeding period of tomatoes is
about half as long as that on earth.
</P>
<P>
China has so far launched 17 return satellites, and breeding
new varieties of crops was among the missions of the outerspace
exploration.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1988, the Ministry of Agriculture made a series of
measures to increase output of vegetables and grains. The yield of
vegetables is expected to reach 360 million tons this year.

restructuring by dividing its business operations into two new
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the reorganization plan, announced Wednesday, one
of the two companies will focus on PC and information products,
while the other, titled to be called Legend Shenzhou Digital Co.,
Ltd. will be wholly engaged in Internet-based services and
products for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yuanqing and Guo Wei, the heads of the two new companies,
are both in their 30s, and each has about 10 years of experience
in their respectively field.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chuanzhi, president of Legend, said that his company should
have more than one brand on the market, although Legend has
already become a famous brand.
</P>
<P>
While continuing its traditional PC business, the company needs
another team to develop e-commerce-centered network products, and
this team is the Legend Shenzhou Digital Co., Ltd., said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that this restructuring means the PC giant has
began its march into the increasingly hot fields of the Internet

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Effective Afforestation Measures in West Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's State Forestry
Administration (SFA) decided today to publicize 100 effective ways
to accomplish afforestation in the country's western region to
raise the survival rate of trees and grass that have been planted.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 5.4 million square kilometers, the western
region is largely sandy and arid, where harsh natural conditions
make it difficult for newly planted trees and grass to survive.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, experts organized by the SFA came up
with 100 effective measures based on high technology and
successful experience in afforestation under similar conditions.
</P>
<P>
One effective method, for example, is collecting surface water
in the Loess Plateau to irrigate trees, which has raised the
survival rate of the trees by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
An SFA official said they will adopt various ways to publicize
these measures and make them known to all. Meanwhile, technical
training will be carried out at different levels to ensure their
successful implementation.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of people held a rally at the Western Wall
Wednesday in support of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of the
ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party.
</P>
<P>
The rally came a day after the Shas mentor submitted evidence to
the police explaining his verbal attack on Meretz leader and
Education Minister Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
The rally was the second in support of Yosef since Attorney-
General Elyakim Rubinstein ordered police to investigate if there
was incitement when Yosef compared Sarid to two Jews' traditional
enemies in the Bible whom God orders completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The next pro-Yosef demonstration will take place in Jerusalem
during the Jewish Passover holidays. Organizers hope tens of
thousands will participate.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A senior One Israel coalition politician has sounded out the
opposition Likud over whether it would support the candidacy of
Foreign Minister David Levy for president if President Ezer Weizman
resigns soon.
</P>
<P>
Levy's possible candidacy has been broached again in the past
few days, ahead of police recommendations expected soon on the
investigation of President Weizman for accepting large cash gifts
from French businessman Edouard Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
According sources in One Israel, Prime Minister Ehud Barak will
recruit the Likud into the coalition government, with Likud leader
Ariel Sharon becoming foreign minister, in return for its support
for Levy's candidacy, which is based on the assumption that Weizman
plans to resign at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli shares traded on Nasdaq Wednesday rose across the
board at the end of another roller-coaster trading day, raising
hopes that the local Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) will recover
Thursday from its drop of more than 4 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned, however, that global financial markets will
remain volatile in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The TASE's TA-100 index fell 4.25 percent and the TA-25 index
was down 4.31 percent, the largest one-day drop since October 1997.
The Teltech listing of technological companies was down 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanon has set a series of stringent conditions for
permitting a United Nations peacekeeping force to deploy along the
border with Israel following a unilateral Israel troops withdrawal
based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese terms came in a message conveyed to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan by President Emile Lahoud through U.N. envoy
Terje Roed Larsen, who met with Lahoud Wednesday in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Among Lahoud's conditions is that the multinational forces
disarm the Palestinian militias in the country, a task Beirut has
long been afraid to undertake for fear of possible repercussions
for the country's security and stability.

NEW DELHI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Emirs Support Suspension of Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Traditional rulers in Nigeria
Wednesday rose from a meeting in the country's northern city
Kaduna with a call on religious leaders to educate their
followers on the potential dangers of introduction of the Islamic
law Sharia.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Thursday quoted the
emirs as warning that religion and Sharia should not, in anyway,
be used to " threaten the corporate existence of the country since
both have always been with us."
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue should be encouraged and Nigerians should stay where
they are and continue with their normal businesses and
interactions," the monarchs advised.
</P>
<P>
The advice came just as the Kaduna State government and
Jama'atu Nasril Islam (JNI), a Islamic organization insisted on
the implementation of the Sharia legal code despite a resolution
of the meeting of 19 northern governors earlier this week to put
the code on hold.
</P>
<P>
They warned that such acts could lead to the disintegration of
the country, which had already deeply divisive on the issue
between the Muslim north and Christian south, and reminded those
behind the moves that "our strength lay in our size."

<HEADLINE> Clash in Southern Nigeria Kills Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The community clash in southern
Nigeria's towns of Ile-Ife and Modakeke, which had lasted over
two months, Wednesday claimed another five lives.
</P>
<P>
A senior teacher of Botany with the Obafemi Awolowo University,
Ile-Ife, was among the victims, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The violence lingered despite President Olusegun Obasanjo's
inspection to the area in the country's Osun State two weeks ago
to broker a truce.
</P>
<P>
The recent fighting between feuding communities in the two
towns, where some of Nigeria's best universities are located, had
claimed more over 100 lives.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, a visiting governor from a neighboring
state narrowly escaped death from an ambush by the militant
youths in the area.
</P>
<P>
The gate of the well-known Obafemi Awolowo University was
heavily guarded by mobile policemen to prevent the hostility from
extending to the university campus, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Most students living off campus were said to have moved into
the campus for safety.
</P>
<P>
A dusk-to-dawn curfew has long been imposed upon the area and
police as well as federal troops moved in to press down the
violence, but with little effect.
</P>
<P>
The two towns of Ife and Modakeke were traditionally thought to
be the heartland of Yoruba, one of the three dominate
nationalities in the Africa' s most populous country. President
Obasanjo himself is a Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
The communities living in the two towns have a long-standing
rivalry over land ownership and political supremacy in the area
that has sporadically erupted into violence since 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign policy
orientation has become more lucid and more predictable after
Vladimir Putin was elected the new president last month, and
Kazakhstan welcomes this, Foreign Minister Erlan Idrisov said in
Astana Thursday, the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In the first comment by a senior Kazakh official on Russia's
foreign policy since Putin won the election on March 26, Idrisov
said that relations between Russia and his country could become "
less flexible" under the Putin administration.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "rigidity" does not mean "no good,"
but rather "predictability."
</P>
<P>
"Putin is a strong-minded man. He knows very well what he's
doing," Idrisov said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not see Russia as a possible direct threat to
Kazakhstan under a new leader.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control over International Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China is readjusting its taxation
system to fit the new situation that will arise after the country'
s accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO), a senior
taxation official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hao Zhaocheng, deputy commissioner of the State Administration
of Taxation (SAT), told Xinhua there is still a gap between the
taxation system and international practice.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the current taxation system is designed only to
cover foreign companies and individuals in China, but it lacks
regulations on companies investing overseas and individuals
working abroad.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China' accession to the WTO will pose many new
problems for the taxation system, including the conflict of
interest of taxes among different countries and hidden evasion of
taxes in the form of transfer pricing.
</P>
<P>
He said that increasing exposure of multinational companies in
China has brought more and more new issues involving international
taxation to the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 of the top 500 multinational companies in the
world are now operating in China, and over 5,000 Chinese companies
have made investments outside the country. At the same time, more
than 3 million Chinese people are now working abroad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Sino-U.S. Trade Relations (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged the United States to properly handle the issue of
granting China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR).
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in his meeting with visiting U.S.
Commerce Secretary William Daley here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The proper solution to the PNTR issue "is in the interests of
both China and the U.S.," Jiang said. The mutual granting of the
most-favored nation status forms "one of the essential principles
of the World Trade Organization," he pointed out. "China will, as
always, make an active contribution to the healthy development of
the world economy and trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daley told Jiang that the U.S. government values very much its
ties with China and actively works for the continuous growth of U.
S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation is
absolutely conducive to the prosperity and development of both U.S.
and China and in the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration will make efforts to push
the Congress to approve the PNTR bill so as to ensure the sound
development of U.S.-China trade relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang welcomed Daley to visit China, who
thanked Jiang and conveyed U.S. President Bill Clinton's regards
to him.
</P>
<P>
In return, Jiang asked Daley to convey his regards to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Sino-U.S. relations are facing opportunities
and challenges, and for the fundamental interests of the peoples
of the two countries, both sides should ascend a height to enjoy a
distant view, enhance mutual understanding and increase
cooperation and work hard to push forward the continuous
development of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Daley is here for the 13th Session of the Sino-U.S. Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting were State Councilor Wu Yi,
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng,
vice-foreign minister Yang Jiechi, and U.S. ambassador to China
Joseph Prueher.

<HEADLINE> Top Prosecutor Pledges Judicial Support in Developing China's West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- China's top prosecutor pledged
today to provide support for procuratorial bodies in the country's
western areas.
</P>
<P>
"Support means providing equipment, personnel training, money,
as well as political guidance," said Han Zhubin, procurator-
general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SSP), in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial bodies in China's western regions will focus on
five major tasks: maintain social order and ethnic unity; help
eliminate corruption in state-owned enterprises; improve law
supervision over courts and the police, and protect the legitimate
rights and interests of non-state economic entities.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1,000 procuratorates in China's west,
accounting for one third of all the procuratorates in the country.
</P>
<P>
SPP will pay special attention to upgrading ethics and
professional proficiency level of prosecutors in western areas,
said Han.
</P>
<P>
A massive educational campaign will be launched for these
prosecutors on the significance of developing China's western
regions.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial bodies in developed coastal areas will be
mobilized to provide support and help for their counterparts in
the west.

<HEADLINE> Campus Rapist Executed in North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Court
announced here today that a man who raped two university students
and killed a woman postgraduate student during a failed sexual
assault was executed in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wen, 31, was jobless and had served three and a half years
in prison on a previous rape conviction. In August 1999, Yang
raped two female students on the campus as he posed as a staff
member of Shanxi University.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, Yang once again pretended to work at the
university when he attempted to rape a postgraduate student, and
choked her to death during the failed attempt, disposing of her
body in a pond.
</P>
<P>
On December 8, 1999, the Intermediate People's Court of Taiyuan
sentenced Yang to death on charges of murder and rape. Yang did
not appeal the sentence, and the Higher People's Court of Shanxi
later examined and approved the judgment of the Intermediate Court.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, a vice president of the Supreme People's Court,
said that courts of all levels will punish all crimes that
threaten students.

<HEADLINE> 30 Combatants Killed in Gun Battle in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 combatants had been
killed in a fierce gun battle in northern Sri Lanka between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels, a military spokesman
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Col. R. P. Witana said the Tamil Tiger rebels
Wednesday engaged the advancing troops with a heavy volume of
mortar and artillery fire at Muhamalai in the northernmost Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sri Lankan artillery carried out counter
bombardment and neutralized the rebel mortars, killing 18 rebels
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
"MI24 ground-attack helicopters and Kfir aircraft of the Sri
Lankan Air Force engaged identified terrorist targets in depth,"
said Witana.
</P>
<P>
He said 12 soldiers were killed and 67 others injured in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government Thursday held another round of talks
with the main opposition United National Party on constitutional
reform proposals which aim to end the conflict by devolving more
powers to regional councils, including one administered by Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula has seen bloody battles since last week as
LTTE rebels try to retake their former stronghold, which they lost
in 1996. Hundreds of rebels and soldiers have been killed or
wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have vowed to
take back Jaffna, which might help the LTTE negotiate from a
position of strength if and when peace talks with the government
began.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Leaves Cuba for U.S. to Pick up Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez, father of the
six-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, who lives with his
relatives in Florida, left here Thursday for the United States to
pick up his son.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, his wife, and their 6-month-old son -- Elian's half
brother -- left for Washington after they were seen off by Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has granted a visa for the father and
five others including Elian's kindergarten teacher in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department last week demanded Elian's relatives in
Florida to promise to surrender Elian if they lose their court
fight and said that it would end the custody of the boy by Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled earlier
this year that the boy belongs to his father and should be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle in Florida filed a political asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuban politicians in the U.S.,
wanted to keep the boy in the United States.

<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Australian sports consultants
will conduct a seminar on managing sports facilities on April 26-
28 in Manila as part of the Australian government's continuous
support to the Filipino athletes.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador John Buckley said Thursday the three-day
seminar, funded by the Australia-Asia Sports Linkages program,
will tackle topics on how to maintain and manage existing sports
facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation between Australia and the Philippines in sports
goes back several years and this seminar is part of the memorandum
of agreement between us and the Philippine Sports Commission,"
said Buckley in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum between the two countries was signed in 1995 and
under it, Australia has become an important provider of sporting
expertise to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a number of Australian specialists have visited the
country to share their technical know-how on sports.
</P>
<P>
During the All the Best from Australia promotion in 1998,
Australian experts led a series of seminars for sports
administrators and athletes on topics such as sports science,
elite athlete development and women in sports.
</P>
<P>
Also, a number of Filipino athletes have gone to Australia to
take advantage of the high quality training and facilities.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Southeast Asian Games medal winners Elma Muros-
Posadas, Joebert Delicano, John Lozada, Jimar Aing, and Fidel
Gallenero.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's commitment to this warm sports relationship is
ongoing and will keep going on," said Buckley.

Jiang extended a warm welcome to Ersumer, speaking highly of
the traditional friendship between the two countries, which was
initiated in ancient times by the world-famous "silk road".
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he noted, high-level contacts have been
frequent, bilateral relations have continuously developed, and
cooperation in the fields of politics, economy and culture has
been expanding.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today urged the United States to properly handle the issue of
granting China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR).
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in his meeting with visiting U.S.
Commerce Secretary William Daley here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The proper solution to the PNTR issue "is in the interests of
both China and the U.S.," Jiang said. The mutual granting of the
most-favored nation status forms "one of the essential principles
of the World Trade Organization," he pointed out. "China will, as
always, make an active contribution to the healthy development of
the global world economy and trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Daley told Jiang that the U.S. government values very much its
ties with China and actively works for the continuous growth of U.
S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation is
absolutely conducive to the prosperity and development of both U.S.
and China and in the interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration will make efforts to push
the Congress for approving the PNTR bill so as to ensure the sound
development of U.S.-China trade relations.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Pakistan's Ex-Premier Sentenced to Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's former Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Thursday was sentenced to life imprisonment on
charges of hijacking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Terrorism Court No. One in the southern Pakistani city of
Karachi also ordered that Sharif be fined 500,000 rupees (9,615 U.
S.dollars) for each charge and all his properties confiscated.
</P>
<P>
However, the deposed prime minister was acquitted of charges of
attempted murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
All the six co-accused, including Sharif's brother Shahbaz
Sharif, were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan's legislative code, Sharif will have a
week's time to appeal to the Sindh High Court. The defendant
lawyers said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was accused of endangering the lives of some 200
passengers, including army chief General Pervez Musharraf, by
refusing to let a civil plane to land in Karachi on October 12
last year.
</P>
<P>
The plane finally grounded with fuel for only seven minutes
after the army took control of the airport. General Musharraf then
dashed to Islamabad and dismissed the Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Sharif were first filed by an army officer
in Karachi on November 10, 1999, and the case experienced ups and
downs during some three and half months of hearing.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had asked for death penalty for Sharif and his
six co-accused, charging them with hijacking, terrorism,
kidnapping and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
In his statements to the court, Sharif denied the charges,
saying evidence against him had been fabricated and prosecution
witnesses had been tortured and intimidated into giving false
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Judge Rehmat Hussain Jaffry on Thursday morning announced the
verdict amidst tight security around the court and throughout the
city of Karachi. Hundreds of paramilitary troops were deployed
across the port city to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign observers and diplomats witnessed the court
's proceedings. Only journalists who were issued special cards by
the local authorities were allowed into the court.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is Pakistan's third prime minister to have been found
guilty of various charges.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's first-elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
was given the death sentence in the late 1970s on charges of
murder, while his daughter, Benazir Bhutto, was sentenced to a
five-year jail term in her absence on corruption charges by the
Sharif government.

<HEADLINE> NZ Doctors Advised Against Early Sex Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand doctors are being
advised not to carry out sex determination tests on pregnant women
if the information may be used to abort an unwanted fetus, usually
a female.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Pippa MacKay of the New Zealand Medical Association(
NZMA) said in a statement here Thursday that the practice of
couples seeking the sex determination tests is now being sought in
New Zealand. The issue was discussed at a meeting of the NZMA-
sponsored National Policy Council and referred to the NZMA Ethics
Committee for a policy to be formulated.
</P>
<P>
Some older pregnant women or those with a family history of
hereditary problems can undergo a procedure called chorionic
villus sampling, which is used to check fetuses for chromosomal
abnormalities, MacKay said, adding that it can also identify the
sex of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
"If women want this procedure carried out purely to identify
the sex of the fetus, with a view to having an abortion if they
are carrying a girl, then we strongly advise doctors not to refer
the woman for the test, or to carry out the test," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Continue Caning Naughty Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
declared that discipline will continue to be enforced by the cane
until teachers think of another suitable form of punishment to
inflict on naughty young scholars.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Thursday quoted Deputy Education
Minister Bujiku Sakila as saying in parliament on Wednesday that
the Ministry for Education and Culture still believes that
corporal punishment, if used properly, can continue to reform
pupils.
</P>
<P>
He told the House that teachers would continue caning naughty
youths indefinitely despite the opposition from activists who
describe the form of punishment as severe and a gross abuse of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
According to Sakila, the National Education (Corporal
Punishment) Regulation of 1979 gives teachers the right to punish
pupils by a "soft cane on the hands or buttocks while the pupil is
wearing all her/his uniform."
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, caning should not be above six
strokes at any one time.
</P>
<P>
Caning is popular in Tanzanian schools and most teachers have
been accused of arbitrarily caning their pupils.
</P>
<P>
Critics said the problem lies in the lack of professionalism on
the part of teachers because most of them can not think of lesser
punishments to inflict on pupils.
</P>
<P>
Teachers turn to the cane because it is much easier and does
not even require them to think, the critics said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Retrench Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 48,000 Kenyan civil
servants will be retrenched at a staggering cost of 16 billion
shillings (about 216 million U.S. dollars), said a revised draft
paper on poverty reduction just released by the government.
</P>
<P>
The draft paper was recently tabled for debate at a high
profile workshop attended by top government officials led by
President Daniel arap Moi, civil society and religious leaders,
opposition parliament members, and professionals among other
stakeholders, the East African Standard newspaper reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The final draft, which is expected to save the exchequer 6
billion shillings (about 80 million U.S. dollars) per annum, will
be ready early next year after countrywide consultation.
</P>
<P>
However, this poverty eradication document indicates that the
painful retrenchment will commence in the 2001/2002 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft noted that the move to rightsize the civil
service will enable the government maintain a quality work force
that is highly paid.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights in the revised draft paper include the
combination of the auditor-general (corporation) with the
controller and auditor- general in a bid to closely monitor
government accounting officials and control public spending.
</P>
<P>
As part of its civil service reform program, the Kenyan
government announced Wednesday that it will downsize its bloated
teaching work force by 28,000.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Cautiously Welcomes Kaunda's Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
cautiously welcomed the retirement from active politics of Kenneth
Kaunda, former republic president and leader of the biggest
opposition party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP),
the Times of Zambia newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman and Information Minister Newstead
Zimba was quoted as saying here on Wednesday that the cautious
approach emanated from Kaunda's well documented history of
retiring from active politics and later coming back.
</P>
<P>
"His role during this period has been far from being
constructive," he said, adding that "when Dr. Kaunda's retirement
becomes effective, we will now give him the role of a respected
founding father-figure of the nation which he deserves."
</P>
<P>
Zimba described Kaunda's retirement as a good thing for
himself, his family, his party, his country and the entire African
continent.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kaunda to be above partisan politics to be a
distinguished and respected statesman at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The whole country could benefit from his immense knowledge and
experience acquired over a period of 50 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda should not retire with bitterness and vengeance and
should desist from inciting the people to rise against President
Frederick Chiluba and his government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda reaffirmed his decision here on Sunday to quit party
politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 76, ruled Zambia after its independence from British
colonial rule in 1964 until 1991 when he was defeated by incumbent
President Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He was barred from contesting the position in the 1996
elections because of his Malawian parentage. In that year, a
constitutional amendment was adopted in the country to bar those
whose parents are foreign immigrants from contesting the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda had vowed repeatedly to run for the presidency
in the next general elections despite the government utterance
that Kaunda is not qualified for it.
</P>
<P>
His rival Chiluba had repeatedly urged him to quit party
politics to be respected as founding father of the country like
Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda resigned from UNIP soon after his party lost in the 1991
 elections but he returned to UNIP in 1994 and was elected UNIP
presidency in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On December 25, 1997, three days after his return from overseas
trip, Kaunda was arrested for his alleged involvement in the coup
attempt of October 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, 1998, Kaunda was released and in return for the
release three days later Kaunda announced his retirement from
party politics.
</P>
<P>
However, at the end of 1998, Kaunda vowed not to retire from
politics, saying no body can prevent him from contesting the 2001
elections.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has told donors to stop playing double standards and devise a
common criteria for judging the performance of African countries.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal here on Wednesday when returning from the
two-day Africa-European Union summit held in Cairo, Egypt, which
was ended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged donors to help African countries strengthen their
 economies for good governance and democracy to take root on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"They have been making subjective judgment about what one
African country does compared to another. They must come up with
criteria to make objective judgment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said good governance and democracy could lead to confusion
if they are pursued in an environment of abject poverty and
squalor.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Chiluba said "violations (of the cease-fire agreement) have
become the rule rather than the exception."
</P>
<P>
"That is not good for us," he said, stressing that "we want
money for development and we want war to come to an end as soon as
possible."

<HEADLINE> Corruption Blamed for Investment to Shun Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria William
Twaddel Wednesday picked out corruption as the major obstacle
hindering foreign investment from flowing in to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Thursday quoted
Twaddel as saying here at a workshop that corruption would impede
the current efforts by the Nigerian government to revive the
comatose utilities, reduce poverty and encourage investments.
</P>
<P>
Only stringent measures like an efficient legal system,
reduction of bureaucracy and political stability could remedy the
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, competitive financial market, a
prompt regulatory system and high moral values would compel
discipline, reduce corruption and consequently improve Nigeria's
tarnished image.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, according to last year's Transparency International
polls, is the second most corrupt nation in Africa, coming behind
Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
However, Twaddel applauded President Olusegun Obasanjo's
commitment to warring against corruption.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Notables Call for Lift of Sanctions on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- As many as 79 Swedish notables
of various circles called on the international community to lift
the sanctions on Yugoslavia in an article carried on the Dagens
Nyheter (Daily News) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old sanctions on the Balkan country have brought
great difficulties and pain to its people, including serious lack
of food, medicines and fuels, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the sanctions have hindered the reconstruction of
Yugoslavia after NATO's bombing in 1999 and the settlement of some
1 million Balkan refugees in the country, said the article, signed
by leading figures from political, cultural, sports, religious and
justice circles in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to restore normal relations with Yugoslavia in
all fields," whether out of humanitarian considerations or for the
sake of a peaceful environment in Europe and respect for the U.N.
charter, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Swedish government to make efforts for the
lifting of the sanctions on Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Dell Shifts Focus to Internet Services, Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Michael Dell, chief executive
of Dell Computer Corp., told analysts Wednesday that his company
is now focusing on Internet-related services and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"This entire Internet revolution is fueling lots of changes,
particularly in the consumer market," Dell said on the eve of the
company's semi-annual analyst meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
The nation's leading personal computer seller is not abandoning
the direct sales model that made it famous, but building from the
successful formula that has allowed it to sell 40 million U.S.
dollars a day through its Web site, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
Dell's vice chairman, Kevin Rollins, said the company has
developed a strategy that focuses on the back-end arena of dot-
coms, Internet service providers and established companies that
are increasing their e-commerce presence.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is not a surprise because Dell has slowly been
branching from selling PCs and breaking into the service arena,
said Barry Jaruzelski, an analyst with Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts noted Dell Computer Corp., which has reaped
25.3 billion dollars in revenue over the past year -- mostly from
PC sales -- has already begun putting its strategy in play.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company announced that it would broaden its year-
old Dell Ventures to include equity investments and incubation
services for private startup companies.
</P>
<P>
The company also appointed its chief financial officer, Thomas
Meredith, as managing director of Dell Ventures, which has to date
invested more than 700 million dollars into 95 startups.
</P>
<P>
Since the formation of Dell Ventures in April 1999, a dozen of
the Dell-supported companies have gone public, earning Dell about
2 billion dollars on paper.
</P>
<P>
Dell Ventures also will focus on data transfer and storage,
Internet services, business-to-business and business-to-consumer
online commerce, and Internet access and content, according to
officials in Dell.
</P>
<P>
The company also released the PowerApp server, targeting the
Web hosting and traffic management needs of service providers and
other businesses with Internet infrastructure needs.

<HEADLINE> Land Gear Collapse Blamed for MiG-31 Crash in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The collapse of the landing gear's
right rack led to Wednesday's crash of a MiG-31 fighter-
interceptor in northern Russia, the Interfax news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The jet was in the process of landing at 10:32 p.m. Moscow time
(1832 GMT) following a training flight when the landing gear
collapsed. The aircraft slid off the runaway, went about 800
meters, flipped over and then caught fire, Interfax said, citing
preliminary data from the air force general staff.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened at an air base in Kotlas, of the northern
Russian region of Arkhangelsk region.
</P>
<P>
Major Yevgeny Stroitelev was in serious condition following the
crash and died later. Crew commander Colonel Gennady Mashevsky
received only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
A commission of the Russian Armed Forces' Flight Safety Service
is investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
The MiG-31 supersonic fighter-interceptor of the fourth
generation was designed some 25 years ago. About 500 warplanes of
this model have been built, and more than 350 of them are being
used by the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The air force has had five incidents over the last year,
including two crashes and three minor accidents. There was an
average of one accident for approximately every 27,000 hours of
air force flights, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Said to Back Early Elections in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Yugoslav opposition
leader said here Thursday that Russia supports his calls for early
presidential and parliamentary elections in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Vuk Draskovic, leader of Yugoslavia's opposition Serbian
Renewal Party, told a news conference that Russian officials,
including Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, "expressed absolute
support" for the idea during meetings with him.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Ivanov as saying that "democratic elections in
Yugoslavia are the only way to preserve Yugoslavia, keep Kosovo in
the framework of the country and guarantee the full implementation
of U.N. Security Council resolution No. 1244," the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic's assertion of firm Russian support for early
elections in Yugoslavia was apparently different from earlier
reports that Moscow only expressed "understanding."
</P>
<P>
Draskovic, who also met on Wednesday with Grigory Yavlinsky,
leader of Russia's liberal Yabloko party, said the purpose of his
trip to Moscow was "to ask Russia to exert quick and effective
pressure" on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to "
early elections at all levels this year."
</P>
<P>
"I asked Russia to come to an agreement with the European Union
on the cancellation of all sanctions against Serbia immediately
after the announcement of the elections in Yugoslavia and on the
return of a number of Serbian policemen and troops sent by
international understandings to Kosovo, primarily to the border
with Albania," he said.
</P>
<P>
The next presidential elections in Serbia, the largest republic
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, are scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic is visiting Moscow at the invitation of the
international affairs committee of the State Duma, Russia's lower
house of parliament. He is expected to leave Moscow on Friday.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua)-- China insists that the United
Nations Security Council should be reformed and representatives of
developing countries should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said this at today's press
conference, when asked to comment on the 21st century action plan
proposed by Kofi Annan, U.N. Secretary-General, to the U.N.
convention.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that China has taken note of relevant reports by Annan
and is closely examining them.
</P>
<P>
China has always maintained that the role of the U.N. should be
reinforced, Sun said, adding that China expects members of the
organization to have thorough discussions on the matter at the U.N.
millennium summit scheduled for the fall of this year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve the U.N. role, reforms will have to be
implemented, Sun said, noting that the reforms should be in line
with the principles and objectives of the U.N. charter and fully
reflect the common interests of its members, rather than serving a
minority of countries.
</P>
<P>
The priority of reforms for the Security Council is to correct
the current imbalance in the council, Sun said, stressing that any
proposition that excludes developing countries will not win wide
support.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Improvement Vital to Western Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Ecological improvement is vital to
the development of China's vast west, according to the country's
leading newspaper the People Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper today devoted a full page to the subject of the
ecology of the west, whose development has attracted the attention
of the whole nation following calls from the Communist Party
Central Committee and central government late last year.
</P>
<P>
"Ecological deterioration of the western region should never be
underestimated," the newspaper quoted ecological experts.
</P>
<P>
Despite the many factors behind the underdevelopment of the
region, the most fundamental has been adverse natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
At present, the major part of the region, which occupies 2,622,
000 square kilometers, or 27.3 percent of the country's total, has
been desertified.
</P>
<P>
All the grand plans for western development will become empty
words unless the ecological problems there are given enough
emphasis, the newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
It cited the example of Otog Banner in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region. Over the past 30 years, shifting sands have
destroyed and buried over 2,200 houses there, and more than 700
households have been forced to relocate.
</P>
<P>
In Zhongqu Township of Minqing County in the northwest province
of Gansu, 5,300 hectares of the 6,660 hectares of farmland there
has been abandoned over the past five years because of
desertification and salinazation.

"Declining vegetation, soil erosion, and ever-worsening
desertification have seriously hindered economic construction and
social development in the western region," said Jiang Zehui,
president of the Chinese Academy of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State
Council have been very concerned about the ecological environment
of the western region and have given priority to the region's
ecological protection and improvement.
</P>
<P>
"It is both scientific and practical that the Party and the
central government have decided western development should first
proceed from the ecological development of the region," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
To halt the sharply declining forests in the region, the State
Forestry Administration, the State Development Planning Commission,
and the Ministry of Finance have jointly put forward a program to
"barter grain for trees and grass."
</P>
<P>
Under this program, 5.15 million hectares of farmland will be
reconverted into forests and grasslands, and another 6.48 million
hectares of forests and grasslands will be created on the region's
barren hills and wastelands.
</P>
<P>
All farmers engaged in the program will be compensated in grain
for their lands and labor, and the huge cost of the program will
be shouldered entirely by the central government, the paper said.

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of the All-China
Women's Federation has found that women running businesses in the
private sector are mostly tough and confident, with a strong
awareness of law and social responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire survey conducted among more than 800 female
entrepreneurs in the private sector shows that most of the
respondents are healthy, well-educated, and have a happy family.
</P>
<P>
Some 73 percent of the women surveyed are under 45 years of age,
and 30 percent of them have a college education. About 13 percent
said they would like to become delegates to the people's congress
or representatives of the people's political consultative
conference, which indicates a strong wish to participate in
government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the women entrepreneurs said they believe
that being straight and setting a good example for employees by
their own behavior is the key to success, while 82 percent said
they would like to make greater contributions to society.
</P>
<P>
Among the women surveyed, 95 percent have donated to social

When asked "what mental qualities does a successful woman
entrepreneur need?" 44 percent said "enterprise," about 41 percent
said "confidence," and 30 percent said "persistence."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of the female entrepreneurs said that self-
contempt is a state of mind that women should overcome, while 32
percent said dependency and self-satisfaction should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The survey results show that the mentality of women
entrepreneurs is largely similar. Most of them hope they will have
opportunities to learn more about management, policies and
regulations, and computer technology.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, some 83 percent are still in their
first marriage, 6.3 percent are remarried, and 5.7 percent are
divorced or separated from their husbands. About 84.4 percent said
their husbands play an active role in supporting their businesses.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the majority of the women have a happy marriage
and receive help and support from their husbands. But the divorce
rate among them is slightly higher than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Compared with developed countries, China has a very small
number of female entrepreneurs, with women accounting for only 10
percent of all private-enterprise owners in China.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these women's enterprises are engaged in the
traditional sectors of commerce, catering and entertainment, and
textiles and garments, with some 20 percent in agriculture and
manufacturing, and another 16 percent in real estate, information,
technology, advertising, finances, electronics and
telecommunications.
</P>

The respondents to this survey urge that women's federations at
all levels should play a more active role in improving the status
of female entrepreneurs in China.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Chinese Book Website Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- A new website claiming to be the
world's biggest for Chinese books has been launched by several
Chinese students studying in Silicon Valley in California in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The site, called Bookoo, differs from similar sites in that it
will sign contracts with writers and publish their books on-line.
By paying the authors, the Bookoo company is thus licensed to
digitize their works.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of well-known writers had decided to work with Bookoo
before the website was opened. Insiders say this will be helpful
for protecting on-line intellectual properties and stopping
illegal digital copies.
</P>
<P>
Logging on: www.bookoo.com.cn, one will be able to access
information about bestsellers, book reviews, and cultural
activities, as well as the latest on-line publications.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Spells out 3 Principles for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Thursday that the government will adhere to three guiding
principles in solving the country's armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement that these principles involve
not only the government and armed rebel groups alone, but also the
communities affected by clashes between them.
</P>
<P>
"The government has consistently adopted a comprehensive and
holistic approach to solve the country's internal armed conflicts.
This approach is governed by three important principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
First of the three principles decrees that the peace process
must forge a new social compact that allows all individuals and
groups to fully engage in peaceful competition.
</P>
<P>
The second guiding principle, the president said, involves a
community-based peace process, reflecting the sentiments, values
and principles important to all Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The third principle, according to Estrada, decrees that the
peace process seek a peaceful resolution -- and not by victory in
a violent armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration has committed to pursue the peace
process with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Mindanao
and leftist groups at the local level.
</P>
<P>
Formal peace negotiations between the government and the MILF
are scheduled to resume on May 2, while local peace fora in the
provinces of Bohol, Davao and Bicol have already been set up to
serve as pilot areas in ending the government's conflict with
leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president ordered all government agencies,
financial institutions and state-owned and controlled corporations
to fully support the localized peace process with leftist
insurgents to ensure the success of the government's new peace
strategy.
</P>
<P>
National level peace talks between the government and leftist
rebels were suspended last year after Philippine Senate ratified
the Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement which allows the
resumption of large-scale war games between the two countries.

ISLAMABAD, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's former prime minister
Nawaz Sharif Thursday was sentenced to life imprisonment on
charges of hijacking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He was also fined 500,000 rupees (9,615 U.S. dollars) for each
charge and awarded confiscation of all his properties.
</P>
<P>
Rehmat Hussain Jafri, judge of the Anti-Terrorism Court No.One
in southern Pakistani city of Karachi announced the verdict.
</P>
<P>
However, he was acquitted of charges of attempt to murder and
criminal conspiracy. All of the six co-accused, including Sharif's
brother Shahbaz Sharif, were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan's legislative code, Sharif will have a
week's time to appeal in the Sindh High Court.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was accused of endangering lives of some 200 passengers,
including army chief General Pervez Musharraf, by refusing the
landing of a civil plane in Karachi on October 12 last year.
</P>
<P>
The plane finally grounded with fuel for only seven minutes
after the army took control the airport, soon after which General
Musharraf dashed to Islamabad and dismissed the Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Sharif was first lodged by an army officer
in Karachi on November 10, 1999, and the case witnessed ups and
downs during some three and half months of hearing.
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, both the prosecution and the accused,
including the deposed prime minister himself, expressed confidence
on the court judgment.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Launch Bursary Schemes for Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is to come
up with bursary or scholarship schemes for students whose families
cannot afford the newly increased fees for technical colleges, the
Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Science, Technical Educational and Vocational Training
Minister Abel Chambeshi was quoted as saying that in view of the
current levels of poverty in the country, the government will have
to come up with appropriate bursary or scholarship schemes for
some of the poor students.
</P>
<P>
Chambeshi was on a tour of the ministry's newly delinked
institutions in Solwezi city, North-Western Province, to meet the
new board members.
</P>
<P>
Much of the technical equipment and tooling for Solwezi Trades
is still locked away in a store room behind the provincial
permanent secretary's office due to lack of space.
</P>
<P>
The government is working in league with some cooperating
partners to play their part by providing consultancy services and
project money through a training fund which is to be launched
later this year, the minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 5 (Xinhua) -- California governor Gray Davis
Wednesday proposed spending some 5.2 billion U.S. dollars on
transportation projects, apparently in an effort to solve the
state's notorious traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
Davis proposes spending 4.7 billion dollars for a variety of
rail, bus and highway projects, including 1.5 billion dollars in
the San Francisco-San Jose area, 2.24 billion dollars in the Los
Angeles area, 481 million dollars in the San Diego area, and 518
million dollars in the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
He recommends spending 500 million dollars to ease a backlog in
road maintenance and asks lawmakers to allocate 5 million dollars
to begin environmental studies for a high-speed rail system that
would link Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The projects range from a new ferry on San Francisco Bay to a
study on a proposed 1,150-kilometer high-speed rail system,
according to Davis' spokesman Michael Bustamante.
</P>
<P>
The plan, pending approval by the state legislature, would be
funded in part with 3 billion dollars from the state's largest
budget account, the general fund, that would be spread over four
years, and 2.2 billion dollars from a bond measure that Davis
wants to put on the November ballot.

<HEADLINE> Leading U.S. Internet Company Unveils New Web Browser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft's archrival Netscape
announced Wednesday it will release a preview version of Netscape
6, the latest version of its Internet browser to connect millions
of Web surfers, promising an array of new bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
The preview of Version 6 will be officially launched by parent
company America Online's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
Steve Case at Internet World, an industry trade show in Los
Angeles, according to news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
America Online, the biggest Internet service provider with 23
million users, acquired Netscape in November 1998 for 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Netscape, once the Internet's leading browser, has been
battling Microsoft and its Explorer browser for market share. Late
last year, the data research firm WebSideStory said that Microsoft
Explorer accounted for 75 percent of all browsers used on the
Internet, while Netscape Navigator accounted for just 24.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Netscape has accused Microsoft of strong-arming computer
vendors into selling PCs bundled with Explorer -- an accusation
that helped lead to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's ruling Monday that Microsoft violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act in attempting to "monopolize the Web browser market.
"
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say that Netscape 6 uses Gecko browser engine
technology and JavaScript 1.5 that allows Web developers to create
more robust Internet applications. It also features the voice
software of Net2Phone, enabling users to make phone calls through
the Internet, they added.
</P>
<P>
A language translating feature from Alis Technologies that
translates Web pages will be available, as will an application
that enables users to accept or block "cookies" -- bits of data
stored on a user's computer that provide ways for Web sites to
keep track of users' preferences.
</P>
<P>
A new feature of Netscape 6, My Sidebar, will let users keep
open online features and information from content providers
including the New York Times, CNN, CNET and eBay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PC maker Gateway unveiled three new AOL-Gateway
products, including a countertop device, a Web pad providing

<HEADLINE> China's City of Springs Threatened By Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Residents in this capital city of
east China's Shandong Province, famous for its many fountains,
have been urged to stop using dripping faucets starting this month
to reduce the amount of wasted water.
</P>
<P>
This famous city of springs is now being threatened by serious
shortage of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Local water supply officials said the underground water level
in Jinan is three meters lower than at the same time last year,
and what is worse, the water level is still dropping.
</P>
<P>
There is no hope of rising the underground water level before
the rainy season, they predict.
</P>
<P>
The city government has warned residents that the daily
shortage of water stands at over 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The city government has taken measures to deal with the
shortage, including building reservoirs, developing new water
sources, and reducing the exploitation of underground water.
</P>
<P>
An city government official said that an indifferent attitude
toward water saving on the part of local people has made this
problem the hardest nut to crack.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, the city government has taken
compulsory measures whereby residents must replace their leaky
faucets by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Jinan has more than 100 springs in its downtown area, producing
over 300,000 tons of water daily.

<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region and Hebei Province, all in northern China, are now
experiencing strong dusty wind, blotting out the sun and turning
the sky slate grey.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guimin, senior engineer with China's Central
Meteorological Observatory, explained that today's dusty weather
is being caused by moderate gales originating on the Mongolian
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the strong winds would sweep areas along the
Yellow River and the Huaihe River, including Shandong Province,
later today.
</P>
<P>
"The wind will slow down later this afternoon and the grey sky
will turn clear as air-borne dust gradually settles down", Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed dry, strong wind, and the dearth of vegetation in
northern China for the dusty weather, adding that the fine
particles of soil can easily be carried long distances by the
strong winds.
</P>
<P>
"A sandstorm hit Ulan Bator, capital of Mongolia, Wednesday
under the influence of a strong gale, which has moved southward
and blanketed northern China with fine particles," she said.

<HEADLINE> N.Z. Bosses Pocketing Big Salaries Despite Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Chief executives of big
companies in New Zealand often receive generous salaries bearing
little relationship to the sharply lower returns they generate for
shareholders, a research by the Australia-New Zealand Bank (ANZ)
showed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank estimated that 500 of New Zealand's biggest public and
private companies lost about 3.25 billion U.S. dollars of
shareholder wealth in 1998. Last year, the New Zealand sharemarket
's top 40 companies shed 600 million U.S. dollars in shareholder
value.
</P>
<P>
It also estimated that companies on the sharemarket's NZSE 40
index have shed seven billion U.S. dollars in shareholder value
since 1991, more than a quarter of the sharemarket's present total
value of 25 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But some chief executives of big companies in New Zealand can
still earn an annual salary of as high as more than one million U.
S. dollars, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
ANZ's head of corporate finance, Joseph Healy, said in the
research that the results raised important questions about the
caliber of corporate management, the structure of executive
remuneration and New Zealand's broader economic performance.
</P>
<P>
"It's a massive concern for the whole economy and needs to be
addressed," he said.

ANZ's research also highlights flaws in the remuneration
structures of many chief executives and other senior managers,
particularly in companies that have surrendered shareholder wealth
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Evidence suggested remuneration packages for chief executives
and other senior executives are "insensitive" to the creation of
shareholder wealth, Healy said.
</P>
<P>
"To pay high fixed salaries regardless of how well you have
governed shareholder funds is clearly a flaw in any sensible
governance structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Healy recommended setting up a working party of finance
industry and government representatives to consider better
guidelines for improved corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
"In essence, we believe that what we have is a structural
problem or a systemic failure in corporate governance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Calls for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala called for more foreign investment to help the land-
locked Himalayan kingdom achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-day trade promotion meeting starting on
Wednesday, Koirala said the Nepali government has been promoting
investment through a variety of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives
for local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nepal has made important progress in achieving
and maintaining macroeconomic stability and removing major
restrictions that had impeded the development of trade and
industry.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's economy is already quite liberal with almost no
barriers to international trade, a fairly open foreign investment
regime and deregulated interest rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
These reforms have made Nepal a much better place for trade and
investment compared with other South Asian countries, said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"You can choose anything you can invest in whatever sector you
desire," Koirala reassured the meeting's 450 participants from 34
countries.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to selected manufacturing and service industries,
tourism and water resources are the prominent areas of foreign
investment in Nepal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Koirala also told the meeting that his country has adopted the
"open sky"policy to attract more investment in its aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever export promotion meeting in Nepal was organized
by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce with the objectives of
promoting the country's tourism and foreign trade and attracting
more foreign investors.

<P>
LAGOS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will raise crude oil supply
to its full new OPEC quota from May, a report cited its source
close to the country's Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC) as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

million bpd as part of a late March deal by nine OPEC members to
raise supplies, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Maintains Overnight Call Rate at 5-Percent Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Korea announced Thursday
it will maintain the current overnight call rate at the 5-percent
level this month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it decided to maintain the level of 5
percent as there is little inflationary pressure even if the trade
surplus is shrinking and bond transactions are showing sluggish
performance.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, South Korean consumer prices
rose 1.5 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank will closely watch the real economy,
financial trends and domestic and foreign imbalances.
</P>
<P>
International crude oil prices have been falling because of
OPEC's decision to increase production while the downward trend of
won's value against the dollar has eased inflationary pressure,
Bank of Korea's Governor Chon Chol-hwan said.
</P>
<P>
This year will see stable market, but the rise of imports, rent,
utility fees and wages could become an obstacle next year and
thereafter, added the governor.

<HEADLINE> Russian Spacecraft Docks With Mir Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Soyuz TM spaceship with two
Russian cosmonauts docked with the Mir space station on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The docking occurred at shortly after 10.30 a.m. Moscow time (
0630 GMT) in a manual mode after the ground mission control failed
to do it in an automated mode.
</P>
<P>
The Soyuz spacecraft was launched Tuesday from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The two-member crew include flight commander Sergei Zaletin and
flight engineer Alexander Kaleri. Zaletin is on his first mission
to the 14-year-old station, but the mission is the third for
Kaleri.
</P>
<P>
The official duration of the current mission is 45 days but it
may be prolonged to 60 or 75 days if additional funding is found.
</P>
<P>
It is the first manned flight since Mir was put on auto-pilot a
year ago prior to its planned scrapping. Moscow decided to go
ahead with a new mission after securing 20 million U.S. dollars
from a group of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mir was to have been brought down this year by plunging it
toward earth and burning up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The task for Zaletin and Kaleri is to reactivate the station
and conduct maintenance operations and repairs on onboard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important and complicated tasks is to detect
tiny cracks from which air escapes from the station.
</P>
<P>
The leak of air, which led to a pressure drop in the station,
does not affect the safety of flights because air is disappearing
very slowly and can be compensated from the stores on Mir,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mission Control expressed the hope that at least the module
from which the air is leaking should be discovered. Even if the
escape of air is not stopped, it would be a very useful for the
future operation of the International Space Station now under
construction.
</P>
<P>
The crew also has to analyze the reliability of the station and
its capability to function. Any further decisions on Mir's use
will be made based on this analysis.
</P>
<P>
The cosmonauts will also conduct a series of scientific
experiments and make a space walk.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Progress M1-1 supply ship docked with Mir with
fuel and water. Zaletin and Kaleri are expected to receive another
Progress cargo spaceship in April.

A leading Chinese economist has suggested that western China
must initiate new ways for future development to suit the

The west should rely on markets instead of preferential
policies made by the central authorities, according to Chen Jiagui,
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Localities in the western regions should actively cultivate
their own markets and encourage all sectors of the economy
including the state-owned, collective, and private, the well-known
economist said.

-- Some 61.8 percent of the youths aged 19 to 24 in the country
cannot enter public colleges, providing an abundant source for non-
public colleges.
</P>
<P>
-- Many of the non-public colleges are located in small and
medium-sized cities and towns, convenient for rural youths.
</P>
<P>
-- Enrollment in non-public colleges is affordable to many
families. Loans from banks are available, same as to public
college students.
</P>
<P>
-- Diplomas granted by these colleges have the same status as
the public ones. The teaching staff mainly come from public
colleges, who seek a sideline. Therefore, the education received
there has almost the same quality as from public ones.

<HEADLINE> Thai Family Size Shrinking as Women Assert Authority: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- More Thai women are choosing to be
their own bread-winners and those who get married are now having a
major influence on determining the size of their family, the
Nation quoted a study as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Population Study Institute of
Chulalongkorn University, shows that women are becoming more
financially independent because they are getting a higher level of
education and tend to remain single or wait longer before getting
married.
</P>
<P>
Highly-educated women get well-paid jobs and think that having
children would result in a loss of working opportunities and
income, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Because women fear losing the opportunity of making money, they
decided to only have one or two children, causing the average Thai
family to be smaller than in the past.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that well-educated women tend to wait for
a longer period of time before they have the first child.
</P>
<P>
"Women's autonomy directly influences whether their families
decide to have a child or not," the study said.
</P>
<P>
The trend is expected to affect the rate of increase in the
country's population, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The birth rate is projected to fall from 1.8 percent annually
in 1992 to 1.1 percent, 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent in 2000, 2010
and 2020, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The study forecasts that the country's population would
increase from the present 62.4 million to 67.2 million and 70.5
million by 2010 and 2020, respectively.

<HEADLINE> China to Turn Population Burden Into Resources: Mini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 6 (Xinhua) - China's Minister of Education
Chen Zhili Thursday said here that China will transform its heavy
population burden into valuable human resources through innovation
and extensive education development.
</P>
<P>
Chen said this while delivering a speech on the topic of "
Innovation in Education for the 21st Century" at the 2nd APEC
Education Ministerial Meeting (AEMM) which opened here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China has made education a strategic priority in national
development and the government has drawn up a new blueprint for
educational reform and development, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 340 million people who are receiving
education and the illiteracy rate in the total population has
reduced from over 80 percent in 1949 to 14.5 percent in 1998, she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that giving top priority to basic education, China
will accomplish the goal of basic universalization of nine-year
compulsory education very soon.
</P>
<P>
In cities and economically developed areas, 12-year education
will be universalized step by step. The national level of
education will be raised and goals of education for all will be
accomplished, she said.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, the minister also talked about China's
innovation education approaches, including implementing quality-
oriented education, improving teaching quality, utilizing
information technology, restructuring education and linking
education with economy and society.
</P>
<P>
As the most dynamic region in terms of economic globalization
and technological progress, she said, the Asia-Pacific region is
faced with more challenging reform and innovation.
</P>
<P>
"The only choice we can make is to go with the trend of the
times, strengthen intellectual and economic co-operation between
member economies and meet the challenges together," she said.
</P>
<P>
The AEMM is scheduled to be held on Thursday and Friday.
Participants include some 150 ministers and senior officials from
the 21 APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) economies.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Japan's New PM Faces Host of Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Elected helmsman of the world's
second largest economy on Wednesday, new Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori is treading down a rough path. He is faced with a
series of challenges, including promoting Japan's economic
recovery and securing a victory in the coming general election for
his party, which will determine how long he will stay at his new
post.
</P>
<P>
Hours after being picked as chief of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), Mori was elected prime minister on
Wednesday afternoon by parliament to succeed the incapacitated
Keizo Obuchi, who has been in a coma since Sunday after suffering
a mass stroke.
</P>
<P>
Of the various challenges, the most difficult one for Mori
would be to maintain the current momentum of economic recovery,
which came after a 10-year-long slump thanks to his predecessor's
aggressive fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Well aware of the importance in entrenching the economic
recovery, Mori has vowed to adhere to Obuchi's economic policies
and listed economic rejuvenation as his top priority.
</P>
<P>
In a rare move taken by a new Japanese premier, Mori retained
all the 18 members of the Obuchi cabinet at a meeting on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The move showed that there will be no visible change in
policies of the former government, analysts said, adding that
consistency in economic policies also reflects the strong
aspiration of the country's economic circle.
</P>
<P>
With Japan's economy beginning to show signs of regaining
strength, the only option for Mori's administration seems to
execute the national budget for fiscal 2000, which started April 1,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mori will face the task of containing Japan's mounting
fiscal debts, which increased rapidly after Obuchi adopted an
aggressive fiscal policy to bridle the country's recession-bound
economy.
</P>
<P>
The combined long-term debts of Japan's central and local
governments are expected to reach 645 trillion yen (6.14 trillion
U.S. dollars) at the end of fiscal 2000, equivalent to 129.3
percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge Mori have to face is whether he can secure a
victory for the LDP in the coming general election to guarantee
the continued control of the lower house of parliament by the LDP
and its coalition allies, analysts say. A majority in the lower
house is vital for the government to pursue its policies to
rejuvenate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Mori also has to decide whether to dissolve the lower house for
an early election.
</P>
<P>
The general election must be held by October 19, when the term
for the incumbent lower house expires. But the LDP is now divided
over the timing of a new parliamentary poll.
</P>
<P>
After the election of Mori, a growing number of LDP members
called for an early dissolution of the lower house for a snap
parliamentary poll in the hope of taking advantage of public
sympathy currently mounting for ailing Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Before Obuchi fell ill, a lower house election had been widely
expected to be held after the July Okinawa summit of the Group of
Eight (G-8) most industrialized nations in the wake of a series of
scandals involving police, the Self-Defense Forces and a former
senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Many LDP members now, however, prefer an early election,
probably because they believe that Mori will not be strong enough
to lead the party to an easy victory if an election is held after
the G-8 summit when the voters' sympathy with Obuchi fades away,
said a LDP lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure, Mori on Wednesday night ruled out an
early general election, citing many remaining problems to deal
with. However, he failed to mention the timing of the election.
</P>
<P>
The new Japanese prime minister is also expected to face tests
on the diplomatic front. Mori, who has served the education,
international trade and industry, and construction portfolios, is
not known as an experienced hand at international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Imminent challenges for Mori include an informal visit to
Russia later this month at the invitation of Russian president-
elect Vladimir Putin, and the hosting of the prestigious G-8
summit in July.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia have not yet concluded a bilateral peace
treaty due to long-standing disputes over four Russian-held islets
off Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido. Many Japanese
prime ministers had striven to resolve the territorial issue since
they took office, but none succeeded. Mori, as his predecessors,
faces an uncertain future on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the daunting tasks ahead, Mori is believed to be
the right person, at least at this stage, to maintain economic and
political stability in Japan.
</P>
<P>
His role as LDP coordinator with coalition partners has put him
in a better position to work with the Komei Party and Conservative
Party, the LDP's new partner.
</P>
<P>
Mori held talks with leaders of both parties immediately after
his election as prime minister to secure a new three-party ruling
coalition, which ensures majority of the LDP-led bloc in both
houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
One of the LDP's important coalition partners, the Liberal
Party, broke away ahead of Obuchi's hospitalization.

<HEADLINE> IFC to Double Investment in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's private investment arm, will
more than double its investment in Sri Lanka to 200 million U.S.
dollars in the next 12 to 18 months, the official Daily News
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The increased investments will be mainly focused on the
financial sector of the country," IFC's South Asia Director
Bernard Pasquier was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is exploring the possibility of setting up an
investment bank dedicated to government and corporate debt
securities and is also working on new debenture issues to
diversify the issuer base, said Pasquier.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's current investment portfolio in Sri Lanka was 86.4
million dollars, covering projects in private power generation,
port operations, general manufacturing, tourism and the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Other areas it will invest this year are housing finance,
insurance, telecommunication, water supply, software development,
manufacturing for export, private education and healthcare, said
Pasquier.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka could achieve an economic growth rate of 10
percent if not for the 17-year-old ethnic conflict between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's economic fundamentals appeared good despite the
ongoing conflict but peace and security were prerequisites for
people to come, said Pasquier.
</P>
<P>
He said the current large scale outflow of money from the
Colombo Stock Exchange were due to "problems of confidence."

<HEADLINE> APEC Education Ministers Meet in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Education ministers from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies Thursday began
a two-day meeting here to discuss challenges facing education in
the new century.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the 2nd APEC Education Ministerial
Meeting (AEMM), Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong called for
preparing the young for the challenges of globalizaton and IT
revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The two most important driving forces behind the change are
globalization and the IT revolution," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Both these forces reinforce one another to impact people's
lives dramatically, he added.
</P>
<P>
As an inescapable trend, globalization is not only about
economy but also about the flows of people, ideas and knowledge,
Goh said.
</P>
<P>
"How successful our respective societies can cope with
globalization will depend on how our educational systems respond
to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said education must arm the young with necessary skills to
succeed in a new world of rapid change.
</P>
<P>
About 150 education ministers and senior officials from the 21
APEC economies are attending the AEMM.
</P>
<P>
The main theme for the second AEMM is "Education for Learning
Societies in the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The first AEMM was held in Washington D.C. in 1992 and the APEC
leaders decided in 1997 to hold the second AEMM in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Government Urged to Make Plans to Fight Child Prostitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Specialists in the Social Health
Ministry have demanded the government take measures to fight child
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Child prostitution is doing harm to children physically and
psychologically, which makes it a viable social target, said a
panel of the ministry in a report which was delivered to the
government early this month.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that the fight against child prostitution
involves many fields and governmental institutions, such as the
Foreign Ministry, Justice Ministry, and Ministry of Education. The
government should inspire all of society to rebuke child sex,
strengthen research on the effects of the sex market on society,
and amend relevant legislation.
</P>
<P>
The government should take efforts to make Finns aware that
child prostitution is criminal both in Finland and abroad, and
demand the tourism industry ban the exploitation of child sex,
since sexual abuse of children in tourism is becoming an
international issue.
</P>
<P>
Kindergartens and schools should intensify educating children
on how to prevent sex attacks, and build more safe and supervised
playgrounds to prevent children from being attacked, said the
report.

SAN JOSE, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Brazilian President
Fernando Enrique Cardoso and leaders from Central American
countries Wednesday vowed to enhance cooperation and regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
They called for closer ties in various aspects among these
countries, which urged more states in the region to sign a
framework accord on cooperation in trade and investment reached

<HEADLINE> Chile Has Absolute Judiciary Independence: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- As an appeals court hearing draws
near to decide whether former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet's
legal immunity is to be scrapped, Justice Minister Jose Antonio
Gomez said Wednesday that his country's judiciary has absolute
independence in making decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Every state power and every citizen have the obligation to
respect its decisions," said Antonio.
</P>
<P>
The Pinochet hearing, scheduled for April 12, will be broadcast
live on Chile's national television and other channels, the
Santiago Appeals Court announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990,
now enjoys legal immunity from criminal prosecution since he is
senator for life.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 criminal charges against Pinochet have been
presented so far by relatives of victims who were killed or went
missing during Pinochet's rule.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, were allowed to returned home on March 3, 2000,
after a 16-month detention in London pending a Spanish request to
have him extradited and tried for alleged human rights violations
against Spaniards during his rule.
</P>
<P>
After long-time wrangling, British Home Secretary Jack Straw
ruled that Pinochet was mentally and physically unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
Chilean authorities say that more than 3,000 people were
killed and over 1,000 others disappeared during Pinochet's
military rule.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chile's new President Ricardo Lagos
is trying to launch a constitutional reform aimed at ending the
practice of appointing senators for life.
</P>
<P>
Lagos told a news conference on Tuesday that he would ask
parliament to appoint a bicameral committee to study how to make
the constitution more representative and democratic.
</P>
<P>
Lagos is also demanding the restoration of presidential power
to dismiss the chief of the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia to Issue 243.9-Million-Dollar Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>

<P>
PRAGUE, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia will issue treasury bonds
of 10 billion Koruna (243.9 million U.S. dollars), authorities
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has set a 8.6 percent interest rate for the 5-
year bonds, which is the largest issue in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of treasury bonds seem to be the only way to help
the deficit-hit country recover from a sluggish economy, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of Slovakia's gross domestic product (GDP) has seen
a slowdown from 4.4 percent in 1998 to 1.9 percent in 1999,
coupled with a 16.7 percent drop in foreign investments and a 74
percent dive in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, last year's jobless rate and inflation rate
in the country reached a record high of 20.1 percent and 13
percent respectively, while the estimated government deficit this

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Trade Energy Products in Commodity Bourses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEF, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government decided
Wednesday to regulate the country's fuel market by allowing fuel
products to be traded in commodity bourses as of May 1, the media
reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision is meant to establish a pricing mechanism by
allowing prices to fluctuate in line with supply and demand in the
market, thus sharpening the competitive edge and preventing
bottlenecks in the fuel market, the Ukrainian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Next month, the trading of oil, natural gas and coal will be
moved into merchandise exchanges for public pricing, but the
sellers must be state-run enterprises or economic entities
controlling over 50 percent of their own shares, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
State-owned and confiscated energy products, and those used to
offset taxes will also be openly traded in bourses.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Economic Ministry will determine the bourses and
exchanges through public bidding to undertake the trading of fuel
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Lacking a transparent mechanism to fix market prices in this
sector, most trading in Ukraine are conducted by dickering or
chalking up. As a result, the country has lost vast financial
revenues and seen complicated debt relationships exist between
fuel traders.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Explore Proteins in Tumor Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at a U.S.
biotechnology company reported Wednesday the identification of a
key sequence that permits a protein to exit cancer cells and
stimulate blood vessel and tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
The protein is called fibroblast growth factor 2. This research
represents the first step toward characterizing a non-classical
protein trafficking pathway that the scientists dubbed "export,"
said Ciblex Corporation, the San Diego, California-based company
that made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
The findings were reported at the ongoing 91st American
Association for Cancer Research meeting in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Ciblex scientists also reported that blocking protein export
offers a new approach to combat cancer and other diseases, and may
lead to new drug discoveries.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, proteins are normally transported
out of a cell by virtue of having a special amino acid sequence
called a "leader peptide." The leader sequence acts as a signal
for the protein to enter the classical "secretion" pathway, which
routes proteins through cellular machinery called Golgi apparatus
and endoplasmic reticulum before being secreted outside the cell.
</P>
<P>
Certain disease-causing proteins, such as fibroblast growth
factor 2, do not have this leader peptide sequence and are
exported out of cells through an alternative, non-classical
pathway that bypasses the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum.
</P>
<P>
Using an experimental technique involving hybrids and brain
tumor cells, the scientists identified the unique region of the
protein sequence that is responsible for its alternative export
out of brain tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
There has been intense interest over the past few years
regarding the therapeutic value of secreted proteins as drug
targets, according to Ciblex.
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, we believe that our focus on the export pathway
will allow intervention at the earliest and possibly most
effective point -- before a disease-causing protein leaves the
cell and causes harm," said the company.
</P>
<P>
"We have begun to assign a molecular basis to this recently
discovered cellular pathway, and further characterization of the
export pathway should reveal completely novel targets for drug
discovery."

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Due to Arrive in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the
father of the six-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, who lives
with his relatives in Florida, will arrive in Washington on
Thursday to pick up his son, the attorney of the father announced
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The American attorney, Gregory Craig, who traveled to Cuba on
Tuesday to meet with Juan Gonzalez, told reporters that the father
would make a statement upon his arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for this reunion to go forward, and he (Juan
Gonzalez) ... is prepared to stay here -- until he has achieved
that objective," Craig said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has granted a visa for the father and
five others including Elian's kindergarten teacher in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department last week demanded Elian's relatives in
Florida to promise to surrender Elian if they lose their court
fight and said that it would end the custody of the boy by Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled earlier
this year that the boy belongs to his father and should be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle in Florida filed a political asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuban politicians in the U.S.,
asked the boy to stay in the United States.

relations status.
</P>
<P>
Hastert said he set the timetable after consulting with the
White House and looked forward to working with President Bill
Clinton to build support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to ultimate victory," he said. "This will have
to be a bipartisan effort."
</P>
<P>
Hastert said the bill gives the United States a chance to break
down barriers and build up trust between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has long called for an early vote on the China trade
issue, one of the top priorities of his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the legislation are concerned that a delay in the
vote will complicate the case and make the bill difficult to clear
the House because of intense political fighting in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
The bill is opposed by organized labor, environmental groups
and some conservative organizations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton welcomed Hastert's move, saying, "This is very good
news."
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank the speaker and the leadership of the House
for doing this, and I assure you I will do what I can to pass it,"
said Clinton.

Over the past ten years, the provincial government has made
great efforts on afforestation and environmental protection,
according to an official with provincial forestry bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province's forestry cover grew from 36 percent over a
decade ago to 47.7 percent by the end of 1999, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The province has issued regulations banning logging and
commercial wood trading, and carried out many tree-planting
projects to improve eco-system and control soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province will invest 168 million yuan in
afforestation, construction of shelterbelts and turning former
wastelands into greenery, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Habitats of Giant Pandas Shrinking: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Habitats of giant pandas in China
are shrinking and degenerating, latest surveys made by China's
State Forestry Administration (SFA) and the World Wildlife Fund (
WWF) have shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in Qingchuan County of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, the home to the rare black and white bear, found
that the habitat area was only two thirds of that a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Another investigation launched by the Sichuan Provincial
Department of Forestry and the WWF in 1998 in Pingwu County also
disclosed serious problems in panda protection, such as
degeneration of habitats and the decline of population density of
pandas.
</P>
<P>
To protect the endangered animal, China has set up 33 nature
reserves, covering a total area of 1.6 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Specialists' estimation, based on a national survey ten years
ago, put the number of pandas living in the wild to 1,114. But the
current figure remains unclear until a new round of investigation
will be completed by June, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The SFA announced late last month that it would launch the
third national survey from this month, together with the WWF, a
long-term partner with the Chinese government in panda protection.
</P>
<P>
The survey, including 55 counties in Sichuan and northwestern
Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and covering an area of more than 22
million hectares, will determine the exact number of giant pandas
living in the wild and in zoos.

JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign exchange
reserves increased by 1.43 billion U.S. dollars to 18.51 billion
dollars in the week ending on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to revenue from oil exports, and
drawing on a loan from the Japan Export-Import Bank and Japan Bank
for International Cooperation (JBIC), according to a press release
issued by the central bank, Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Gross foreign exchange reserves, which are net reserves plus
outstanding foreign exchange contracts, also increased by 1.42
billion dollars to 29.73 billion dollars, the press release was

<HEADLINE> IMF Optimistic Indonesia Can Achieve Reform Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) was optimistic the Indonesian government would be able to
settle the programs in the Letter of Intent (LoI) targeted in
April.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the LoI will be settled in April, as I noticed that
vast progress has been achieved, but it all depends on the
management of the economics ministers," IMF's chief representative
in Indonesia John Dodsworth was quoted by the Antara News Agency
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has previously postponed the disbursement of the loan
amounting to 400 million U.S. dollars until May, as many programs
laid down in the LoI had not been completed by the Indonesian
government.
</P>
<P>
The reform programs include getting under way the
recapitalization of state Bank Negara Indonesia and completing
recapitalization of Bank Mandiri, recently set up by merging four
troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie said that almost all the programs in the
LoI signed on January 15 this year had been completed.
</P>
<P>
He said of the many programs, some will be completed on April 8,
while others on April 15.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is the dates, which are the result of
bargaining between us and the IMF," he was quoted by Antara as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Stem Flood of Imported Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Logistics
Board (Bulog) and the Customs Office have decided that starting
this week imported rice can enter the domestic market only after
passing a tight selection in regard to their volume and quality.
</P>
<P>
"Bulog and the Customs Office have agreed that rice imports
should pass the 'red channel' (tight inspection)," Bulog chief
Rizal Ramli was quoted by the Antara News Agency Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramli, the measure's purpose is to stem the flood
of imported rice that has caused the price of domestic farmers'
unhusked rice to drop.
</P>
<P>
He said the measure was necessary as several rice production
centers in Indonesia were expected to enjoy grand harvests so that
there would be an abundance of rice in the market.
</P>
<P>
As long as the flow of rice imports continued, he said,
whatever Bulog would do to reverse the decline in the price of
domestic farmers' rice would not be effective.
</P>
<P>
Ramli pointed out the measure would be temporary in nature and
would be evaluated after grand harvest time was over.
</P>
<P>
To reduce rice imports, the Bulog had also decided to
renegotiate contracts for the importation of 175,000 tons of rice
which Bulog had made through an auction early this year.
</P>
<P>
Bulog would also renegotiate an agreement on the procurement of
17,000 tons of rice from the World Food Programme.
</P>
<P>
Bulog had to resort to postponement of rice imports because
this year's grand harvest was expected to be successful and
domestic need for rice could be met by domestic production, Ramli
said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, now Latin America's

<HEADLINE> Plan Needed to Secure Safe World Blood Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- To secure a totally safe and
reliable blood supply, countries across the world should eliminate
paying donors and improve blood screening technologies, said a
famous doctor from the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday interview here, Dr. David Brandling Bennett,
vice director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), said
between five and ten percent of HIV infections worldwide are
transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood
products.
</P>
<P>
Besides HIV, the major diseases that can be transmitted by
contaminated blood are hepatitis B and C, syphilis, malaria and
Chagas disease, the vice director said.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report to be
released on April 7, unsafe transfusions and unclean injection
practices each year cause an estimated 8 to 16 million hepatitis B
virus infections, 2.3 to 4.7 million hepatitis C virus infections,
and 80,000 to 160,000 HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
As WHO's regional organization, the Washington D.C.-
headquartered PAHO has expended great effort in Latin-American
countries advocating volunteer blood donations, and has helped
improve blood-testing technologies in this region.
</P>
<P>
However, paid donors are still commonly seen in Latin America
and Caribbean countries, where Dr. Bennett said laws banning such
practices are necessary.
</P>
<P>
April 7 is World Health Day (WHD) and the theme for this year's
WHD is "Safe blood starts with me." It highlights the highly
unbalanced situation in the world today with regard to blood
supply. Specialists believe that blood supply and blood
transfusion services are still very low on the agenda of national
public health authorities in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The WHO says safe blood is blood that does not contain any
viruses, parasites, drugs, alcohol, chemical substances or other
extraneous factors that might cause harm, danger or disease to the
recipient.

BRASILIA, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Brazil and

country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Japan, which has strong trade ties with Indonesia,
is particularly interested in the stabilization of East Timor,
where bloody violence occurred last year. Australian-led multi-

country gained independence.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Back Tanzania's Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank Wednesday agreed to support a
comprehensive debt reduction package for Tanzania under the
enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Total relief from all of Tanzania's creditors is worth more
than 2 billion U.S. dollars, which is equivalent to more than half
of the net present value of the total outstanding after the full
use of traditional debt relief mechanisms, the IMF said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank's International Development
Association (IDA) will start providing interim relief in April.
</P>
<P>
The assistance committed by the IMF, amounting to 152 million
dollars, will be delivered over a 10-year period, and will cover
an average 58 percent of Tanzania's debt-service obligations to
the IMF. The debt relief provided by the IDA, totaling 1.2 billion
dollars, will be spread over a period of 20 years, covering 69.1
percent of the east African country's debt-service obligations to
IDA.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will receive the bulk of the assistance under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative when it satisfies a number of conditions,
including adoption and implementation of a participatory poverty
reduction strategy paper, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the IMF also approved a three-year loan of 181.
5 million dollars for Tanzania under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility to support the government's 2000-2002 economic
program.
</P>
<P>
The first annual loan, equivalent to 80.7 million dollars, will
be available in three installments, with 26.9 million dollars
available immediately.

<HEADLINE> One Million Smokers to Participate in Quit and Win in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth international "Quit and Win" competition is an "
explicitly positive message for smokers," said Puska, professor of
the Finnish National Public Health Institute, told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Contestants may win one of the prizes, but by quitting
cigarettes they win out over tobacco and all the harm it causes,"
he said. "Everyone who quits is a winner."
</P>
<P>
Coordinated by the Finnish Health Institute and backed by the
World Health Organization, the Quit and Win campaign has
mushroomed since it started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000 smokers from 13 countries participated in the
initiative. In 1996, some 70,000 smokers in 25 countries took part
in the contest. Two years later, 200,000 smokers in 48 countries
participated.
</P>
<P>
Participants are smokers aged 18 or over. They are allowed to
use pharmacological aids throughout the four-week contest. Winners
are required to take a test to confirm their abstinence from
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 competitions will be held all over the world this
year, and among them 67 are being conducted at the national level,
with the rest being done at the local or regional level.
</P>
<P>
Winners of these awards will advance to a draw for one
international prize of 10,000 U.S. dollars and six regional prizes
of 2,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The prizes will be awarded on August 29 at a global heath
exposition in Hanover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 1.2 billion tobacco smokers around the
world. Each year about 4 million people die from smoking-related
diseases. The death toll is expected to jump to 10 million over
the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of smokers want to quit, but many find it is
too difficult for them to do it alone. For this Quit and Win
competition has been organized and it has grown rapidly in
popularity as a practical international quit-smoking contest,
thanks to its unique and positive approach to the major health
threat.

NANJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Twentsche Kabel Holding Co.,
the famous optical fiber manufacturer in the Netherlands, has
recently added 10 million U.S. dollars of investment in its
business in this capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The Twentsche (Nanjing) Fiber Optics Ltd went into operation
last year with an initial capital injection of 30 million U.S.
dollars. The high-tech plant now has an annual capacity of one
million km long optical fibers.
</P>
<P>
The demand for its products is growing as a result of China's
fast telecommunications development. In response, the Dutch
company has added investment for production expansion of the plant
and building facilities for producing optical fiber preforms,
which is expected to make it the second producer of the telecom
materials in China.
</P>
<P>
The Twentsche has another two plants, one in Zhangjiagang,
Jiangsu and the other in Yantai City of east China's Shandong
Province. Its investment in Jiangsu has topped 80 million U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Expert: China's Software Industry Needs Int'l Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The rapid growth of the global
software industry has provided China with excellent chances to
develop its software industry, but it needs international
cooperation for this.
</P>
<P>
Jin Hui, director of the Xi'an Software Industry Park, made
this remark at an evaluation of the park's performance in the less
than one year since it was set up.
</P>
<P>
He said the park had earned two billion yuan (about 240 million
US dollars) and exported two million US dollars-worth of products
by the end of last year, only six months after it had been set up,
in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We attribute our good performance to extensive cooperation
with foreign software enterprises," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
China's software industry has developed rapidly in recent years,
with software companies emerging across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi provincial capital city of Xi'an alone has more
than 300 software companies at present, and is expected to have
over 1,500 companies in four years.
</P>
<P>
But all these companies are small-sized, half of them having
fewer than 50 employees.
</P>
<P>
Jin said the limited scale of local companies is the major
hindrance to the development of China's software industry, and
only through cooperation with large foreign counterparts can China
's software industry develop properly.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Glass Industry Technical Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth China International
Glass Industrial Technical Exhibition (China glass 2000) opened in
Beijing Wednesday, with more than 300 glass companies from 18
countries including Germany, Italy and France participating.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the exhibition, co-sponsored
by the Chinese Ceramic Society and the China National Association
for Glass Industry, will last three days until Friday.
</P>
<P>
"China's glass industry has developed rapidly since the
adoption of the reform and opening-up policies in 1978," Jiang
Donghua, vice-president of the Chinese Ceramic Society, said at
the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The flat glass output jumped from 17.8 million boxes in 1979 to
179 million boxes in 1999, ranking it first worldwide.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, China had 330 flat glass mills with some 500
production lines and an annual production capacity of 215 million
boxes.
</P>
<P>
According to Hao Zhenhua of the State Administration of
Building Materials Industry, small glass factories played a role
in local economic development, but their outdated technology, high
energy consumption, low productivity and poor quality had a
negative impact on the economy's sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, products manufactured by the majority of the small
glass factories were not up to the standards set by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
Hao's bureau shut down some small glass mills with an annual
production of 150,000 boxes of glass in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Traffic Prompts Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Fewer parents will be seen waiting
to pick up their child from Haidian Experimental Primary School as
a result of a new project launched yesterday to ensure safety for
children who walk home alone.
</P>
<P>
Though the project was kicked off in Beijing, it will be
carried out in 36 large cities, senior officials with the
Communist Youth League of China was quoted by China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-graders like Yang Chengjie walked home alone for the
first time without parental escort.
</P>
<P>
"I will go home by myself today," said the pupil yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Youth League, the Ministry of Education and
Ministry of Public Security, the project also educates students on
common knowledge of traffic rules. Students will also wear yellow
hats for safety and carry signs that caution drivers to stop or
slow down.
</P>
<P>
More and more schools are also posting additional police
outside school gates, said Gao Yanming, director of the After-
Class Education Division with the Youth League.
</P>
<P>
"The project aims to build a better environment for children,
raise their awareness and ability of self-protection," said Li
Yong, a senior official with the League.
</P>
<P>
As part of the project, traffic police will be invited as after-
class speakers to teach students traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
The project came in response to increased concern from parents
about the frequent traffic accidents occurring in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, at least 80,000 people died in traffic related
accidents and 286,000 were injured, according to official
statistics.

<HEADLINE> "Most Polluting Firms in China Up to Discharge Requirements" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-one percent of China's
polluting firms had met the official pollutant discharge
requirements by the end of 1999, up 14 percentage points over six
months previously.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics from the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA), the progress was
made as local governments across China are trying hard to make all
of the country's 234,200 polluting firms meet the requirements set
by the central and local governments by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Following more than 18 years of two-digit economic growth, the
Chinese government decided in 1996 that all polluting firms meet
pollutant discharge requirements by the end of 2000, in order to
halt the worsening environmental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the progress is uneven among the country'
s rich east and poor central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last December, 88 percent of polluting
industrial firms in east China, 74 percent in central China and 49
percent in the west had met the requirements.
</P>
<P>
China has shut down over 65,000 polluting firms, mostly small
ones, over the past three years to protect the environment and
save natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Industrial firms which fail to meet the requirements by the
deadline face revocation of their production licenses, close-down,
economic sanctions such as fines or suspension of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been encouraging clean industrial
production and use of cleaner energy, such as natural gas and
cleaner coal, in its energy and communications sectors over the
past four years.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Issues Breakaway Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Managing director of English
premier league soccer club Chelsea Colin Hutchinson issued a
warning on Wednesday that UEFA and FIFA could face a breakaway of
leading clubs if they persuaded the European Union to change its
stance on the Bosman Ruling.
</P>
<P>
The controversial ruling, adopted by the EU in 1995, gave
players freedom of movement at the end of their contracts and
swept away limits on foreign players previously imposed by the
soccer authorities.
</P>
<P>
But Hutchinson, writing in the match program in the first leg
of a Champions League quarter-final match between Chelsea and
Barcelona at Stamford Bridge, said the law should not be
challenged.
</P>
<P>
UEFA and FIFA have asked the EU to be allowed to re-impose a
limit of five non-nationals playing in a domestic team. Chelsea
have twice fielded starting line-ups this season containing no
British players.
</P>
<P>
"Such a move would fly in the face of EU law. Why should the EU
treat football differently from any other industry or sport?"
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
"Imagine the outcry if the request is ratified: Brussels will
be bogged down with legal challenges. It is strange and worrying
that FIFA and UEFA should make such representations to the EU
without consulting the clubs.
</P>
<P>
"Equally the (English) FA and Premier League have not sought
views."
</P>
<P>
He said that UEFA were "given a fright" when Media Partners
considered a breakaway European Super League and added: "Don't
rule out further talk of a breakaway if top clubs are asked to
dismantle -- even if it is phased in -- teams constructed within
EU law."
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson continued: "The quality of football in this country
has never been higher. Since Bosman it has risen to previously
unobtainable heights and is now the envy of Europe. This would not
have been possible without the influx of foreigners. To restrict
to five would be the biggest own goal in recent times."
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter, UEFA president Lennart Johansson
and other senior soccer administrators are due to meet high-
ranking EU officials in Strasbourg next Wednesday as they continue
to lobby European law-makers to overturn the Bosman ruling.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Beats Barcelona in Champions League  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Chelsea produced one of their finest ever European performances
Wednesday evening to take a shock 3-1 lead over Spanish giants
Barcelona in their Champions League quarter-final first leg match.
</P>
<P>
The damage was done to Barcelona, who did not lose a match this
season, in eight glorious first-half minutes as the home side went
3-0 up through their two frontmen.
</P>
<P>
Gianfranco Zola led the way with a superb free-kick and strike
partner Tore Andre Flo added two swift goals to leave the Catalans
reeling.
</P>
<P>
Luis Figo then brought Barcelona back into the tie in the
second half with a crucial away goal.
</P>
<P>
But the west London side, whose defence was in formidable form
throughout, are still well placed to wrap up a famous upset in the
return leg in Spain on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona started brighter but the match tipped Chelsea's way
in the 30th minute after Figo was adjudged to have deliberately
handled two meters outside his own penalty area. That not only
earned him a booking from German referee Markus Merk but also led
to his side going behind.
</P>
<P>
Zola took advantage of a huge gap left by goalkeeper Ruud Hesp
and his defensive wall to curl the ball perfectly into the back of
the net for the opening goal.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later Chelsea breached the Barcelona defence again
when former Barcelona defender Albert Ferrer broke and found Zola
on the right. He cut the ball back for Tore Andre Flo, who pushed
ahead of his marker Abelardo to sidefoot home.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea made it 3-0 after 38 minutes when Didier Deschamps sent
Flo clear with a high bouncing volleyed pass and the tall
Norwegian lobbed it over the stranded Hesp for his 17th goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona re-organised after the break with Finnish striker
Jari Litmanen replacing Carles Puyol and Barcelona gradually
regained their composure. They kept the tie alive when Rivaldo
slipped his marker Ferrer for about the first time in the match
after 64 minutes and crossed to Figo who steered it home.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea and Valencia on Way to Champions League Semis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Spanish soccer club Valencia and
English team Chelsea each laid down a solid foundation for a
second leg match for a Champions League semi-final place with
dominating victories in the first leg actions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Valencia, boosted by a fine hat-trick from Gerard Lopez,
hammered Italian giant Lazio 5-2 while Chelsea beat Barcelona 3-1
in a classy encounter at Stamford Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Valencia's victory in an exciting game gave the lie to London
betting that made the Spanish club 16-1 outsiders to land the
trophy.
</P>
<P>
Two goals in the first three minutes set Valencia on their way
and when Gerard completed his hat-trick they were 4-1 ahead.
</P>
<P>
A late flurry gave Lazio some hope when Marcelo Salas scored
but an injury-time goal from Claudio Lopez restored Valencia's
comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
Salas said: "It's difficult to explain a match like this where
we were two goals down within a couple of minutes...but we're not
out yet. Losing like this is obviously bad but we can still do it.
"
</P>
<P>
An eight-minute golden spell from Chelsea put them 3-0 up after
38 minutes against Barcelona with two goals from Tore Andre Flo
and one from Gianfranco Zola.
</P>
<P>
But Barcelona fought back well to create a series of chances
and the away goal, scored by the omnipresent Luis Figo in the
64th minute, could be a critical one when the two sides meet in
the return leg on April 18.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday in the other quarter-finals, Manchester United drew
0-0 away to Real Madrid while Bayern Munich also drew, 1-1 at
Porto.
</P>
<P>
With the draw for the semi-final already determined, the
winners of Tuesday's ties play each other in the last four as do
the winners of Wednesday's ties.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals are due to be played in the first two weeks of
May.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Hit Back over Link-up Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman English premier league
soccer club Leeds Peter Ridsdale has dismissed the Football League
's concerns at his club's proposed link-up with Oldham.
</P>
<P>
The Elland Road club announced on Tuesday that they were
planning to buy a 9.9% stake in the second division club.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan Leeds would help Oldham set up a center of
excellence for developing young players. The Premiership club
would then have first call on any promising teenagers to emerge
from the academy.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement gets around a rule that prevents clubs signing
under-16-year-olds who live outside a 90-minute radius.
</P>
<P>
But Football League spokesman John Neagle hinted that the
organisation might stop the project going ahead.
</P>
<P>
"The League's board are set to meet in the next 10-12 days and
the matter will be discussed then," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"We have not given our consent and if necessary have the power
to prevent it happening. The whole issue will need to be examined
and we will be contacting Leeds and Oldham," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Ridsdale warned the league that if the plan was blocked,
Leeds would still look into setting up a center in Lancashire.
</P>
<P>
"If this was stopped from going through the only people who
would lose out would be Oldham," the Leeds chairman told the
Yorkshire Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
"We could set up a center of excellence right on their doorstep.
Is that what the Football League really wants?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> McManaman Back in the Hunt for Euro 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 5 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan said Steve McManaman is back in the reckoning for a place
in England's European Championship squad, following his superb
display for Real Madrid against Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
McManaman's form at Real has been erratic and he has not
appeared for his country since the goalless clash against Poland
last September.
</P>
<P>
However, Keegan was hugely impressed with the ex-Liverpool
winger's display against Sir Alex Ferguson's side on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I thought he did excellently. He was the best outfield player
on the pitch," Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
"He and Mark Bosnich were the men of the match. Everything he
did was like the old McManaman. He's had a new haircut, I don't
know if that's helped, but he was running at people and committing
them," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
"That's something he hasn't done lately. He was looking all the
time to be positive and his first target was to get into the box.
I've played him before and, to be fair to him, I've played him out
of position sometimes. His form for Madrid this year hasn't been
good, but against United, you saw a Steve McManaman who saw it as
a big game, wanted to perform and wanted to show people back here -
hopefully someone like myself - that he's still got something to
offer for England," he added.
</P>
<P>
Keegan has already indicated that 17 or 18 names in his 22-man
squad are fixed in his mind, and McManaman is probably one of a
number of players contesting the final four or five places.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Hits North Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone "Hudah" from the Mozambique
Channel on Wednesday stroke the coast of the north Mozambican
Province of Nampula.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in Moma and Angoche towns, the high winds
associated with the cyclone were felt as from early Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Angoche civil servant Paulina Gama said that, as from 7 A.M.,
the winds were accompanied by heavy rain, that, as the day wore
on, increased in intensity.
</P>
<P>
The winds have damaged flimsy homes in poor Angoche suburb of
lnguri, which is the most populous part of the town, and knocked
down some electricity poles.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the danger of electrocution from fallen cables, the
power supply to the town has been switched off.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambique News Agency, In Moma about 100
kilometers further south, a source in the telecommunications
company, TDM, said that there was intermittent rainfall, but the
winds were not very strong.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of wind since early morning, and with the
rain that's continuing to fall, there can be some damage," he
said.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no deaths or injuries reported from either
district.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Meteorology Institute (INAM), Angoche
is indeed in the path of the storm.
</P>
<P>
A statement from INAM said that the main force of the cyclone
will hit the Angoche coast on Wednesday night, with winds of up to
100 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted to move southwards and inland, hitting Moma and
the neighboring district of Mogovolas as well as Pebane in the
neighboring province of Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday afternoon, the cyclone will be over the interior
districts of upper Zambezia, INAM forecast .

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt to Help Solve Telkom-AT&AMP;T Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI) is trying to help solve a dispute
between the country's telephone giant, Telkom, and the U.S.-based
telecommunications company, AT&AMP; T.
</P>
<P>
Tshidiso Matona, DTI's director of foreign trade relations,
said South Africa and the U.S. were bilaterally addressing the
matter in the Trade and Investment Framework, a forum which
entertains trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T is accusing Telkom of breaching the World Trade
Organization (WTO) agreement by denying additional bandwidth to
AT&AMP;T. It has set a June 15 as deadline for "cooperative" dispute
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Matona said: "AT&AMP;T has no standing in the WTO. We are talking
with the U. S. government with regard to this matter. We are aware
of the allegations that AT&AMP;T has made and we do not concur with
them."  Telkom claimed that it is losing an estimated one
billion rand (about 153 million U.S. dollars) per annum as a
result of illegal activities, including the resale of facilities
by Value Added Networks (VAN).
</P>
<P>
It said AT&AMP;T failed to confirm that they were not reselling
these services.
</P>
<P>
Victor Moche, group executive of government relations at
Telkom, accused AT&AMP;T of circumventing South Africa's regulatory
regime.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in breach of any agreement. Telkom is the exclusive
supplier in South Africa of specified services and with that
status comes the very significant obligation of providing the
people of South Africa with 2.85 million new telephone lines over
a five-year period. This is an enormous and costly task which
Telkom is already successfully delivering on," Moche was quoted
as saying by South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Matona added: "In our opinion based on the examination of
issues involved, I think Telkom is acting within the law. AT&AMP;T and
the U.S. government will have to demonstrate more convincing
arguments that Telkom is contravening either the domestic law or
its commitment in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria High Court and the South African
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (SATRA) earlier ruled
against AT&AMP;T's request.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Push Hard for PNTR with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a speech to a local technology company in Massachusetts
State, Albright said America has a profound economic interest in a
China that opens its vast market and takes its place in a global
trading system based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"We have an abiding security interest in seeing a China that
contributes to the stability in the Asia Pacific and plays a
constructive role in world affairs," she said.
</P>
<P>
All of these interests will be served if Congress makes the
right decision now on PNTR and all will be set back if PNTR is
rejected, she said.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the issue before Congress is whether America
will share in the economic benefits, or leave those benefits
entirely to U.S. competitors in Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"For America to benefit under WTO rules, we must give China the
same permanent normal trading status that we grant to the more
than 130 other countries who belong to that organization," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat
said the vote on PNTR is "perhaps the most important international
economic issue facing this Congress".
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a testimony before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs
and Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Export and
Trade Promotion.
</P>
<P>
"Passing PNTR merely ensures that we reap the full benefits of
our bilateral agreements with China and its accession to the WTO,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said by granting PNTR to China, the U.S. would get
unprecedented new access to China's market for exports of American
goods and services, with benefits for American workers, farmers
and companies.
</P>
<P>
WTO accession provides a powerful impetus for China's economic
reforms at a critical juncture, he said.
</P>
<P>
"PNTR advances our broader national interests by promoting a
more responsible and constructive role for the Chinese state, both
at home and abroad," he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Nuclear Plant Bosses Admit Safety Breach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
admitted breaching safety regulations on Thursday after it pleaded
guilty in court to a safety lapse last year at its Sellafield
plant that left three workers with acid burns.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest in a catalogue of safety scares to
dog the company in recent months. They have forced the government
to delay its plans for a part-privatisation and drawn
international calls for Sellafield's closure.
</P>
<P>
The men sustained burns when seven cubic meters of highly
corrosive concentrated nitric acid escaped from a valve in March
last year.
</P>
<P>
British Nuclear Fuels plc and BNFL Engineering Limited pleaded
guilty at Whitehaven Magistrates' Court, Cumbria, to failing to
ensure the safety of workers during commissioning and maintenance
work in the Low Active Effluent Management Group Plant.
</P>
<P>
BNFL Plc and BNFL Engineering Limited have since carried out an
internal inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The case followed a series of controversies which have called
the future of the Cumbrian plant into question.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an international campaign was launched to shut down
Sellafield on environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
BNFL last year admitted data on plutonium destined for Japan
had been falsified, and is still reeling from the sabotage in
March of robotic tools at Sellafield, which it admits has put the
plant's future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Ireland and Denmark have both called on the British government
to close Sellafield down, complaining radioactive discharges from
the plant are polluting the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
And environmental activists Greenpeace said last month an as
yet unfinished and unpublished OECD study it obtained showed
reprocessing plants like Sellafield exposed the public to higher
doses of radiation than storing nuclear waste.

<HEADLINE> Arrival of Elian's Father "Positive Step" -- White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration said
Thursday that the arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez was a "positive
step" for the reunion of father with his son Elian, who is now in
the hand of his distant relatives in Florida.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president and the administration believe that this
is a positive step towards, ultimately, reuniting a father with
his son. That's what the courts have ruled. The father coming here
is a constructive way to facilitate that process," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a shipwreck last November and is now under
the custody of his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, has now become
the focus of four-month-old disputes between his father and Cuban
relatives who insisted his return home in Cuba and Florida's
distant relatives who, backed by some U.S. anti-Cuba politicians,
refused to obey the ruling of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to immediately send the six-year-old
boy back home.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the reunion process should be "fair, orderly and
prompt."
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that President Bill Clinton and his
administration would steer clear of the inflammatory dispute. He
said this was something that the president believed "should be
kept out of politics and should be done based on what the facts
were and what the law is."
</P>
<P>
The position of the Clinton administration shows that, while
expressing support to the INS ruling, it was cautious not to be
involved in the dispute to hamper would-be Democrats' presidential
candidate, Al Gore, in his campaign against Republicans'
presumptive presidential nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
"He (Clinton) stated very directly at the press conference last
week that this is something that should be done not on the basis
of political views, but on the basis of the facts and the law,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Vice President Gore, who broke with Clinton over
the Elian case by endorsing legislation to make the boy a
permanent U.S. resident, has not lobbied the president on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Juan Miguel told reporters upon arrival in Washington earlier
in the day that he wanted to express his "deepest gratitude" to
Americans for supporting him and his efforts to get Elian back
home.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized his relatives and some anti-Cuba elements
for exploiting his son and gain "political advantage" from his
family tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"It's been an agonizing experience to see my son submitted to
cruel psychological pressures," Juan Miguel said, noting that his
son had been forced to live for 137 days with "some distant
relatives who have never seen him before."

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes at British Army base in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one was hurt in the early morning blast at the perimeter of
the Ebrington Barracks in the staunchly nationalist city of
Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
It was the second bomb attack on an army base in the British
province in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack is part of a build-up to an offensive by
dissident republicans. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said,
it appeared that the attack on Ebrington barracks in Londonderry
was part of a wider campaign by dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The bomb contained five pounds of homemade explosives which
went off inside the perimeter fence.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told BBC that "There have been a number of incidents
recently which have been attributed to dissident republicans. This
may be another one."
</P>
<P>
Later on Thursday, the police found timing devices and
detonators in Derry. They were discovered during a security
operation after men were seen running away from a car.
</P>
<P>
It is not known if it is connected to the attack on Ebrington
barracks about three miles away.
</P>
<P>
The attack heightened fears of a developing campaign by former
IRA terrorists opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has told the Irish parliament
he believed dissident republicans were responsible for the bomb. "
I would take the opportunity to unreservedly condemn the bomb," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The governments in London and Dublin are still trying to inject
momentum into the stalled Northern Ireland peace process before
Easter in order to reinstate the suspended political institutions.
</P>
<P>
Police in the city also went on high alert after a bag
containing detonators and timers was found in a Roman Catholic
area hours after the explosion at the base, which senior officers
said was caused by a five-pound (2.2 kg) bomb.
</P>
<P>
In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said the
incident showed there was "clearly a need for vigilance" on the
part of police and security forces.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility but pro-British Protestant
politicians warned of a return to concerted attacks by renegade
republicans.
</P>
<P>
Despite heightened security concerns before the queen's visit
on April 12 to honor the mainly Protestant Royal Ulster
Constabulary police force, Buckingham Palace and the Northern
Ireland Office said there were no plans to cancel the trip.
</P>
<P>
The one-day visit to Belfast by Britain's head of state came at
a tense time for Northern Ireland, with its peace process bogged
down and its fledgling home-rule government suspended over the
lack of guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein -- the political ally of the Irish Republican Army,
which has suspended its guerrilla war against British rule but
made no moves on a weapons handover -- said the bombing was "an
attempt to raise tensions at a critical period".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein said it had no idea who was responsible but asserted
that London's suspension of the home-rule assembly had created a
vacuum which opponents of peace "will attempt to fill with acts
such as those we have seen this morning".
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's main guerrilla forces are holding to
ceasefires after three decades of sectarian conflict that left 3,
600 people dead but the peace process is in virtual paralysis over
the question of when and if they will hand in weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
A EU spokesman announced that it is a preparatory round to
establish groups of work, the logistics and the calendar of
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The working groups will discuss industrial and agricultural
assets, rules or origin, safeguards, antidumping, services,
investments and copyright, public markets, and competence,
following the model of the negotiation for the free trade
agreement signed with Mexico in March.
</P>
<P>
Talks of customs tariffs applied to the agriculture sector,
which will be the most conflictive, will start in the year 2001,
without setting a date for the conclusion of the free trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur and the EU decided in June of 1999 to start talks for
a free trade agreement in a progressive and reciprocal way,
without excluding any sector, and in agreement with the World
Trade Organization (WTO) guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur-EU meetings will be held three times a year and
the next will be in June or July in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
According to European sources, the EU is Mercosur main trade
partner in goods and investments, of which the global value
increased from 18.9 billion euros in 1990 to 42 billion euros in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three percent of Mercosur total imports originate in the
EU countries, and 30 percent of its exports went also to the EU in
1998. The EU trade surplus was 6.5 billion euros in 1998.
</P>
<P>
EU direct foreign investments in the Mercosur countries went
from 650 million dollars in 1993 to 8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>

Mercosur is composed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguy and Uruguay,
with Bolivia and Chile as associate members.

The Bank's decision will be greeted with relief by businesses

The British Chambers of Commerce said the rate decision was

Policy Committee has considered fully its verdict on the
inflationary consequences of the chancellor's recent Budget."

The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the rate freeze.
Digby Jones, its director general, said it was "the right decision

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican Legislators Push Gun Law Enforcement Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Republican lawmaker Bill McCollum,
chairman of the House Judiciary crime subcommittee, would provide
100 million U.S. dollars in grants over five years to states
imposing a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence, without
parole, for anyone who uses or carries a firearm during a violent
or serious drug-trafficking crime.
</P>
<P>
McCollum said the bill combined the proven approaches of
enforcing gun laws already on the books and ensuring mandatory
minimum sentences for criminals who break them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, congressional Democrats said the bill, based on a
successful Richmond, Virginia State, anti-gun program, merely
deflected attention from the failure of Congress to enact more
fundamental gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
At present, six states -- Virginia, Texas, Florida, Louisiana,
South Carolina and Colorado -- would qualify for the funding.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Congress has been deadlocked over a juvenile
crime bill that contains provisions to tighten gun controls,
particularly on sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
The two parties in Congress did come together Thursday on
proposed legislation under which the federal government would
provide matching grants for school safety programs such as the
installation of metal detectors and training of security personnel.

<HEADLINE> Blix Proposes Staff Structure For UNMOVIC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Hans Blix, executive
chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commssion (UNMOVIC) for Iraq, Thursday recommended to
the United Nations Security Council that the staff structure for
this commission be strong on experts and technical personnel
rather than political functionaries.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, Blix said in his report to the
Security Council that the commission has the right to inspect
anything in Iraq from ground and in the air.
</P>
<P>
Blix said that a college of commissioners would give him
professional advice and guidance. But he also stressed that the
decision-making would be his.
</P>
<P>
Blix said the UNMOVIC needed the freedom of movement and
immediate, unrestricted access to any and all areas, facilities,
equipment, records and means of transport.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNMOVIC had to have a clear United Nations identity.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Blix eliminated the post of deputy executive
chairman of the UNMOVIC, which had been held by an American.
</P>
<P>
The UNMOVIC is created by U.N. resolution 1284 adopted last
December to replace the United Nations Special Commission and
resume U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq which has been suspended
since the U.S.-led military air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has so far banned the U.N. arms inspectors from returning
and said the lifting the sanctions is the precondition.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 and it cannot be lifted until Iraq is clarified that it
has destroyed all the weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> JMC Needs More Money for Monitoring Ceasefire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 6 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Commission
(JMC) that oversees the ceasefire in the Congo is facing serious
financial problems, Acting Chairman of the JMC Timothy Kazembe
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after the closing of a three-day meeting of
the JMC, Kazembe, a brigadier general from Zambia, said: "We now
only have received donations of 1.3 million U.S. dollars, just one
quarter of the sum required for half-a-year military monitoring of
our group. We usually refer our problems to the Joint Political
Committee."
</P>
<P>
"There are now 20 JMC military observers on the ground. They
are equipped with advanced equipment. We have donations from the
U.S, China, Britain, Canada, Germany and Uganda. But we hope we
can get more money for the operations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The JMC is comprised of members from the nine parties to the
19-month conflict in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Predicts Lower Gas Prices This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. gasoline prices should
peak this month and decline to an average of 1.46 U.S. dollars a
gallon this summer due to the impact of increase in worldwide
crude oil production, the Energy Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest analysis by the Energy Department's Energy
Information Administration (EIA) was in sharp contrast to its
forecast a month ago when the agency said that even with increased
oil production, gasoline prices were expected to soar to a
national average of 1.80 dollars a gallon.
</P>
<P>
But the estimated average price of 1.46 dollars per gallon was
still 25 percent higher than last summer's average of 1.17 dollars
per gallon.
</P>
<P>
The EIA said its revised forecast, taking into account the
additional oil production announced by world producers last month,
shows the average price nationwide peaking at 1.52 dollars a
gallon this month and then declining. The forecast estimated
prices averaging 1.39 dollars a gallon by September.
</P>
<P>
The EIA forecast assumed that additional oil would begin
hitting the U.S. market by May and June as a result of a decision
on March 28 by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC) to boost production by 1.7 million barrels a day. Other non-
OPEC producers also would pump more oil.
</P>
<P>
The EIA report predicted that the average price of crude oil
imported into the United States would decline from an estimate of
26.75 dollars per barrel in February and March 2000 to about 25
dollars per barrel by June 2000 and to 23.50 dollars by the end of
2000. The price is expected to continue to decline to about 21.50
dollars by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The spot price for light sweet crude was 25.68 dollars per
barrel Thursday at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier this
year, oil reached a high of 34 dollars per barrel.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Rise Again From Violent Swings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks Thursday rose
again from Tuesday's violent swings, leading the Nasdaq composite
to a solid advance.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index was up 98.34 at 4,267.56. The index closed up 20.33 at 4,169.
22 Wednesday, recovering from panic selling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 80.35 at 11,114.27 and the Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index rose 13.97 at 1,501.34.
</P>

for bargain hunting. As of Tuesday, the index has fallen 900.13
points or 17.8 percent from its record closing high of 5,048.62
set on March 10.
</P>
<P>
Tech companies with strong prospects for future growth were
rewarded. Semiconductor companies such as Texas Instruments and
LSI Logic rose after a report said that worldwide sales for the
semiconductor industry rose 33.4 percent to 14.56 billion U.S.
dollars in February.
</P>
<P>
The biotechnology sector also surged Thursday after U.S.
President Bill Clinton said at a gathering of top economists and
corporate executives in the White House Wednesday that
biotechnology companies should be able to patent privately
financed gene discoveries. Three weeks ago, a joint declaration on
that subject between Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
became a big factor in starting Nasdaq's selloff.

A price surge in Hewlett-Packard led the Dow's advance.

<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.26 at 658.79 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 23.09 at 979.80. The Russell 2000 index of

<HEADLINE> Poland Expresses Hope for Early Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
expressed the hope Thursday that his country wanted to joint the
European Union (EU) as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
But the visiting premier indicated that he had not won pledges
from European Commission President Romano Prodi that Poland would
be in the first group to join the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after meeting Prodi that Poland "cannot
imagine not being in the first group of countries."
</P>
<P>
Buzek came to Brussels seeking assurances that the EU is not
trying to delay its pace for enlargement. He said his meeting with
Prodi had helped "dispel recent misunderstandings" between Warsaw
and Brussels that Poland desperately wants to join the Western
bloc by 2003. However, EU officials say the enlargement is not
likely until 2005.
</P>
<P>
Poland entered the EU accession negotiations in March 1998
along with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and
Cyprus. Six new countries also joined the process last month. They
are Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Union has set no specific timetable for eastward
expansion, but EU officials have said that negotiations on the
most difficult issues such as agriculture and the free movement of
workers will start only in mid-2001. Buzek said Poland intended to
have completed its accession talks by then.

<HEADLINE> Global Chip Sales Grow in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of
semiconductors totaled 14.56 billion U.S. dollars in February 2000,
up 33.4 percent from a year ago, the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, compared to January 2000, chip sales slipped a
fraction, from 14.77 billion dollars, according to the SIA, the
leading voice for the semiconductor industry representing U.S.-
based manufacturers since 1977.
</P>
<P>
"The year-to-year growth of semiconductor sales indicates a
strong 2000 for the chip industry," said the SIA, expecting the
continued expansion of communications networks and Internet to
provide broad product growth for all chip sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-Pacific and Japan markets, the industry grew at 45.
4 percent and 42.5 percent respectively from last year. The
Americas market was up 24.7 percent from last year, and Europe's
sales grew at 25.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SIA's Global Sales Report is a three-month moving average
of sales activity. It is tabulated by the World Semiconductor
Trade Statistics organization, which represents some 70 companies.

<HEADLINE> Annan Promises Deep ATR Air Crash Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 6 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Thursday that the U.N. was "fully" cooperating
with investigations into the cause of the crash last November of
an ATR plane in Pristina which claimed 24 lives, nine of whom were
Italians.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations had an "open door" and wanted to
"get to the bottom of this question," which he described as a "
tragic accident" on which the U.N. will make its own probe.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) plane which crashed, he recalled,
had played the role of a "shuttle of hope," transporting aid every
day from Rome's Ciampino airport to the Kosovar capital.
</P>
<P>
After reiterating his determination to shed full light on the
incident, Annan recalled that British aviation authorities were at
present also investigating the accident.
</P>
<P>
The British, in fact, decided to carry out their own
investigation into the cause of the November 12 crash after a
French report pinned the blame on a British radar operator on duty
at the Pristina airport.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary general is currently on a six-day visit to
Italy and the Vatican during which time, aside from meeting
Italian officials and the pope, gathered together the directors of
the 28 U.N. agencies which act as the organization's operating
hand.
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the first time that the 28 U.N. agency chiefs had
been gathered together outside Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Travel by Air Costs More in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Traveling by airplane needs to
pay more in Belgium from Thursday due to a new measure of fuel
supplement.
</P>
<P>
The so-called fuel supplement must be paid on top of each air
ticket. It ranges between 260 Belgian francs (6.3 U.S. dollars)
for European destinations, and 930 Belgian francs (22.6 U.S.
dollars) for inter-continental flights.
</P>
<P>
The exact ticket price will be calculated by travel agencies
who will transfer the money to the airline companies.
</P>
<P>
The new measures means additional paperwork and costs for tour
operators.
