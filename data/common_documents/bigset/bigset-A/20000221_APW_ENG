<HEADLINE> Clinton comes out in favor of Northeast home heating oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton says she
wants to be "the kind of leader who lifts people up, not pushes them down."
<P>
	   Calling on New Yorkers to "reject the politics of division, revenge and
retribution," Clinton asked more than 1,000 blacks and Hispanics on Sunday to
support her campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning her Republican rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, by name, Clinton warned against the politics of "insulting people and
demeaning people."
</P>
<P>
	   "This must be one New York," the first lady told the annual dinner hosted by
the state Legislature's Black and Puerto Rican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Clinton called for New York and the other Northeastern
states to have their own home heating oil reserves just in case future shortages
make prices skyrocket again.
</P>
<P>
	   "We in the Northeast ... are the most reliant on home heating oil and
therefore pay the highest prices when we have cold snaps," said the Senate
candidate who just moved to New York in January as the coldest weather of the
winter hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd be able to dip into that reserve without raising the strategic issues
that are raised by going to the reserve that we already have."
</P>
<P>
	   A coalition of Northeastern lawmakers, including Democrats and Republicans,
have already called for creation of such a regional reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. The Northeast has been hardest hit
by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has been lambasting President Clinton for refusing to dip into the
nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration says the reserves are only for emergencies and
are not intended as a way to affect market price.
</P>
<P>
	   However, candidate Clinton said she and the president know what New Yorkers
are going through.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take this issue very personally as does the president," said Clinton, who
recently moved into the couple's $1.7 million home in Chappaqua in Westchester
County. "Now that we are homeowners here in New York, our house is heated by
heating oil and it is extremely expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that she and her husband are better able to afford the high
oil prices than most New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short term, Clinton said New York's congressional delegation should
support President Clinton's call for $600 million in emergency assistance to
help poor people meet heating-oil costs. The first lady also said she favored
dipping into the strategic reserves with a swap system under which U.S. oil
companies would be able to borrow from the stockpile and make larger donations
back to it later.
</P>
<P>
	   That way, "they would not run into some of the legal and security issues,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she would also support a bill by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
that would require home heating oil companies to keep a larger reserve of their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a mild winter last year, so that the oil companies did not stockpile
enough of an inventory," she said. "So when OPEC began to raise prices, they had
to scramble on the open market and pay more."
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of how serious the situation is in New York, the Pataki
administration last week used a waiver to allow the use of high-sulfur heating
oil at New York City municipal facilities. Sulfur levels in heating oil are
tightly regulated by state environmental regulations to protect air quality in
the metropolitan area. Connecticut and New Hampshire have used sulfur waivers
similar to New York's during the heating oil crunch, the Pataki administration
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also called on the OPEC counties to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
	   That would "enable us to cut prices so that we wouldn't face either higher
prices in the short term in the home heating oil or longer term in gasoline
prices," she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Hillary Clinton at side, courts minority votes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - On the eve of his crucial debate with Bill Bradley
at Harlem's Apollo theater, Al Gore sought to reinforce his standing among New
York's minorities.
<P>
	   Renewing his call for an end to racial profiling by police and passage of
federal hate crimes legislation, the vice president told a largely black
audience of more than 800 people at an Albany church Sunday that the Republicans
who hope to take the White House are "morally blind" to racial concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, campaigning for the first time this year in New York with first lady
and Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, never mentioned his Democratic
rival for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an uncharacteristically impassioned speech, the vice president
lambasted the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... Some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina," Gore said to laughter
from the audience at the Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina state
Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, "They looked at that flag
and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see."
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president said the Republican reaction - both Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain have said the flag issue is something to be resolved
by South Carolinians - reminded him of those who say that America has become
color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   "They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds -
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to," he said
to cheers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady, running against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, had warm words and hugs for each other.
</P>
<P>
	   "Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up for her," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left the Albany church after about a half-hour of handshaking to fly to
New York City where he met Sunday afternoon with the editorial board of The
Amsterdam News, an influential black-oriented newspaper whose endorsement the
vice president is courting.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour church service was part of the annual weekend conference
sponsored by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus that brings
together hundreds of the state's top black and Hispanic leaders. They represent
an increasingly powerful voting bloc in New York state. Blacks and Hispanics
made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998 election for governor and U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the state's March 7
primary, which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New
York Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their
bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Clinton said she was
"just honored to help him in any way that I can. I was grateful for the chance
to appear with him, because I don't get to see him so often now that he's all
over the country. We used to work together very closely on a lot of issues ...
I'm very fond of him personally as well as very supportive of him as our next
president."

<HEADLINE> Fall landslides make for dangerous trails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - Skiers call them the slides - swaths of
mountain smoothed by the wrath of Tropical Storm Floyd and other major storms.
They provide for speedy descents in some of the most picturesque regions of the
Adirondacks.
<P>
	   But Saturday's avalanche at Wright Peak that killed 26-year-old Toma Jacob
Vracarich of Lake Placid serves as a reminder of the dangers inherent in the
snow-laden mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Adirondacks can be a dangerous place," said John Sheehan of the
Adirondack Council, an environmental advocacy group. "People lose their lives in
the back country every year."
</P>
<P>
	   Vracarich was one of six skiers out telemarking, a Norwegian-born sport that
combines the arts of downhill and cross-country skiing in places off the beaten
track.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, said the slope they chose was on the exact side of Wright Peak
that had been denuded by a mudslide following Tropical Storm Floyd last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bared by the winds of trees and vegetation, the mountainside was no more
than smooth rock. Skiers familiar with the area said that Friday's powdery snow
made for a type of skiing usually associated with the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1 p.m., an avalanche brought snow smashing over the trail, burying
both Vracarich and 29-year-old Lauren Konowitz of Keene. Konowitz was rescued
when other skiers in the party spotted her hat on the snow and dug down to her
face. She was listed in serious condition at Adirondack Medical Center Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The others in the party - Lauren's 45-year-old husband Ronald, 26-year-old
Dean Cook of Saranac Lake, Christina Ford of Lake Placid, and Rohan Roy of
Chateaugay escaped with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   "A fracture line opened below me and one above me," Roy said, "it rumbled,
there was a powder clouds...it was like being strained through the woods, just
like a little pinball being pushed through the woods by a 100-mph force," Roy
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was fortuitous, Post said, that DEC rangers were in the area scouting for
avalanche conditions when the tragedy occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   After someone on the mountainside with a cell phone reported the avalanche,
rangers were able to reach the site within an hour and arrange helicopter
transport for the injured.
</P>
<P>
	   It took rangers and volunteers nearly five hours to find Vracarich's body.
Crews searched for Vracarich in armpit-deep snow, using "avalanche poles" to
poke in search of him.
</P>
<P>
	   Because northeastern mountains are relatively low and are less steep than
mountains in western parts of the nation, avalanches are rare here. They are
most common in the Mount Washington area of New Hampshire, where an avalanche
Sunday killed one person.
</P>
<P>
	   But conditions in recent weeks have increased the likelihood here. Last
week, officials in Vermont posted avalanche warnings in Smugglers' Notch,
popular among skiers, as well as on Vermont 108, a state highway.
</P>
<P>
	   "In my 13 years I have never seen anything like this. There are fracture
lines (for avalanches) all over the place," said Sgt. Butch Patch of the Vermont
Army National Guard's Mountain Warfare School.
</P>
<P>
	   New York officials were not limiting trail access Sunday, but were
continuing to advise people of known areas of risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangers had warned the very party caught in the avalanche that the trail
they planned to ski was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   "We advise people to avoid areas with steep open slopes with heavy snow
loads," Post said. "Where the snow slide occurred was the exact same spot that
we had a landslide in this summer. The avalanche essentially mirrored the
landslide."
</P>
<P>
	   Cook, one of the skiers, described the avalanche as "freak."
</P>
<P>
	   "To try to talk about what went wrong and what went right is useless," he
said. "Somebody died up there."

</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Clinton called for New York and the other Northeastern

make prices skyrocket again.
</P>
<P>
	   "We in the Northeast ... are the most reliant on home heating oil and

</P>
<P>
	   A coalition of Northeastern lawmakers, including Democrats and Republicans,
have already called for creation of such a regional reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. The Northeast has been hardest hit
by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has been lambasting President Clinton for refusing to dip into the
nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration says the reserves are only for emergencies and
are not intended as a way to affect market price.
</P>
<P>
	   However, candidate Clinton said she and the president know what New Yorkers
are going through.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take this issue very personally as does the president," said Clinton, who
recently moved into the couple's $1.7 million home in Chappaqua in Westchester
County. "Now that we are homeowners here in New York, our house is heated by
heating oil and it is extremely expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that she and her husband are better able to afford the high
oil prices than most New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short term, Clinton said New York's congressional delegation should
support President Clinton's call for $600 million in emergency assistance to
help poor people meet heating-oil costs. The first lady also said she favored
dipping into the strategic reserves with a swap system under which U.S. oil
companies would be able to borrow from the stockpile and make larger donations
back to it later.

<HEADLINE> Hometown hero Jim Shea wins gold in skeleton as games end  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - Jim Shea has spent five years on a bare-bones
budget, which is what one might expect in the sport of skeleton.
<P>
	   That may be about to change after his victory Sunday in the Winter Goodwill
Games. Shea found out after the race that two Internet companies - Ultimate Bid
and MilestonesNetwork.com - had signed on as team sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   On this day, though, Shea had the kind of support that money can't buy. The
perimeter of the new skeleton-bobsled-luge track at Mount Van Hoevenberg was
lined with relatives, including his parents and 89-year-old grandfather, Jack, a
two-time gold medalist in speedskating at the 1932 Lake Placid Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
	   A horde of friends wielding cowbells also showed up to cheer on the newest
hometown hero, even though he wasn't born here.
</P>
<P>
	   "The support really made a difference for me," said the Connecticut-born
Shea, who won the world championship last year. "It feels real good. The U.S.
Skeleton program is really taking off."
</P>
<P>
	   Shea entered the final two runs with a lead of more than a second over
Snorre Pedersen of Norway and Chris Soule of the United States. He won with a
four-run time of 4 minutes, 1.12 seconds, nearly three seconds faster than
Soule. Japan's Koshi Kazuhiro slid past Pedersen for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got lucky," said Shea, who received his medal from his grandfather and
father, a 1964 Winter Olympian in Nordic combined, at the awards ceremony.
"Anything can happen in any race. It's up for grabs."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're strong sliders and it's great to have the heated competition," added
Soule, who finished second this season on the World Cup tour. "We're just trying
to put it together. We're looking forward to 2002. That's what we're building up
to."
</P>
<P>
	   Latvian star Sandis Prusis won the race for gold in the two-man bobsled. He
finished in 3:49.13, only 22 hundredths of a second faster than Germany-1,
piloted by Andre Lange, the current world champion in four-man.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States took the bronze, thanks to a gutsy performance by Brian
Shimer, who crashed twice in practice earlier in the week and was bothered by
leg and rib injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel in my heart if I was healthy we could have won this race," said
Shimer, who was limping noticeably. "In the third heat I had a great run going,
went into the big Shady curve, and then my ribs just exploded (from the
pressure). It felt like somebody stuck me with a sword. I almost crashed."
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. also finished on top with 34 medals - 11 gold, 10 silver and 13
bronze. Canada was next with 15 medals, eight of them gold, and Germany and
Norway tied for third with nine medals each.
</P>
<P>
	   The most exciting race Sunday was staged in the 15-kilometer cross-country
sprint relay. The American team of Justin Wadsworth of Bend, Ore., and Marcus
Nash edged Brynjar Skjaerli and Ola Rygg of Norway for the gold.
</P>
<P>
	   The teletimer camera at the finish pegged the margin of victory at eight
thousandths of a second - about the tip of Nash's boot.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our goal at the beginning of the race was to just stay in contact with the
leaders," said Nash, 28, of Fryeburg, Maine. "It's a five-lap race for each man,
so there's no point in leading if you're going to lose it at the end.
</P>
<P>
	   Nash went out in third on the last lap and took the lead before the final
uphill, but as he approached the finish line he didn't realize he suddenly had a
race on his hands.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought once I rounded the final bend the race was over," Nash said. "But
for some reason I chose the middle lane instead of the shortest route to the
finish and he (Rygg) took advantage of that.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said, OK, I'm not going to lose it here. I dug a little deeper.
Fortunately, I'm pretty flexible. I was able to outstretch him."
</P>
<P>
	   Rygg tried in vain to reach ahead with his right foot and stumbled just past
the finish line as the American twosome won despite a fall by Wadsworth on the
seventh lap.
</P>
<P>
	   The final day was not without controversy. In the men's snowboard cross at
Whiteface Mountain, a faulty starting gate left Ryan Neptune stuck at the top as
his American teammate Seth Wescott sped to an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Neptune protested and the race jury upheld it, nullifying Wescott's win. In
the rerun, Neptune accidentally took out Wescott early in the race and Scott
Gaffney of Canada won gold.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the first time we've had that happen," said a disappointed Wescott,
who finished fourth. "Usually they're on it and the stuff's done days ahead of
time. It (the gate) just didn't have time to harden in the ground."
</P>
<P>
	   The only injuries requiring hospitalization in the four days of competition
occurred in separate accidents Sunday and involved two Canadians.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mount Van Hoevenberg, bobsledder Pierre Lueders crashed on his third run
in the two-man, and snowboarder Kim Dunn of Calgary suffered a concussion when
she fell during training for the cross event at Whiteface Mountain. Both
athletes were taken to nearby Saranac Lake for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunn underwent a CAT scan and was in stable condition, according to Dr.
William Smith. Precautionary X-rays were done on Lueders, who was pinned under
his sled after it flipped near the bottom of the course.
</P>
<P>
	   Lueders was released from the hospital Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The American bobsled team of Garrett Hines and Todd Hays also crashed at
about the same place on the track, but they were not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Turner Network Television, which staged these winter games,
said to expect more for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
	   "The games are new," said Mike Plant, president of the Goodwill Games. "You
have to build. My goal 20 years from now is that people around the world will
know what the Goodwill Games are."

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 4, Thrashers 2  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jyrki Lumme scored a power-play goal and had one of his two
assists on another as the Phoenix Coyotes beat the Atlanta Thrashers 4-2 Sunday
night in the first meeting of the franchises.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Sullivan scored a short-handed goal in an excellent special-teams
performance by the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
	   Stan Neckar and Jeremy Roenick also had goals for the Coyotes, who remained
two points behind leader Dallas in the Pacific Division with their 32nd win -- a
franchise-best after 58 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thrashers skidded to their season-high 12th consecutive loss and 14th in
16 games (0-14-2) despite goals from Ray Ferraro and Yannick Tremblay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes and expansion Thrashers were scheduled to play in Atlanta on
Jan. 26, but the game was postponed until next month because of a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   With the teams virtually even on shots most of the game, goalie Sean Burke
was the difference for Phoenix. He had 36 saves to 35 for embattled Norm
Maracle, whose last win was a 1-0 shutout of Philadelphia on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan scored the Coyotes' 12th short-handed goal, tying them with St.
Louis for tops in the NHL, and broke a 2-2 tie with 9:49 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Lumme got the puck to him at the blue line, and Sullivan angled in across
the slot with Hnat Domenichelli in pursuit. He turned and fired back from the
opposite circle, with Domenichelli's leg partially blocking Maracle's view.
</P>
<P>
	   Roenick got his 27th goal -- the only one of the third period -- on
Phoenix's third and final power play.
</P>
<P>
	   Maracle fell while Roenick skated behind the net and was getting up when
Roenick poked the puck past him 2:47 into the third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes, whose best games have come against potential playoff opponents,
played lethargically in the first period and went the first 8:44 without taking
a shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevor Letowski provided a spark with two quick shots in 39 seconds, but
seconds later Ferraro scored his 15th goal for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Brunette made the play possible, skating to the circle, leaving a
drop pass for Ferraro and screening Burke's view of Ferraro's one-timer with
9:13 left in the first.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes tied it with 3:42 remaining when Roenick passed high in the slot
to Lumme, who scored his 100th career goal on a 50-foot slap shot, and went
ahead on Neckar's goal 4:50 into the second period.

<HEADLINE> Blake in His America's Cup Farewell  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Sir Peter Blake's mark is all over Auckland.
</P>
<P>
	Red socks.
</P>
<P>
	There are real ones, worn by everyone from sailing enthusiasts to bikers.
There's a giant red sock perched on a waterfront building. The day before the
scheduled start of the America's Cup, a parade of boats, with large red socks
dangling from the masts, sailed past the harbor to salute Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	Red socks?
</P>
<P>
	If Blake, the CEO of Team New Zealand, can whip up the same fervor in his next
endeavor as head of the Cousteau Society, the world's oceans should be in good
shape.
</P>
<P>
	Red socks became Team New Zealand's lucky symbol in the 1995 America's Cup in
San Diego, when Blake wore them aboard Black Magic during the challenger trials.
The one day he wasn't on the boat was the only time the Kiwis lost on the water
(one victory was overturned on protest).
</P>
<P>
	Someone noticed and the lucky red socks craze soon spread through New Zealand.
Eager to support their team, New Zealanders bought 100,000 pairs of red socks in
a matter of days, with half the money going to Team New Zealand's coffers. The
Kiwis went on to whip Dennis Conner in the finals, just the second time the
America's Cup was taken from America.
</P>
<P>
	It was such a big victory that Blake was knighted.
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, the red socks stir is still here.
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's sort of a national icon. Crazy thing, but it doesn't do any harm,''
Blake said.
</P>
<P>
	Team New Zealand still relies on proceeds from sales of the socks -- made in
Korea, by the way -- in its effort to retain the Cup. The Kiwis got off to a
great start Sunday when Black Magic beat Italy's Luna Rossa by 1 minute, 17
seconds in the opening race, which was delayed a day by lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
	Monday was a day off, and racing resumes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	So it's one win down and, Blake hopes, four to go in his America's Cup career.
After this, his third America's Cup, he's off to lead the Cousteau Society, an
environmental organization founded in 1973 by the late undersea explorer
Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
</P>
<P>
	Although he's one of the world's most accomplished sailors, Blake, 51, never
really considered himself an America's Cup sailor. He's not on the boat this
time, but when he sailed on Black Magic in 1995, he epitomized the Kiwis'
low-key approach by basically doing grunt work even though he was the syndicate
chief.
</P>
<P>
	Going around buoys is pretty tame stuff for a guy who's sailed around the world
several times. It's largely because of that experience that he accepted the job
with the Cousteau Society.
</P>
<P>
	``I was planning to do something similar of my own a number of years ago
anyway, so it'll be good to be involved with this,'' Blake said.
</P>
<P>
	Blake will be involved with planning and fundraising -- much like he does with
his America's Cup campaign -- but he also plans to spend six months a year on
the water. After the America's Cup, he plans to go to Greenland. Next year, he
wants to explore the Northwest Passage above Canada.
</P>
<P>
	Blake used to sail around the world as fast as he could. He won one Whitbread
Round the World race and in 1994 won the Jules Verne Trophy by sailing nonstop
around the globe on a catamaran in 74 days, 22 hours, 17 minutes and 22 seconds.
The record fell three years later to a Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
	Blake will now slow down and, using TV, film and the Internet, share some of
the sights he's seen -- massive waves, icebergs, whales and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen lots of things I want to show kids,'' Blake said. ``I've gone,
`wow,' `fantastic' and `marvelous.' I want to capture some of those now, and get
young people interested in the environment.
</P>
<P>
	``It's more excitement and adventure entertainment rather than a scientific
survey. Otherwise, they'll change channels.''
</P>
<P>
	Blake said the most awe-inspiring thing he's seen on the oceans is the weather.
</P>
<P>
	``I want to show people what it's like to be in a full storm at sea. You may
say, `why bother?' But weather is probably the most talked about subject in the
world. And most people probably don't know how it develops or why it's there.
There's a lot to do with water.''
</P>
<P>
	Same goes for the next several days. Blake has one last item to try to add to
his resume -- the first successful America's Cup defense by a country other than
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaving the America's Cup pretty happy -- as long as one thing happens,''
Blake said.

<HEADLINE> Veteran's death recalls Navy record - six brothers who served at  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager hands motivated by empty stomachs reached out
toward the parked car with its rumble seat full of sacks leaking dirt.
<P>
	   In the midst of the small crowd stood a contingent of the Martin boys. The
teen-agers handed out potatoes from the heaping bags - a bounty brought back to
their neighborhood in Flushing, Queens, from an overnight excursion to dig up
potatoes that otherwise would go unharvested on Long Island farms.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 1930s, the Great Depression. Everyone was poor, and everyone was
familiar with hunger. The potatoes meant a sure meal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Martin boys were known for banding together to help out. That's why no
one was surprised when a few years later six of the brothers joined the Navy in
World War II, even though no six sons from one family ever served in the Navy at
one time - before or since
</P>
<P>
	   The boys got their spirit from their dad, who toiled at two jobs to feed a
family of 13, brought starving families home to dinner, and once paid an
out-of-work bricklayer to repair the family fireplace - which was not really
broken - in hopes it would restore the man's pride.
</P>
<P>
	   Like their dad, the boys believed in family - theirs was seven brothers,
three sisters, their parents and an uncle - and in community, in an age when
many city neighborhoods were as caring as small towns. That's why the neighbors
found it natural when most of the Martin sons went off to World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody questioned it," recalled sister Agnes Martin. "Nobody thought it was
anything outstanding. It was always what people did."
</P>
<P>
	   Each time a Martin walked into the recruitment office, their mother grabbed
needle and thread and added another gold star to the navy blue flag at the front
window. The six stars represented her boys: John Jr., Edward, William, James,
Charles and Robert.
</P>
<P>
	   All survived the war, and now this unusual chapter in the U.S. military's
history has closed. Charles, the last remaining brother, died late last month
following a lengthy illness at age 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Military historians doubt one family will ever contribute so many sons again
to a war. That is due partly to today's smaller families. In 1930, a U.S family
averaged 4.1 people, and it was not unusual for a couple to have a half-dozen
sons. Today, the average family size is about 2.5.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just finding six brothers of military age, well, I guess you could, but it
wouldn't be probable," said Jerry Cooper, a professor of U.S. military history
at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "You can say the differences are more
demography and social change, rather than anything to do with the military."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the military has changed. The country is not at war, the draft is
gone, and the military has downsized. Most expansion is focused on technology,
not numbers. And as on expert explained, the appeal for volunteering has faded,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   "In those days, it seemed like a respectable thing to do," said Charles
Moskos, a professor of military sociology at Northwestern University in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   But Moskos said this doesn't mean the military has no family connections.
"Husbands and wives serving together - that's the new military," Moskos said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that women make up 15 percent of the armed forces and estimated
that 50 percent of them are married to servicemen.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Martins, little made their story special beyond the number of
brothers. Yes, they all fought, even participating in every World War II theater
involving U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
	   But their sacrifice pales when compared with that of the Sullivans, five
brothers all killed serving together on a cruiser sunk by a Japanese torpedo in
1942. When the news hit the states, a horrified Congress approved the "Sullivan
Act" forbidding siblings from serving on the same ship.
</P>
<P>
	   A few of the Martin boys had served together at one time or another, but
never all on the same ship. Early in the war, Mrs. Martin urged daughter Agnes
to write a letter asking President Roosevelt to put the boys together.
</P>
<P>
	   She came to Agnes in a panic when the Sullivans were killed and was relieved
to learn her daughter had put off the letter since some of the boys didn't like
the idea of saluting one brother who had been promoted.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mother was crying and on her knees, praying in gratitude," Agnes Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Martins' story wasn't "Saving Private Ryan" - the recent film about
World War II that capitalized on the notion of a country not only sending
brothers-in-arms, but real brothers, into battle together.
</P>
<P>
	   What the Martins did was serve their country, supporting the Allies'
victory. James Forestall, then Secretary of the Navy, sent the family a letter
lauding the sons' patriotism.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, the brothers came home, started families, and began spreading
throughout the New York area. William returned to Japan to marry a woman he had
met. Each got a job, frequently utilizing technical skills.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles became a cook in Brooklyn and later, like some of his brothers, an
airline engineer. After retiring, he volunteered at the Brooklyn School for
Special Children, where one of his son's had been educated.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Martins talked little about their service during the war, their
children knew they never forgot it.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were damn proud of it, too - not of the six thing - but that they did
their duty," said Elizabeth Egan, Charles Martin's daughter. "They felt it was
their obligation as United States citizens to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   For at least one of the brothers, it came close to never happening. Robert -
the smallest of an already diminutive brood - needed the help of his sisters to
make the weight to enlist. To add some pounds, they mixed a concoction of eggs,
heavy cream and beer for him to drink before the weigh-in. But that wasn't
enough, and it took a well-timed foot on the scale from an older brother for
Robert to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the desire to serve the country, there was at least one other reason
the boys enlisted. Their Uncle James had been an army man who served in five
wars. When he retired, he moved in with the family and his pension helped pay
some bills. So the boys grew up hearing James' war stories.
</P>
<P>
	   The tales must have had some impact. But Agnes Martin recalled something
else that played an important role. Mrs. Martin was a talented seamstress who
made her first sons sailor suits when they were little, and these later were
passed on to brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We always thought it was so ironic," Agnes Martin said. "It was almost a
premonition."

Bush, McCain Campaigning in Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Governor
George W. Bush kicked off their campaigns in Michigan Sunday, two days before
the state's primary. "We won round one," McCain said, referring to his landslide
in New Hampshire's presidential primary on Feb. 1. "Governor Bush won round
two," a lopsided win in South Carolina. "Now we go to round three," he said.
Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the momentum.
McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who had
supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina as well as his visit to Bob Jones University.

Judge Handling Cuban Boy's Case Hospitalized
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal judge handling Elian Gonzalez's case was
hospitalized Sunday and may have suffered a stroke, two of the judge's
colleagues said. One colleague of U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler who
has been in touch with Hoeveler's family said the situation was not as grave as
it initially appeared. Both colleagues spoke on condition of anonymity. The
judge had been scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court
has jurisdiction in Elian's case. The boy is at the center of a custody battle
involving his relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba, who wants him returned.
Officials said there is no reason for the hearing to be postponed.

Bradley, Gore Well-Financed

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley had about the same amount of
money to spend in the five weeks leading up to the March 7 primaries that likely
will determine the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to
reports filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission. Meanwhile, Sen. John
McCain outraised George W. Bush last month, even as the Texas governor set
records for total fund-raising and spending. And McCain continued to narrow the
financial gap between himself and Bush in February, at least in advance of
Saturday's South Carolina primary in which he was soundly defeated by Bush.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters have freed the 65 policemen they
captured during a clash over control of a teachers' college, according to news
reports Sunday. Several police and protesters were injured during the weekend
protest in the Hidalgo state town of Tepatepec, 50 miles north of Mexico City,
the reports said. Protesters also burned more than a dozen police cars. The
latest violence began as hundreds of state police raided the school early
Saturday morning to end a seven-week student takeover.

Microsoft Moves to Ban Long Temps
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is limiting its temporary workers to
one year of employment at a time, with 100-day intervals in between -- a move
that will force up to 1,500 of its long-term contract workers to find new jobs
or seek permanent positions with the company. Microsoft's policy change,
announced Friday, follows pressure from litigation and union organizers to bar
use of so-called "permatemps" -- temporary workers who stay in the same job for
years, but without the benefits offered permanent workers. Microsoft began
informing temp agencies early last week of the new policy, which goes into
effect July 1.

Prisoner Killed After Hijacking

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Paramilitary gunmen killed Hernando Prada Sunday, a
convicted murderer who had hijacked a domestic flight at knifepoint. Prada,
convicted of five murders, was serving a 50-year jail sentence. The strange
event began Saturday as two armed guards escorted Prada aboard a plane at
Bucaramanga airport in northwestern Colombia, with plans to transfer him to a
prison in Cucuta. Prada drew a knife eight minutes into the flight, held the
guards at bay and forced the pilot to land at a remote airstrip near El
Tornillo, 240 miles north of Bogota. Officials said he took one of his guards
hostage as he fled on foot. A right-wing paramilitary squad spotted the plane as
it landed, and quickly caught Prada.

<HEADLINE> Cast members and fans come to terms with impending close of 'Cats'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The mood was somber yet nostalgic as the news sunk in
with cast members and fans alike that "Cats," the longest-running show in
Broadway history, will close in June after a record-breaking 7,397 performances.
<P>
	   "When we got the news there were tears, sure, and hugs. And believe it or
not there was lots of laughter. Somehow everybody knows in their heart that
nothing goes forever," said Marlene Danielle, who has played the feline
character Bombalurina since the show started in October 1982. "We brought the
show into the new millennium. How much more can you really expect?"
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, which has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, will bring down the
curtain June 25, after a nearly two-decade run at Broadway's Winter Garden
Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats," which is advertised as "Now and Forever" and has long been a major
tourist attraction, will have been seen by more than 10 million theatergoers in
New York by the end of the run.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's grosses on Broadway alone are estimated to be more than $380
million. Yet in the last two years, its weekly receipts have been dwindling, at
times falling to only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the lean winter
months after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bound to happen someday. When you look at it, we're running into our
18th year and the houses have been slow. It's a business, and they have to make
their money," Danielle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although cast members admitted to being sad and disappointed, they said that
knowing the end is near makes the remaining performances even more special.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really very exciting to be a member of the last cast," said Lenny
Daniel, 33, who plays the character Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of the show were saddened by the news but also expressed a feeling of
nostalgia upon learning that the show would not really be "Now and Forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the news I was devastated," said uber-fan Hector
Montalvo, a Manhattan computer software salesman who said he has seen the show
670 times. "This is such a sad thing, but I guess all good things must come to
an end."
</P>
<P>
	   Montalvo, tears streaming down his face, waited in line for Sunday's
matinee.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the 10th time I have seen it, and I must admit I'm feeling pretty
sad," said Ernie Puglise, a music teacher from Connecticut who took his classes
many times over the years to see the show. "I really think it's the best musical
ever written."
</P>
<P>
	   Both performers and fans, however, admitted that despite the show's
impending closing they were optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've all been auditioning for other things because we knew this had to
happen at some point," said Tesha Bess, who has played the character Rumple
Teaser for the last 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Montalvo, the fan, said that although he was upset he knew that life would
go on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've made friends with a lot of the cast and I look forward to seeing them
in their future projects," he said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> The New Yorker magazine celebrates 75 years in print  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bylines glimpsed in The New Yorker since its 1925 debut:
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sylvia Plath, W.B. Yeats.
<P>
	   Dorothy Parker, Truman Capote, E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
	   W.H. Auden, Ogden Nash, James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
	   With the magazine's double-issue now on newsstands, the ghosts of authors
and artists past help celebrate the venerable publication's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Snatches of their vivid pictures and prose dot the magazine pages under the
headline "Takes," standing alongside a current offering about Fidel Castro's
public relations war over Elian Gonzalez. There's also an analysis of Martha
Stewart that concludes she taps into the power "of the woman who sits down at
the table with the men, and, still in her apron, walks away with the chips."
</P>
<P>
	   Woody Allen is back, ending his long hiatus as a contributing writer.
</P>
<P>
	   The man best known for his films and a headline-grabbing romance-marriage
with longtime paramour Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, Allen penned "Attention
Geniuses: Cash Only" for his return to the magazine. The piece is a rambling,
off-the-wall story of a therapist who daydreams of accepting a musician's work
in lieu of cash. It's disastrous, of course, as the man's song titles include
"The Earthworms of Tuscany."
</P>
<P>
	   The story is an amusing, fulfilling one of David Remnick's priorities as The
New Yorker's fifth editor. Allen has a tough time, however, competing with the
magazine's alumni.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's a sampling of the competition's work:
</P>
<P>
	   -E.B. White on learning to crank start the Model T: "It was a special trick
and until you learned it (usually from another Ford owner, but sometimes by a
period of appalling experimentation) you might as well have been winding up an
awning," White wrote in 1936. "Often, if the emergency brake hadn't been pulled
all the way back, the car advanced on you ... I can still feel my old Ford
nuzzling me at the curb, as though looking for an apple in my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   -Vladimir Nabokov on butterflies: "Through the smells of the marsh, I caught
the subtle perfume of butterfly wings on my hands, a perfume that varies with
the species; it was vanilla, or lemon, or musk, or a musty, sweetish odor
difficult to define."
</P>
<P>
	   -And Philip Hamburger on Mussolini's execution and subsequent hanging: "To
an outsider like myself, who happened to be on hand to see Mussolini, Clara
Petacci, Pavolini Starace, and some of the other Fascists dangling by their
heels from a rusty beaming front of a gas station, the breathless, bloody scene
had an air of inevitability. You had the feeling, as you have at the final
curtain of a good play, that events could not have been otherwise."
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Wallace Ross, a self-taught man rumored teasingly by his staff to
have finished reading but one book in his life, founded The New Yorker in 1925,
at first with the breezy about-town flair of 1920s New York. Later, under the
gentle guidance of Katherine White, who shepherded serious fiction onto its
pages, the magazine began to take shape. It took on the voice that resonates
today, somehow conjuring the whispers of Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein in
the cafes of Paris, witty, intelligent, and yes, a little too full of itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ross was an aggressively ignorant man, with a head full of odd scraps of
information and misinformation," reported longtime staffer Brendan Gill in his
1975 book "Here at The New Yorker." Driving home the point, he explains that
Ross might likely badger an author with the question: "Is Moby Dick the whale or
the man?"
</P>
<P>
	   Something of that tone comes through on the pages of The New Yorker even
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current Commentary offered by Anthony Lane, Thurber is remembered
with the following quote: "Two overcoats which he left in The New Yorker office
last spring were stolen, or else he left them someplace else."
</P>
<P>
	   And much later, from Donald Barthelme in a "The Talk of the Town" recipe:
"About twenty pounds of sliced onion would be a good addition, although they
probably should have gone in earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   It's that tone, that something, that Remnick hopes to see more of.
</P>
<P>
	   After 18 months as editor, he says he still can't wait to put his pants on
every morning and come to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine has had its troubles in recent years, including flagging
circulation and advertising sales, but all that appears to be on the rebound.
Circulation is up to 844,000 from 628,000 in recent years, and ad pages are up
37 percent this quarter, according to the director of public relations. About
76.7 percent of subscribers renew.
</P>
<P>
	   That means Remnick can focus on the fun stuff, like weekly cartoon meetings
and soothing ruffled writers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a real joy. Sure, it's exhausting and even once in a blue moon
frustrating and it's always difficult. It's always difficult to do the best you
can in so many ways," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   He says Anthony Lane, the commentary writer, summed it up best in advising
what to do when you inherit a tradition: "The crucial thing is not to ape it,
still less to seize up with awe, but to ask yourself what, by way of homage, you
can possibly bring to the party."
</P>
<P>
	   That, Remnick says, is what he is figuring out.

<HEADLINE> Cops not trigger happy, experts say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the popular "Lethal Weapon" movies, the actors
portraying cops shoot their weapons endlessly, killing bad guys one after
another.
<P>
	   Those visions, coupled with the real-life shooting of Amadou Diallo - killed
in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four New York City police officers last year -
reinforce the stereotype that all cops are trigger happy.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to police officials and crime experts, the majority of police
officers never fire their weapons during their careers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well over 95 percent never shoot their weapons here," said New York City
Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year in New York City, with 41,000 cops, the largest force in the
nation, there were 155 incidents in which police fired their weapons. Forty-two
"offenders" - people being pursued for questioning or arrest - were shot by
cops, according to department firearms discharge statistics. Cops also shot
three bystanders - none was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 42 "offenders" shot, 11, including Diallo, were killed. Diallo was
standing in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building when four cops
approached him for questioning, officially putting him in the "offender"
category. The four are on trial for murder in Albany, N.Y., and testified they
thought they saw him with a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Four New York police officers were shot and wounded by perpetrators last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In spite of the low number of police shootings, there's the perception that
cops constantly fire their weapons, and according to Safir, no fan of the press,
it's the media's fault.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people are surprised that most officers never fire their weapons
because they've seen so much press based on one or two incidents," Safir said in
a recent interview. "The truth is, the media conditions people. It's the only
thing you hear about in the press, 41 shots and those kind of things."
</P>
<P>
	   "People hear 41 shots and they think it's not an aberration, when it's quite
an aberration," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Geraldine Majors, 52, an elementary school teacher who lives near the Bronx
street where Diallo was killed, said movies and TV shows reinforce the
stereotype of gun-toting, mean cops.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cops are always shooting at someone in the movies or TV," Majors said.
"Take that picture and add it to the perception enforced in young minority kids
from the poor neighborhoods that cops are bad. The Diallo shooting was nothing
new to us."
</P>
<P>
	   But in study after study, it's been proven that the majority of police
officers nationwide never fire their guns in their careers. In conversations
with several current officers of all ranks, with career spans of seven to nearly
20 years on the force, not one had fired his or her weapon. The officers all
wished to remain unidentified due to the Diallo trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But all had been in situations where they had to pull their weapons out of
their holsters.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the worst feeling in the world, having to pull your gun," said a
female detective with nearly 18 years of experience. "Because there's a chance
you may have to use it."
</P>
<P>
	   And most of the cops who do fire their weapons are assigned to the more
dangerous units, such as narcotics, or patrol in high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Geoffrey Alpert, a criminologist who studied police shootings in Miami over
a 10-year period, said most officers do their best to not get in the situation
where deadly force is required.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's true in LA, true in Chicago, true in Miami, true in New York," said
Alpert, a professor at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   And the officers who are involved in shootings are those in certain units,
said Willam A. Geller, a criminologist who co-authored "Deadly Force: What We
Know," a book on police shootings nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "The likelihood that you're going to use your weapon in the line of duty
depends hugely on a given city," said Geller, who runs a consulting firm in
Illinois. "It also depends on your unit, such as special street crime kinds of
units."
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers accused of murdering Diallo all belonged to the NYPD's
Street Crime Unit, whose goal was to patrol high crime neighborhoods to search
for illegal guns, and sometimes to investigate a violent crime pattern. The
officers stopped Diallo because they thought he matched the description of a
serial rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   And, unlike Hollywood, police are trained to use their weapons only as a
last resort, wrote Louis Anemone in the NYPD's 1998 Firearms Discharge Data
Report. Anemone, now retired, was chief of department - the highest ranking
uniformed officer - when the Diallo shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent telephone interview, Anemone said that message has not gotten
out to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   "They NYPD is the most restrained department in the nation among large
departments, when it comes to the use of deadly physical force," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police shootings in New York City have steadily declined in the 1990s, and
Safir attributes that to good training.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a tactics house at the firing range and police officers get a real
sense of when to shoot and not to shoot," he said. "We go through so many
scenarios and change them so often that they don't become routine."
</P>
<P>
	   Other large departments, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
report low incidences of police shootings as well. But in 1998, the Washington
Post published a series revealing that the District of Columbia police shot and
killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other large U.S. police
department. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1999 for the
series.
</P>
<P>
	   The series prompted action by city and federal officials. Police Chief
Charles Ramsey asked the Justice Department to probe a decade of police
shootings to try to restore public confidence, and announced a sweeping
retraining program for the entire force.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research
group, said retraining may be needed in other cities to prevent some shootings
that result from the cultural gap between black suspects and white police.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police need more training - cultural training," said Williams, who once
headed the Newark, N.J., police department. "We need to engage in a broader set
of parameters that involves the culture of inner city youth. We need to draw
from savvy street officers, who day after day engage these young kids and never
shoot anybody."

<HEADLINE> Philanthropy spurs hot trend in education - after-school programs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The normal school day at P.S. 27 is long over, but
fifth-grader Shanna Holmes is still in a classroom, busily creating an elaborate
3-D greeting card.
<P>
	   The 10-year-old is one of 235 children in the Crossroads After-School
Program at the Brooklyn school. When she and her classmates master the 3-D
cards, they will teach the technique to residents at a nearby home for mentally
handicapped adults.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's fun," Holmes says of the Crossroads program. "We teach people. I like
staying in school after school.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lot better than being at home. At home all I do is watch TV and be
alone," Holmes adds, gazing up from the milk carton that is soon to be the
centerpiece of her card.
</P>
<P>
	   After-school programs like the year-old one at P.S. 27 are a growing trend
fostered by charity foundations, which in turn get help from community groups
and government.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is to make after-school activities a permanent fixture of American
life, much as Andrew Carnegie did a century ago with libraries, by building them
in towns and cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The free after-school programs are popular with parents. One survey showed
90 percent of Americans favor them. Much of their popularity can be traced to
the increasing number of working mothers; nearly 80 percent of mothers of
children ages 6 to 13 are employed full time.
</P>
<P>
	   Government is responding to the need. In 1997, Congress set aside $1 million
for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, a pilot after-school program.
This year it allocated $454 million to help support the centers in 1,600 rural
and inner-city schools in 49 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been exponential growth in after-school programs," says Adrienna de
Kanter, a special adviser to the U.S. Department of Education. "It's been a
silent revolution that there be activities for kids ... to keep buildings open
after school."
</P>
<P>
	   At P.S. 27, principal Marilyn Fuenes says the after-hours program has given
her school a new spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two years ago, nothing was happening. The kids couldn't play. They would go
to school and then go home," she said. "Now the school has come to life."
</P>
<P>
	   The elevated Brooklyn-Queens Expressway runs by outside the school in Red
Hook, a low-income, dockside area. The neighborhood has one of the city's
largest public-housing projects, and 97 percent of P.S. 27 students are poor
enough to receive free school lunches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crossroads program at P.S. 27 is a partnership between Good Shepherd
Services, a neighborhood community group, and The After-School Corporation,
which provided the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Philanthropist George Soros started the corporation in April 1998 with a
challenge grant. He pledged up to $125 million over five years to create
after-school programs in New York City public schools, with the goal of matching
his grants with public and private money on a 3-to-1 basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation has created nearly 100 after-school programs for 26,000
children. It estimates that a program operating Monday through Friday for three
hours each day costs about $1,000 a year per child.
</P>
<P>
	   This school year, its budget is $36 million, with more than $25 million
coming from private and public coffers. Included is $17 million from New York
City and the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
	   The programs are designed to enrich learning, and 45 minutes is devoted to
homework, but they have a wide range of recreational activities, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes you have to take the reins off a little," says John Powell, 24, a
volunteer in the P.S. 27 program who was once a student at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In one classroom on a winter's afternoon, first- and second-graders thump
drums, knock wooden sticks together and bang tambourines on their hips, keeping
time with a music teacher. When the song ends, the kids clap and burst out
laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   Down the hall, second-graders in theater class shriek with excitement as
they transform themselves into Pikachus, a favorite character from the popular
Pokemon cartoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixth- and seventh-graders in the volunteer Counselor-in-Training program
act as mentors to first- or second-graders. Mentor Emanuel Turner says he feels
like a teacher and guidance counselor as he helps a second-grade buddy learn to
read. He is learning patience himself, too, Turner says, since his charge would
rather run around than do homework.
</P>
<P>
	   Socorro Perez, a mother of second- and seventh-grade boys, said that she
used to have problems helping with homework - her first language is Spanish -
before enrolling her sons in the free program.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's helped them a lot," she said. "Before they stayed at home. Sometimes I
had to contact a friend to help with the English homework."
</P>
<P>
	   Soros, the philanthropist, said his vision is that after-school programs
"will eventually become a universally available public responsibility."
</P>
<P>
	   He praised the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, funded by the U.S.
Department of Education, as a good way to bolster after-school efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Soros' corporation, the Department of Education does not create the
programs single-handedly. Almost all after-school programs are a collaboration
among the government, private groups and community organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, schools receiving grants from 21st Century get training from
the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has donated $83 million over six
years to support the centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Political leaders also have started pushing the after-school programs.
During his State of the Union address in January, President Clinton said he
wanted to more than double funding for after-school and summer-school programs
to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore also has spoken favorably about the after-school
idea, and Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush recently said he wants
to reverse federal rules that prevent churches and synagogues from being part of
the after-hours programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Negron, who runs an after-school program in Manhattan's Washington
Heights neighborhood, said he's not surprised to see politicians "jumping on the
bandwagon."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no coincidence that it's an election year," he said. "For parents,
it's a hot issue."

<HEADLINE> Farmers Warned About Fertilizer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BETHEL, Minn. (AP) -- A University of Minnesota ecologist is warning that
the agricultural landscape could turn ugly within 50 years if farmers continue
to depend heavily on nitrogen fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   David Tilman has been studying the long-term effects of nitrogen fertilizer
on plots he and colleagues have tended north of the Twin Cities near Bethel for
nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   On 207 plots, each about 16 yards square, they have measured how plants
handle varying levels of nitrogen, a powerful fertilizer that is a key factor in
how plants fare.
</P>
<P>
	   Over time, a trend has emerged. As more nitrogen is applied to plots,
progressively fewer species of plants survive. The ones that do are usually
less-desirable, non-native ones such as quack grass, which needs high doses of
nitrogen to thrive.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Tilman has taken that level of inquiry a step further. As part of a
broader effort involving other scientists, he has tried to determine what the
world will look like in 50 years assuming farmers continue to adopt U.S.
agricultural methods that depend heavily on nitrogen for high yields.
</P>
<P>
	   That picture isn't pretty, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oxygen-starved "dead zones," such as the one now in the Gulf of Mexico, will
become increasingly prevalent and many plants will die off, while fewer -- and
less desirable ones -- will take over, he said. The result will be less diverse
and less healthy ecosystems for plant and animal life.
</P>
<P>
	   To arrive at that conclusion, Tilman took his own experiments on nitrogen
and incorporated them with the best available world population, income and
consumption patterns. He already had found that as the amount of nitrogen
doubles, species diversity declines by 25 percent. And as nitrogen levels
continue to increase, species are lost at a greater, though less dramatic, rate,
leveling off at declines of 40 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bad news is that low rates of nitrogen are having more impact than
expected," Tilman said.
</P>
<P>
	   To get world food production to double over the past 35 years, farmers have
had to use seven times as much nitrogen as they used to, effectively doubling
the amount that already comes in from the atmosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our estimate is that by 2050, the use of nitrogen will quadruple," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, the world population is projected to increase by almost 50 percent,
Tilman said. It also will become increasingly affluent, resulting in buying
power 2.4 times that of today's population and producing a demand for twice as
much food, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unless agricultural methods are changed or technical adaptations are made,
he said, that will amount to three to four times more need for nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
	   But society is not without options, Tilman said. For starters, he recommends
more efficient ways to use nitrogen, such as timing applications of fertilizer
better and doing a better job of removing it from sewage.
</P>
<P>
	   Tilman emphasized he isn't trying to rattle cages or offer gloom-and-doom
scenarios. Instead, he said he and his colleagues are part of a growing body of
scientists that are raising issues that often have not been addressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Humans now dominate the ecosystems of the world, yet we don't understand
the implications," Tilman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not clear what the wisest path is," he said. "But if we continue on
the current one, we're going to create a world we really don't want."

<HEADLINE> More Items in 'the Nation's Attic'  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution added 345,000 items to its
collection of historical artifacts last year, an eclectic mix ranging from the
earliest known portrait of Thomas Jefferson to the leather pants, boots, jacket
and brassiere of murdered Tejano singer Selena.
</P>
<P>
	   Including stamps, buttons and dried insects, the 15 museums and a zoo run by
the Smithsonian own more than 141 million objects and living creatures. Despite
all that space, only a small fraction can go on display; the rest is squirreled
away in research centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Given its vast collections, the Smithsonian has earned the nickname ``the
nation's attic.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Lawrence M. Small, the new secretary of the Smithsonian,
announced a reorganization designed in part to get more of the treasures
traveling around the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of each year, the staff takes several weeks to count up all the
items the Smithsonian has purchased, discovered, given birth to and found left
on its many doorsteps. Then it makes an announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the most cuddly acquisitions in 1999 were Mike, Chrissie and Eric,
Sumatran tiger cubs born in June at Washington's National Zoo. It's the third
litter for the mother, Kerinci. They'll probably go to other zoos eventually.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also Kwame, a male lowland gorilla born to Mandara in November.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Jefferson, he was serving as U.S. minister to France in 1768 when he
had his likeness painted. The portrait belonged to John Adams, his predecessor
as president. They had a bitter political quarrel but reconciled before both
died on the same day: July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of his Declaration of
Independence, which Jefferson had written.
</P>
<P>
	   A descendant of Adams left the heirloom to the National Portrait Gallery,
one of the Smithsonian museums.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican-American singer Selena Quintanilla-Perez was 23 when she was
shot to death in 1995. Yolanda Saldivar, former president of her fan club, was
sentenced to life in prison for the murder.

<HEADLINE> Mandela-Led Burundi Talks Resume  </HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG NELSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Scolding negotiators trying to end Burundi's
7-year-old civil war, Nelson Mandela accused them of squabbling while their
fellow countrymen were massacred every day.
</P>
<P>
	   The former South African president's 90-minute address last month in this
northern Tanzanian town left little doubt among the negotiators or anyone else
that he meant business.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Mandela is under pressure to deliver. And with the talks set to resume
today, his skills will be tested as he tries to advance an effort to end
fighting between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels that has killed
more than 200,000 people since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Mandela's reproaches, representatives of the 18 political groups
participating in the talks quarreled last week in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, over
the same issues that have mired down the talks for months: integrating rebels
into the army and guidelines for future national elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile in Burundi, there were reports last week of army massacres of
scores of Hutu civilians near Ruyigi, as more than 345,000 Hutus remained
confined to army-run camps and restricted from tending their land during the
year's main planting season.
</P>
<P>
	   More importantly, middle-class Tutsis -- President Pierre Buyoya's key base
of support -- grew restive as recent price increases on fuel and other staples
continued to strain their already threadbare household budgets.
</P>
<P>
	   No hard-nosed negotiations were expected during Mandela's three-day stay in
Arusha. Instead, he will play the impresario, briefing regional leaders on the
progress of the talks and hosting President Clinton and French President Jacques
Chirac by television hookup from their respective capitals.
</P>
<P>
	   By focusing international attention on the talks, Mandela hopes to prod
negotiators toward a settlement and secure outside interest in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Some observers criticized the high-tech, video diplomacy as time-wasting
nonsense, saying any accord will emerge from a more discreet, parallel
negotiating track with the two main rebel groups, which so far have not
participated in the Arusha process.
</P>
<P>
	   The suggestion was denied with a chuckle by Judge Mark Bomani, Mandela's
chief aide to the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A show is a good thing sometimes to create the climate for painstaking
negotiations,'' he said. ``The participants will get the message that the
outside world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then there is the issue of Mandela's record as a diplomat. For all his
accomplishments, he failed in peace initiatives to Zaire -- now the Democratic
Republic of Congo -- Sudan and Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if Mandela manages to brokers an agreement here in the coming months, a
key element has so far been excluded from the process: Burundians themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   With the exception of an elite few among the country's minority Tutsi and
majority Hutu, most of Burundi's 6.2 million people know little of the progress
of the talks. What they do know rests mainly on rumor and state-controlled
radio.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiators could come to some agreement, but there would be no
understanding of it because there's been no wide debate on the issues,'' said
Francis Rolt, director of Studio Ijambo, an independent radio news and features
production unit in the Burundian capital, Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Mandela invoked the recent past to warn of the perils of an
opaque negotiating process concluded under intense international pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 6, 1994, in this same town, the extremist Hutu government of
neighboring Rwanda and a Tutsi rebel force reached a power-sharing agreement
ending a nearly 4-year-old war. ``That led to what we all know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive jet returning the Rwandan president home was shot from the sky
that night, killing him and igniting the genocide of at least 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.

captured during a clash over control of a teachers' college, according to news
reports Sunday. Several police and protesters were injured during the weekend
protest in the Hidalgo state town of Tepatepec, 50 miles north of Mexico City,
the reports said. Protesters also burned more than a dozen police cars. The
latest violence began as hundreds of state police raided the school early
Saturday morning to end a seven-week student takeover.

<HEADLINE> Letters to Abraham Lincoln  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The debating advice to the Republican candidate could
hardly have been more direct: ``You are dealing with a bold, brazen, lying
rascal and you must fight the devil with fire.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was Aug. 27, 1858. Abraham Lincoln, in a tough race for the Senate, was
set to debate Sen. Stephen Douglas for the second time. And Joseph Medill, then
managing editor of The Chicago Tribune, advised Lincoln to ``give him hell,'' to
unsettle Douglas with sharp-pointed ``ugly questions'' about his views on the
slavery question.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hold (him) up as a traitor and conspirator, a bamboozling demagogue,'' he
told Lincoln. ``Give measure for measure and a great triumph awaits you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Medill's sulfurous campaign advice got a wider audience this month when the
Library of Congress put an initial installment of 2,200 of its more than 20,000
Lincoln papers on its Web site (http://www.loc.gov).
</P>
<P>
	   The Lincoln file has been available to the public since 1947, but reading it
meant cranking through miles of microfilm on mechanical projectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Now anyone with Internet access can read Lincoln's mail. The process is made
easier in many cases by typed transcriptions of the handwritten letters provided
by the Lincoln Studies Center at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Not surprisingly, many of the surviving letters to Lincoln are from
political supporters, many of them writing at the time of the pivotal
Lincoln-Douglas debates, which set the stage for Lincoln's presidential victory
in 1860.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hold him (Douglas) to a severe reckoning,'' said a writer in Jacksonville,
Ill. ``He has shown you no mercy and treated you with no honor or decency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Ill., who was to take initial charge of
the Lincoln papers following the president's 1865 assassination, offered this on
Aug. 25, 1858: ``Pour hot shot into Douglas all the time -- attack him through
his whole record -- in this way alone can the people see through him.''
</P>
<P>
	   A writer in Chenango County, N.Y., saw future promise in the newspaper
accounts of the debates. ``You have a chance which comes to but few men of each
generation,'' he told Lincoln. ``It is for you to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   When it was over, Lincoln had the largest number of votes but Douglas had
won election in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The result in Illinois has both astonished and mortified me beyond
measure,'' Judge Davis wrote his friend. ``There is one thing certain and that
is that you have nothing to blame yourself for. (You have earned) a national
reputation and made friends everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although we are beaten we are not whipped,'' an Illinois supporter told
the defeated candidate. In a letter peppered with misspellings he blamed the
result on ``misrepresentation on every hand, fraudulent voteing in all the
doubtfull districts -- and all the whisky shops in the land ...''
</P>
<P>
	   The advice and the comments continued after Lincoln won the presidency and
Southern states moved to secede from the Union and organize the Confederate
States of America.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You were last night hung in effigy in this city,'' a telegram from
Pensacola, Fla., informed the president-elect on Nov. 8, 1860.
</P>
<P>
	   A supporter in New Brunswick, N.J., explaining that he was a ``poor hard
working boy,'' told Lincoln he had ``worn my boots intirely out'' marching in
his behalf and asked for enough money to buy replacements.
</P>
<P>
	   A writer in New York City, declaring that he had earnestly and ``honestly
labored for your defeat,'' told Lincoln it was now his duty to travel through
the South and save the Union by promising Southerners to govern according to
strict constitutional principles.
</P>
<P>
	   But a Republican voter in Springfield, Ohio, reading hints in local
newspapers that Lincoln would issue such a statement, told him: ``Nothing could
be more humiliating to us and disastrous to our cause, than to see you, the
chosen leader of a bold and noble party, crawl upon your belly before a handful
of traitors in the South.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although most of the papers consist of letters written to Lincoln, there are
treasures written by the president himself. These include his first draft of the
Emancipation Proclamation, his second inaugural address, a private memo
expressing his belief he would be defeated in the 1864 election and the first
draft and reading copy of the Gettysburg Address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am naturally antislavery,'' Lincoln said in an April 1864 letter to a
Kentucky editor. ``If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember
when I did not so think ...''

<HEADLINE> Use of Guns Likened to Disease  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The willingness of young men to use guns spreads like a
disease, or even a fashion fad, through urban neighborhoods, often causing youth
to view firearms as essential to survival and status, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and Prevention,
said gun homicides among young men is a contagious impulse that becomes a
powerful social current, forcing even violence-averse youth to grab a firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found that guns become sort of a social toxin,'' Fagan said Sunday at
the national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
``Guns became a major influence on the way that one young man interacts with
another.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fagan said firearms become status symbols, a central part of a violence
theme that spreads like a fad from neighborhood to neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The presence of gun homicides in one neighborhood significantly increased
the likelihood of gun homicide in any of the surrounding neighborhoods during
the subsequent year,'' Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
	   He based the conclusion on an analysis of the rise and fall of fatal
shootings over many years in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   In interviews with scores of young men in urban neighborhoods, Fagan said,
he discovered that a gun, and the willingness to use it, can become a marker for
a young man's status in a community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns created an ecology of death,'' he said. ``All disputes become
potentially lethal.'' If a young man fails to carry a gun and then loses an
argument, he slips in social status and ``becomes prey, a potential victim.''
</P>
<P>
	   The young man's reaction, for safety and to regain status, is often to start
carrying a gun and to be ready to use it. And so the gun culture spreads, from
youth to youth, until gun ownership has ``eclipsed or devalued other
identities,'' Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Guns became part of their identity,'' he said. ``The decision to carry a
gun was very strategic.''
</P>
<P>
	   But like a disease epidemic or a fashion fad, said Fagan, gun violence can
fade, become stigmatized and socially unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
	   The study strongly suggests that a police focus on taking guns off the
street can be a successful way to control crime and violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another speaker at the AAAS meeting said a 25 percent decline in national
homicide rates among adults in the 1990s may be linked to society's increased
willingness to put people in prison and, ironically, to the decline in
marriages.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri,
St. Louis, said his study suggests there also is a ``civilizing influence'' at
work, creating a reduced tolerance for violence that includes increased respect
for the victims of domestic crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. incarceration rate was stable for 50 years, standing at about 110
people per 100,000 general population. Starting in 1973, society starting
putting more people in prison for longer sentences. The incarceration rate is
now 450 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   By removing people from the street during the years that they were most
prone to violence, the increased incarceration can be credited with about
one-quarter of the decline in adult homicide rate, Rosenfeld said. The rate
peaked at 16 per 100,000 population in 1980, dropped to 8.3 per 100,000 by 1995
and remains about there, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But if the fall in homicide rate is linked to more crowded prisons,
Rosenfeld said, it comes at a high price for society: A net increase of 670
prisoners a year yields one less homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you multiply 670 times the $20,000 it costs to house one prisoner,
you get $13.4 million,'' he said. Society must decide ``if that is too much to
avert one homicide.''
</P>
<P>
	   The sharpest decline in the homicide rate has been in the category that
includes spouses, family members and intimate partners, Rosenfeld said. One
major reason for this is the decline in marriages, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he said, ``Cultural changes are reducing the tolerance for
interpersonal violence.''

<HEADLINE> New Plan for U.S.-Africa Relations  </HEADLINE>
   By PAULINE JELINEK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed new plan for U.S.-African relations is to
begin landing on policy-makers' desk this week, following its passage in a
five-day convention of black Americans and others concerned about Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, approved Sunday at the close of the National Summit on Africa,
calls for a Marshall Plan-style reconstruction program among some 250
recommendations aimed at uplifting the impoverished continent.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit, a 3-year-old project, hopes to continue as a permanent lobby in
the United States for Africa, a part of the world that advocates say has long
been mishandled, misjudged and ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   They said copies of the plan would be sent to members of Congress, Clinton
administration officials, mayors and others and posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time has come for the elaboration of a new and bold policy toward
Africa,'' said the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the recommendations already constitute U.S. policy toward the
continent. Others have not been tried, such as the Marshall Plan idea. The plan
also includes suggestions for debt relief, improving trade and investment and
encouraging stronger democracy, better education, human rights and peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Africa needs a ``massive inflow of public and private capital and
technology,'' the document said. The United States should convene world powers
to devise a plan for reconstruction and reparations, it said, similar to the
Marshall Plan implemented by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendations said the plan should ``systematically transfer capital
and resources to Africa and people of African descent ... commensurate with
their historical losses due to slavery, colonialism and the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the group Thursday that she looks
forward to receiving the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear, however, how much of it might become policy. Critics of the
gathering pointed out that previous summits and seminars on Africa have done
little to stop violent conflicts in a dozen of its nations or to improve the
plight of other African countries that rank among the world's most impoverished
and undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't just have a five-day event,'' Senegal's ambassador to
Washington, Mamadou Mansour Seck, acknowledged Sunday. ``We have to have a
concrete follow-up, we Africans and you Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers said the summit already has shown accomplishment by bringing
together 5,000 people who can form the core of a new Africa lobby in the United
States. They include academics, business people, health professionals, former
Peace Corps members and African citizens living here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been extremely uplifting, inspirational. I'm persuaded that this
energy and momentum will be sustained through the country, particularly at the
state level, which is new,'' said Leonard Robinson, summit president and a
former assistant secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many, many people said to me that they never thought they would ever see
anything like this in their lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than development of the policy plan, the summit's main goals were to
form a stronger lobby and improve the continent's image beyond being a place of
unending poverty and conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit was attended mostly by Americans but also by about two dozen
diplomats, Cabinet ministers and other African officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, businesses
and others, has been in progress since late 1996. In 1998 and 1999, six U.S.
regional summits were held to come up with the plan approved Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The week's meeting was not without dissenters. Aleah Bacquie, of the New
York-based social and economic advocacy group Africa Fund, said some delegates
thought the proposed policy was too ``corporate-friendly'' and they were not
given enough opportunity to talk about environmental and social problems some
businesses have caused in their African dealings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did their money (sponsorship of the summit) buy the absence of critics?''
she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Iranians Seek Engagement  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is welcoming preliminary
results of parliamentary elections in Iran as pointing toward a stronger hand
for reformers who seek more freedom and engagement with the world.
</P>
<P>
	   In a warm statement Sunday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the balloting was a historic event, with the Iranian people showing they want
policies that give them more freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindful of persistent tensions between moderates, represented by President
Mohammad Khatami, and conservative clerics, Rubin said ``we hope the clear
desires of the Iranian people can be translated into reality by their elected
representatives, and we hope this trend will be reflected in a new approach in
Iran's relationship with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. relations with Iran were broken off when followers of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini took control in 1979 of a revolution that had overthrown the
Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and a mob of zealots seized the American Embassy
and held Americans there captive until January 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The election of Khatami in May 1997 was interpreted by U.S. policy-makers
and other analysts as a tilt toward moderation and an expression of
dissatisfaction with the strictures of the theocratic regime. The Clinton
administration undertook an effort to engage Tehran in a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials stressed that while it would have no preconditions,
the agenda would have to include U.S. complaints that Iran promoted terrorism,
was seeking to develop a mighty arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and was
trying to sabotage Arab-Israeli peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
	   The absence of a response suggested reformers had been unable to outweigh
the conservative Ayatollah Ali Khamanei and his followers.
</P>
<P>
	   But as results of the balloting Friday for the 290-member assembly began to
become clear Sunday, the State Department found grounds for optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although the reports of the results are not yet final, all indications are
that this election is an event of historic proportion,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Iranian people have demonstrated unmistakably that they want policies
of openness and engagement with the rest of the world, while making clear their
preference for international policies that allow them greater freedom in Iran,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Hillary Court Minority Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- On the eve of a debate with Bill Bradley at Harlem's
Apollo Theatre, Vice President Al Gore sought to reinforce his standing among
New York's minorities in the Democratic presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Renewing his call for an end to racial profiling by police and passage of
federal hate-crimes legislation, Gore told a largely black audience of more than
800 at an Albany church Sunday that the Republicans who hope to take the White
House are ``morally blind'' to racial concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, campaigning for the first time this year in New York with first lady
and Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, never mentioned Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The two rivals are to meet tonight at the Apollo, a Harlem landmark, in a
90-minute debate centering on urban and racial issues. Theater stage hands and
management reached a contract agreement Sunday, averting a threatened strike
that would have caused complications because both Gore and Bradley had vowed not
to cross a picket line.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ, the vice president
lambasted the Republicans in impassioned tones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind. ... Some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina,'' he said to laughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
statehouse, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, ``They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the GOP reaction -- rivals Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain have said the flag issue is something to be resolved by South Carolinians
-- reminded him of those who say that America has become color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds --
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to,'' Gore
said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady had warm words and hugs for each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up for her,'' he said.
``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the church appearance, Gore flew to New York City, where he met Sunday
afternoon with the editorial board of The Amsterdam News, an influential
black-oriented newspaper whose endorsement he is courting.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour church service was part of the annual weekend conference
sponsored by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. Minorities made
up 15 percent of voters in New York's 1998 election for governor and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the state's March 7
primary, which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New
York Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their
bids for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief interview Sunday with The Associated Press, Clinton said she was
``just honored to help him (Gore) in any way that I can. I was grateful for the
chance to appear with him, because I don't get to see him so often now that he's
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used to work together very closely on a lot of issues. ... I'm very
fond of him personally as well as very supportive of him as our next
president.''

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The flip-flop of the finish between the New Hampshire and
South Carolina primaries has brought a role reversal to the campaign styles of
Republican presidential rivals John McCain and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator, who beat the Texas governor decisively in New Hampshire
but suffered an 11-point loss in South Carolina, went on the attack Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' McCain told a rally in suburban Livonia, Mich.
``If Governor Bush is a reformer I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he supported campaign funding reforms such as his decision to
promptly post the names of his contributors on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise Bush, who attributed his South Carolina victory to a newfound
aggressiveness, reverted to a front-runner's posture of trying to ignore his
rival and instead lay out his agenda for the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like Senator McCain spent a lot of time talking about me, and I
want to spend a lot of time talking about the future,'' Bush told reporters
during a news conference in Southfield.
</P>
<P>
	   The stylistic differences came as the two competed with former ambassador
Alan Keyes in Tuesday's GOP primary. The election will award 58 convention
delegates, the biggest bounty to date in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, McCain was traveling to Traverse City, Saginaw and Ypsilanti, Mich.,
before heading to his home state. Arizona also was holding its primary Tuesday.
Bush planned to stay in Michigan today, campaigning in Detroit, East Lansing and
Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   After a run of early, isolated primaries, the campaign has gone national en
route to ``Super Tuesday.'' In elections on March 7, large states including
California and New York will award almost 60 percent of the delegates needed for
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is airing ads in California, Washington, North Dakota, Virginia,
Michigan and Arizona. McCain was advertising in Michigan, Washington, California
and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   That made Michigan, a classic swing state in general election campaigns, a
critical battlefield in the nominating contest.
</P>
<P>
	   To Bush's advantage, the primary will be the first contest where he enjoys
the institutional support of a fellow Republican governor, John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It helps to have a governor who is popular and strong,'' Bush said. ``It
helps to have a group of friends who we both can call upon to turn out the vote,
because this is a primary and primaries not only require a message and a
messenger, but they require a ground game -- a grass-roots organization that has
the capacity to take the energy and convert it to votes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout Sunday, McCain ratcheted up his attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' the senator said Bush's record on
spending compared unfavorably with President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said spending increased only 2 percent under
the governor when adjusted for inflation and a growing population. He added that
the governor cut the rate of spending growth in half -- again adjusted for
inflation and demographics.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Livonia rally, McCain said Bush had supported last year's omnibus
spending bill in Congress, a measure the senator said contained the ``most
outrageous pork-barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also picked up the endorsement of Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a former
Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   King said he made the switch out of anger that Bush had campaigned at Bob
Jones University in South Carolina, a school that critics say espouses
anti-Roman Catholic views -- a biting charge in a heavily Catholic state like
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That to me just showed a willingness to take any road to the White
House,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush responded by noting that his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is a
Catholic. Jeb Bush converted to the faith in 1995 after being married to a
Catholic woman for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is Mr. King suggesting I have an anti-Catholic bias because I went to a
university? I go to universities all the time,'' the Texas governor said. ``With
all due respect to Congressman King, he can make any decision he wants to make,
but he should not ascribe anything to my heart.''

<HEADLINE> Nader Making Bid for White House  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE PFLEGER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Ralph Nader, it's try, try and try again.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer advocate who has made several bids for the White House called a
news conference today to announce another run as a candidate for the
presidential nomination of the environmentalist Green Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Nader, a lawyer who first gained prominence taking on the auto industry in
the 1960s, received less than 1 percent of the vote when he ran in 1996. He
spent less than $5,000, taking no contributions and personally financing his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, Nader collected about 6,300 write-in votes in the New Hampshire
primary, sometimes drawing crowds that rivaled those of major-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Nader, who turns 66 this month, has fought for campaign finance reform,
environmental protection and fair trade, employing a network of nonprofit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   He faces competition for the Green Party nomination from at least three
other candidates, including Jello Biafra, lead singer for The Dead Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
	   Nader often shows disdain for the political process and has suggested that
the Republicans and Democrats leave voters with a choice between ``Tweedle-Dum
and Tweedle-Dee.'' He thinks third parties offer voters an alternative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Third parties are getting more visible,'' Nader said in 1996. ``The
aggregate of their votes will begin to affect the margin of victory for the
major party candidates.''

<HEADLINE> New Light Shed on Kohl, Mitterrand  </HEADLINE>
   By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- In the early 1990s, Europe was an old continent moving toward
a new order with a seemingly unlikely alliance in the lead -- conservative
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Socialist President Francois Mitterrand of
France.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl and Mitterrand joined to guide the region in those unsure days after
the fall of communism, the link soldered by their visions for the future -- and
how they played and, according to recent allegations, financed politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were not very democratic at heart. I think they had a very
interesting vision of Europe ... Europe was to be built from above,'' said
Anne-Marie Le Gloannec, deputy director of the Paris-based Center for
International Studies and Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Their relationship is under new scrutiny as part of a political party
financing scandal in Germany that has engulfed Kohl's Christian Democrats and is
chipping away at the reputation he earned as Germany's longest-serving
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   German and French television have reported that Mitterrand arranged for
payment of $15.7 million to Kohl's party in 1992 to help his friend's
re-election campaign. The reports said the money was part of $44 million in
payoffs made by French oil giant Elf Aquitaine for its 1992 purchase of a former
East German refinery at Leuna.
</P>
<P>
	   A German parliamentary committee investigating whether Kohl's government
took cash for political favors in the Leuna and other deals held its first
public hearing Thursday. The committee is trying to locate missing files
concerning the 1992 privatization of the Leuna refinery as well as the Minol gas
station chain while Kohl was still in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Elf Aquitaine, formerly a state-owned company, is the subject of a
meandering investigation into kickbacks in France.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations about funneling money to Kohl's party have not been proven.
French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou dismisses them as rumors, and Kohl's
spokesman says they are lies.
</P>
<P>
	   But the charges highlight the symbiosis that bound the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl's pet project was German reunification, while Mitterrand's was European
monetary union, and both needed each other for the success of their plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For Mitterrand, Kohl was the guarantor of the realization of monetary
union. He was the only political figure in Germany who had the political force
necessary to impose it on the Germans,'' said Hans Stark of the French Institute
for International Relations.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, the majority of Germans were not in favor of the
creation of a single currency, and many politicians said the project was a bad
idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl, in turn, needed France on his side if his ambitious plan to reunite
Germany was to succeed without reviving fears in a Europe that remembered the
Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
	   Le Gloannec said Mitterrand initially opposed reunification. ``Kohl was more
daring. He could figure out that reunification would come, but he knew he had to
assuage French fears,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitterrand finally accepted a single Germany, but that strengthened his
desire for political and monetary union in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mitterrand was a very conservative man in the sense that he had a vision
of Europe in which Europe should not change. But in spite of being conservative,
he very quickly understood he couldn't prevent reunification and that a unified
Germany had to be embedded in a unified Europe,'' Le Gloannec said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the kind of politics practiced by the two men, they may have been
intent on securing the foundations of democracy in Europe, but their behavior
smacked of more autocratic impulses.
</P>
<P>
	   Le Gloannec describes them as ``Metternich-like'' leaders -- a reference to
Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria who helped redraw the borders of Europe
after the Napoleonic Wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their shared goals, Mitterrand and Kohl were not imitations of one
another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mitterrand was the prototype of the French intellectual, very literary;
Kohl was more coarse and simple, a pure politician,'' said Olivier Duhamel, a
Socialist member of the European Parliament and a professor of politics at the
Sorbonne.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But they were both great Machiavellian opportunists who would do anything
for power, and the one constant for them was Europe.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Mayor Seeks Civil Bogota  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Sidewalks don't typically stir passions, but they
do for Mayor Enrique Penalosa, even if it means risking his job.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa faced a serious impeachment drive last year just for trying to stop
people from parking their cars on sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he has some people angry over a plan to turn a posh golf and polo club
into a park and a one-day ban on cars he's ordered for this Thursday -- to
demonstrate how much better Bogota would be without them.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's crusades are about more than just scofflaw parking or reducing
traffic and pollution. They symbolize what has become the goal of government in
one of Latin America's least-loved capitals: improving life by challenging
residents to put the common good ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   By trying to foster a sense of community, Penalosa hopes not just to soften
life's edges in Bogota, but to offer an example for other cities that aspire to
more than simply coping with the burdens of growth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the country urbanized quickly during the past 50 years, we learned
to survive, to build water mains, sewers, to open a lot of schools, to provide
electricity,'' Penalosa said in a recent interview. ``The challenge now is to
learn not to survive, but to live.''
</P>
<P>
	   One expert on Bogota's development puts it more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is no longer that there aren't any public telephones; it's to
get people to stop breaking them,'' said Fabio Zambrano, a historian at the
National University.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogota's experiments in civics -- Penalosa's predecessor deployed mimes to
shame the city's notoriously aggressive drivers -- might be the only path to
happiness for a metropolis lacking other obvious attractions.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprawled on a chilly, rain-soaked plateau at 8,500 feet above sea level, and
with a spine of mountains brooding over its eastern edge, Colombia's capital has
always been a spartan place.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogota's population has soared tenfold to 7 million over the past five
decades, ballooned by poor people flooding in from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   A huge increase in car ownership has created some of Latin America's worst
traffic jams, which are exacerbated by widespread flouting of traffic laws. Even
the shortest drive can be a frightening odyssey among smog-belching buses
swerving wildly to unload passengers or beat the competition to a fare.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the unpleasantness are Bogota's frequent hailstorms and average
annual rainfall of 37 inches, compared to famously drizzly London's 23 or
Seattle's 33.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the city's foul weather, infuriating traffic and unremarkable
architecture, Bogota's recent leaders have tried to at least build community
spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although it's not a city that the people care for very much, it has its
attractions,'' said Antanas Mockus, Penalosa's predecessor. ``It's a laboratory
for quickly changing the way people live together.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was Mockus who posted mimes at stoplights to teach civility. He
instituted a late-night bar-closing law that reduced homicides, and he got
residents to save water by taking shorter showers.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa, a Duke University graduate with a doctorate from France, has
carried out traditional projects like patching roads and opening parks. And this
year, his last in office, he plans to begin a public bus system over fierce
opposition from the powerful private bus companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalosa is most passionate, however, about the misuse of sidewalks, the
dispute that threatened his job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sidewalks are for children to play on, for couples to seduce, for old men
to sit down and read the newspaper and discuss politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why he ordered city workers to install hundreds of concrete barriers
along curbs last year, making it impossible for drivers to park their cars on
sidewalks. An impeachment campaign sprang up from irate motorists and angry
shopkeepers, who had turned miles of pedestrian walkways into clogged private
parking bays.
</P>
<P>
	   He fended off the critics, though, and opinion polls say his popularity is
rising. He earned 1999 man-of-the-year honors from Colombia's top two news
magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   To broad applause, the mayor recently reopened one of Bogota's most
deteriorated shopping districts with wide, clean walkways and not a car on the
sidewalk. He also has restricted car use during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps one of his stranger projects -- considering the weather -- is to
build 180 miles of bike paths that he says will encourage people to pedal to
work. ``Cars isolate people,'' he said. ``Bicycles integrate socially.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even if anti-social tendencies still abound, there are signs civility is
taking root. Crowds of rich and poor mingle peacefully every Sunday on the
``Ciclovia,'' a circuit of streets closed off to cars all morning.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 1.4 million Bogotanos -- bicyclists, joggers, in-line skaters
and dog walkers -- take to the outdoors each weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Some even swear the weather has improved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those of us who grew up in Bogota are convinced it's raining less,'' said
Mockus, the former mayor.

<HEADLINE> All Tap Water Not Created Equal  </HEADLINE>
   By VICKI SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- All tap water is not created equal.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, after sipping thousands of samples from all over the world, Arthur
von Wiesenberger knows this much: The shorter the journey from source to spigot,
the more pleasing it will be to the palate.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Wiesenberger, a California author and trained ``water master,'' will
help pick the best this weekend at the International Water Tasting in Berkeley
Springs, W.Va., the largest competition of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-year-old contest, which features water from more than two dozen
states and four countries, is expanding almost as rapidly as the $4.8 billion
bottled-water industry, which grows about 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's bigger than ever. There's nothing else quite like it,'' says
Wiesenberger, who will train amateur judges to gauge water in three categories
-- municipal, bottled non-carbonated and bottled sparkling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no other place for municipalities to compare their waters in a
non-biased environment,'' von Wiesenberger says from Santa Barbara, Calif. ``The
chance to be recognized ... is like winning the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Literally. There are big payoffs for commercial winners, who can proclaim
their victories on their bottle labels and increase sales.
</P>
<P>
	   For municipal competitors, though, it boils down to bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have tasted a lot of municipal water and I honestly feel none of it
compares to Mount Airy's water,'' says Gerald Johnson, a mayor from Maryland,
the home state of Mount Airy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, others might disagree,'' Johnson concedes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly, Mount Airy, Md., has competition: Among this year's entrants are
three-time winner Atlantic City, N.J., and two-time winner Charleston, W.Va.
Also back in the municipal category is last year's winner, Desert Hot Springs,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's really fascinating is the results, no matter who the judges are --
and the judges change every year,'' von Wiesenberger says. ``There's a certain
concentration of minerals that keeps coming up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Atlantic City may not win every year, but it consistently finishes in the
top five or 10, apparently using either a good filtration system or tapping into
a great source.
</P>
<P>
	   And Desert Hot Springs' victory last year ``flies in the face of assumptions
that southern California has bad water,'' von Wiesenberger says. It relies on a
pristine source, supporting the notion that the more natural a water is, the
better it will taste.
</P>
<P>
	   Other municipal water systems use as many as 30 chemicals to clarify and
flavor their water. They generally don't fare as well in competition.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep their senses sharp, the judges are forbidden to smoke, drink coffee
or alcohol, eat spicy food or chew gum within a half-hour of the contest. Like
wine-tasters, they will tap into senses of sight, smell and taste.
</P>
<P>
	   They hold clean, clear, hand-buffed glasses to the light and inspect the
water for clarity. Points are deducted for things like cloudiness and
discoloration.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the judges sniff, hoping not to smell sulfur, chlorine, mustiness or
swampiness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One judge described one entry as smelling like guppy water,'' von
Wiesenberger recalls. ``Sure enough, it came from a source that had fish in
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, they roll the water around the mouth, looking for a metallic or
chemical taste as well as saltiness, sweetness or bitterness. Ideally, none of
those should exist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But you're not looking for the absence of everything,'' von Wiesenberger
explains. ``If you wanted that, you could drink distilled water. But distilled
water leaves your palate tasting flat or dull. You want minerals, but you want a
certain combination.''
</P>
<P>
	   Potassium, for example, makes it sweeter; calcium and magnesium give it
fullness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm always fascinated to see how some of the returnees do,'' von
Wiesenberger says. Even perennial losers return year after year, often having
modified their processing to reflect the judges' comments.
</P>
<P>
	   And the contest likely will continue to grow. There are more than 900
commercial water bottlers in the United States, von Wiesenberger says, ``so
there's a lot of room for growth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But there are also those that would never want to enter because they know
they wouldn't fare well.''

<HEADLINE> 'The New Yorker' Marks 75th Year  </HEADLINE>
    By SHARON L. CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bylines seen in The New Yorker since its 1925 debut: F.
Scott Fitzgerald, Sylvia Plath and W.B. Yeats.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to mention Dorothy Parker, Truman Capote, E.B. White, W.H. Auden, Ogden
Nash and James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
	   The ghosts of such authors and artists help celebrate the venerable
publication's 75th anniversary, with the magazine's double-issue now on
newsstands,
</P>
<P>
	   Snatches of their vivid prose and pictures dot the magazine pages under the
headline "Takes," standing alongside a current offering about Fidel Castro's
public relations war over Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also an analysis of Martha Stewart which concludes she taps into the
power "of the woman who sits down at the table with the men, and, still in her
apron, walks away with the chips."
</P>
<P>
	   Woody Allen is back, ending his long hiatus as a contributing writer.
</P>
<P>
	   The man best known for his films and a headline-grabbing romance/marriage
with longtime paramour Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, Allen penned "Attention
Geniuses: Cash Only" for his return to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen's piece is a rambling, off-the-wall story of a therapist who daydreams
of accepting a musician's work in lieu of cash. It's a disastrous exchange, of
course, as the man's song titles include "The Earthworms of Tuscany."
</P>
<P>
	   The story is an amusing, fulfilling one of David Remnick's priorities as The
New Yorker's fifth editor. Allen has a tough time, however, competing with the
magazine's alumni.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's a sampling of the competition's work:
</P>
<P>
	   --E.B. White on learning to crank start the Model T: "It was a special trick
and until you learned it (usually from another Ford owner, but sometimes by a
period of appalling experimentation) you might as well have been winding up an
awning," White wrote in 1936. "Often, if the emergency brake hadn't been pulled
all the way back, the car advanced on you ... I can still feel my old Ford
nuzzling me at the curb, as though looking for an apple in my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   --Vladimir Nabokov on butterflies: "Through the smells of the marsh, I
caught the subtle perfume of butterfly wings on my hands, a perfume that varies
with the species; it was vanilla, or lemon, or musk, or a musty, sweetish odor
difficult to define."
</P>
<P>
	   --And Philip Hamburger on Mussolini's execution and subsequent hanging: "To
an outsider like myself, who happened to be on hand to see Mussolini, Clara
Petacci, Pavolini Starace, and some of the other Fascists dangling by their
heels from a rusty beaming front of a gas station, the breathless, bloody scene
had an air of inevitability. You had the feeling, as you have at the final
curtain of a good play, that events could not have been otherwise."
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Wallace Ross, a self-taught man rumored teasingly by his staff to
have finished reading but one book in his life, founded The New Yorker in 1925,
at first with the breezy about-town flair of 1920s New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, under the gentle guidance of Katherine White, who shepherded serious
fiction onto its pages, the magazine began to take shape. It took on the voice
that resonates today, somehow conjuring the whispers of Ernest Hemingway or
Gertrude Stein in the cafes of Paris, witty, intelligent, and yes, a little too
full of itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ross was an aggressively ignorant man, with a head full of odd scraps of
information and misinformation," reported longtime staffer Brendan Gill in his
1975 book "Here at The New Yorker." Driving home the point, he explains that
Ross might likely badger an author with the question: "Is Moby Dick the whale or
the man?"
</P>
<P>
	   Something of that tone comes through on the pages of The New Yorker even
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current Commentary offered by Anthony Lane, James Thurber is
remembered with the following quote: "Two overcoats which he left in The New
Yorker office last spring were stolen, or else he left them someplace else."
</P>
<P>
	   And much later, from Donald Barthelme in a "The Talk of the Town" recipe:
"About twenty pounds of sliced onion would be a good addition, although they
probably should have gone in earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   It's that tone, that something, that Remnick hopes to see more of.
</P>
<P>
	   After 18 months as editor, he says he still can't wait to come to work every
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine has had its troubles in recent years, including flagging
circulation and advertising sales, but all that appears to be on the rebound.
Circulation is up to 844,000 from 628,000 in recent years, and ad pages are up
37 percent this quarter, according to the director of public relations. About
76.7 percent of subscribers renew.
</P>
<P>
	   That means Remnick can focus on the fun stuff, like weekly cartoon meetings
and soothing ruffled writers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a real joy. Sure, it's exhausting and even once in a blue moon
frustrating and it's always difficult. It's always difficult to do the best you
can in so many ways," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   He says Anthony Lane, the commentary writer, summed it up best in advising
what to do when you inherit a tradition: "The crucial thing is not to ape it,
still less to seize up with awe, but to ask yourself what, by way of homage, you
can possibly bring to the party."
</P>
<P>
	   That, Remnick says, is what he is figuring out.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Denies Report of Defection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea on Monday denied a newspaper report
that a missile expert from communist North Korea had defected to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Quoting unidentified Chinese sources, Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest
daily newspaper, reported last week that Im Ki Song, 59, a North Korean missile
expert, defected to the United States via China in January, along with two
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Chosun Ilbo article on the defection of a North Korean missile expert
is groundless,'' the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a one-sentence statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The national Yonhap news agency, quoting an unidentified ministry official,
said South Korea had checked with the United States on the reported defection
and was told it was false.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul could not be reached for comment because it was
closed Monday for Presidents Day.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's missile capability has become a matter of worldwide concern
since the isolated country fired a three-stage rocket in 1998 that flew over
Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   After negotiations with the United States last September, North Korea agreed
to forgo further missile tests during the duration of talks with Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But the North is threatening to resume missile tests, complaining that the
United States is unwilling to drop its hostile policy toward the hard-line
communist regime.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea recently agreed to send a high-ranking official to Washington in
March to discuss ways of improving ties.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States fought against North Korea on South Korea's side in the
1950-53 Korean War. About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under
a defense treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 450 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since 1994, about
one-third of them in 1999. Many complained of hunger in their homeland.

<HEADLINE> China General To Streamline Forces  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- The head of China's air force said Monday his country will
streamline its huge military, and promised that Beijing would never ``invade or
threaten any sovereign state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Liu Shunyao was addressing high-level participants from around the
world who were taking part in a Millennium Air Power Conference in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu said the Chinese would aim at ``winning local wars directed against
China under high-tech conditions on short notice.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll stick to the road of streamlining the armed forces the Chinese
way,'' the air force commander said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that would include better weapons, military theories and training to
achieve the ``goal of defense plus offense.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the strong words, Liu also promised: ``China will never invade or
threaten any sovereign state. But it will definitely not allow any other country
to invade China.''
</P>
<P>
	   Liu has already urged rapid military modernization aimed at turning its 2.7
million-member army -- rooted in guerrilla warfare -- into a modern fighting
force armed with weapons to rival those of the United States and other Western
powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese anxieties have been fueled by the Persian Gulf War and NATO's war
against Yugoslavia, where Western forces used laser-guided bombs and other
weapons that China lacks.
</P>
<P>
	   China has poured tens of billions of dollars into upgrading its arsenal in
recent years, buying supersonic Russian fighter planes and developing cruise and
ballistic missiles.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Officials To Visit U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean military officials will visit the
United States this week as part of an investigation into an alleged mass killing
of civilian refugees by U.S. troops during the Korean War, the Defense Ministry
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Kim Jong-hwan, assistant defense minister for policy and planning,
will lead the six-member team, which will arrive Tuesday in Washington for a
five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip will mark the third meeting between military investigators from
both countries who are investigating the killings at No Gun Ri village. The last
meeting was held in mid-January when U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera visited
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides plan to discuss progress in their investigations, share
information and jointly interview some of the U.S. veterans who were allegedly
involved in the case, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing dozens of villagers and U.S. veterans, The Associated Press reported
in September that hundreds of Korean civilians were killed by American soldiers
at No Gun Ri in central South Korea in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   According to declassified U.S. military documents, American ground
commanders feared that North Korean soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, were
infiltrating refugee columns.
</P>
<P>
	   The governments of the United States and South Korea previously dismissed
the claims, but opened investigations after the AP report was published.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1950-53 Korean War, the United States led a 16-nation U.N. force in
the defense of South Korea against an invasion by North Korea, which was backed
by China and the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down, Japanese Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar inched down against the yen Monday in quiet trading
because of a market holiday in the United States. Japanese stocks fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.66 yen, down 0.08 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 110.96 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 245.28 points, or 1.23
percent, to finish the day at 19,543.75 points. On Friday, the average closed
down 2.37 points, or 0.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar traded in a narrow range partly because
U.S. financial markets were to be closed Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar slightly reversed its recent course.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past few weeks, the greenback has been moving higher against the
yen, thanks to favorable prospects for U.S. economic growth coupled with low
inflation and slightly higher interest rates -- all positive factors for the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the yen has been vulnerable to selling pressure after American
ratings agency Moody's Investors Services said last week it would review Japan's
local currency debt rating for possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.20 yen, down from 109.42 yen
late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei average finished lower on investor concerns
the U.S. economy could slow with future interest rate hikes. A weaker U.S.
economy would hurt Japanese companies that sell products there.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 295.05 points, or 2.8
percent, to close at 10,219.52 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed at 1,680.72, down 39.05 points, or 2.27 percent. The TOPIX
finished up 2.66 points, or 0.15 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 624 million shares changed hands on the First Section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 667.81 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Decliners overwhelmed advancers 1,046 to 222, while 95 issues were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8100
percent from Friday's finish of 1.8200 percent. Its price rose 0.09 point to
99.14.

<HEADLINE> Cops not trigger happy, experts say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the popular "Lethal Weapon" movies, the actors
portraying cops shoot their weapons endlessly, killing bad guys one after
another.
<P>
	   Those visions, coupled with the real-life shooting of Amadou Diallo - killed
in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four New York City police officers last year -
reinforce the stereotype that all cops are trigger happy.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to police officials and crime experts, the majority of police
officers never fire their weapons during their careers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well over 95 percent never shoot their weapons here," said New York City
Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year in New York City, with 41,000 cops, the largest force in the
nation, there were 155 incidents in which police fired their weapons. Forty-two
"offenders" - people being pursued for questioning or arrest - were shot by
cops, according to department firearms discharge statistics. Cops also shot
three bystanders - none was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 42 "offenders" shot, 11, including Diallo, were killed. Diallo was
standing in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building when four cops
approached him for questioning, officially putting him in the "offender"
category. The four are on trial for murder in Albany, N.Y., and testified they
thought they saw him with a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Four New York police officers were shot and wounded by perpetrators last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In spite of the low number of police shootings, there's the perception that
cops constantly fire their weapons, and according to Safir, no fan of the press,
it's the media's fault.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people are surprised that most officers never fire their weapons
because they've seen so much press based on one or two incidents," Safir said in
a recent interview. "The truth is, the media conditions people. It's the only
thing you hear about in the press, 41 shots and those kind of things."
</P>
<P>
	   "People hear 41 shots and they think it's not an aberration, when it's quite
an aberration," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Geraldine Majors, 52, an elementary school teacher who lives near the Bronx
street where Diallo was killed, said movies and TV shows reinforce the
stereotype of gun-toting, mean cops.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cops are always shooting at someone in the movies or TV," Majors said.
"Take that picture and add it to the perception enforced in young minority kids
from the poor neighborhoods that cops are bad. The Diallo shooting was nothing
new to us."
</P>
<P>
	   But in study after study, it's been proven that the majority of police
officers nationwide never fire their guns in their careers. In conversations
with several current officers of all ranks, with career spans of seven to nearly
20 years on the force, not one had fired his or her weapon. The officers all
wished to remain unidentified due to the Diallo trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But all had been in situations where they had to pull their weapons out of
their holsters.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the worst feeling in the world, having to pull your gun," said a
female detective with nearly 18 years of experience. "Because there's a chance
you may have to use it."
</P>
<P>
	   And most of the cops who do fire their weapons are assigned to the more
dangerous units, such as narcotics, or patrol in high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Geoffrey Alpert, a criminologist who studied police shootings in Miami over
a 10-year period, said most officers do their best to not get in the situation
where deadly force is required.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's true in LA, true in Chicago, true in Miami, true in New York," said
Alpert, a professor at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   And the officers who are involved in shootings are those in certain units,
said Willam A. Geller, a criminologist who co-authored "Deadly Force: What We
Know," a book on police shootings nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "The likelihood that you're going to use your weapon in the line of duty
depends hugely on a given city," said Geller, who runs a consulting firm in
Illinois. "It also depends on your unit, such as special street crime kinds of
units."
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers accused of murdering Diallo all belonged to the NYPD's
Street Crime Unit, whose goal was to patrol high crime neighborhoods to search
for illegal guns, and sometimes to investigate a violent crime pattern. The
officers stopped Diallo because they thought he matched the description of a
serial rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   And, unlike Hollywood, police are trained to use their weapons only as a
last resort, wrote Louis Anemone in the NYPD's 1998 Firearms Discharge Data
Report. Anemone, now retired, was chief of department - the highest ranking
uniformed officer - when the Diallo shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent telephone interview, Anemone said that message has not gotten
out to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   "They NYPD is the most restrained department in the nation among large
departments, when it comes to the use of deadly physical force," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police shootings in New York City have steadily declined in the 1990s, and
Safir attributes that to good training.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a tactics house at the firing range and police officers get a real
sense of when to shoot and not to shoot," he said. "We go through so many
scenarios and change them so often that they don't become routine."
</P>
<P>
	   Other large departments, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
report low incidences of police shootings as well. But in 1998, the Washington
Post published a series revealing that the District of Columbia police shot and
killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other large U.S. police
department. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1999 for the
series.
</P>
<P>
	   The series prompted action by city and federal officials. Police Chief
Charles Ramsey asked the Justice Department to probe a decade of police
shootings to try to restore public confidence, and announced a sweeping
retraining program for the entire force.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research
group, said retraining may be needed in other cities to prevent some shootings
that result from the cultural gap between black suspects and white police.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police need more training - cultural training," said Williams, who once
headed the Newark, N.J., police department. "We need to engage in a broader set
of parameters that involves the culture of inner city youth. We need to draw
from savvy street officers, who day after day engage these young kids and never
shoot anybody."

<HEADLINE> The New Yorker magazine celebrates 75 years in print  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bylines glimpsed in The New Yorker since its 1925 debut:
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sylvia Plath, W.B. Yeats.
<P>
	   Dorothy Parker, Truman Capote, E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
	   W.H. Auden, Ogden Nash, James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
	   With the magazine's double-issue now on newsstands, the ghosts of authors
and artists past help celebrate the venerable publication's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Snatches of their vivid pictures and prose dot the magazine pages under the
headline "Takes," standing alongside a current offering about Fidel Castro's
public relations war over Elian Gonzalez. There's also an analysis of Martha
Stewart that concludes she taps into the power "of the woman who sits down at
the table with the men, and, still in her apron, walks away with the chips."
</P>
<P>
	   Woody Allen is back, ending his long hiatus as a contributing writer.
</P>
<P>
	   The man best known for his films and a headline-grabbing romance-marriage
with longtime paramour Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, Allen penned "Attention
Geniuses: Cash Only" for his return to the magazine. The piece is a rambling,
off-the-wall story of a therapist who daydreams of accepting a musician's work
in lieu of cash. It's disastrous, of course, as the man's song titles include
"The Earthworms of Tuscany."
</P>
<P>
	   The story is an amusing, fulfilling one of David Remnick's priorities as The
New Yorker's fifth editor. Allen has a tough time, however, competing with the
magazine's alumni.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's a sampling of the competition's work:
</P>
<P>
	   -E.B. White on learning to crank start the Model T: "It was a special trick
and until you learned it (usually from another Ford owner, but sometimes by a
period of appalling experimentation) you might as well have been winding up an
awning," White wrote in 1936. "Often, if the emergency brake hadn't been pulled
all the way back, the car advanced on you ... I can still feel my old Ford
nuzzling me at the curb, as though looking for an apple in my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   -Vladimir Nabokov on butterflies: "Through the smells of the marsh, I caught
the subtle perfume of butterfly wings on my hands, a perfume that varies with
the species; it was vanilla, or lemon, or musk, or a musty, sweetish odor
difficult to define."
</P>
<P>
	   -And Philip Hamburger on Mussolini's execution and subsequent hanging: "To
an outsider like myself, who happened to be on hand to see Mussolini, Clara
Petacci, Pavolini Starace, and some of the other Fascists dangling by their
heels from a rusty beaming front of a gas station, the breathless, bloody scene
had an air of inevitability. You had the feeling, as you have at the final
curtain of a good play, that events could not have been otherwise."
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Wallace Ross, a self-taught man rumored teasingly by his staff to
have finished reading but one book in his life, founded The New Yorker in 1925,
at first with the breezy about-town flair of 1920s New York. Later, under the
gentle guidance of Katherine White, who shepherded serious fiction onto its
pages, the magazine began to take shape. It took on the voice that resonates
today, somehow conjuring the whispers of Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein in
the cafes of Paris, witty, intelligent, and yes, a little too full of itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ross was an aggressively ignorant man, with a head full of odd scraps of
information and misinformation," reported longtime staffer Brendan Gill in his
1975 book "Here at The New Yorker." Driving home the point, he explains that
Ross might likely badger an author with the question: "Is Moby Dick the whale or
the man?"
</P>
<P>
	   Something of that tone comes through on the pages of The New Yorker even
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current Commentary offered by Anthony Lane, Thurber is remembered
with the following quote: "Two overcoats which he left in The New Yorker office
last spring were stolen, or else he left them someplace else."
</P>
<P>
	   And much later, from Donald Barthelme in a "The Talk of the Town" recipe:
"About twenty pounds of sliced onion would be a good addition, although they
probably should have gone in earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   It's that tone, that something, that Remnick hopes to see more of.
</P>
<P>
	   After 18 months as editor, he says he still can't wait to put his pants on
every morning and come to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine has had its troubles in recent years, including flagging
circulation and advertising sales, but all that appears to be on the rebound.
Circulation is up to 844,000 from 628,000 in recent years, and ad pages are up
37 percent this quarter, according to the director of public relations. About
76.7 percent of subscribers renew.
</P>
<P>
	   That means Remnick can focus on the fun stuff, like weekly cartoon meetings
and soothing ruffled writers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a real joy. Sure, it's exhausting and even once in a blue moon
frustrating and it's always difficult. It's always difficult to do the best you
can in so many ways," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   He says Anthony Lane, the commentary writer, summed it up best in advising
what to do when you inherit a tradition: "The crucial thing is not to ape it,
still less to seize up with awe, but to ask yourself what, by way of homage, you
can possibly bring to the party."
</P>
<P>
	   That, Remnick says, is what he is figuring out.

<HEADLINE> Cast members and fans come to terms with impending close of 'Cats'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The mood was somber yet nostalgic as the news sunk in
with cast members and fans alike that "Cats," the longest-running show in
Broadway history, will close in June after a record-breaking 7,397 performances.
<P>
	   "When we got the news there were tears, sure, and hugs. And believe it or
not there was lots of laughter. Somehow everybody knows in their heart that
nothing goes forever," said Marlene Danielle, who has played the feline
character Bombalurina since the show started in October 1982. "We brought the
show into the new millennium. How much more can you really expect?"
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, which has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, will bring down the
curtain June 25, after a nearly two-decade run at Broadway's Winter Garden
Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats," which is advertised as "Now and Forever" and has long been a major
tourist attraction, will have been seen by more than 10 million theatergoers in
New York by the end of the run.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's grosses on Broadway alone are estimated to be more than $380
million. Yet in the last two years, its weekly receipts have been dwindling, at
times falling to only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the lean winter
months after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bound to happen someday. When you look at it, we're running into our
18th year and the houses have been slow. It's a business, and they have to make
their money," Danielle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although cast members admitted to being sad and disappointed, they said that
knowing the end is near makes the remaining performances even more special.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really very exciting to be a member of the last cast," said Lenny
Daniel, 33, who plays the character Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of the show were saddened by the news but also expressed a feeling of
nostalgia upon learning that the show would not really be "Now and Forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the news I was devastated," said uber-fan Hector
Montalvo, a Manhattan computer software salesman who said he has seen the show
670 times. "This is such a sad thing, but I guess all good things must come to
an end."
</P>
<P>
	   Montalvo, tears streaming down his face, waited in line for Sunday's
matinee.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the 10th time I have seen it, and I must admit I'm feeling pretty
sad," said Ernie Puglise, a music teacher from Connecticut who took his classes
many times over the years to see the show. "I really think it's the best musical
ever written."
</P>
<P>
	   Both performers and fans, however, admitted that despite the show's
impending closing they were optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've all been auditioning for other things because we knew this had to
happen at some point," said Tesha Bess, who has played the character Rumple
Teaser for the last 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Montalvo, the fan, said that although he was upset he knew that life would
go on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've made friends with a lot of the cast and I look forward to seeing them
in their future projects," he said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> Veteran's death recalls Navy record - six brothers who served at  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager hands motivated by empty stomachs reached out
toward the parked car with its rumble seat full of sacks leaking dirt.
<P>
	   In the midst of the small crowd stood a contingent of the Martin boys. The
teen-agers handed out potatoes from the heaping bags - a bounty brought back to
their neighborhood in Flushing, Queens, from an overnight excursion to dig up
potatoes that otherwise would go unharvested on Long Island farms.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 1930s, the Great Depression. Everyone was poor, and everyone was
familiar with hunger. The potatoes meant a sure meal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Martin boys were known for banding together to help out. That's why no
one was surprised when a few years later six of the brothers joined the Navy in
World War II, even though no six sons from one family ever served in the Navy at
one time - before or since
</P>
<P>
	   The boys got their spirit from their dad, who toiled at two jobs to feed a
family of 13, brought starving families home to dinner, and once paid an
out-of-work bricklayer to repair the family fireplace - which was not really
broken - in hopes it would restore the man's pride.
</P>
<P>
	   Like their dad, the boys believed in family - theirs was seven brothers,
three sisters, their parents and an uncle - and in community, in an age when
many city neighborhoods were as caring as small towns. That's why the neighbors
found it natural when most of the Martin sons went off to World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody questioned it," recalled sister Agnes Martin. "Nobody thought it was
anything outstanding. It was always what people did."
</P>
<P>
	   Each time a Martin walked into the recruitment office, their mother grabbed
needle and thread and added another gold star to the navy blue flag at the front
window. The six stars represented her boys: John Jr., Edward, William, James,
Charles and Robert.
</P>
<P>
	   All survived the war, and now this unusual chapter in the U.S. military's
history has closed. Charles, the last remaining brother, died late last month
following a lengthy illness at age 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Military historians doubt one family will ever contribute so many sons again
to a war. That is due partly to today's smaller families. In 1930, a U.S family
averaged 4.1 people, and it was not unusual for a couple to have a half-dozen
sons. Today, the average family size is about 2.5.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just finding six brothers of military age, well, I guess you could, but it
wouldn't be probable," said Jerry Cooper, a professor of U.S. military history
at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "You can say the differences are more
demography and social change, rather than anything to do with the military."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the military has changed. The country is not at war, the draft is
gone, and the military has downsized. Most expansion is focused on technology,
not numbers. And as on expert explained, the appeal for volunteering has faded,
too.
</P>
<P>
	   "In those days, it seemed like a respectable thing to do," said Charles
Moskos, a professor of military sociology at Northwestern University in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   But Moskos said this doesn't mean the military has no family connections.
"Husbands and wives serving together - that's the new military," Moskos said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that women make up 15 percent of the armed forces and estimated
that 50 percent of them are married to servicemen.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Martins, little made their story special beyond the number of
brothers. Yes, they all fought, even participating in every World War II theater
involving U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
	   But their sacrifice pales when compared with that of the Sullivans, five
brothers all killed serving together on a cruiser sunk by a Japanese torpedo in
1942. When the news hit the states, a horrified Congress approved the "Sullivan
Act" forbidding siblings from serving on the same ship.
</P>
<P>
	   A few of the Martin boys had served together at one time or another, but
never all on the same ship. Early in the war, Mrs. Martin urged daughter Agnes
to write a letter asking President Roosevelt to put the boys together.
</P>
<P>
	   She came to Agnes in a panic when the Sullivans were killed and was relieved
to learn her daughter had put off the letter since some of the boys didn't like
the idea of saluting one brother who had been promoted.
</P>
<P>
	   "My mother was crying and on her knees, praying in gratitude," Agnes Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   So the Martins' story wasn't "Saving Private Ryan" - the recent film about
World War II that capitalized on the notion of a country not only sending
brothers-in-arms, but real brothers, into battle together.
</P>
<P>
	   What the Martins did was serve their country, supporting the Allies'
victory. James Forestall, then Secretary of the Navy, sent the family a letter
lauding the sons' patriotism.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, the brothers came home, started families, and began spreading
throughout the New York area. William returned to Japan to marry a woman he had
met. Each got a job, frequently utilizing technical skills.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles became a cook in Brooklyn and later, like some of his brothers, an
airline engineer. After retiring, he volunteered at the Brooklyn School for
Special Children, where one of his son's had been educated.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Martins talked little about their service during the war, their
children knew they never forgot it.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were damn proud of it, too - not of the six thing - but that they did
their duty," said Elizabeth Egan, Charles Martin's daughter. "They felt it was
their obligation as United States citizens to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   For at least one of the brothers, it came close to never happening. Robert -
the smallest of an already diminutive brood - needed the help of his sisters to
make the weight to enlist. To add some pounds, they mixed a concoction of eggs,
heavy cream and beer for him to drink before the weigh-in. But that wasn't
enough, and it took a well-timed foot on the scale from an older brother for
Robert to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the desire to serve the country, there was at least one other reason
the boys enlisted. Their Uncle James had been an army man who served in five
wars. When he retired, he moved in with the family and his pension helped pay
some bills. So the boys grew up hearing James' war stories.
</P>
<P>
	   The tales must have had some impact. But Agnes Martin recalled something
else that played an important role. Mrs. Martin was a talented seamstress who
made her first sons sailor suits when they were little, and these later were
passed on to brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We always thought it was so ironic," Agnes Martin said. "It was almost a
premonition."

<HEADLINE> Abuse Alegations Against TV Groom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox has canceled the rebroadcast of its highly-rated
special "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" after learning that the groom,
Rick Rockwell, once was accused of hitting and threatening to kill an
ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   "In light of that new information, the network feels that to rebroadcast the
special would be inappropriate, and consequently we have removed it from our
schedule," the network said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancellation was ordered by Fox Television Network chairman Sandy
Grushow.
</P>
<P>
	   The repeat was to air Tuesday night, a week after Rockwell, a real estate
investor and motivational speaker, chose a bride from a group of 50 women he had
never met. The two-hour special drew a huge audience. Viewership grew from 10
million viewers in the program's first half-hour to an enormous 22.8 million in
the final half-hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, 42, and his new wife, emergency room nurse Darva Conger, 34, were
scheduled to return from their Caribbean cruise honeymoon Sunday night and were
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Fox contacted Rockwell, and he confirmed a restraining order had been
issued against him nine years ago, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the Web site TheSmokingGun.com posted court records filed
against Rockwell by Debbie Goyne, a woman who described herself as his former
fiancee. She said she lived with Rockwell for more than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Goyne's 1991 petition accuses Rockwell of shoving and slapping her, twice
entering her home without permission and vandalizing her car after she broke off
their engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recently, he said he would find me and kill me," her court papers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued a restraining order
prohibiting Rockwell from coming within 100 yards of Goyne for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Goyne could not be reached for comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how the "Millionaire" cancellation would affect Fox's plans
for another such special in May, the next sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
	   The special sparked plenty of controversy because of its premise and format,
which included women parading around in bathing suits and wedding dresses for
Rockwell, who was not shown on-camera until the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said it checked out Rockwell's financial records and determined he was
worth "at least $2 million."
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell was born Richard Balkey in Pittsburgh and now lives near San Diego.
From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, he was a regular on the Southern California
comedy club circuit and appeared on a comedy show on KFMB-TV as a geeky beach
bum.

<HEADLINE> Broadway's 'Cats' To Close  </HEADLINE>
    By LUKAS I. ALPERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tears streamed down Hector Montalvo's cheeks as he waited
outside the Winter Garden Theater to see the feline musical "Cats" -- yet again.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Sunday's matinee, he'd already seen the record-breaking show 670
times. And the show's announced closure in June -- after a record-breaking 7,397
performances -- was scratching him up inside.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the news, I was devastated," said Montalvo, a Manhattan
computer software salesman. "This is such a sad thing, but I guess all good
things must come to an end."
</P>
<P>
	   Marlene Danielle, who plays Bombalurina, was somber, too: Her nine lives --
make that over 7,000 lives -- are now winding down.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we got the news there were tears, sure, and hugs," said Danielle, who
has played the role since the show began in October 1982. "And believe it or
not, there was lots of laughter. Somehow, everybody knows in their heart that
nothing goes forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought the show into the new millennium," she said. "How much more can
you really expect?"
</P>
<P>
	   The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical will bring down the curtain June 25, after a
nearly two decade run on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of its run, "Cats" -- with its "Now and Forever" slogan -- will
have played to more than 10 million theatergoers in New York. On Broadway alone,
its grosses are estimated to be more than $380 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But its receipts have dwindled in the last two years, at times falling to
only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the lean winter months after
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you look at it, we're running into our 18th year and the houses have
been slow," Danielle said. "It's a business, and they have to make their money."
</P>
<P>
	   While saddened, cast members said news of the closure will make the
remaining shows special.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people cherish the performances," said Lenny Daniel, 33, who plays
the character Alonzo. "Everything sharpens, and you focus on what I can do to do
the best and enjoy the time the absolute most. That's the general feeling. Every
moment on that stage now, there's a countdown."
</P>
<P>
	   Other fans were harder hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the tenth time I have seen it, and I must admit I'm feeling pretty
sad," said Ernie Puglise, a Connecticut music teacher who brought classes to the
show over the years. "I really think it's the best musical ever written."
</P>
<P>
	   But fans and cast members were optimistic about a life beyond the show's
final rendition of its signature song, "Memories."
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all trying to leave with the attitude that this is just another door
opening rather than one closing," said performer Lenny Daniel.
</P>
<P>
	   Tesha Bess, who has played the character Rumple Teaser for the last 1 1/2
years, said cast members have "all been auditioning for other things because we
knew this had to happen at some point."
</P>
<P>
	   And Montalvo said life will go on for him, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've made friends with a lot of the cast," he said, "and I look forward to
seeing them in their future projects."

    HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock closed sharply lower Monday on the back
of last week's tumble on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 245.28 points, or
1.23 percent, to finish the day at 19,543.75 points. On Friday, the average
closed down 2.37 points, or 0.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nikkei average fell on fears the U.S. economy could slow with future
interest rate hikes. A weaker U.S. economy would hurt Japanese companies that
sell products there.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 295.05 points, or 2.8
percent, to close at 10,219.52 on Friday. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index
fell 137.18 points to 4,411.74.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's losses were cushioned by a sharp rise in shares of Sony Corp.,
whose PlayStation2 game console is expected to meet with strong demand when it
goes on sale March 4.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 110.58 yen, down 0.16 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 110.96 yen
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean shares plunged, with the key index falling 3.8 percent in
reaction to the sharp fall on Wall Street. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index
fell 33.82 points 845.32.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index fell 276.79 points, or 1.7
percent, to close at 16,322.37. On Friday, the index had tumbled 382.07 points,
or 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are worried about further increases in U.S. interest rates
following a warning last week by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
that such action may be needed to keep U.S. inflation in check.
</P>

fall and on weak regional sentiment. The benchmark Straits Times Index fell
61.51 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2,115.85.
</P>
<P>
	   MANILA: Philippine shares slumped, dragged down by heavy foreign selling
after Wall Street's huge loss and the ongoing probe into trading irregularities
involving shares of gaming group BW Resources Corp. The 30-company Philippine
Stock Exchange Index fell 50.44 points, or 2.7 percent, to 18,33.84.
</P>
<P>
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed lower as investors rushed to sell technology
stocks after Nasdaq's 3 percent fall Friday. The Weighted Stock Price Index fell
248.38 points, or 2.4 percent, to 9,912.67.

<P>
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed little changed. The NZSE-40
Capital Index edged up 0.63 point tp 2,031.85.
</P>
<P>
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed slightly lower in thin trading as
many investors sat on the sidelines with the U.S. closed for a public holiday on
Monday. The All Ordinaries Index closed at 3,117.1, down 3.0 points, or 0.09.
</P>
<P>
	   KUALA LUMPUR: The key index fell on profit-taking. The Composite Index,
which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, closed at 1,007.13 points, down 6.14 points

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Big Bird, Kermit and Miss Piggy better brush up
on their German.

<P>
	   Munich-based EM.TV and Merchandising AG is buying the Los Angeles-based Jim
Henson Co., creator of the Muppets -- the biggest U.S. name to go German since
Chrysler was bought up by Daimler-Benz to form DaimlerChrysler AG in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The cash-and-stock deal announced today is worth $680 million.

<P>
	   "By acquiring The Jim Henson Company, we gain some of the most powerful and

	   The Jim Henson Co. rose to international fame from its humble founding in

Street," first broadcast in 1969, is seen in 140 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV, which is well-established in Europe with television and marketing
rights to the popular Japanese animation Pokemon as well as Bugs Bunny in
Germany, said the deal would help it penetrate the American and Asian markets
where Jim Henson's Muppets already have deep roots.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, EM.TV plans no shakeups for the Jim Henson crew, which will continue
to have creative independence from its headquarters in Los Angeles, New York and
London, said Florian Haffa, Thomas Haffa's brother and deputy chairman of EM.TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. has been run by Henson's son and daughter and chief
operating officer Charles H. Rivkin since Henson's death in 1980. They all will
stay on.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Germany, we have a term that comes from English, 'Never change a winning
team,"' Haffa said.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyout also gives EM.TV rights to more than 5,000 licensed Muppet
products that have hit toy stores over the past 10 years, including the
talking-and-laughing Tickle Me Elmo doll, which at one point triggered buying
frenzies at toy stores across the United States. It will also control more than
30 million Muppet books sold in 45 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. also has production agreements with the American cable
company Odyssey Channel, Capital Cities/ABC and Sony's Columbia Tristar Home
Video in the home video arena.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV says it wants to work with the Henson Company on investing more in the
fast-growing Odyssey Channel, which is operated jointly with Hallmark
Entertainment. Odyssey Channel is seen in nearly 30 million households in the
United States, though officials hope to increase that number to 50 million
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded by Thomas Haffa in 1989, EM.TV produces children's and family
programs, manages the distribution of such TV shows as "Pigs Next Door" and

episodes marketed under the brand Junior.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- The Financial Times trademark pink newsprint, a
business accessory for English-reading executives for 112 years, launched its
first foreign-language spinoff Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial Times Deutschland hit newsstands with 200,000 copies -- of which
50,000 were paid subscriptions -- underlining the growing importance of business
news in Europe's biggest economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Envisioned as an alternative to the leading German business daily,
Handelsblatt, the Financial Times Deutschland has its own staff of more than 130
reporters focusing on German companies, German economics and the latest German
financial trends.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason for all this is clear. Germany is at the center of a European
economic revival brought about by falling trade barriers and fierce competition.
With the recent takeover battle between Britain's Vodafone AirTouch PLC and
rival telecom company Mannesmann AG, Germans are more aware than ever about the
ramifications of a global economy -- and they want to know more.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest is fueled by the growing enthusiasm about investing in German stock
markets, which have ridden the worldwide wave of rising prices to new highs in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   The inaugural issue of FT Deutschland headlines an interview with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and a story about corporate restructuring at the
German electronics firm Siemens.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper says it hopes to have a subscriber base of 120,000 within five
years, rivaling Handelsblatt, which has 170,000. The English-language version of
The Financial Times has 20,000 readers in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The FT Deutschland is based in Hamburg and has the latest closing deadline
of any German newspaper, 10:30 p.m. It will be published in conjunction with the
magazine group Gruner and Jahr, which is owned by German media giant
Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Handelsblatt has been beefing up for the competition,
pumping millions of dollars into the German paper to give it a new face, with
brighter colors, more background reports and analysis pieces and a new emphasis
on high growth areas of information technology, telecommunication and
e-business.

<HEADLINE> Allegations against 'Millionaire' groom cause Fox to scrap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Fox has canceled the rebroadcast of its highly rated
special "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" after learning that the groom,
Rick Rockwell, once was accused of hitting and threatening to kill an
ex-girlfriend.
<P>
	   "In light of that new information, the network feels that to rebroadcast the
special would be inappropriate, and consequently we have removed it from our
schedule," the network said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancellation was ordered by Fox Television Network chairman Sandy
Grushow.
</P>
<P>
	   The repeat was to air Tuesday night, a week after Rockwell, a real estate
investor and motivational speaker, chose a bride from a group of 50 women he had
never met. The two-hour special drew a huge audience. Viewership grew from 10
million viewers in the program's first half-hour to 22.8 million in the final
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, 42, and his new wife, emergency room nurse Darva Conger, 34, were
scheduled to return from their Caribbean cruise honeymoon Sunday night and were
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Fox contacted Rockwell, and he confirmed a restraining order had been
issued against him nine years ago, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the Web site TheSmokingGun.com posted court records filed
against Rockwell by Debbie Goyne, a woman who described herself as his former
fiancee. She said she lived with Rockwell for more than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Goyne's 1991 petition accuses Rockwell of shoving and slapping her, twice
entering her home without permission and vandalizing her car after she broke off
their engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recently, he said he would find me and kill me," her court papers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued a restraining order
prohibiting Rockwell from coming within 100 yards of Goyne for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents listed Goyne's Redondo Beach address from nine years ago. But
a phone listed to a D. Goyne in Redondo Beach was not in service and she could
not immediately be found for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how the "Millionaire" cancellation would affect Fox's plans
for another such special in May, the next sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
	   The special sparked plenty of controversy because of its premise and format,
which included women parading around in bathing suits and wedding dresses for
Rockwell, who was not shown on-camera until the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said it checked out Rockwell's financial records and determined he was
worth at least $2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell was born Richard Balkey in Pittsburgh and now lives near San Diego.
From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, he was a regular on the Southern California
comedy club circuit and appeared on a comedy show on KFMB-TV as a geeky beach
bum.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bank Repays Government Loan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. said Monday it will pay back
public funds borrowed under a government bailout program two years ago, becoming
the first bank to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's largest commercial lender said in a statement it will repurchase
$904.3 million in subordinate bonds from the government-backed Resolution and
Collection Corp. on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Though it was not obliged to pay back the money for at least five years, the
bank decided to do so this month after judging its capital-adequacy ratio was
sufficiently "healthy," bank official Keiichi Riko said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi applied for the funds under a $16.3 industry
stabilization plan approved by the government in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time, a drop in Tokyo stock prices and in the value of the yen
threatened to leave many banks with insufficient levels of capital to do
business overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   Helped by a rebound in the stock market and gains by the yen, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi's group capital-adequacy ratio had risen to 11.1 percent as of
September 1999 from 8.53 percent in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank for International Settlement requires a capital-adequacy ratio of
at least 8 percent for internationally operating banks.

<HEADLINE> EU Extends MCI WorldCom-Sprint Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators have extended their
probe into MCI WorldCom Inc.'s $130 billion bid for Sprint Corp. by an
additional four months, the European Commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU regulators are concerned about the giant U.S. telecommunications
merger's impact on access to the so-called Internet backbone; the trans-Atlantic
telephone market and services to multinational businesses, said Michael
Tscherney, the commission spokesman on antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the commission said it has serious doubts about the
companies' control of the Internet backbone. According to the commission's
figures, the Clinton, Miss.-based MCI WorldCom has between 30 percent and 40
percent of that market while the Westwood, Kan.-based Sprint has around 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission fears the merged company's leading role would erode the
current system under which companies offering top-level connectivity on the
Internet backbone carry other companies' traffic for free in return for the same
privilege on other carriers' systems.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to meet concerns about the business services and trans-Atlantic
telephone call side of the merger, Sprint sold its stake in the Global One
venture with European carriers Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom in January.
</P>
<P>
	   However the EU Commission said it still has concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Commission will also look at how the market for international voice
telephony on the EU-U.S. route might be affected as the merger may lead to MCI
Worldcom/Sprint and AT&AMP;T having bottleneck control on the U.S. end," it said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission is also concerned about the market for global
telecommunications services to multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Together with the Concert alliance, the merged entity would appear to
control the majority of the market" for services to multinational companies, it
said. Concert is an alliance between British Telecom and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU Commission said it rejected the companies' argument that the Global
One sale would remove its concerns over internet access, multinational business
services and transatlantic calls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the negligible involvement of Global One in the market for top-level
internet connectivity this undertaking could not remove the serious doubts
raised," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   It also said it will continue to work closely with the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission and the Department of Justice in assessing the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU decision comes a few days after the end of the FCC's comment period.
The proposed merger has come under criticism in the United States because of
concern over the long-distance telephone and Internet access markets.

<HEADLINE> Henson Co. Sold to German Media Co.  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Big Bird, Kermit and Miss Piggy better brush up
on their German.
</P>
<P>
	   Munich-based EM.TV and Merchandising AG is buying the Los Angeles-based Jim
Henson Co., creator of the Muppets -- the biggest U.S. name to go German since
Chrysler was bought up by Daimler-Benz to form DaimlerChrysler AG in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The cash-and-stock deal announced today is worth $680 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "By acquiring The Jim Henson Company, we gain some of the most powerful and
enduring kids' and family brands worldwide and get access to the world's biggest
and most important media market," said Thomas Haffa, chief executive of EM.TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. rose to international fame from its humble founding in
1958 with the hit television series "Sesame Street," "The Muppet Show," "Jim
Henson's Muppet Babies," "Fraggle Rock" and a string of Muppet films. "Sesame
Street," first broadcast in 1969, is seen in 140 countries.
</P>

	   EM.TV, which is well-established in Europe with television and marketing
rights to the popular Japanese animation Pokemon as well as Bugs Bunny in
Germany, said the deal would help it penetrate the American and Asian markets
where Jim Henson's Muppets already have deep roots.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, EM.TV plans no shakeups for the Jim Henson crew, which will continue
to have creative independence from its headquarters in Los Angeles, New York and
London, said Florian Haffa, Thomas Haffa's brother and deputy chairman of EM.TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. has been run by Henson's son and daughter and chief
operating officer Charles H. Rivkin since Henson's death in 1990. They all will
stay on.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Germany, we have a term that comes from English, 'Never change a winning

</P>
<P>
	   The buyout also gives EM.TV rights to more than 5,000 licensed Muppet
products that have hit toy stores over the past 10 years, including the
talking-and-laughing Tickle Me Elmo doll, which at one point triggered buying
frenzies at toy stores across the United States. It will also control more than
30 million Muppet books sold in 45 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. also has production agreements with the American cable
company Odyssey Channel, Capital Cities/ABC and Sony's Columbia Tristar Home
Video in the home video arena.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV says it wants to work with the Henson Company on investing more in the

<HEADLINE> Singapore Defends New Market Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in
Parliament Monday defended the government's recent easing of stock exchange
rules. He was responding to questions about the dangers of high-risk Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The recently loosened rules were necessary to enable capital markets to fund
a new economy based on high-tech and knowledge-based industries, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Otherwise either high-tech companies will be choked off from equity
capital, or they will list overseas, for example, on Nasdaq, and our stock
market will wither," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee was responding to questions from legislator Wang Kai Yuen, who expressed
concerns in Parliament about how Singaporeans "can participate in the Internet
boom without being sucked into the asset bubble."
</P>
<P>
	   Wang suggested that the government "express stronger words of caution
regarding new IPOs (initial public offerings) of dot.com companies," he said,
comparing this to "the practice of printing warnings on packs of cigarettes."
</P>
<P>
	   Lee acknowledged that there were risks involved in some high-tech stocks,
but said Singaporean investors could educate themselves and make informed
decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Risk taking is the essence of the new economy," he said. "But we will
educate the public in the risks, so that people know what they are doing, and do
it with their eyes open."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the recent change in rules, five companies have been listed that
wouldn't have qualified under the old rules.
</P>
<P>
	   They are MediaRing.com, Horizon.com, ST Assembly Test Services Ltd.,
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., and China Toll Bridges and Roads
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee said the new listing rules and the philosophy behind it are sound.
</P>
<P>
	   "The government cannot stop companies from being listed on the Singapore
Exchange because it thinks their business is too risky, or their shares are
priced too high," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that what the government can do is to enforce the rules of the
market.

<HEADLINE> Havas Advertising Buys Snyder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- France's Havas Advertising SA confirmed Monday that it has
bought Snyder Communications Inc. in a stock deal worth $2.07 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The move makes Havas the world's fourth largest advertising concern, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new group will have a market capitalization of $6.42 billion and annual
revenues of more than $19 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Havas' chairman, Alain de Pouzilhac, said in a statement that the Snyder
deal gave the French group a chance to step up its North American presence.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition will nearly double its revenues from the United States,
boosting them from 30 percent to 45 percent of overall sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The French company said the new group formed after the absorption of
Bethesda, Md.-based Snyder will be 70 percent controlled by current Havas
shareholders and 30 percent by Snyder.
</P>
<P>
	   Half the new group's clients will be in telecommunications, technology,
financial services, media and healthcare, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Havas' largest shareholder -- French giant Vivendi SA -- is likely to see
its stake in the advertising group diluted to 14.5 percent from its current 20.7
percent as a result of the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement has now been submitted for approval by both regulatory
authorities and the two groups' shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Both boards have already given their go-ahead, and Havas says it expects the
transaction to be closed by mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Snyder group comprises four separate advertising and marketing agencies:
Arnold Communications, Bounty SCA Worldwide, Brann Worldwide and Circle.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Snyder shareholders will receive $29.50 per share, representing Havas
Advertising common shares, which will be registered with the Securities &AMP;
Exchange Commission and listed in the United States once the deal is sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   The new group will be the world's fourth largest advertising concern behind
U.S. groups Omnicom and Interpublic and Britain's WPP, Havas said.

<HEADLINE> CGU, Norwich Union Plan Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Insurance companies CGU PLC and Norwich Union PLC are
combining in a $12 billion stock deal that will form Britain's biggest insurance
group.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company, to be called CGNU, would have a market value of about $30
billion. It would be the largest provider of general insurance and the
second-largest provider of life insurance in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said today that 5,000 jobs or 7 percent of their total work
force, will be cut as part of the combination. Shareholders of the two companies
and British financial authorities still must approve the all-share transaction.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company, which would be called CGNU, would be Europe's fifth-biggest
insurer and be based in London.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would give the combined company strong positions in several
European and international markets, said CGU chief executive Bob Scott, who is
to continue in the same role at the new group.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, CGU shareholders would control 58.5 percent of the new
group, while Norwich Union shareholders would control 41.5 percent of the group.
CGU would appoint nine of the group's 17 directors.
</P>
<P>
	   A wave of consolidation has swept Britain's insurance and financial services
sectors. Royal Bank of Scotland won a $33.6 billion takeover bid for National
Westminster earlier this month, while Lloyds TSB acquired the insurance group
Scottish Widows last June.

<HEADLINE> Charges Surface Against TV Groom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox canceled the rebroadcast of its highly rated special
"Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" after learning that the groom, Rick
Rockwell, once was accused of hitting and threatening to kill an ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   "In light of that new information, the network feels that to rebroadcast the
special would be inappropriate, and consequently we have removed it from our
schedule," the network said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cancellation was ordered by Fox Television Network chairman Sandy
Grushow.
</P>
<P>
	   The repeat was to air Tuesday night, a week after Rockwell, a real estate
investor and motivational speaker, chose a bride from a group of 50 women he had
never met. The two-hour special drew a huge audience. Viewership grew from 10
million viewers in the program's first half-hour to an enormous 22.8 million in
the final half-hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, 42, and his new wife, emergency room nurse Darva Conger, 34, had
been scheduled to return from their Caribbean cruise honeymoon Sunday night and
were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   But Fox contacted Rockwell, and he confirmed a restraining order had been
issued against him nine years ago, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell denied the accusations, CBS News reported today. "Relationships
have ups and downs but getting physical, for me, is not an option," Rockwell
told CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, the Web site TheSmokingGun.com posted court records filed
against Rockwell by Debbie Goyne, who described herself as his former fiancee.
She said she lived with Rockwell for more than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Goyne's 1991 petition accuses Rockwell of shoving and slapping her, twice
entering her home without permission and vandalizing her car after she broke off
their engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recently, he said he would find me and kill me," her court papers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge issued a restraining order
prohibiting Rockwell from coming within 100 yards of Goyne for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Goyne could not immediately be reached for comment. The documents listed
Goyne's Redondo Beach address from nine years ago. But a phone listed to a D.
Goyne in Redondo Beach was not in service today.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear how the "Millionaire" cancellation would affect Fox's plans
for another such special in May, the next sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
	   The special sparked plenty of controversy because of its premise and format,
which included women parading around in bathing suits and wedding dresses for
Rockwell, who was not shown on camera until the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox said it checked out Rockwell's financial records and determined he was
worth "at least $2 million."
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell was born Richard Balkey in Pittsburgh and now lives near San Diego.
From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, he was a regular on the Southern California
comedy club circuit and appeared on a comedy show on KFMB-TV as a geeky beach
bum.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell has bought and sold several Southern California properties in
recent years and told Fox he is a real estate developer.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Break NATO Barrier  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers fired tear gas
today at thousands of ethnic Albanians who broke through a cordon and hurled
stones as they tried to enter the Serb part of this ethnically divided town.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10,000 Albanians reached the main bridge in the center of Kosovska
Mitrovica, which divides the Serbs from the ethnic Albanians. Hundreds of
red-and-black Albanian flags flew on the southern, Albanian side of the bridge
over the Ibar river.
</P>
<P>
	   On the northern bank, about 4,000 Serbs were positioned near the bridge.
Some who had gathered there earlier began to flee, while others fought to
reinforce their positions. Some Serb women and children began evacuating the
town.
</P>
<P>
	   The French brought in reinforcements and armored vehicles to strengthen
their cordons on the bridge, firing tear gas to hold off the Albanians, who had
broken through an earlier cordon set up to hold them back. Later, British
peacekeepers put four armored personnel carriers across the bridge to keep the
crowd from crossing, and some Albanians who tried to climb over the vehicles
were pushed back.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier today, NATO suspended in some areas a massive house-to-house weapons
search that was launched early Sunday in response to weeks of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``KFOR had to take some of its soldiers away to provide security for these
demonstrations,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Philip Anido, a NATO spokesman in Pristina,
adding that the suspension was only temporary and the search would ``carry on.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. police and NATO-led troops accompanied the demonstrators, who were
heading from the provincial capital, Pristina, on a 25-mile march to Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. military vehicles and soldiers lined the side road leading into the
center of the town. Marchers had been banned from entering for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   As the march made its way north, hundreds of people from villages and towns
along the route joined in the protest. Others set up along the roadside, loaded
with food and drinks for the marchers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No to Partition of Kosovo'' and ``Without Mitrovica there is no Kosovo''
read banners carried by demonstrators. Other marchers carried Albanian and
American flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this peaceful march we want to make it clear to the whole world that
(Kosovska) Mitrovica cannot be partitioned, because it means very much for all
the people of Kosovo,'' said Jeton Balaj, 24, a student participating in the
march.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Albanians fear the ethnic division between the Serb-controlled north
and majority ethnic Albanian south sides of the town could eventually lead to
the northern side being given to Serbs altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The northern industrial town, has been a flashpoint for ethnic tensions
since the peacekeeping force entered Kosovo in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently, nine people were killed and dozens injured in ethnic violence
that followed a rocket attack on a U.N. bus that killed two Serb civilians on
Feb. 2. French troops, who are permanently stationed in the town, have been
criticized by U.N. police and ethnic Albanians for failing to provide security
for Albanians living on the Serb side.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of weapons seized Sunday was modest considering the more than
2,300 peacekeepers deployed in the search operation. Peacekeepers found dozens
of automatic rifles, several plastic explosives and a large amount of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten Albanians and one Serb were arrested Sunday, Anido said. One Serb and
one Albanian remained in custody Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two American peacekeepers were slightly injured Sunday when angry Serbs
pelted them with stones and bricks, who accused them of aggressive behavior in
house-to-house searches. At least three Serbs were also reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb officials complained bitterly about alleged acts of violence and
intimidation committed by the U.S. troops. ``Americans were smashing doors,
destroying furniture. There was no reason for such behavior,'' said Oliver
Ivanovic, a local Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Russel Berg, an American deputy public affairs officer, defended the
troops and military police as ``very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no action on the part of the American soldiers'' warranting
tension with the Serbs, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Extends MCI WorldCom-Sprint Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators have extended their
probe into MCI WorldCom Inc.'s $130 billion bid for Sprint Corp. by an
additional four months, the European Commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU regulators are concerned about the giant U.S. telecommunications
merger's impact on access to the so-called Internet backbone; the trans-Atlantic
telephone market and services to multinational businesses, said Michael
Tscherney, the commission spokesman on antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the commission said it has serious doubts about the
companies' control of the Internet backbone. According to the commission's
figures, the Clinton, Miss.-based MCI WorldCom has between 30 percent and 40
percent of that market while the Westwood, Kan.-based Sprint has around 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission fears the merged company's leading role would erode the
current system under which companies offering top-level connectivity on the
Internet backbone carry other companies' traffic for free in return for the same
privilege on other carriers' systems.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to meet concerns about the business services and trans-Atlantic
telephone call side of the merger, Sprint sold its stake in the Global One
venture with European carriers Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom in January.
</P>
<P>
	   However the EU Commission said it still has concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Commission will also look at how the market for international voice
telephony on the EU-U.S. route might be affected as the merger may lead to MCI
Worldcom/Sprint and AT&AMP;T having bottleneck control on the U.S. end," it said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission is also concerned about the market for global
telecommunications services to multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Together with the Concert alliance, the merged entity would appear to
control the majority of the market" for services to multinational companies, it
said. Concert is an alliance between British Telecom and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU Commission said it rejected the companies' argument that the Global
One sale would remove its concerns over internet access, multinational business
services and transatlantic calls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the negligible involvement of Global One in the market for top-level
internet connectivity this undertaking could not remove the serious doubts
raised," the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprint spokesman James Fisher said the ruling was expected. "We assumed that
due to the nature of the proceedings, this would be extended, and we certainly
figured that into our plans," he said. "The issues they are looking at we feel
can be and will be fully addressed to their satisfaction."
</P>
<P>
	   MCI WorldCom said in a statement that it would work with the EU to provide
whatever information it needed and that it remained confident that the deal
would be approved.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU Commission also said it will continue to work closely with the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice in assessing the
deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU decision comes a few days after the end of the FCC's comment period.
The proposed merger has come under criticism in the United States because of
concern over the long-distance telephone and Internet access markets.

<HEADLINE> Sithe Sells 21 Plants to Reliant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Reliant Energy is buying 21 power plants from Sithe
Energies, a privately held electricity producer whose generators dot the Middle
Atlantic region, for $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal gives Houston-based Reliant a major foothold in one of five regions
the company is targeting as it expands its unregulated power generating
capacity. Sixteen of the plants Reliant is acquiring from Sithe Energies are in
Pennsylvania, with four in New Jersey and one in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale is expected to be finalized by midyear.
</P>
<P>
	   "These newly acquired assets, which will be managed closely with Reliant's
trading, origination and development activities in the region, will position us
well to pursue follow-on opportunities to control additional generation and
serve complex customer needs," said Joe Bob Perkins, president of Reliant Energy
Wholesale group.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal also includes 18 sites Reliant could use to expand or build new
power plants that are adjacent to or near the existing power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   New York-based Sithe is one of the largest power producers in the United
States. It is owned 60 percent by the French water and utilities giant Vivendi,
29 percent by the Japanese trading firm Marubeni and 11 percent by its two
cofounders.
</P>
<P>
	   A Vivendi spokesman said the sale was made in part because of the high costs
necessary to compete in the quickly deregulating U.S. energy market.
</P>
<P>
	   Vivendi has been concentrating on the services side of the energy business
through its Paris-based Dalkia unit, which manages heating networks and other
facilities. Synergies between the European unit and the U.S. one were few and
far between, Vivendi officials said. The energy unit also was dwarfed by
Vivendi's telecommunications investments.
</P>
<P>
	   "U.S. deregulation of the business was such that it needed considerable
capital to grow," said Vivendi spokesman Alain Delrieux. "When we did our
strategic review six months ago, we saw that synergies (with Dalkia) were
relatively weak because they weren't the same businesses. ... Was Vivendi, given
those synergies, ready to pour in a lot of capital? That was the issue and we'd
decided to invest elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
	   Sithe and Vivendi also announced the formation of K Road Ventures, an
Internet energy company focused on business-to-business ventures.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Language Heroes Honored  </HEADLINE>
   By FARID HOSSAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Nearly 100,000 barefooted people converged on a
monument Monday to pay tribute to five Bangladeshi students who were shot and
killed by police nearly five decades ago during a protest over the suppression
of the national language.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 21, 1952, university students revolted when the Pakistani rulers
declared Urdu the only official language, although people of Bangladesh -- at
that time the eastern wing of Pakistan -- speak Bangla. Bangladesh won
independence from Pakistan in 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   Braving chilly winds, men, women and children -- who wore no shoes or socks
as a mark of respect -- waited in long lines to place wreathes at the monument
in central Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
	   Many came from nearby towns and villages. Dozens also came from neighboring
India, traveling from West Bengal state where Bangla is also spoken.
</P>
<P>
	   The ceremonies began with President Shahabuddin Ahmed, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia placing wreathes studded with marigolds
and roses at the monument -- three curved stone pillars in the form of a bowing
human being.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been standing in the line for two hours and this is worth the
occasion,'' said Sharmina Nargis, a Dhaka University student.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 1952 protests, thousands of students took to the streets,
demanding that both Urdu and Bangla be recognized as official languages. Police
cracked down on the protesters, killing five.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Bangladeshis have observed Feb. 21 as Language Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was the day when we realized that we will have to gain our
independence,'' said Abdul Matin, who participated in the 1952 protest as a
student.
</P>
<P>
	   Bangladesh successfully proposed last year to the United Nations that Feb.
21 be deemed International Mother Language Day. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan issued a message published by Dhaka newspapers commemorating the event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This day will help raise awareness among all peoples about the distinct
and enduring value of their languages,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The language celebrations in Bangladesh focus on literary and cultural
achievements, and include book fairs and awards for writers.

<HEADLINE> Bill would lift ban on Sunday deer hunting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Deer populations are exploding across New Jersey,
and now officials are thinking about lifting the state's 97-year-old ban on
Sunday hunting.
<P>
	   While some towns retain "blue laws" prohibiting shopping or car sales on
Sunday, the ban on hunting is one of the few Sunday laws that still applies
across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. William Schluter, R-Mercer, said it is time to revisit the law
because deer now pose an epidemic problem for farmers and motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey Division of Fish &AMP; Wildlife Director Bob McDowell says the deer
hunting ban has always seemed inconsistent since other shooting sports are
permitted on Sundays and fishing has always been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is that a lot of hunters don't have the time to get out in
the woods anymore," McDowell told The Record of Hackensack for Monday's
editions. "Now they might have the chance to enjoy themselves and thin the deer
herd at the same time."
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's 2000-2001 deer hunting season will run from mid-September
through January. Farmers who sustain crop damage are eligible for special 30-day
licenses at other times of the year, but even they are prohibited from shooting
deer on Sunday. An estimated 100,000 people are currently licensed to hunt in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Economic Growth and Agriculture committee last week approved the
Schluter bill, S-810, sending it to the full Senate for consideration. It would
only apply to counties with rural areas and it would permit local town councils
to choose for themselves whether or not to maintain the Sunday ban.
</P>
<P>
	   Schluter told the newspaper he believes most towns in his legislative
district would jump to permit Sunday hunting. Although he lives in a Mercer
County suburb, his district covers all of Hunterdon County and rural parts of
Warren County. Figures show deer have made travel on rural roads increasingly
hazardous, especially at night, and farmers have increased their complaints
about crop damage from deer forage.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an extreme measure, but these are extreme times," Schluter said. "The
deer must be stopped."
</P>
<P>
	   McDowell said, "There are a lot of farmers out there that really need help."
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday hunting bill is one of several deer-control measures being
pursued by lawmakers who represent rural areas. One bill would revamp the
state's carcass pickup program, which is struggling to keep pace with the road
kill, while another bill would set up a system to process deer meat for donation
to the state's needy.
</P>
<P>
	   But those who oppose deer hunting as a means of controlling the population
believe the expansion of hunting is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat McElroy, a wildlife researcher at the Humane Society of the United
States in Washington, said clearing the way for Sunday hunting is not worth the
trade-off for the majority of residents who may want to enjoy at least one day
outdoors without the danger of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why make our woods less safe for the tiny minority of people who want to
hunt?" McElroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials say more than 15,000 deer were found dead or dying on New
Jersey highways in 1998, almost twice the number found just a decade ago.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than a
quarter-million highway accidents in 1997 involved animals, mostly deer,
including 142 fatal accidents nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers, meanwhile, said the simultaneous growth in deer population and
suburban housing tracts has concentrated deer onto the remaining farm acres.
</P>
<P>
	   "I say bring the hunters on Saturday, Sunday, every day," said Delaware
Township farmer Ken Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Clinton campaign complains about Giuliani "hypocrisy"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign accused Senate
rival Rudolph Giuliani on Monday of having "cornered the market on hypocrisy"
after records showed the mayor took money from a source he had criticized the
first lady for tapping.
<P>
	   At issue is a $750 September donation to the New York City mayor's campaign
committee from a political action committee linked to the Loral Space and
Communications company.
</P>
<P>
	   After being informed of the donation by a reporter, Giuliani campaign
spokeswoman Kim Serafin said "it is our intention to return that money."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the Giuliani campaign issued a news release complaining
about "the Clinton campaign's funny-money machine" and "the reemergence of the
same cast of characters at the center of the worst finance abuses that marred
the 1996 presidential campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   As evidence of that, the Giuliani camp cited "Bernie Schwartz of Loral Space
and Communications, which is currently under Justice Department investigation
over the illegal transfer of missile technology to China. Donated to Mrs.
Clinton $40,000."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal election records show the Clinton campaign and related committees
received the $40,000 from Loral chief Bernard Schwartz and his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, Schwartz has been one of the Democratic Party's biggest
donors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rudy Giuliani has cornered the market on hypocrisy," Clinton campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said. "Soon the mayor will accuse us of arresting the
homeless and cutting $7 billion from city schools."
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp has been critical of the mayor's push to have homeless
people arrested who refuse to leave the streets and for his attacks on the New
York City school system.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Clinton attack served to highlight the extensive research that
each is doing on the other's voluminous fund-raising reports that were filed
with the Federal Election Commission at the end of last month. Over the final
six months of last year, Republican Giuliani raised $8.8 million for the Senate
race while Democrat Clinton raised about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to uncovering the recent $750 donation from the Loral Spacecom
Civic Responsibility Fund, the Clinton campaign also found that Giuliani's
mayoral campaign committee received $750 from Schwartz in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Giuliani camp, citing Clinton's FEC report, has complained
that she has reimbursed the federal government just $34,000 as of the end of
last year for political trips to New York on government aircraft. The mayor's
aides have said she should pay more than $300,000 more than that to cover the
real costs of such travel. Her aides have said they have reimbursed the federal
government for everything they are required to.

<HEADLINE> High Oil Prices Barely Affect Japan  </HEADLINE>
    By SCOTT STODDARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Takayuki Sunamura's gas station is getting squeezed.
</P>
<P>
	   With the doubling of global crude oil prices over the last year, his
supplier is charging him more for gasoline, but customers refuse to pay more at
the pump and often go searching for lower prices that are available in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a sign of how petroleum isn't as critical a factor for the Japanese
economy as it once was, even though Japan still imports all its oil and is only
just beginning to recover from the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time oil prices skyrocketed -- in the mid-1970s -- the government
ordered neon signs turned off at night, gas stations to close on Sundays and
holidays, and the partly state-owned NHK TV to cut its hours. Resource-poor
Japan, the world's second largest economy, sank into recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, aside from shrinking profits at some filling stations, where gas
typically costs the equivalent of $3.28 a gallon, there are few signs of
economic pain.
</P>
<P>
	   "Japan is becoming less of a manufacturing-driven economy and more of a
service-type of economy, so the price of oil plays less of a role," said Matthew
Poggi, an economist at Lehman Brothers (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   The story is similar in many Asian countries. The reasons range from shifts
in manufacturing to less energy-dependent businesses to expanding uses of other
energy sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil is a lot less important these days," said Scott Weaver, deputy head of
research at ING Barings Securities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has worked hard since the '70s to reduce its reliance on oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices started rising last February when the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production to reverse a drop in prices. Since
then, the price of oil has soared from $10 to $25 a barrel, the highest in nine
years, the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy said.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Japan still imports almost all of the oil that its factories and
households consume, few worry anymore about the impact of oil prices on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs,
told reporters Thursday that higher oil prices won't hinder the nation's
economic recovery. The government expects the economy to grow 0.6 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 31, following two straight years of contraction.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has greatly reduced its dependence on oil imports, Kuroda said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of Japan's electricity is now supplied by nuclear
reactors, compared with just 6.5 percent during the 1970s oil crisis, the energy
agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, cleaner industries such as software development and engineering
services are growing relative to oil-guzzling manufacturing industries like
steel and autos.
</P>
<P>
	   The reduced dependence on oil lets Kuroda and his colleagues at the Finance
M@)try worry about other things, such as the yen's recent rise against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   "The level of the exchange rate is more important than the level of one
particular commodity," said Lehman's Poggi.
</P>
<P>
	   The Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan in recent months have intervened
in the currency market, selling yen for dollars to weaken the Japanese currency.
They say a strong yen could derail Japan's nascent economic recovery because it
makes Japanese products more expensive in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil, on the other hand, has gone from newspaper headlines to a trade
statistic.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's current account surplus -- the nation's broadest measure of trade --
shrank in 1999 for the first time in three years in part because Japan had to
pay more for oil imports. The surplus has long been a source of friction with
the United States and other trading partners.
</P>
<P>
	   Back at street level, though, the service stations are struggling.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying not to raise prices," Sunamura said. "If we do, they'll just
go somewhere else."
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, many of Japan's service stations, whose attendants bow
politely, pump the gas themselves and wipe clean the outside and inside of
vehicles for free, are trying to provide even more services to attract picky
customers.

<HEADLINE> Former TV Producer Tries Teaching  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) -- Smoke billowed from gutted buildings near Joanne
Brough's home. Student protesters rioted in the streets. The Indonesian economy
was teetering, and rioters in Jakarta were demanding a change of leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   Brough and her husband, Charles, an American couple caught in the middle of
a fight they barely understood, were forced to flee, leaving their possessions
behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The former producer and developer of prime-time soap operas like "Falcon
Crest" and "Dallas" was used to drama and intrigue, but she never counted on
getting caught up in a real national crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   She was working for two years in Jakarta helping produce a locally grown
soap.
</P>
<P>
	   "Towards the end, there were armed guards in the studio and barbed wire
around everything," Brough says. "I wanted a little adventure. I got more than I
expected."
</P>
<P>
	   A year and a half later, the 71-year-old Brough has landed back in her
hometown of Joplin -- a quiet nook in southwest Missouri that offers a lifestyle
"just right for someone who had to escape a revolution."
</P>
<P>
	   Semi-retired now, Brough is on to Act Two of her life, teaching a television
script-writing course twice a week at Missouri Southern State College.
</P>
<P>
	   "Does anyone know what a cliffhanger is?" she asked her students during one
recent class as she loads a "Falcon Crest" rerun into the VCR.
</P>
<P>
	   In the clip, the vineyards of the show's California valley have fallen
victim to an earthquake. A woman rushes around her house calling out for her
fiance, then finds him dead on the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't hurt if you have a cliffhanger at the end of every scene,"
Brough explains.
</P>
<P>
	   Her students hang on her every word. Most of them realize by now that
Brough's resume reads like a page from TV Guide: For most of the 1960s and '70s,
she oversaw the development of series like "Kojak," "Hawaii Five-O," "All in the
Family," "M A S H," "Dallas" and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show" at CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1978, she moved over to Lorimar Productions and became vice president of
creative affairs for all on-air programs, and in 1986 was promoted to executive
producer of "Falcon Crest," where she stayed for four years.
</P>
<P>
	   For a woman who spent nearly half her life running a piece of Hollywood,
Brough is amazingly humble, but not without confidence -- a strange mix of your
favorite aunt and "Falcon Crest" matriarch Angela Channing.
</P>
<P>
	   One minute she'll tell you about a shrewd business lunch with foreign TV
executives, and the next laugh about the time she was convinced her dentist had
given her a truth serum anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
	   "I only knew one secret, and when I came to I found myself saying to the
dentist, 'Would you like to know who shot J.R.?"' she says, shaking her head. "I
guess the pressure was a little too much."
</P>
<P>
	   She also likes chatting about the hundreds of TV personalities she hired and
worked with.
</P>
<P>
	   Jane Wyman (Angela Channing) was one of her favorites.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I was working I tried to keep relationships on a professional level.
But in the case of Jane, we just got to be great friends," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, Brough traveled to Rome to film "Killer Rules," a two-hour TV movie
about the mafia. She then spent three years in Singapore developing "Masters of
the Sea," the first English-language drama on Asian television.
</P>
<P>
	   Her biggest challenge came in 1996 when Indonesia's No. 1 network, RCTI,
asked Brough to create from scratch an in-house drama department.
</P>
<P>
	   She was to produce a local soap opera along the lines of "Dallas." So she
set to work on "Dua Sisi Mata Uang" (Two Sides of the Coin) -- a
J.R.-Ewing-meets-the-Waltons brand of show.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans might not have recognized it as a soap: Local customs meant no
kissing on screen, and the budget was a mere $42,000 per episode, compared to
about $1 million for "Dallas" and "Falcon Crest."
</P>
<P>
	   Brough managed to film 26 episodes before the civil unrest in 1998 forced
her to evacuate. She and her husband moved back to Joplin a year ago. The
teaching job keeps her busy, and she plans to take her class on a study tour of
Hollywood and Singapore this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Her other favorite pastime? Watching her old TV shows, especially when her
name appears in the credits.
</P>
<P>
	   "That never gets old," she says.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Purchasing System Flawed  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A system designed to rid the Pentagon of outrageously
priced hammers and multipage cookie specifications has sped up purchases but
produced new excesses such as a $251 compressor seal and a $714 electrical bell.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has been trying to make its military purchasing
system more like corporate America, where speed and volume discounts are
emphasized and detailed product specifications and cost analyses are usually
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
	   But an Associated Press review of military records found the system that is
faster and less burdensome to industry isn't always cheaper -- producing
purchases like a $76 screw.
</P>
<P>
	   Some defense officials worry that too much emphasis is being placed on
speed, forcing purchasing officers to shy away from demanding cost figures from
contractors for fear it might slow down orders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there's a real morale problem,'' said Robert Lieberman, the
Pentagon's assistant inspector general for auditing. ``I think as a practical
matter, people are going to cut corners. They will be criticized severely for
slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force Maj. Joe Besselman, who has studied the new purchasing system,
found officials made good bargains on volume purchases but still got gouged on
smaller orders.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, using wholesale commercial prices as a guide, he found a
15-cent O ring gasket was purchased by DOD for $30, a 40-cent electronic part
known as a diode cost taxpayers $4.50 and a 60-cent transistor went for $7.60.
He also found that the same turbine blades bought for $19.80 cost $63.70 when
not part of a high-volume purchase. And a jet engine part cost $251 in volume,
but $768 when just 15 were bought.
</P>
<P>
	   Such examples have led a watchdog group in Washington to conclude the
Clinton administration's reinventing government program -- which has endorsed
the emphasis on speed over cost analysis -- placed too much price-setting powers
in the hands of Pentagon contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The defense industry succeeded beyond its wildest dreams,'' the Project on
Government Oversight concluded. ``Unfortunately, the defense industry took the
wisdom of the Reinventing Government campaign and pushed it much too far.''
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials dismiss the criticism, saying they have reshaped a
purchasing system that in the 1980s made headlines for buying $435 hammers and
$640 airplane toilets.
</P>
<P>
	   The critics have ``tied our learning to do business smarter with giving away
the farm,'' said Stan Z. Soloway, a top Defense acquisition official. ``That's
just nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
	   Soloway said 30-day delivery times for items have been halved. Large volume
discounts are negotiated. And chocolate chip cookies are bought in normal
packages, eliminating silly military specifications that in the past mandated
that a cookie's ``diameter at its greatest dimension shall be not less than 2
5/16 inches.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new concept is to buy commercial products whenever possible, bargaining
hard for the best price while eliminating detailed specifications and company
cost analyses that in the past drove up prices.
</P>
<P>
	   In the old system, the Pentagon would make contractors divulge and justify
their actual costs for products made to exact specifications. Now, defense
contracting officials are prevented under the law from learning a company's
costs for producing any product deemed to be commercially available.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of demanding cost analyses, defense officials simply try to
negotiate the best price, buying in bulk.
</P>
<P>
	   Besselman's review found success stories with commercial purchases of
electronic items, computer software and engines. He found the Defense Department
paid $99.9 million for 831,000 items for which private companies would have paid
$188.7 million at wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But the inspector general, the agency internal watchdog, found several
examples of waste in purchases where defense officials were too willing to
accept a contractor's description of a product as commercially available and did
not demand cost figures. In those cases, the Defense Department was either the
sole or primary user of the item.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general's examples of inflated prices include:
</P>
<P>
	   --$714 for an electrical bell worth just $47;
</P>
<P>
	   --$251 for a compressor seal with a ``fair and reasonable'' price of just
$59;
</P>
<P>
	   --$350 for a ball bearing that should have cost $48;
</P>
<P>
	   --$76 for a single screw that had been priced earlier at 57 cents;
</P>
<P>
	   --$1,236 for fan assemblies worth $675.
</P>
<P>
	   Soloway, the deputy defense undersecretary for acquisition reform, said such
examples of inflated prices are part of ``a learning process, not a case of the
government getting ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said DOD purchasing officers have been ``steeped in a culture, they've
been taught to do things based on a certain set of rules, checklists and so
forth and to essentially avoid really taking innovative business approaches.''
</P>
<P>
	   Soloway encourages innovation and hard bargaining. The top concern of
Pentagon contract negotiators, he said, is that congressional and Defense
auditors will ``come down on them like a hammer'' for making a mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Dalton, a spokesman for one of the Pentagon's bigger contractors,
Boeing Co., said progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon contracting officers now frequently browse through the company's
online catalog to see if any of the 4.6 million aircraft parts available to
commercial airlines might fit their needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The benefit of this system is Boeing bears responsibility for keeping
parts stocked, managing the inventory and delivery,'' Dalton said. ``All these
services are built into the catalog price, but the government doesn't have to do
it on its own.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Aerospace Industries Association, the defense industry group that helped
develop the streamlined purchasing system, was pleasantly surprised that the
Clinton administration was ``happy to latch on to that as another means of
reinventing government,'' said LeRoy Haugh, a former vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Kelman, a professor of management at Harvard University and
administrator of the government's Office of Federal Procurement Policy from
1993-97, said the administration's reinvention program is about replacing
$14,000 Navy radios made according to ``military specs'' with a $2,500 modified
commercial version.
</P>
<P>
	   And it's about the ability to switch from military socks, made according to
exact requirements, to commercial brands. ``The old socks had no elastic on
top,'' Kelman said. ``So they fell down.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors Make 'House Calls' Via Web  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congestive heart failure can be really scary -- one day
you're fine, the next you're gasping for air as you're raced to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   If only doctors could catch subtle early warning signs, they potentially
could stave off thousands of panicked hospital visits by adjusting patients'
medications before they worsen.
</P>
<P>
	   But isn't examining a patient every single day impossible?
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe not, thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   In a science fiction-sounding experiment, doctors are implanting tiny
monitors inside the hearts of 120 patients to painlessly record every twinge, 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Sit in front of a doctor's wireless transmitter and the monitor beams the
recordings into a computer for diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
	   But by spring, the study's participants won't have to leave home, instead
spending five minutes a day beaming their Chronicle heart monitor's recordings
to a doctor's secure Web site via a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider it an Internet "house call." This doctor-to-home connection is a
hot new area for medical device manufacturers, and it's generating great
interest from doctors frustrated with how to keep chronically ill patients from
worsening at home.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe it's the next generation of care," says Michael Colson of
Medtronic Inc., which is developing the experimental Chronicle system.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the future for chronic disease management -- heart failure,
diabetes, asthma," adds Dr. Richard Miller, director of the Mercy Heart
Institute in Sacramento, Calif., who is using a simpler online monitor, the
Health Buddy.
</P>
<P>
	   Why concentrate first on heart failure? It's so severe that studies should
be able to determine fairly quickly whether monitors help.
</P>
<P>
	   Four million Americans have heart failure, a number expected to double
within 30 years as the population ages and more people survive heart attacks
only to live with a weakened heart that struggles to pump.
</P>
<P>
	   Heart failure costs $40 billion in annual health care, two-thirds due to
repeated hospitalizations when fluid builds up in patients' chests, leaving them
gasping, said Dr. Maria Rosa Costanzo of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical
Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Worsening heart failure sneaks up on patients, who also may have a hard time
strictly adhering to medication and diet, said Costanzo, whose hospital is one
of seven studying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, patients typically wait five days to call a doctor after a symptom
worsens, Miller laments.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors already know at-home follow-up helps:
</P>
<P>
	   Mercy nurses telephoned hundreds of patients several times a month to quiz
them on symptoms and weight -- even a slight weight gain suggests fluid buildup.
By adjusting medications and alerting doctors to early problems, the telephone
program lowered rehospitalizations by 79 percent. But it's labor-intensive.
</P>
<P>
	   So Miller turned to the Health Buddy, made by California-based Health Hero
Network. Hook the answering machine-size gadget to a telephone line. Nurses'
questions zip through the phone line to the Health Buddy video screen. Patients
click a few buttons to respond to a secure Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller calls it "a baby step" toward full online monitoring but says
patients "love it. They feel as though they're in touch with a caregiver on a
daily basis."
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration just approved a Health Buddy version that
transmits diabetics' blood-sugar test results straight to doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Medtronic's Chronicle is still more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeons thread the pacemaker-like device into the heart, to measure
pressure and other subtle disease signs that until now only in-hospital cardiac
catheterizations could provide.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, weekly doctor visits download the recordings, which can alert if a
medication change is needed before there's a crisis, Costanzo said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Medtronic hopes to ship patients at-home transmitters by spring. Point
the antenna at the chest and the recordings beam over a phone line to the
doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'll be in touch with these people anywhere in the country," said implant
recipient Edward A. Krzyston, 51, of Hammond, Ind., who's looking forward to
vacationing with his device -- and says he'll no longer wonder if he's imagining
symptoms. "You don't want to sound like a whiner. With this device, it just
records the information and the doctor decides if it's important or not."
</P>
<P>
	   If studies show the Chronicle keeps patients out of the hospital, Medtronic
hopes to apply for FDA approval in about two years.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Discuss Consumer Privacy  </HEADLINE>
   By RAF CASERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union was hopeful Monday it could
force a breakthrough in negotiations with the United States on how to protect
consumer data in trans-Atlantic trade, an issue that has long dogged
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides want to wrap up negotiations before the end of next month, but
the EU's executive Commission said talks between U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce
for International Trade David Aaron and chief EU negotiator John Mogg could
yield results as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron and Mogg started talks at EU headquarters Monday morning and announced
a joint news conference for Tuesday afternoon to wrap up three negotiating
sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have struggled since last summer to find a solution to the
dispute over a data protection directive issued by the EU.
</P>
<P>
	   The directive, which went into effect in October, authorizes regulators in
each of the 15 EU nations to halt exports of personal data to countries they
believe do not have adequate arrangements to protect the data.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU countries consider the decentralized approach to data protection in
the United States -- a mixture of law and self regulation -- as not meeting the
standards of its new directive.
</P>
<P>
	   So far EU member states have not threatened to disrupt transfers of
information. Some are still trying to decide how to implement the directive.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome of the talks will have an impact on industries as varied as
airlines, insurance and banking and could affect billions of dollars in trade.
</P>
<P>
	   It raises such questions as whether the distribution and use of airline data
on a passenger's meal preference need the consent of the individual. In the
insurance sector, the free availability of personal health data might raise
ethical questions on the availability of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. companies want an agreement that will ensure that as much personal data
as possible about European consumers can be transferred across the Atlantic.
European human rights campaigners want to prevent this as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides are trying to come up with a so-called safe-harbor agreement
that would allow U.S. industry to conduct business with Europe if they meet
certain private data commitments.

   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) -- Avalanches swept down Alpine slopes at the height of
the ski season Monday, killing three skiers in Italy and three in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   In Italy, two back-to-back avalanches in the northern Venosta Valley trapped
a group of seven Germans and one Italian skiing on an unauthorized route, alpine

</P>
<P>
	   Searchers recovered the bodies of two women and one man and accounted for
the remaining five skiers, Weger said. At least one was hospitalized with severe
hypothermia. The valley is about 90 miles from the northern Italian city of
Balzano.
</P>
<P>
	   In Switzerland, a 200-yard-wide snowslide buried two Swiss skiers and a
German near the popular eastern ski resort of Davos, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers rescued one slightly injured man immediately after the avalanche.
After hours of searching involving about 100 people backed by dogs, police said
they had determined that no one else was missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent heavy snowfall followed by blue skies and sunshine Monday had
prompted official avalanche warnings for both areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian schools are out this week for what is known as ``white week,''
freeing pupils for family ski trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Swiss youngsters also are given weeklong school vacations during the
winter -- most frequently in February -- to go skiing.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, alpine avalanches killed 12 people in Italy and 36 in Switzerland,
according to an Italian avalanche center.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Nears Mozambican Coastline  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Cyclone Eline edged its way towards the
Mozambican coast Monday, driving heavy rains ahead of it to an area already
devastated by the worst floods in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Satellite pictures taken Monday afternoon showed the cyclone about 30 miles
off the coast of the central Inhambane province, said Mussa Musdafa, chief
weather forecaster at the National Meteorology Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The center of the storm was moving northwest at about 6 miles an hour. It
was expected to hit the Mozambican coast early Tuesday morning, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyclone had been downgraded to a tropical storm but was upgraded Monday
afternoon after its pressure sank and its winds strengthened to over 62 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the cyclone is still at sea, it has brought heavy rains and gale
winds to the area between Beira and Vilanculos, nearly 480 miles to the south,
Stephan Steyn, a forecaster with the South African Weather bureau in Pretoria
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maputo, Mozambique's capital, was fanned by strong winds on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Torrential rains hit the impoverished former Portuguese colony two weeks
ago, causing widespread flooding that washed away roads, houses, bridges and
agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300,000 people were affected by the floods and needed food and water,
said Dr. Gilbert Greenall, a spokesman for U.N. agencies involved in relief
efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighboring South Africa has provided five helicopters and two aircraft to
help relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Louis Kirsten, a spokesman for the South African Air Force, said 230
tons of food and medical supplies had already been dropped off, and close to
3,000 people had been rescued from the flood waters.
</P>
<P>
	   About 211,000 people have been displaced, and 67 have died in the floods,
Udoyen said. Earlier reports said 400,000 people were displaced and 150 killed.

<HEADLINE> Man Fined in German Amber Room Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREMEN, Germany (AP) -- A German court on Monday convicted a notary of trying
to find a buyer for a mosaic panel identified as part of the long-sought ``Amber
Room'' treasure, which disappeared after World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bremen state court ordered the 62-year-old man to pay a fine worth
$25,000 for his conviction on a charge of accessory to attempted fraud. His name
was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1,300-square-foot Amber Room -- named after the wall panels of amber --
was a gift from Prussian King Frederick William to Russia's Peter the Great. The
panels were installed in a palace the czar built for his wife, Catherine I, in
Tsarskoe Selo outside St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Retreating Nazi troops looted the palace in World War II. The Amber Room's
panels were moved to a castle in Koenigsburg, now Kalinigrad in Russia, but they
disappeared in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   One mosaic panel was found in 1997 in the possession of a man in Bremen who
had inherited it from his father. The man, who also was charged in the case but
has since died, claimed he only discovered what the panel was after watching a
TV documentary on the Amber Room.
</P>
<P>
	   He contacted the notary public, asking him to arrange the sale of the
treasure. The asking price was the equivalent of $2.5 million, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under an agreement with the Russian government, Bremen plans to return the
mosaic to Russia in exchange for the return of 101 other works of art that were
removed from Germany by the Red Army after the war, city Mayor Henning Scherf
said last month. Those works are to include art by Albrecht Duerer, Manet, Goya
and Toulouse-Lautrec.
</P>
<P>
	   The $25,000 fine is to be split evenly between the German state's treasury
and the Bremen Art Center.

<HEADLINE> CGU, Norwich Union Plan Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Insurance group CGU PLC plans to acquire Norwich Union PLC
for $12 billion in stock in a deal that would form the largest insurance
business in Britain and fifth-largest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The consolidation would come at the cost of 5,000 jobs, or 7 percent of the
companies' combined work force.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company, to be called CGNU, will be based in London and will be the
largest provider of general insurance and the second-largest provider of life
insurance in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal also would give the combined company strong positions in several
European and international markets, said CGU chief executive Bob Scott, who is
to continue in the same role at the new group.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareholders in both companies and British financial authorities still must
approve the transaction.
</P>
<P>
	   The partners estimate that they can save $400 million each year by
consolidating various aspects of the two companies. Half the savings would
result from job cuts, with the remainder expected to come from integrating
computer networks, selling property and other sources, Norwich Union spokesman
James Duffell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, Norwich Union shareholders would receive 0.48 shares in the
new group for each Norwich Union share. CGU shareholders would receive one share
in the new group for each CGU share.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, CGU shareholders would control 58.5 percent of the combined
group, while Norwich Union shareholders would control 41.5 percent. CGU also
would appoint nine of the group's 17 directors.
</P>
<P>
	   NU chief executive Richard Harvey, who will become deputy chief executive in
the combined group, said the deal would create significant value for both sets
of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   CGU shares surged on the announcement, but later fell to 785 pence ($12.45)
each, down 11 pence on the London Stock Exchange. Norwich Union shares initially
rose before finishing down 9 percent, or 39 pence, to 396.25 pence ($6.29) each.
</P>
<P>
	   Duffell acknowledged that an outside company could disrupt the marriage if
it were to make an offer for either or both companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although both Norwich Union and CGU have long planned their move, neither
set of shareholders would receive a premium as the deal is structured.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation that has swept Britain's
insurance and financial services sectors. Royal Bank of Scotland won a $33.6
billion takeover bid for National Westminster earlier this month, while Lloyds
TSB acquired the insurance group Scottish Widows last June.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Coca Crops Still Thriving  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO NEGRO, Colombia (AP) -- In nearly a decade of U.S.-sponsored fumigation,
planes have sprayed hundreds of thousands of gallons of herbicide on illicit
drug crops in vast expanses of Colombia's highlands and rainforests.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet drug cultivation in the world's No. 1 cocaine-producing nation is at a
record high and climbing. Crop yields are also improving as traffickers plant
more potent strains of coca and opium poppy, the sources of cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   The stubbornness of the plants seems matched only by the determination of
U.S. and Colombian officials to continue the chemical counterattack.
</P>
<P>
	   As President Andres Pastrana awaits action in the U.S. Congress on a $1.6
billion aid package that would fund an accelerated spraying effort, new
estimates show coca cultivation up by 20 to 30 percent last year. Since 1995, it
has more than doubled, according to the Colombian and U.S. figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, who expressed serious reservations about fumigation's
effectiveness during his first months in office, has toned down the criticism
and now welcomes the U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anyone has been tough on drug trafficking it's me,'' he told The
Associated Press earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian and U.S. officials including White House drug czar Barry
McCaffrey, who arrives Tuesday for a three-day visit, argue that drug crops
would be expanding even more rapidly if there wasn't any attempt to halt their
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
	   But even a recent effort to showcase the spraying effort ended up
highlighting the many questions surrounding it, including its distressing impact
on this Andean nation's diverse and fragile ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying with anti-narcotics police to an opium poppy field in the
southwestern state of Huila, the view out the Bell 212 helicopter window is one
of huge scars in the forests, of valleys denuded by clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the ecological crime of the narcos,'' national police spokesman
Carlos Perdomo says, gesturing at the deforested ridges around Rio Negro.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a crime that critics say is only aggravated by fumigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca- and opium-growers who've had their crops destroyed rarely quit. Either
they fell more trees elsewhere to plant or they wait until soil microbes have
decomposed the herbicide -- typically a year -- and reseed the same plot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've noted about a 40 to 50 percent replanting rate'' of opium poppy
fields, admits Col. Edgar Orlando Barrero, the police eradication program
director.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the mid-1990s, coca growers have pushed ever deeper into the Amazon
basin to evade the crop-dusters, clearing tens of thousands of acres of virgin
rainforest. Every new acre planted requires that three be cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   More than two-fifths of Colombia's 210 square miles of coca is grown in the
rebel-dominated southern state of Putumayo. Pastrana plans a major eradication
effort there this year spearheaded by a new U.S.-trained counternarcotics
battalion.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort is likely to be opposed by the leftist insurgents who guard drug
crops and processing laboratories in Putumayo. Government officials also expect
violent protests by poor coca-growers.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aid plan includes $145 million for alternative development --
programs to give peasants legal alternatives to making their living by growing
drug plants. Nonetheless, skeptics expect most of the poor coca growers to
simply continue their cat-and-mouse game with the spray planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Field studies by Ricardo Vargas, a sociologist and eradication researcher,
show that when coca areas are detected and sprayed, growers simply migrate to
other regions where drug mafias can offer the chemicals, labs and clandestine
air strips needed to process and transport cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Government figures bear out this argument. An explosion in coca cultivation
in Putumayo coincided with its near elimination in the eastern state of
Guaviare, where nearly 245 square miles were sprayed with herbicide in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Coca has a behavior completely independent of eradication,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
	   With tens of thousands of Colombian peasants making a living off coca, some
analysts fear stepped-up spraying will only increase their support for the
guerrillas who have been fighting the Colombian government for more than three
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of rebel resistance, the eradication business has become
increasingly militarized. Spray aircraft were hit by gunfire on 35 occasions
last year alone and a key counterdrug base was overrun by rebels the week
Pastrana took office in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has already donated six Black Hawk UH-60 helicopters,
equipped with miniguns that fire 1,200 rounds per minute, to the Colombian
police to protect the eight spray planes now in action. The proposed U.S. aid
package calls for 30 more Black Hawks, for the air force and army, and 15 more
spray planes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we will ever solve this problem without an end to the armed
conflict,'' says Klaus Nyholm, director for Colombia of the U.N. Drug Control
Program.

<HEADLINE> EU, Latin Nations Seek Deeper Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY HATTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) -- Leaders of the European Union and Latin American
nations are aiming to deepen economic and political ties in three days of talks
beginning Tuesday in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU is eager to expand trade with Latin America, fearing it could lose
ground to the United States, which is seeking to create a Pan-American
free-trade area by 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks among government ministers from the EU and Latin America are to
build on last summer's summit meeting, which was a first step toward a
free-trade deal with South America's strongest economies.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU aims to sign a free-trade deal with Mexico next month, although the
accord still must be ratified by the European Parliament, the legislatures of
Belgium, Italy, Denmark and Luxembourg, and the Mexican Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU also is to discuss prospects for a free-trade deal with the Mercosur
nations of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile -- South America's
strongest economies -- during the meetings in southern Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   Portugal currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. The EU already is the
main trading partner of the Mercosur nations, ahead of the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   EU companies are eager to expand their presence in Latin America's
industrial and service sectors. Some companies already have invested heavily in
privatization efforts in Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU has put together an 11-point program that seeks to promote human
rights and good governance in Latin countries.
</P>
<P>
	   An EU meeting with a half dozen Central American nations was to begin the
talks. The Europeans plan to seek assurances that countries struck in October
1998 by Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 10,000 people, will use EU aid
totaling about $250 million. Some $80 million in reconstruction aid still must
be allocated.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, EU officials are to meet with Mexican officials to discuss a
planned visit to Lisbon next month by President Ernesto Zedillo. The Mexican
president is to sign a free-trade accord on the sidelines of an EU summit
meeting in the Portuguese capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord foresees free trade in industrial goods by 2007 and in farm
products by 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU wants to conclude its pact with Mexico so its member states can
compete effectively with the United States and Canada, which will have duty-free
access to Mexican markets by 2003 under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The free-trade talks with the four Mercosur countries face no formal
deadline since their fate depends on the evolution of trade talks through the
World Trade Organization, which are now deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the EU is to meet with the Andean Pact nations of Bolivia,
Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. These countries want the EU to treat them on an
equal basis as the Mercosur nations, something the Europeans refuse to do
because of those countries' weak economic integration with their neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Pope's Trip Raises Political Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA BRYSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Pope John Paul II's visit to Egypt is in many ways a
personal pilgrimage, but it will also focus attention on sectarian tensions in a
country where politics and religion often mix in volatile ways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot deny that there will be a political aspect,'' Egyptian Catholic
Bishop Youhanna Kolta said Monday at a news conference called to outline the
pope's three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His holiness is aiming to make his visit to Egypt a spiritual journey, a
pilgrimage,'' the bishop said. ``The political side is to strengthen relations
with the Egyptians here, with the Coptic Orthodox Church and with the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, his first day in Egypt, John Paul will pay separate courtesy
calls to Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, one of Egypt's top Muslim clerics, and
Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III. The visits will likely shine a light on the
tense relations between Egypt's Muslim majority and Copts, the largest religious
minority at an estimated 10 percent of the 64 million population.
</P>
<P>
	   Deadly clashes broke out at the start of the year between Copts and Muslims.
Copts often complain they are unfairly treated by Muslims but Bishop Kolta said
such outbreaks are isolated and stem from ignorance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Egyptians do not discriminate and there is no persecution,'' he said. ``I
can't deny that there are some problems. But I can say that all the people of
Egypt, Muslims and Christians, they feel they are one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tantawi told an Arabic television station last week that he welcomed John
Paul's visit as an attempt ``to bring people closer and encourage them to do
good, and as a call for cooperation between people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tantawi is chief cleric of Al-Azhar University, a venerable seat of Muslim
learning that has been engaged in interfaith dialogue with the Vatican for
nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul also will be reaching out to other Christian sects during his
visit, with Saturday prayers at a Greek Orthodox monastery on Mount Sinai, where
the bible says Moses received the 10 Commandments.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop Kolta's church, the Coptic Catholic Church, dates to a Coptic
Orthodox archbishop who accepted Roman Catholic teachings in the 18th century.
Catholics, whether Roman or Coptic, are only a small proportion of Christians in
Egypt. Coptic Orthodox Christians trace their tradition to St. Mark, writer of
the second Gospel, who is believed to have brought Christianity to Egypt shortly
after the death of Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul's trip, the first to Egypt by a Roman Catholic pope, kicks off his
2000 Holy Year pilgrimages to ancient biblical sites. From March 20 to 26, he
will visit sites in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Awards Fever Hits Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Is there anybody left in Hollywood who hasn't been
nominated for some kind of award this year?
</P>
<P>
	   Entertainment awards are proliferating, with 332 ceremonies last year, up
from 252 in 1997, according to the trade publication Variety.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry has ovations and backslaps for directors, writers and
cinematographers, and salutes for the best movie trailers, the best publicity
campaigns and the best raising of awareness on social issues. Even the awards
shows can win awards.
</P>
<P>
	   The hoopla all builds up to Hollywood's grandest night, the Academy Awards,
on March 26. Awards by groups such as the Directors Guild and Screen Actors
Guild offer a sneak peek at how some top Oscar categories might play out, while
organizers of other ceremonies schedule their awards to feed off Oscar
excitement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We definitely wanted to do ours before the Oscar nominations," said Laurie
Silvers, president of the entertainment Web site Hollywood.com, which presented
its second annual awards for top movie trailers about two weeks before the
Academy Award nominations came out last week. "We wanted people thinking about
whether the best movie trailers have any association with the best movies."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the specialized award ceremonies this season:
</P>
<P>
	   --Faces and follicles get their due at the first Hollywood Makeup Artist and
Hair Stylist Guild Awards on March 19. Guild Awards chairman Alan Fama said
movie makeup and hairstyles often are overlooked and the awards are meant to
"bring attention to the fact that our work is not just for a beauty-shop
clientele. You don't just spray an actor's hair and have them come back next
week." Awards will be presented in such categories as contemporary and period
hairstyling and special-effects makeup. Nominated films include "Sleepy Hollow,"
"Tea With Mussolini" and "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me."
</P>
<P>
	   --Positive social and moral messages in film and TV will be lauded at the
23rd annual International Angel Awards, selected by two groups, Excellence in
Media and the National Association for Family and Community Education.
Contenders in the movie category include "The Green Mile," "The Straight Story,"
"Music of the Heart" and "Runaway Bride."
</P>
<P>
	   --Animal welfare is the theme at the 14th annual Genesis Awards presented by
the Ark Trust, a humane group. The awards this year will include honors for the
movie "Instinct," which fosters respect for great apes, and the animated feature
"The Iron Giant," which includes a stark anti-hunting scene, said Ark Trust
founder Gretchen Wyler.
</P>
<P>
	   Four days before the Oscars, the 37th annual awards for best promotional
campaigns will be held by the Publicists Guild of America. Nominated for best
movie publicity efforts are "American Beauty," "The Matrix," "Stuart Little,"
"The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Toy Story 2."
</P>
<P>
	   "Publicists are always the last to be recognized for anything," said Henri
Bollinger, who heads the guild's awards committee. "Part of the job of
publicists is to stay in the background, but our awards bring some positive
attention to the work we do."
</P>
<P>
	   Ceremonies themselves sometimes garner honors. The Oscar, Grammy and Tony
broadcasts all won Emmys last fall, while last year's Oscar show is nominated in
the TV musical variety category for the Directors Guild awards March 11.
</P>
<P>
	   There are also awards no one in the industry wants to win. The 20th annual
Golden Raspberry Awards for the worst movies of 1999 will be announced the day
before the Oscars. This year's nominees for the Razzies include the blockbusters
"Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace," "Big Daddy" and "The Blair Witch
Project."

<HEADLINE> Germany's Kohl To Be Spared Search  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be spared the
embarrassment -- at least for now -- of having his homes and offices searched
for evidence of breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
	   Roland Wangen, a spokesman for Bonn prosecutors, said Monday that a weekend
report in Der Spiegel magazine about the planned search eliminates the element
of surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   Such searches are successful only ``when the person concerned has no
knowledge ahead of time,'' Wangen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors would have needed permission from the parliament to do the
search because Kohl retains his seat there and therefore has immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Files relating to the sale of the former East German Leuna oil refinery to
France's Elf Aquitaine already have been reported missing from the chancellery
office. There are allegations that Aquitaine paid Kohl's party kickbacks in
order to seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Wangen raised the possibility of criminal action against those responsible
for leaking news of the search, but said it was still more important to continue
the investigation against Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had also wanted to search the offices and homes of Kohl's office
manager and driver.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl's admission that he accepted $1 million touched off the scandal over
years of illegal financial practices by the Christian Democrats, including
secret accounts to evade campaign finance laws and defrauding the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl lawyer Stephan Holthoff-Pfoertner called a potential search a
``senseless action,'' telling the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung that it would
only serve to ``degrade Kohl's character.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also granted a reprieve in the scandal Monday was the embattled governor of
Hesse state, whose own network of secret accounts has shown the Christian
Democrat party branch there to be just as corrupt as the national party.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors in Wiesbaden said they would not pursue a criminal investigation
against Roland Koch, who over the weekend was re-elected as head of the state
party branch in an overwhelming show of confidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Werner Roth, head prosecutor in Wiesbaden, said there was not enough
evidence to begin an investigation against Koch, who took office just a year
ago. Other party leaders have also defended Koch against calls for him to
resign, saying he had no role in setting up the secret accounts that stretch
back to 1971 -- the year Kohl took over as chairman of the federal party.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch has belatedly admitted he knew the state party had filed a false
financial report for 1998, characterizing $750,000 as a loan when it actually
stemmed from one of the party's slush fund.
</P>
<P>
	   That false report led the federal party to also carry the misstated amount
over to its 1998 financial report, which is used by the federal government to
determine the matching campaign funds parties receive. The federal party earlier
this month was ordered to pay back $20.6 million it had received in matching
federal funds following the illegal 1998 report.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to the prosecutors' decision, Koch said he hoped he would now be
freed from nearly daily accusations of being a swindler.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Coca Crops Still Thriving  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO NEGRO, Colombia (AP) -- In nearly a decade of U.S.-sponsored fumigation,
planes have sprayed hundreds of thousands of gallons of herbicide on illicit
drug crops in vast expanses of Colombia's highlands and rainforests.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet drug cultivation in the world's No. 1 cocaine-producing nation is at a
record high and climbing. Crop yields are also improving as traffickers plant
more potent strains of coca and opium poppy, the sources of cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   The stubbornness of the plants seems matched only by the determination of
U.S. and Colombian officials to continue the chemical counterattack.
</P>
<P>
	   As President Andres Pastrana awaits action in the U.S. Congress on a $1.6
billion aid package that would fund an accelerated spraying effort, new
estimates show coca cultivation up by 20 to 30 percent last year. Since 1995, it
has more than doubled, according to the Colombian and U.S. figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana, who expressed serious reservations about fumigation's
effectiveness during his first months in office, has toned down the criticism
and now welcomes the U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anyone has been tough on drug trafficking it's me,'' he told The
Associated Press earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian and U.S. officials including White House drug czar Barry
McCaffrey, who arrives Tuesday for a three-day visit, argue that drug crops
would be expanding even more rapidly if there wasn't any attempt to halt their
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
	   But even a recent effort to showcase the spraying effort ended up
highlighting the many questions surrounding it, including its distressing impact
on this Andean nation's diverse and fragile ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying with anti-narcotics police to an opium poppy field in the
southwestern state of Huila, the view out the Bell 212 helicopter window is one
of huge scars in the forests, of valleys denuded by clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the ecological crime of the narcos,'' national police spokesman
Carlos Perdomo says, gesturing at the deforested ridges around Rio Negro.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a crime that critics say is only aggravated by fumigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca- and opium-growers who've had their crops destroyed rarely quit. Either
they fell more trees elsewhere to plant or they wait until soil microbes have
decomposed the herbicide -- typically a year -- and reseed the same plot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've noted about a 40 to 50 percent replanting rate'' of opium poppy
fields, admits Col. Edgar Orlando Barrero, the police eradication program
director.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the mid-1990s, coca growers have pushed ever deeper into the Amazon
basin to evade the crop-dusters, clearing tens of thousands of acres of virgin
rainforest. Every new acre planted requires that three be cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   More than two-fifths of Colombia's coca, or about 210 square miles' worth,
is grown in the rebel-dominated southern state of Putumayo. Pastrana plans a
major eradication effort there this year spearheaded by a new U.S.-trained
counternarcotics battalion.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort is likely to be opposed by the leftist insurgents who guard drug
crops and processing laboratories in Putumayo. Government officials also expect
violent protests by poor coca-growers.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. aid plan includes $145 million for alternative development --
programs to give peasants legal alternatives to making their living by growing
drug plants. Nonetheless, skeptics expect most of the poor coca growers to
simply continue their cat-and-mouse game with the spray planes.
</P>
<P>
	   Field studies by Ricardo Vargas, a sociologist and eradication researcher,
show that when coca areas are detected and sprayed, growers simply migrate to
other regions where drug mafias can offer the chemicals, labs and clandestine
air strips needed to process and transport cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Government figures bear out this argument. An explosion in coca cultivation
in Putumayo coincided with its near elimination in the eastern state of
Guaviare, where nearly 245 square miles were sprayed with herbicide in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Coca has a behavior completely independent of eradication,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
	   With tens of thousands of Colombian peasants making a living off coca, some
analysts fear stepped-up spraying will only increase their support for the
guerrillas who have been fighting the Colombian government for more than three
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of rebel resistance, the eradication business has become
increasingly militarized. Spray aircraft were hit by gunfire on 35 occasions
last year alone and a key counterdrug base was overrun by rebels the week
Pastrana took office in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has already donated six Black Hawk UH-60 helicopters,
equipped with miniguns that fire 1,200 rounds per minute, to the Colombian
police to protect the eight spray planes now in action. The proposed U.S. aid
package calls for 30 more Black Hawks, for the air force and army, and 15 more
spray planes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we will ever solve this problem without an end to the armed
conflict,'' says Klaus Nyholm, director for Colombia of the U.N. Drug Control
Program.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Vows To Complete Chechen War  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOZDOK, Russia -- Waves of Russian bombers on Monday slammed the entrance to
a gorge where thousands of Chechen fighters are holed up, while Moscow promised
to press the offensive until the last rebel is wiped out.
</P>
<P>
	   Jets roared off in pairs from Mozdok, the main Russian military base near
Chechnya. A Russian military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the bombers were striking the so-called Wolf's Gates, at the mouth of the Argun
Gorge.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Russian presidential aide in charge of the
Kremlin's information campaign on Chechnya said up to 4,500 rebels are in the
gorge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The gunmen are totally blocked there, and the blockade is gradually
tightening,'' he said. Acting President Vladimir Putin said the offensive would
continue until the rebels are annihilated.
</P>
<P>
	   The war ``will be brought to its logical end,'' when there are no militants
left in Chechnya and the small republic is brought back under Moscow's control,
he said at a military awards ceremony in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Since rebels fled the Chechen capital Grozny en masse in early February,
Russia has focused its offensive on the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The Argun and Vedeno gorges cut deep into the steep, foggy mountains and are
key channels for the rebels to transport equipment and reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past week, Russia has redeployed many of its troops from other
parts of Chechnya to positions near the mountains, preparing for a full assault
</P>
<P>
	   A top Russian military official said recently that the war could be over in
a month, raising the possibility that its end could come just before the March
26 Russian presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin already is far ahead of his challengers in pre-election opinion polls
and ending the war before the voting could substantially boost his support.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin's strong showing in the polls apparently is a reflection of wide
approval of his tough handling of the five-month-old war.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Russian authorities are clearly concerned about a rebel
resurgence. Rebel bands continue to mount sporadic raids on Russian-held towns
and officials have repeatedly said the rebels are believed to be preparing wide
attacks for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   That day is both the Russian Defender of the Fatherland holiday and the day
that Chechens commemorate the bitter memories of the 1944 mass deportation of
Chechens to Central Asia under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, attending a Russian military parade in the
Chechen capital Grozny, said troops were trying to encircle Chechen rebels in
the Argun gorge to prevent them from ambushing federal-held areas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main thing is not to let the bandits out, to finish them off in the
areas where you have pushed them,'' Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
and warlords Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev were hiding out in the Argun
gorge with rebels, the news agency ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Rushailo underlined Putin's intention to wipe out the rebels by reiterating
Russia's frequent refusal to hold negotiations with Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grozny, Emergency Situations Ministry workers were burying bodies
retrieved from basements where most civilians hid during the Russian
bombardment. Almost no civilians have been visible on the streets since the
military sealed the city and prohibited all nonmilitary traffic until at least
March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said the city's civilian population had plunged to just 9,883
people. Since the blockade was imposed last week, 11,127 people have fled the
Chechen capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya in September, after Chechnya-based Islamic
militants invaded Dagestan. The Chechens also are blamed for four apartment
bombings in Russia in September that killed 300 people.

<HEADLINE> China Threat Affecting Taiwan Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNIE HUANG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian gave his critics
the ammunition they were looking for at a recent campaign stop when he shouted
in his raspy voice: ``Long live Taiwan independence!''
</P>
<P>
	   The slogan is now being used by other candidates as proof that, if elected,
the popular former Taipei mayor will declare that Taiwan is an independent
nation and won't reunify with China -- a prospect that alarms many Taiwanese
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen's opponents' tactic is a sign of voters' fear that Beijing will make
good on its threats to attack if this island tries to break away permanently.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides split amid civil war in 1949, and relations remain tense. On
Monday, China renewed its threats to Taiwan, saying it might attack if Taiwanese
leaders indefinitely refuse to talk unification.
</P>
<P>
	   A China-Taiwan conflict could quickly involve the United States, one of the
few nations that sells weapons to Taiwan. America has repeatedly warned Beijing
that it might help defend the island if China attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen's case is a good example of how the China situation has impacted the
campaign leading up to Taiwan's March 18 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   Although once a vocal supporter of Taiwan independence, a new Chen has
emerged in recent months -- one who is friendlier to China and far less fervent
in public about independence. Now, Chen favors closer trade ties with the
mainland and says Taiwan would seek independence only if China invades. He also
says he wouldn't change the flag or Taiwan's official name, the Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I promise I will not bring Taiwan to the brink of war,'' he said recently.
Many polls say Chen is leading the tight three-way race.
</P>
<P>
	   But his recent ``Long live Taiwan independence!'' cheer made it easy for his
opponents to claim his new stance is just one of convenience. Chen's aides have
said the cheer was only meant to reassert that Taiwan is not controlled by the
Chinese communists. It was not a promise to declare independence, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate has said the best way to keep peace with China is to improve
ties.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the civil war 50 years ago, the two sides have not had direct air and
shipping links. The government also restricts how much Taiwanese firms can
invest in the mainland, fearing this island will become too economically tied to
China.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen wants to change this. He wants to allow Taiwanese ships to sail
directly to the mainland, and if there are no problems, he says direct air links
would follow. Chen also said he'd consider allowing Taiwanese banks to open
branches on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
	   Such proposals won't ease suspicions that Chen would botch relations with
China, said Chu Liluan, a lawmaker with the ruling Nationalist Party, whose
official candidate is trailing Chen in most polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He changes several times a day, and voters don't believe he has given up
independence,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen's Democratic Progressive Party is the island's largest opposition
party. He faces independent James Soong and Vice President Lien Chan of the
ruling Nationalist party in next month's vote. Neither of them are
pro-independence.
</P>
<P>
	   The three candidates are vying to replace retiring 77-year-old President Lee
Teng-hui, elected in Taiwan's first presidential vote in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 6 Skiers Die in Europe Avalanches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) -- Avalanches swept down Alpine slopes at the height of
the ski season Monday, killing three skiers in Italy and three in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   In Italy, two back-to-back avalanches in the northern Venosta Valley trapped
a group of seven Germans and one Italian skiing on an unauthorized route, alpine
rescue official Luigi Weger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers recovered the bodies of two women and one man and accounted for
the remaining five skiers, Weger said. At least one was hospitalized with severe
hypothermia. The valley is about 90 miles from the northern Italian city of
Bolzano.
</P>
<P>
	   In Switzerland, a 200-yard-wide snowslide buried two Swiss skiers and a
German near the popular eastern ski resort of Davos, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers rescued one slightly injured man immediately after the avalanche.
After hours of searching involving about 100 people backed by dogs, police said
they had determined that no one else was missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent heavy snowfall followed by blue skies and sunshine Monday had
prompted official avalanche warnings for both areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian schools are out this week for what is known as ``white week,''
freeing pupils for family ski trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Swiss youngsters also are given weeklong school vacations during the
winter -- most frequently in February -- to go skiing.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, alpine avalanches killed 12 people in Italy and 36 in Switzerland,
according to an Italian avalanche center.

<HEADLINE> IPE To Become For-Profit Company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The International Petroleum Exchange, Europe's largest energy
market, said Monday that it plans to transform itself from an enterprise owned
by members into a for-profit business.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange's members voted unanimously to restructure the exchange with
the aim of responding more quickly to opportunities and competitive threats.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange, perhaps best known for its futures contracts in North Sea
Brent crude oil, began operating in 1981. Its other contracts include heating
oil and natural gas, and it hopes in June to launch a futures contract for
electricity, spokeswoman Seana Lanigan said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a mutually owned exchange, the IPE needs the approval of 75 percent of
its members for any changes in rules or policy. Under the new structure, a
15-member board of directors would be able to make most policy decisions. The
exchange aims to complete its makeover by April 3.
</P>
<P>
	   In assuming for-profit status, the IPE is taking a cue from the London Stock
Exchange, which announced plans last July to end its 240-year status as a
member-owned organization and transform into a company controlled by
shareholders.

<HEADLINE> China Threatens Unification or War  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- With a month to go in Taiwan's presidential election
campaign, China warned Monday that it might attack the island if Taiwanese
leaders indefinitely refuse to talk unification.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat, delivered in a policy paper from China's cabinet, was intended
to increase the pressure on Taiwan's three presidential candidates. Although
there was no immediate reaction from Taiwan's government or the candidates'
camps, policy toward China has been at the center of the campaign, which ends
March 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Already this month, China sailed its newly acquired, heavily armed
Russian-built destroyer through the Taiwan Strait. And Chinese President Jiang
Zemin over the weekend toured military bases in southern China that would be the
ones used in any invasion of Taiwan, the Hong Kong media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Such tactics, and Monday's heated words from the State Council, were ominous
reminders that Taiwan and China remain antagonists in an unfinished,
seven-decade civil war. Although democratic Taiwan has relinquished its claim to
the communist mainland, China considers the island a rebel province.
</P>
<P>
	   China has long vowed to wage war if Taiwan declared independence outright or
foreign forces meddle. The policy paper from the State Council added Taiwanese
foot-dragging over unification talks to the list of provocative circumstances
that would compel China to attack.
</P>
<P>
	   If any of those three situations arose, ``then the Chinese government will
be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force, to
... fulfill the great cause of reunification,'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
	   It included a warning to the United States to scale back arms sales to
Taiwan -- once a close ally whose defense Washington must by law assist -- and
``not to stand in the way of the reunification of China.''
</P>
<P>
	   China's new Taiwan policy statement was not all barbs. It reiterated that
force was a last resort and offered to hold talks as equals with any Taiwanese
politicians so long as they recognized the island as part of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Taiwan's last presidential campaign four years ago, China tested missiles
and staged intimidating war games to deter pro-independence Taiwanese and the
United States sent warships to counter the threats. It was the closest the sides
had come to armed confrontation since the late 1950s.

<HEADLINE> More classes, convenient study methods attracting different types  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) - Anthony Racioppi is 47, and he's made a commitment.
<P>
	   "This is something I've been wanting to do for a long time," said Racioppi,
a firefighter for the North Hudson Regional Fire Department in North Bergen.
</P>
<P>
	   He isn't referring to marriage. He's decided to become certified open water
scuba diver and has been taking classes at the Hoboken Dive Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Scuba organizations and dive shops offering a variety of class schedules
have enabled the $1.5 billion-a-year industry to attract people who otherwise
wouldn't have the chance to experience a world most people never get to see.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the peacefulness of it," said Racioppi, who has completed several pool
sessions required for certification. "I remember watching the 'Diver Dan'
cartoon when I was about 6, and then it was 'Sea Hunt' when I was older. I could
never get certified because I had no time, but that flexibility of going to
class on Tuesday nights was good for me."
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Powley, 34, is an attorney who is also a dive instructor. He's been
teaching since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "I get everybody from actors to investment bankers," he said. "I think most
people get into it because they tend to be a little bit more adventurous. It's a
super-safe sport, but people tend to think it's much more dangerous than it is."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, there are about 8.5 million certified scuba divers, according to
PADI. The average diver is 36 years old. Half are college educated and earn over
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the majority - over 70 percent - of recreational divers are men,
the number of women involved in the sport is on the rise. Their numbers
increased by 112 percent from 1989 to 1999, according to the Professional
Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), the world's largest scuba
organization, which certifies 70 percent of divers in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   Colleen Bush, 38, of Fairview started diving around 1987 after being
certified a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "I dragged my husband skiing, so he dragged me to go diving," said Bush, who
now works at the Hoboken Dive Center.
</P>
<P>
	   She recalled what it was like aboard boats on her first dives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the guys are really great, but sometimes some of them will look at
you like, 'What are you doing here?' There's still some of that," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry is also beginning to target another group - children - and is
now marketing equipment made especially for them.
</P>
<P>
	   "So many of us in the business started as kids, and I saw a study somewhere
that said the best way to get a person to stick with a sport is to start them
young. We in the industry have just begun to recognize that," said David
Stancil, vice president for Aqua Lung America Inc., headquartered in Vista,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   As with skiing, diving involves a substantial initial outlay for equipment.
A new diver should plan on spending about $1,200, which includes a BCD (buoyancy
control device), air-flow regulators, tanks, weight belt, fins, mask and
snorkel.
</P>
<P>
	   Certification courses can run between $100 and $300, depending on location
and class size. PADI or NAUI (National Association of Underwater Instructors)
require written work and four check-out dives accompanied by an instructor.
</P>
<P>
	   Like a passport, the certification cards are recognized at shops and resorts
around the world, allowing individuals access to equipment and the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Diving can be physically taxing, and there are risks. Instructors typically
recommend getting a physical prior to taking a class, but industry officials say
the sport is less dangerous than people generally think.
</P>
<P>
	   "Per 100,000 participants, there are as many accidents as you would have in
badminton - literally," said Jeff Nadler, vice president of industry relations
for PADI. "There are three times more accidents in swimming as a recreational
activity," said Nadler, referring to statistics from the National Safety
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, 85 people were killed in diving-relating accidents in North
American waters, including the Caribbean and Canada, according to Divers Alert
Network (DAN), an organization that provides insurance for scuba divers.
</P>
<P>
	   "But 25 to 30 percent of those cases are attributable to cardiac events, so
it may not be diving that caused those deaths, but rather poor physical
fitness," said Dan Nord, a paramedic at the Durham, N.C.-based organization who
works with injured divers.
</P>
<P>
	   "As divers, we like people to think that it's dangerous because it makes us
look cooler," said Pat Iapicca, owner of the Hoboken Dive Center. "In reality,
90 percent of the entire sport is getting over the anxiety, and once you get
over it, it's all downhill."

<HEADLINE> Barak Outlines Lebanon Pullout Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By SARI BASHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The army will retaliate harshly if Lebanese guerillas
attack Israel after it pulls out of Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Monday, outlining his post-withdrawal strategy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has taken care to signal his desire to withdraw through an agreement
with Syria. However, he has also made it clear that Israel is well-equipped to
defend itself should such an agreement fail to materialize.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Monday that Israeli strikes that destroyed three Lebanese power
stations ``shape the rules of the game gradually for the post-redeployment
period'' if Israel pulls out unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikes came after Hezbollah guerrillas killed five Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon in just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak emphasized, however, that he prefers to withdraw through an agreement,
telling an audience of American Jewish leaders that a unilateral pullout would
mean more casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   He repeated his pledge to withdraw from Lebanon by July, with or without an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   If guerrilla attacks continue after Israel pulls out, Barak said, ``we will
have to retaliate, to respond, very forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
	   The air strikes against Lebanese power stations marked the first time Israel
intentionally struck civilian targets in response to military casualties. The
Arab world condemned the strikes, and Syria, Lebanon and Egypt compared them to
tactics used by the Nazis in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The comparison was greeted with horror in a country where one-third of the
citizens are Holocaust survivors or their descendants -- and made peace with
Syria seem even more remote in the eyes of many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month after two rounds over a
Syrian demand for an upfront Israeli commitment to withdraw from the Golan
Heights, captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel refused to make such a pledge and insisted that security arrangements
and normalization be spelled out before the issue of borders is considered.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel occupies a strip of Lebanese territory six to nine miles wide, where
its soldiers engage Hezbollah guerrillas to keep them away from Israeli border
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to force the Israelis to withdraw. Opponents of
a unilateral Israeli pullout say the guerrillas will continue their attacks
afterward, hitting civilians in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Israelis maintain that Syria uses the low-level war to pressure Israel to
return the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maariv daily reported Monday that Syria has agreed to establish a place
where Druse residents in the Golan Heights can meet their relatives from Syria.
Throughout the 33 years of Israeli control over the Golan, relatives have
gathered at a ``Shouting Hill'' near a Druse village to communicate with each
other across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment about the report.

<HEADLINE> Group once allied with Pataki now running anti-Pataki ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A conservative anti-tax group that was once strongly
allied with Gov. George Pataki has started to run commercials across much of the
state lambasting his tax policies and economic treatment of upstate New York.
<P>
	   The television and radio ads look and sound like something that would come
from Democrats seeking to drive the Republican governor from office. They are
really from Change-New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The group has come to the conclusion that the Pataki of the 1994 campaign
and his first two years in office is not the Pataki who now resides in the
Executive Mansion, spokesman Brian Backstrom said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that there is a mentality, 'Tax hikes? We've done those. Hold the
line on spending? We've done that,"' Backstrom said. "We thought we were in this
for a marriage. We only got the honeymoon."
</P>
<P>
	   The group is particularly angered about a $400 million increase on state
cigarette taxes approved by Pataki and the state Legislature in December as well
as a proposed 2000-01 state budget from the governor that Change-New York
believes would increase spending by twice the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the behavior of fiscal conservatives," Backstrom contended.
"One of the reasons we felt a media campaign was warranted was this latest round
of tax hikes and excessive spending was not a blip on the radar screen, but the
next giant step of an intentional move leftward."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's aides had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The group has two anti-Pataki TV ads, one showing scenes of Niagara Falls
and other flowing waters and criticizing Pataki for proposing a fee on water
hookups. The money was to have gone to fund water-quality programs in the state,
though Pataki's office indicated late last week the governor was backing off the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The other TV ad says: "While Wall Street is booming, upstate New York is
being left behind." If upstate is treated as a separate state, the commercial
says it would be 49th in the country in job creation since Pataki became
governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Pataki," the ad implores, "stop hiking our taxes. Get back to
cutting them."
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said the ads are running in major upstate New York television
markets. He declined to say how much the group was paying for the commercials,
how long they will run or if others are in the works. He said the group will
stop airing the "water tax" commercial in light of Pataki's decision to back off
that proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno called the ads "very, very
one-sided" and "unfair." He complained they make no reference to the tax cuts
enacted under Pataki, estimated as having a cumulative savings for taxpayers of
a highest-in-the-nation $29 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he was also taken aback by the source of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were his biggest supporter in the first election (in 1994) so that's
why this is so surprising," he said on WROW-AM radio in Albany. "These ads are
almost vindictive."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the members of Change-New York's board are two financiers who have
contributed generously to his campaigns in the past, Richard Gilder and Bruce
Kovner.
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said top Change-New York officials were angered when Pataki failed
to show up for a scheduled meeting with them to discuss his taxing and other
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki insists his budget increases general fund spending by just over 2
percent or about the rate of inflation, but the overall increase when all funds
are factored in would be more than 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bill would permit New Jersey judges to earn income from side jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - "I think my term paper deserved a better grade that
a B-minus, your honor."
<P>
	   Picture a judge in the classroom moonlighting as a teacher, or working on
the side as a ski instructor, TV show host or tour guide. Or earning extra
income as a free-lance legal writer or lecturer.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges moonlight at all of these jobs and more in most other states, but New
Jersey law prohibits Superior Court judges from collecting salary for anything
on the side.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Michael Carroll, R-Morris, has introduced a bill, ACR-93, to
that would permit them to earn outside income as long as the work does not
interfere with court business or conflict with any cases they're hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatively low pay for New Jersey judges, who often earn less than the
lawyers appearing before them, has been long been a source of discontent in
legal circles.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chief Justice Deborah Poritz, for one, is against the idea of allowing
them to accept outside income and recently testified before an Assembly
committee that judicial work requires full-time attention.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is one of only three states that bar moonlighting, which is also
allowable for federal judges. To enact the change here, however, lawmakers must
propose a constitutional amendment that would require voter approval in a
November referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said it would be an asset for the state's legal system to expose law
students to experienced judges either as adjunct teachers or on the lecture
circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need some incentive to get those men and women in the acme of their
career into the classroom," he told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Monday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll sponsored a bill passed in January to boost Superior Court judges'
salaries from $115,000 to $141,000 over the next three years. The same bill will
increase lawmakers' salaries in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that law school graduates can secure positions paying $120,000 a
year, Carroll said more liberal financial rules are needed if the state is to
continue enticing qualified lawyers out of private firms and to the bench.
Carroll, who is a lawyer, concedes there is no shortage of people interested in
becoming judges, though he said he worries that the most qualified lawyers shy
away from the job.
</P>
<P>
	   But in her testimony before the Legislature in support of pay raises for
judges, Poritz dismissed the idea of judicial income from off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our judges live by the strictest code of ethics in the nation and are
barred from outside employment by the New Jersey Constitution, and properly so,
because being a judge in New Jersey is a full-time job and more," Poritz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Supreme Court Justice Stewart Pollock, who frequently gave lectures
without compensation and who put four children though college on a justice's
salary, told the newspaper the current system works well and should not be
tinkered with.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollock said New Jersey's judiciary enjoys a good reputation nationwide in
part because judges are utterly free from outside influences.

<HEADLINE> Long Island police arrest man linked to Peddie School sex attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Police on Long Island have arrested a 24-year-old
drifter who Mercer County authorities say is responsible for a knifepoint sex
attack on a 16-year-old prep school student in Hightstown.
<P>
	   Emily J. Hornaday, a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor's office, said
Michael Lee Allen Jr., 24, is charged with a predawn attack at the Peddie School
on Feb. 11. Allen allegedly assaulted and robbed the student before being chased
off the campus by security officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen could face up to 40 years in prison on the New Jersey charges of
aggravated sexual assault with a weapon, armed robbery and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Nassau County police believe Allen is responsible for a series of sex
attacks over the past three years in various jurisdictions around New York City.
He was arrested Friday in East Williston, N.Y. Nassau County authorities laid
out the details at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   They have charged Allen in a sex attack remarkably similar to the Peddie
School attack. According to police, Allen slipped into a C.W. Post College dorm
at 4 a.m. last July 5 and sexually assaulted a male teen-ager at knifepoint. The
victim was on the Old Brookville campus for a summer baseball camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they caught Allen after tracking his use of credit cards he
stole from the same campus on Jan. 31. Authorities in neighboring Sussex County
and in Dutchess County in upstate New York are considering charges against Allen
for similar school dormitory attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is believed and alleged that he targeted prep schools through the
Internet," Hornaday said, "and that he had actually gotten directions from the
Internet to go to these various places."
</P>
<P>
	   The Peddie School attack occurred at 4:30 a.m. Hightstown Police and Peddie
School officials said they could not tell how Allen entered the dormitory, which
has a security alarm. The campus also has its own security force.
</P>
<P>
	   "The school is actively reviewing its security provisions to make sure
nothing like this happens again," said Sandy Tattersall, Peddie's dean of
students. "I can't recall something like this."
</P>
<P>
	   The coed school, dating to 1864, has about 500 students in grades eight
through 12. About 300 students are housed in seven dormitories on the campus.

<HEADLINE> Gore and Bradley at the Apollo - debate night in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Warming up for their debut at the Apollo, Al Gore walked
the streets of Harlem enjoying the advantages of being Bill Clinton's vice
president while Bill Bradley questioned Gore's willingness to help people who
don't have health insurance.
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential rivals were meeting late Monday at the Apollo
Theatre, a Harlem landmark, in a 90-minute debate on urban and racial issues.
State party officials estimate that between 35 percent and 40 percent of voters
in New York's Democratic primary on March 7 will be black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from his shared tenure with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Davita Cook, a forensic science student, called after Gore as he and Rep.
Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., picked their way down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,
past the Harlem Farmers Market and Uptown Jean Co., where two-piece sets of
thermal underwear advertised for $5.99.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do you promise to pick up where Clinton left off? Do you promise to stay
true?" the woman called out to Gore, who did not respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook told a reporter she was voting for Gore "only because he is following
in Clinton's footsteps; it's Clinton we adore."
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Pena, an immigrant from Santo Domingo showed off the voter registration
card that identified him as a Democrat. "I have three babies. I need a job," the
man told Gore in halting English. Gore referred him to a caseworker in Rangel's
local office.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the street, the Apollo marquee advertised "Amateur Night" and made no
mention of the face-off between Gore and Bradley - their first since Gore
solidified his front-runner status with wins in Iowa and New Hampshire. Bradley
has since slipped far behind in some polls and is struggling to build a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides promised a more combative candidate for the two-week sprint to "Super
Tuesday" when more than a dozen states will vote. Bradley scheduled a speech on
Tuesday on Long Island that was being billed as the kickoff of an effort to
expose inconsistencies and dishonesty in Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign strategist Bill Knapp dismissed the pumped-up strategy by
saying, "He's going to throw battery acid around." Knapp said Gore's own sharp
critique of Bradley and his agenda was different because Gore is "just defending
his record and saying what he wants to do as president."
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bradley talked tough before 100 or so parents and other local
residents as he campaigned at Brooklyn's P.S. 24 with City Councilman Angel
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling health care "an American birthright," Bradley, who has proposed a
plan for universal access to health insurance, warned that voters should be
skeptical of Gore's criticism of that plan. "I am disappointed that Al Gore has
attacked and distorted it. It casts doubt on his commitment to a basic plank in
the Democratic platform."
</P>
<P>
	   Universal health care has been part of the Democratic Party's platform for
nearly 40 years, Bradley said. "Now is the opportunity to make good on that
promise."
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Banks, an art teacher at a Brooklyn high school, called Bradley a
little too liberal for his taste. But Banks also said he was voting for Bradley
because, "He's more open-minded than Gore."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Clinton administration achievements for which Gore sought a share
of credit on Monday were the federal "empowerment zone" investments that have
attracted businesses to formerly rundown urban centers like the main street in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   As Gore briefly ducked into an Old Navy store to ask shoppers for their
votes, aides told reporters that Harlem was one of the empowerment zones that
Gore worked on with Rangel.
</P>
<P>
	   Omitted was a crucial piece of legislative history: that it was Bradley who,
as a senator from New Jersey in 1993, wrote the blueprint for the empowerment
zones and - with Rangel, then-Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and New York
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan - was instrumental in pushing the legislation
through Congress.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Law Prompts Nigerian Clash  </HEADLINE>
   By GILBERT DA COSTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Rioting Muslim and Christian youths seized parts of
the northern city of Kaduna on Monday in clashes over a proposal to bring
Islamic law to the state. More than 20 people were killed, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence began when hundreds of Christian demonstrators marched through
the streets chanting ``No to sharia! No to sharia!''
</P>
<P>
	   Counter-chants by Muslims who support sharia, or Islamic law, quickly
degenerated into fighting between the two groups, said the witnesses, who spoke
by telephone on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   By the afternoon, the two sides had gained control of different
neighborhoods and divided the city into warring zones.
</P>
<P>
	   Police largely stayed away from the fighting but cruised the city with
sirens blaring.
</P>
<P>
	   A witness said he saw at least 20 bodies in one Kaduna neighborhood. Other
corpses were spotted elsewhere. Bonfires raged throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Joseph Roman Catholic cathedral and the nearby central mosque were
both set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
	   State Gov. Ahmad Maikarfi imposed a 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew throughout
the city. Military and police were put on high alert. Most civilians remained at
home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are working hard to bring the situation under control,'' state police
commissioner Hamisu Isah said. The city of Kaduna, the state capital, is about
120 miles north of Nigeria's capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharia went into effect without incident last month in nearby Zamfara state,
which is overwhelmingly Muslim. Muslim law prohibits such things as drinking
alcohol and also calls for separate schools and public transportation for males
and females. Islamic courts were established to try and mete out punishment to
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of other states in Nigeria's largely Muslim north -- including
Kaduna -- are considering following suit. About 40 percent of Kaduna state is
Christian.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say changes brought by sharia will not affect Christians, and
that Christians will be allowed to seek redress in secular courts. But the issue
has become increasingly divisive in Nigeria, a nation of 120 million people with
a long history of bloody ethnic and religious violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian leaders across the country have denounced the arrival of Islamic
law, and newspapers based in the largely Christian south fill pages with ominous
headlines warning that non-Muslims will face bitter discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Political leaders in Nigeria, where 15 years of military rule gave way to
democratic elections last year, have remained largely quiet on the topic.

<HEADLINE> Henson Co. Sold to German Media Co.  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- It's not easy bein' gruen.
</P>
<P>
	   Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are becoming the latest American icons to go
German, following in the footsteps of Chrysler Corp. and Random House.
</P>
<P>
	   Munich-based media company EM.TV and Merchandising is buying the Jim Henson
Co. for $680 million in cash and stock, giving it exclusive rights to such fuzzy
critters as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Bert and Ernie, and the scraggly green
furball, Oscar the Grouch.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are a strong believer in brands," deputy chairman of EM.TV Florian Haffa
said Monday. "With the Jim Henson Company, you don't get bigger internationally
recognized brands than Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, in the works for several months, also seals ownership of some of
the world's best loved children's shows including "Sesame Street," "The Muppet
Show," "Jim Henson's Muppet Babies" and "Fraggle Rock," not to mention a string
of Muppet films.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sesame Street," first broadcast in 1969, is seen in 140 countries alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyout gives EM.TV rights to more than 5,000 licensed Muppet products
that have hit toy stores over the last 10 years. That includes the
talking-and-laughing Tickle Me Elmo doll -- which triggered buying frenzies at
toy stores across the United States -- and more than 30 million Muppet books
sold in 45 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV also gets access to the Los Angeles-based company's science-fiction
shows, which include "Farscape," a top-rated show on Britain's BBC and the Sci
Fi Channel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV is well-established in Europe with television and marketing rights to
the popular Japanese animation Pokemon as well as Bugs Bunny in Germany. It said
the deal would help it penetrate the American and Asian markets where Jim
Henson's Muppets already have deep roots.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV hasn't been the only German company to expand its market share
overseas through corporate takeovers. Besides Daimler-Benz, which acquired
Chrysler Corp. in 1998 to help penetrate the American market, German media giant
Bertelsmann bought the No. 1 U.S. publisher Random House that same year.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Henson, creator and alter-ego of Kermit the Frog and scores of other
Muppet characters, founded his self-named company in 1958, inventing the term
"muppet" as a cross between the words marionette and puppet. Kermit was known
for singing songs such as "Bein' Green."
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Henson Co. has been run by Henson's son and daughter and chief operating
officer Charles H. Rivkin since Henson's death in 1990. EM.TV plans no shakeups
for the Jim Henson crew, which will continue to have creative independence with
its headquarters in Los Angeles and studios in New York and London, Haffa said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Germany, we have a term that comes from English: 'Never change a winning
team,"' Haffa said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. also has production agreements with the American cable
company Odyssey Channel, Capital Cities/ABC and Sony's Columbia Tristar Home
Video.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV says it wants to work with the Henson Company on investing more in the
fast-growing Odyssey Channel, which is operated jointly with Hallmark
Entertainment. Odyssey Channel is seen in nearly 30 million households in the
United States, though officials hope to increase that number to 50 million
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded by Thomas Haffa in 1989, EM.TV produces children's and family
programs, manages the distribution of such TV shows as "Pigs Next Door" and
"Norman Normal," and produces various television specials such as the Snowboard
World Championships 1999. The company has a portfolio of about 28,500 half-hour
episodes marketed under the brand Junior.

<HEADLINE> European and Asian Stocks Slump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    The Associated Press
</P>
<P>
	   Most European and Asian stocks fell Monday amid concerns that higher
interest rates in the United States would hurt corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of their fear stemmed from comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated that more rate hikes were likely if the
U.S. economy did not cool down to more manageable levels.

<HEADLINE> 6 Skiers Die in Europe Avalanches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) -- Avalanches swept down Alpine slopes at the height of
the ski season Monday, killing three skiers in Italy and three in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   In Italy, back-to-back avalanches in the northern Venosta Valley trapped a
group of seven Germans and one Italian skiing on an unauthorized route, alpine
rescue official Luigi Weger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Searchers recovered the bodies of two women and one man and accounted for
the remaining five skiers, Weger said. At least one was hospitalized with severe
hypothermia. The valley is about 90 miles from the northern Italian city of
Bolzano.
</P>
<P>
	   In Switzerland, police blamed an avalanche near the popular Davos ski resort
on a German man and his son who skiied into an area of deep snow despite
avalanche warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The two set off a snowslide that covered the father and two Swiss men skiing
farther down the mountain on a prepared course, police said. Only the son
survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent heavy snowfall followed by blue skies and sunshine Monday had
prompted avalanche alerts in Switzerland and Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   In central Switzerland, an avalanche next to a children's ski area caught an
adult and three children at the Lasenberg ski area near Erlenbach.
</P>
<P>
	   The adult and two of the children managed to climb out of the snow by
themselves and pulled a 6-year-old girl to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian schools are out this week for what is known as ``white week,''
freeing pupils for family ski trips.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Swiss youngsters also are given weeklong school vacations during the
winter -- most frequently in February -- to go skiing.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, alpine avalanches killed 12 people in Italy and 36 in Switzerland,
according to an Italian avalanche center.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Halts 'Millionaire' Broadcast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Authorities ordered a television station Monday to
stop broadcasting the Swedish version of the popular quiz show "Who Wants to be
a Millionaire," ruling the program is more a lottery than a real contest.
</P>
<P>
	   The government Lottery Inspection Agency said TV4 would need special
permission to run a lottery and ordered the station either to change the format
of the program or stop broadcasting it, the newspaper Aftonbladet reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A TV4 spokesman confirmed the ruling but said the station had filed an
appeal in civil court, and planned to air the final two shows in their present
form.
</P>
<P>
	   "The decision from the authority for lotteries is based on their point of
view that they think you could only make guesses in the program to take high
prizes, and we deny that opinion," program director Jan Scherman said. "This is
a competition where you only can win if you have the knowledge."
</P>
<P>
	   The show originated in Britain and is a television sensation in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Contestants in the Swedish show must answer 15 multiple-choice questions to
win the ultimate prize worth more than $1.1 million. Nobody has won the jackpot
since the Swedish version began last month, though one contestant won the
equivalent of $288,000, Scherman said.

<HEADLINE> Group once allied with Pataki now running anti-Pataki ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A conservative anti-tax group that was once strongly
allied with Gov. George Pataki has started to run commercials across much of the
state lambasting his tax policies and economic treatment of upstate New York.
<P>
	   The television and radio ads look and sound like something that would come
from Democrats seeking to drive the Republican governor from office. They are
really from Change-New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The group has come to the conclusion that the Pataki of the 1994 campaign
and his first two years in office is not the Pataki who now resides in the
Executive Mansion, spokesman Brian Backstrom said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that there is a mentality, 'Tax cuts? We've done those. Hold the
line on spending? We've done that,"' Backstrom said. "We thought we were in this
for a marriage. We only got the honeymoon."
</P>
<P>
	   The group is particularly angered about a $400 million increase on state
cigarette taxes approved by Pataki and the state Legislature in December as well
as a proposed 2000-01 state budget from the governor that Change-New York
believes would increase spending by twice the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not the behavior of fiscal conservatives," Backstrom contended.
"One of the reasons we felt a media campaign was warranted was this latest round
of tax hikes and excessive spending was not a blip on the radar screen, but the
next giant step of an intentional move leftward."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the group knows it is "deliberately
distorting the facts" with an ad which says upstate New York, if taken as a
separate state, has had job growth ranked 49th nationally since Pataki has
become governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "Upstate is growing jobs faster than many places, such as Illinois, Ohio,
North Carolina and Pennsylvania," McKeon said. "In fact, upstate has more jobs
now than ever before. It's a far cry from the final years of the Cuomo
administration. New Yorkers are not going to be fooled by these misleading ads."
</P>
<P>
	   The group has two anti-Pataki TV ads, one showing scenes of Niagara Falls
and other flowing waters and criticizing Pataki for proposing a fee on water
hookups. The money was to have gone to fund water-quality programs in the state,
though Pataki's office indicated the governor was backing off the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The other TV ad says: "While Wall Street is booming, upstate New York is
being left behind." If upstate is treated as a separate state, the commercial
says it would be 49th in the country in job creation since Pataki became
governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Pataki," the ad implores, "stop hiking our taxes. Get back to
cutting them."
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said the ads are running in major upstate New York television
markets. He declined to say how much the group was paying for the commercials,
how long they will run or if others are in the works. He said the group will
stop airing the "water tax" commercial in light of Pataki's decision to back off
that proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno called the ads "very, very
one-sided" and "unfair." He complained they make no reference to the tax cuts
enacted under Pataki, estimated as having a cumulative savings for taxpayers of
a highest-in-the-nation $29 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he was also taken aback by the source of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were his biggest supporter in the first election (in 1994) so that's
why this is so surprising," he said on WROW-AM radio in Albany. "These ads are
almost vindictive."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the members of Change-New York's board are two financiers who have
contributed generously to his campaigns in the past, Richard Gilder and Bruce
Kovner.
</P>
<P>
	   Backstrom said top Change-New York officials were angered when Pataki failed
to show up for a scheduled meeting with them to discuss his taxing and other
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki insists his budget increases general fund spending by just over 2
percent or about the rate of inflation, but the overall increase when all funds
are factored in would be more than 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore and Bradley at the Apollo - debate night in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Warming up for their debut at the Apollo, Al Gore walked
the streets of Harlem enjoying the advantages of being Bill Clinton's vice
president while Bill Bradley questioned Gore's willingness to help people who
don't have health insurance.
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential rivals were meeting late Monday at the Apollo
Theatre, a Harlem landmark, in a 90-minute debate on urban and racial issues.
State party officials estimate that between 35 percent and 40 percent of voters
in New York's Democratic primary on March 7 will be black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from his shared tenure with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Davita Cook, a forensic science student, called after Gore as he and Rep.
Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., picked their way down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,
past the Harlem Farmers Market and Uptown Jean Co., where two-piece sets of
thermal underwear advertised for $5.99.
</P>
<P>
	   "Do you promise to pick up where Clinton left off? Do you promise to stay
true?" the woman called out to Gore, who did not respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook told a reporter she was voting for Gore "only because he is following
in Clinton's footsteps; it's Clinton we adore."
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Pena, an immigrant from Santo Domingo showed off the voter registration
card that identified him as a Democrat. "I have three babies. I need a job," the
man told Gore in halting English. Gore referred him to a caseworker in Rangel's
local office.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the street, the Apollo marquee advertised "Amateur Night" and made no
mention of the face-off between Gore and Bradley - their first since Gore
solidified his front-runner status with wins in Iowa and New Hampshire. Bradley
has since slipped far behind in some polls and is struggling to build a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides promised a more combative candidate for the two-week sprint to "Super
Tuesday" when more than a dozen states will vote. Bradley scheduled a speech on
Tuesday on Long Island that was being billed as the kickoff of an effort to
expose inconsistencies and dishonesty in Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign strategist Bill Knapp dismissed the pumped-up strategy by
saying, "He's going to throw battery acid around." Knapp said Gore's own sharp
critique of Bradley and his agenda was different because Gore is "just defending
his record and saying what he wants to do as president."
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bradley talked tough before 100 or so parents and other local
residents as he campaigned at Brooklyn's P.S. 24 with City Councilman Angel
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling health care "an American birthright," Bradley, who has proposed a
plan for universal access to health insurance, warned that voters should be
skeptical of Gore's criticism of that plan. "I am disappointed that Al Gore has
attacked and distorted it. It casts doubt on his commitment to a basic plank in
the Democratic platform."
</P>
<P>
	   Universal health care has been part of the Democratic Party's platform for
nearly 40 years, Bradley said. "Now is the opportunity to make good on that
promise."
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Banks, an art teacher at a Brooklyn high school, called Bradley a
little too liberal for his taste. But Banks also said he was voting for Bradley
because, "He's more open-minded than Gore."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Clinton administration achievements for which Gore sought a share
of credit on Monday were the federal "empowerment zone" investments that have
attracted businesses to formerly rundown urban centers like the main street in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   As Gore briefly ducked into an Old Navy store to ask shoppers for their
votes, aides told reporters that Harlem was one of the empowerment zones that
Gore worked on with Rangel.
</P>
<P>
	   Omitted was a crucial piece of legislative history: that it was Bradley who,
as a senator from New Jersey in 1993, wrote the blueprint for the empowerment
zones and - with Rangel, then-Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and New York
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan - was instrumental in pushing the legislation
through Congress.

<HEADLINE> Barak Outlines Lebanon Pullout Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By SARI BASHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The army will retaliate harshly if Lebanese guerillas
attack Israel after it pulls out of Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Monday, outlining his post-withdrawal strategy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has taken care to signal his desire to withdraw through an agreement
with Syria. However, he has also made it clear that Israel is well-equipped to
defend itself should such an agreement fail to materialize.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Monday that Israeli strikes that destroyed three Lebanese power
stations ``shape the rules of the game gradually for the post-redeployment
period'' if Israel pulls out unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
	   The strikes came after Hezbollah guerrillas killed five Israeli soldiers in
south Lebanon in just two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak emphasized, however, that he prefers to withdraw through an agreement,
telling an audience of American Jewish leaders that a unilateral pullout would
mean more casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   He repeated his pledge to withdraw from Lebanon by July, with or without an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   If guerrilla attacks continue after Israel pulls out, Barak said, ``we will
have to retaliate, to respond, very forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
	   The air strikes against Lebanese power stations marked the first time Israel
intentionally struck civilian targets in response to military casualties. The
Arab world condemned the strikes, and Syria, Lebanon and Egypt compared them to
tactics used by the Nazis in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The comparison was greeted with horror in a country where one-third of the
citizens are Holocaust survivors or their descendants -- and made peace with
Syria seem even more remote in the eyes of many Israelis.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month after two rounds over a
Syrian demand for an upfront Israeli commitment to withdraw from the Golan
Heights, captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel refused to make such a pledge and insisted that security arrangements
and normalization be spelled out before the issue of borders is considered.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel occupies a strip of Lebanese territory six to nine miles wide, where
its soldiers engage Hezbollah guerrillas to keep them away from Israeli border
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to force the Israelis to withdraw. Opponents of
a unilateral Israeli pullout say the guerrillas will continue their attacks
afterward, hitting civilians in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Giving voice to mounting public pressure to pull out, Israeli President Ezer
Weizman, whose post is largely ceremonial, told a pro-withdrawal group Monday
that he is ``dying to leave Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What, am I crazy?'' he asked. ``To sit there and see that, through a gun
hole, they are hitting me with guided missiles?''
</P>
<P>
	   Israelis maintain that Syria uses the low-level war to pressure Israel to
return the Golan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maariv daily reported Monday that Syria has agreed to establish a place
where Druse residents in the Golan Heights can meet their relatives from Syria.
Throughout the 33 years of Israeli control over the Golan, relatives have
gathered at a ``Shouting Hill'' near a Druse village to communicate with each
other across the border.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment about the report.

<HEADLINE> David Letterman Returns to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman, on his first show back after quintuple
bypass surgery, fought back tears as he thanked the doctors and nurses who
"saved my life."
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, the "Late Show" host proved heart surgery hasn't softened his
cutting humor. During the show, taped Friday and scheduled to air Monday night,
he took shots at CBS, NBC, ABC, Hillary Rodham Clinton, decaffeinated coffee and
the Super Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking thinner but otherwise healthy five weeks after his operation,
Letterman reached down twice and touched his toes before his monologue. He
promised to show his scar but didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   "After what I've been through," he said, "I'm just happy to be wearing
clothes that open in the front."
</P>
<P>
	   He brought his six doctors and two nurses onstage, referring to one surgeon
as "Michaelangelo with a bone saw."
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't have been more proud when these guys carved their initials in
me," the 52-year-old comic said, referring to a New York obstetrician who
recently etched his initials into a woman's abdomen after delivering her baby by
Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
	   But Letterman appeared on the verge of breaking down when he thanked his
doctors. "It was five weeks ago today that the men and women right here saved my
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said one of his doctors had been given a hard time when the
comedian joked that his cholesterol was 680 before the surgery. In reality, his
cholesterol was 170 -- but his father's death from a heart attack also made him
a risk for heart disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before his surgery, Letterman said, "my career flashed before my eyes.
I'm telling you something. It was mostly awkward silences."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he had newfound respect for President Clinton, whose wife was
Letterman's "Late Show" guest two nights before his surgery. "I spent a half
hour with Hillary," he said, "and look what happened to me."
</P>
<P>
	   He also joked about his bypass operation, which involves surgically creating
new paths for blood to flow to his heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get the 'Tonight Show,"' he
said, a reference to NBC's decision seven years ago to pick Jay Leno over him to
replace Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Seinfeld walked onstage during Letterman's monologue.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are you doing here?" Seinfeld asked. "I thought you were dead."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm on CBS," Letterman replied. "I ain't dead. Why don't you go on home to
your wife?"
</P>
<P>
	   Robin Williams, who appeared in surgical scrubs, and "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" host Regis Philbin were Letterman's first guests. Letterman first
revealed on the air that he needed heart tests during a chat with Philbin.
</P>
<P>
	   One concession to his health: it was Letterman's first show in which he
wasn't sipping regular coffee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, God, I hate decaffeinated coffee ... It's like low-alcohol gin. What's
the point?" he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman still needs to take things slow as he recovers. Bill Cosby fills
in as "Late Show" guest host Tuesday, with Letterman returning to work
Wednesday. Philbin's talk show partner, Kathie Lee Gifford, is Thursday's
substitute, and Letterman expects to work on Friday.

lower-income New Yorkers become eligible for a federal home heating oil
assistance program.
<P>
	   Pataki said he will change the income standards for the Home Energy
Assistance Program (HEAP). Currently, families within 150 percent of the poverty
level qualify for the program in New York, but Pataki said he'd change the
eligibility standard by making it 60 percent of the state's median income.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people making $16,596 a year or less currently qualify for the HEAP
program. That income total would increase to $22,812 using the 60 percent of
median income standard.
</P>
<P>
	   For a family of four, the income threshold would increase from $25,056 to
$33,547.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala wrote
to 18 governors, including Pataki, reminding them that they have the power to
expand the eligibility standards under HEAP.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton last week made another $125 million available under HEAP
and asked Congress to appropriate a new $600 million.
</P>
<P>
	   So far this year, New York has received $73 million in HEAP benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday continued to call on Clinton to release some of the
nation's petroleum reserves to ease the pricing crisis, a move the president has
resisted so far.
</P>
<P>
	   The price spike was created by the decision of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reduce output by 4.3 million barrels a day and
exacerbated by frigid weather in January in the Northeast.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformers Win Parliament Seats  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Reformists led in voting for most of Tehran's
parliament seats Monday and looked set to sweep there -- a victory that would
guarantee them a parliamentary majority with dozens of other seats still left to
be decided nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The results sent a clear message to the hard-line clergy that Iranians are
fed up with their 21-year restrictive rule that dictates day-to-day lives. They
were also an endorsement of President Mohamed Khatami, who has advocated
dismantling many social and political restrictions since he came to power in
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a vote to legalize and institutionalize Khatami's reforms. Our
priority now is to make a serious effort to defend people's rights,'' said
reformist candidate Meysam Saeedi.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament has been dominated by hard-liners since 1979, when the Islamic
revolution installed the Shiite clergy's rule. Hard-liners have obstructed
Khatami at every step during his term. They have used special courts to jail his
allies, and pro-conservative vigilantes have attacked reformist politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Vote counts from Friday's election were still trickling in Monday, and final
results were not expected to be announced until later in the week. But so far,
the reformists have won 137 of 191 seats in the 290-member parliament, or
Majlis. The conservatives have won 44 and independents 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-nine seats will not be decided until run-off elections in April. But
even now, a simple majority of 146 is within the reformists' reach. Their
candidates were leading the vote count in 26 of Tehran's 30 races.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss of Tehran will be particularly humiliating to the hard-liners, who
had fielded some of their top candidates there against equally high-profile
reformers, including Khatami's younger brother, Mohammadreza Khatami.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, Russia and Turkey welcomed the results. In the past,
encouraged by Khatami's attitude, many reformers had suggested reopening talks
with the United States, which used to be reviled by Iran as the ``Great Satan.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners see the ruling clerics as the unquestionable interpreters of
God's word. Khatami, by contrast, believes in the rule of law and people's right
to make their own choices about their lives, such as the music they listen to or
the clothes they wear.
</P>
<P>
	   The reformist sweep has been such that leaders even loosely associated with
the hard-liners -- former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, for example -- have been
defeated. Although a moderate, voters saw Rafsanjani as untrustworthy after he
failed to stand up for reformists jailed by hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   It remains to be seen whether the hard-liners will continue to thwart the
reformists when the new legislature convenes in June. Despite their likely loss
of parliament, the hard-liners still control the Guardian Council, a supervisory
body that approves all bills parliament passes. They also oversee the judiciary,
the armed forces and radio and television stations.

<HEADLINE> Philbin Apparently Feeling Deprived  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Giving away all that money on "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" apparently has host Regis Philbin feeling a little deprived.
</P>
<P>
	   He picked a high-profile venue -- David Letterman's first "Late Show" since
heart surgery -- to reveal he isn't happy that ABC hasn't rewarded him for his
role on television's most popular prime-time show.
</P>
<P>
	   "How's your little quiz show doing?" Letterman asked Philbin, one of his
guests on the show taped Friday that was to air Monday. "Are you making a lot of
dough?"
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I'm not," Philbin replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those pantywaists at ABC are not paying you what you're worth?" Letterman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think so," Philbin said, then quickly tried to change the subject
back to Letterman's bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reply to a phone message and a page left for ABC
representatives on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin signed on as "Millionaire" host last year, when it was supposed to
be a limited summer replacement series on ABC. He even privately campaigned for
the job after being intrigued by the British version of the game show.
</P>
<P>
	   It quickly became a television phenomenon that now runs three times a week
in prime time, sometimes more. Philbin's question to contestants, "is that your
final answer," is a national catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" is singlehandedly responsible for ABC's leap past CBS and NBC
into first place in the prime-time ratings this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin said, during an interview in October before "Millionaire" became a
regular series, that he had signed a five-year contract to be host. At the time,
he said he had not sought to renegotiate with ABC.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Must Deliver  </HEADLINE>
   By ANWAR FARUQI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   President Mohammad Khatami's reformist faction routed the hard-line
opposition in historic legislative elections that Iranians hope will lead to
more freedom and jobs in this fundamentalist Muslim country. Now he has to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranians are looking for a cure for their stagnant economy and rampant
unemployment. Many also want continued expansion of social freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be a new challenge for Khatami, who has pushed reforms since 1997
but thus far has been restrained by hard-liners who dominated other positions of
power.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy percent of Iran's 62 million people are below 30 years of age. Tired
of the hard-line clergy that has ruled with an iron hand since overthrowing the
U.S.-backed shah in the 1979 Islamic revolution, young people were behind
Khatami's 1997 election victory and the thrashing of the hard-liners in Friday's
voting for the Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final returns are not yet in, the reformists have won 137 of 191
seats so far -- 72 percent -- and are leading in crucial races in Tehran.
Victories there will assure them a majority in the 290-seat Majlis, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, Iranians had blamed almost all of the nation's ills on the
hard-liners. But after it consolidates its new power, Khatami's pro-reform
faction will have to take direct responsibility for Iran's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
	   Official figures put the unemployment rate at 20 percent, but Iranian
economists say the rate is much higher. Nearly every family has young men and
women who can't find jobs and can't marry because they cannot afford housing.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior civil servant earns no more than the equivalent of $300 per month
-- just enough to make ends meet. In a country that is the world's third-largest
oil producer, many workers hold two or even three jobs just to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   Little is likely to change without first tackling the bonyads -- huge,
wide-ranging foundations that control millions in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   After the revolution, the enormous assets of the shah and his cronies were
given to the bonyads to care for the needy. While they still do that, their
focus has changed to acquiring wealth by controlling large chunks of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative estimates say the dozen or so main bonyads control at least a
quarter of the economy. The largest, the Bonyad Mostazafan, cares for the poor
and veterans of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, but it also owns everything from soft
drink plants to luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   The bonyads are not audited and it is unknown if they even pay taxes.
Constitutionally, the bonyads stand above the law and are answerable only to
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the hard-line supreme leader whose powers greatly
outstrip those of the elected president. Khamenei, who is unelected, has veto
power over virtually everything.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami has until now avoided head-on confrontation with the hard-line
clergy. But despite his new strength, he will have to find ways to work with
them. The hard-line Guardian Council has veto power over all bills passed by
parliament, and hard-liners still control the military and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran already has the freest press in the Middle East, and media freedoms
launched by Khatami are likely to continue. The ban on satellite dish antennas
and Western music could be lifted quickly by a reformist Majlis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Khatami will face a strong hard-line backlash if he tries to go so far
as to make the hijab -- the Islamic covering women must wear in public to hide
the shape of the female form -- a matter of choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic recovery here also is hampered by Tehran's relations with the
United States, which the hard-liners call the ``Great Satan'' and consider
Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington severed diplomatic ties after Islamic militants stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Since
then, Iran has been under a U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington has indicated it would be more willing to deal with an Iran
controlled by reformists.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami is expected to move cautiously when it comes to the United States,
only acting if Washington provides substantive gestures of goodwill. Those could
include the freeing of billions in frozen Iranian assets or discontinuation of
the 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act when it comes up for renewal next year.
</P>
<P>
	   But Khatami may find it hard to move slowly: After more than 20 years of
waiting, Iran's young want a quick fix.

<P>
    The Associated Press
</P>
<P>
	   Most European and Asian stocks fell Monday amid concerns that higher
interest rates in the United States would hurt corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of their fear stemmed from comments made by U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated that more rate hikes were likely if the
U.S. economy did not cool down to more manageable levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading U.S. indicators such as the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Nasdaq composite index both tumbled 3 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Asian and European markets followed suit Monday. In London, the FTSE-100
Share Index finished down 1.4 percent, or 83.40, to 6,081.6, while the Paris
CAC-40 index tumbled 1.6 percent, or 95.44, to 5,967.28.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese benchmark Nikkei Stock Average shed 245.28, or 1.23 percent, to
finish at 19,543.75.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. stock and bond markets were closed Monday in observance of the
Presidents' Day holiday, giving foreign markets little guidance.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fall on Wall Street took people by surprise considering the economic
news (Friday) wasn't too bad," said Peter Caulkett, equities salesman at Teather
&AMP; Greenwood in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Caulkett said investors are now "frightened in case it's the beginning of a
serious setback" and aren't likely to do any buying until New York investors
return Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors are waiting to see how shares will recover tomorrow," Caulkett
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan, who said he is worried the hot U.S. economy may lead to higher
inflation, issued his warning in testimony on Thursday before the U.S. Congress.
Though it may cool the economy, higher interest rates may weigh down corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rate fears caused the Dow Jones industrial average to plunge 295.05
points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 10,219.52 on Friday. The technology-laden
Nasdaq composite index, which had seemed relatively immune to interest-rate
worries, fell 137.18 points to 4,411.74.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading in London, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 111.22 Japanese
yen above its late New York level of 110.96 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro was quoted at 98.64 cents, up from its late New York price of 98.49
cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell 4.28 points,

<HEADLINE> Ukraine To Let Currency Float  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- The Ukrainian government and central bank announced
Monday that the national currency, the hryvna, is being allowed to float after
years of trying to keep its value within a trading band.
</P>
<P>
	   The move aims "to assist Ukraine's integration into the world market," the
Cabinet and the bank said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, Ukraine tried to keep the official rate within a "trading
corridor;" the most recent trading band was 3.4 to 4.6 hryvna to the dollar. But
street trading, seen as a more reliable indicator of the currency's real value
than the official rate, put the hryvna at 5.57 to the dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The move "will keep Ukrainian goods competitive and enterprises profitable,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the same time, the Cabinet and the National Bank will closely follow the
country's economic development and the situation on the currency market in order
to protect the monetary system, ensure the stability of the hryvna and pursue a
currency policy that will promote Ukraine's economic growth," the statement
said, according to the news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, a top government official said an audit of the National Bank
and an inspection of Ukraine's use of International Monetary Fund credits will
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   An IMF mission held a final meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko
before their scheduled departure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Agreements were reached "on many points," mission leader Mohammad
Shadman-Valavi said after the meeting, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent stories in the Financial Times have claimed the central bank misused
IMF loans in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper based its story on the evidence of former Premier Pavlo Lazarenko,
who was charged with money laundering and is currently in custody in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Britain Boosts Fee To Help BBC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The government decided Monday to raise the annual fee
citizens pay to watch television to help the state-supported British
Broadcasting Corp. fund its digital TV expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The fee, currently $160, will increase by 1.5 percent above the rate of
inflation for seven years beginning this April, Culture Secretary Chris Smith
told the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
	   That translates to a $4.80 increase this year -- far less than the BBC
wanted.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said the boosted fee would give the BBC about $320 million extra
through 2006, but added that the corporation must in turn raise $1.6 billion
itself through internal savings and external funding.
</P>
<P>
	   "As well as providing a greater variety of programs, the BBC must become
even more cost-effective and quality-conscious," Smith said. "Extra funding must
also be accompanied by improved accountability."
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, an independent panel had proposed a separate $38.40 fee be
imposed on viewers already receiving digital channels to help meet the extra
$1.12 billion the BBC had said it needed for its plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation wants to establish new digital channels and further develop
its existing digital outlets and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the BBC's bosses gave the government's announcement a cautious
welcome, saying the certainty of extra funding for the next seven years was
comforting but that some plans would have to be scaled down.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's less than we asked for, but it's above the rate of inflation and the
BBC will do its best to make the best use of it in broadcasting terms," chairman
Sir Christopher Bland said.
</P>
<P>
	   Refusing to rule out staff cutbacks, Bland said: "In terms of job losses,
it's far too soon to say whether there will be any."
</P>
<P>
	   He said details of how the corporation proposed to make efficiency savings
would be made public "in a couple of months."
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the BBC's commercial rivals said they were pleased the government
had not imposed a separate digital fee. But they noted that the corporation was
still getting a decided advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a huge payday for the BBC," said Tony Ball, chief executive of
British Sky Broadcasting. "Despite the culture secretary's recognition that the
BBC needs to raise its game and be more cost-effective, the corporation is being
given millions more in public money."

<HEADLINE> 80,000 Protest Navy in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
   By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Summoned by Puerto Rico's top religious
leaders, more than 80,000 people staged one of the biggest demonstrations in
years here Monday to protest the planned resumption of U.S. Navy training on the
island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrying banners bearing the portrait of Jesus and reading, ``We Want
Peace,'' along with red, white and blue Puerto Rican flags, the protesters
staged a silent march along a one-mile stretch of San Juan's Las Americas
Expressway, cordoned off by hundreds of police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Called by top religious leaders, including the heads of Puerto Rico's
Catholic and Methodist churches, the ``Peace for Vieques'' march repudiated an
agreement between Gov. Pedro Rossello and President Clinton to resume limited
training on Vieques, the Navy's prize Atlantic fleet bombing range. Police Chief
Pedro Toledo estimated the crowd at 85,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are showing the consensus in Puerto Rico's heart in favor of peace and
justice,'' said San Juan Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves. ``It is a signal of
hope and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers depicted the protest as nonpolitical, though many members of this
U.S. territory's tiny Independence Party participated.
</P>
<P>
	   Church leaders' increasing involvement in anti-Navy protests has angered
many pro-statehood politicians here. They fear the protests could harm efforts
to make Puerto Rico -- recipient of $11 billion in federal funds annually -- the
51st U.S. state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is anti-American, anti-Navy and does not contribute to the serious work
that Gov. Rossello has done to obtain the Navy's exit,'' said House speaker
Edison Misla Aldarondo.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and Rossello agreed last month to allow the Navy to resume limited
training using inert bombs. The pact calls for a referendum, likely to be held
in 2001, that will give Vieques residents two choices:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Allowing the Navy to resume use of the range on its own terms --
including the use of live bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Requiring the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003. Until then,
however, the Navy could use the dummy bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossello's opponents -- joined by an unusually united front of religious
leaders -- attacked him for abandoning a pledge to stop all bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's nonvoting delegate to Congress, last
week called religious leaders ``separatists.'' Gonzalez Nieves last year blessed
a protest camp erected by Catholic activists inside the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
	   Many marchers Monday bristled at the politicians' criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm here because it's important to keep the peace in Vieques, and there
doesn't have to be any other reason,'' insisted 52-year-old Marta Figueroa, of
the southern town of Juncos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even though we're veterans and have done our service, I want to tell the
president of the United States that we want peace for Vieques,'' said Modesto
Santiago Alvarado, 72, a U.S. Army veteran of Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   For 60 years, the Navy has used Vieques, with the island's 9,400 residents
sandwiched between an ammunition storage zone and the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
	   After an errant bomb killed a civilian security guard last April, protesters
moved in. Military exercises were suspended, and Puerto Rico demanded the range
be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   Adm. Kevin Green said Friday that the USS George Washington battle carrier
group would not carry out training on Vieques in March, as scheduled, but in the
Gulf of Mexico and Florida. Until last April, carrier groups routinely carried
out live-fire training in Vieques, which the Navy argues is essential to its
battle readiness.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Last in 'Moral Authority'  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rates near the top for managing the
economy and pursuing equal justice, but dead last when measured for ``moral
authority,'' according to a ranking of presidents by 58 historians.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall among presidents, Clinton comes across in the middle, 21st out of 41
men who have occupied the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other presidents marked by scandal -- Richard Nixon and Warren Harding
-- came in just above Clinton in the historians' view of moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   The academics rated Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George
Washington, Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman as the best leaders overall in a
survey conducted by the cable public affairs television network C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
	   Historians from across the political spectrum rated the 41 men who have
served in the White House on 10 qualities. The academics were asked to rank
presidents using a scale of one to 10, with 10 being ``very effective.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton rates 20th in crisis leadership; 21st in international relations;
21st in administrative skills; 22nd in vision; and 21st in performance.
</P>
<P>
	   His high scores are in 'pursuing equal justice' (5th), economic management
(5th) and public persuasion (11th); his low scores were in congressional
relations (36th) and moral authority (41st).
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton came into office with a three-part strategy for the
economy: fiscal discipline, investing in people and opening markets abroad to
benefit American workers,'' White House spokesman Joel Johnson said Monday. ``By
any measure, this has proved resoundingly successful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked specifically about the president's moral ranking, Johnson said time
will tell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When today's headline writers cede influence to tomorrow's historians, the
achievements of the president will prove quite remarkable in significance,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rated worst overall as leaders were William Henry Harrison (37), Warren G.
Harding (38), Franklin Pierce (39), Andrew Johnson (40) and James Buchanan (41).
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald Reagan was ranked 11th overall, the highest of presidents of the past
20 years. George Bush came in at No. 20, Jimmy Carter at 22 and Gerald Ford 23.
Nixon, at No. 25, was among those grouped toward the middle. President Lyndon
Johnson was ranked 10th, Dwight Eisenhower was ranked 9th and John Kennedy was
ranked 8th.
</P>
<P>
	   The historians include presidential specialists David Kennedy and Stephen
Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey was conducted in December and January. It is not scientific,
since it simply asked for the historians' subjective opinions.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate survey, conducted through C-SPAN's web site in December, asked
for public opinion. Viewers also placed Clinton on the bottom for moral
authority, but otherwise rated Clinton more harshly than historians.
</P>
<P>
	   Viewers rated Clinton as No. 36 overall, with rankings below average for
every category except economic management (19) and public persuasion (15).
</P>
<P>
	   The viewer survey is also unscientific, since it counted only those 1,145
viewers who chose to participate.

<HEADLINE> Communists Lead in Kyrgyzstan Race  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT FRANCE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- Communists held a solid advantage over
pro-government parties in vote counting Monday from Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of fraud and voting irregularities also surfaced following Sunday
balloting, further casting doubt on the legitimacy of elections already
tarnished by the exclusion of most of the country's opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyrgyzstan, an impoverished mountainous country of 4 million people, had
been considered the most democratic nation to emerge from the former Soviet
Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   But that reputation has been hurt by concerns about the fairness of the vote
along with recent efforts by President Askar Akayev -- the country's leader
since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union -- to crack down on dissent.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the vote was going against the president's allies, the government
insisted the election had gone smoothly. ``The elections were free and fair,''
said Sulaiman Imanbaev, chairman of the Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 11 out of 27 political parties registered in Kyrgyzstan were allowed to
compete, and most of the main opposition parties were barred from fielding their
strongest candidates because of minor technicalities.
</P>
<P>
	   With about 57 percent of the vote counted, the Communists had 26.4 percent.
The pro-government Union of Democratic Forces had 16.3 percent, and the
Democratic Party of Women had 13 percent, elections officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   By excluding the opposition, Kyrgyzstan reneged on commitments as a member
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the vice
president of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Igor Otash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The overall result of those decisions was a considerable restriction of
political alternatives for the electorate,'' Otash told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions ran high in areas where opposition candidates were barred from the
race, but police were out in large numbers to keep control, and no violence was
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Jalal-Abad University in southern Kyrgyzstan, teachers stood outside
the polling station, handing out poll invitations to students who had already
voted once. The students were then permitted to vote a second time without
showing their passports.
</P>
<P>
	   Claudia Svyatkina, head of the university's election commission, said:
``There's been pressure from the government everywhere, including here.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was discipline during Soviet times,'' she said. ``What we have now
is not democracy but anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Outside a polling station in Bishkek, voter Sergei Gavrilin said, ``I
received invitations to vote at two precincts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Observers in Osh and Jalal-Abad reported Monday they were not allowed to
watch ballot-counting as required by law. In Bishkek, election commissioners
changed voting results while a television news crew filmed them.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 545 candidates competed for 105 seats in the two houses of
parliament. Many ran as independents, preferring to keep their party
affiliations unofficial to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   A second round of voting will be held March 5 in districts in which no
candidate won at least 50 percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Burundi Peace Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG NELSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Nelson Mandela issued a report card Monday on the
Burundi peace talks, praising negotiators for inching toward compromise but
warning them that time was running out to end the country's seven-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like the leadership of Burundi to seize this opportunity and not
allow it to slip away,'' the former South African president told Burundian
politicians and civic leaders gathered in this northern Tanzanian town.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1993, fighting between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army has
killed more than 200,000 Burundians and uprooted more than 1.2 million others.
And since September, the army has herded nearly 350,000 Hutus into camps,
including many farmers -- a strategy that now threatens the impoverished country
with famine.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela, who took over as mediator of the talks last month, told the
negotiators that no peace was possible in Burundi without remaking its political
landscape, where minority Tutsis control the government, the economy and the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Leaders must bite the bullet and address this situation,'' he told an
audience of 500, which included seven African heads of state as well as
officials from Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Mandela's listeners was Burundian President Pierre Buyoya, who later
said his government ``would spare no effort'' to reach a ``lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   By focusing international attention on the 20-month-old talks, the
anti-apartheid champion is hoping to prod representatives of the 18 political
and civil groups participating in the talks toward a settlement. That campaign
will continue Tuesday, with President Clinton scheduled to hold a public
videoconference with Mandela from the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Buyoya, the heads of state attending Monday's talks included Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique,
Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
	   On the key issue of rebel participation in the talks, Mandela was
unequivocal. Discussions were under way to bring the two main rebel groups into
the talks because without them, he said, no agreement reached in Arusha was
secure.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela was no less blunt in his views about the future of Burundi's
military and its electoral system. The army should be at least half Hutu, and
voting should combine one-man-one-vote with some form of group representation,
which he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela also stressed the importance of gaining the support of the country's
6.2 million people. But other than an elite few among the country's minority
Tutsi and majority Hutu, most people know little of the progress of the talks.
What they do know rests mainly on rumor and state-controlled radio.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiators could come to some agreement, but there would be no
understanding of it because there's been no wide debate on the issues,'' said
Francis Rolt, director of Studio Ijambo, an independent radio news operation in
the Burundian capital, Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Mandela invoked the recent past to warn of the perils of an
opaque negotiating process concluded under intense international pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In April 6, 1994, in this same town, the leader of the extremist Hutu
government in neighboring Rwanda agreed to implement a power-sharing agreement
ending a nearly 4-year-old war. ``That led to what we all know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive jet returning the Rwandan president home was shot from the sky
that night, killing him and igniting the genocide of at least 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Barak Plans New Palestinian Proposal  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday his
administration is working on new proposals to break the impasse in peace talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will try in the next few days to shape a kind of package through
contacts with the Palestinians that would help take the wagon out of where it is
right now and put it back on track,'' Barak said in a speech to U.S. Jewish
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, he met with U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. Ross was expected to
pass along any new Israeli suggestions to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a
meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians say they will not resume contacts until they get answers
from Barak on crucial issues, including a pledge that Israel carry out an
additional West Bank troop pullback before the sides sign a final peace treaty.
The target date for that treaty is September.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Monday, Israeli troops set up checkpoints in a Palestinian village
and deployed dozens of troops and helicopters to search for a soldier reportedly
seen taking a ride in a Palestinian car, against army regulations. No evidence
was found to suggest that the soldier was kidnapped, though the army was
continuing to investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   The search began Monday morning, after a patrol officer at an army base near
the border between Israel and the West Bank said he saw a soldier get into a car
with a Palestinian, who drove away. Soldiers are forbidden to accept rides from
West Bank Palestinians, whose cars are identifiable by green or blue license
plates.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Palestinian militants have kidnapped hitchhiking soldiers, and
Israeli security forces have been on high alert in recent weeks for terror
attacks that intelligence reports say may be planned to derail the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, initially due Jan.
20, is a major issue between the sides. The Palestinians demand that Israel hand
over West Bank suburbs of Jerusalem where they hope to establish a future
capital. Barak has refused, apparently fearing a backlash from Israeli
hard-liners who accuse him of preparing to divide the city.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Barak's office said that in its new package, Israel is
``willing to consider minor changes'' to its pullback offer but had not made a
final decision on the matter. The withdrawal will not include areas around
Jerusalem, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Israeli daily Maariv reported that the package will include the
opening of second land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Such a route between the heavily Palestinian areas was supposed to have
been inaugurated in January. It also would seek to resolve tax disputes, Maariv
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo said dealing with issues
like the safe passage and taxes are an attempt by Israel ``to give the false
impression that there is progress in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat told reporters Monday that American and European intervention is
necessary to move the peace process forward. Ross promised U.S. help in bridging
the gaps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am hopeful in working with them we will be able to so,'' Ross said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Fashion Goes Beyond Runway  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIELA PETROFF AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Fashion and boats, fashion and song festivals, fashion
and movies -- there's almost as much happening off the runway as on during this
week of preview showings for fall-winter 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Far away from the hubbub of the "moda Milanese" presentations that began
over the weekend, a sailboat christened Luna Rossa -- but better known as Prada
-- is vying for America's Cup in the bay of Auckland in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat is owned by Patrizio Bertelli, husband of designer Miuccia Prada
and manager of the multimillion-dollar fashion empire. Miuccia unveiled her new
collection Monday evening hours before the Prada team was scheduled to set sail
for the cup's second regatta. The first was won by New Zealand's Black Magic
defender of the cup.
</P>
<P>
	   The Prada boat has become a matter of national pride, with millions of
Italians staying up all night to watch the races live. Between one tack and
another they can also admire the team's outfits, designed by Miuccia. Prada
sailing caps are already selling like hot cakes at more than $100 a shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in Italy another national pastime, the San Remo song festival, will
also have Italians glued to their TV screens throughout the week. Designers
Giorgio Armani and Valentino have been called in to dress one of the co-hosts,
Spanish model Ines Sastri, in outfits from their latest collections.
</P>
<P>
	   Closer to the current fashion scene, the Gattinoni label Monday dipped into
filmmaking and even politics. Reacting to the finale of the show -- a male model
dressed in a white angel's gown -- actress Marisa Berenson leapt onto the
runway, slapped the model, and then fainted. But not to worry -- it was only
make-believe, a scene being filmed on the spot for a remake of the famed "Blue
Angel."
</P>
<P>
	   During the show, Gattinoni also joined the chorus of international protest
against Joerg Haider by presenting a ball gown with "No" written in bold red
letters over a look-alike of the Austrian far-right political leader. The
fashion crowd applauded.
</P>
<P>
	   With all these outside interests, is there still time for plain old
clothes-making?
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, plenty. And the new trend is just that, a return to well-tailored
styles that look like the ones mother used to wear but with new individuality.
</P>
<P>
	   No one does this better than Miuccia Prada, whose trademark is turning
old-fashioned into ultramodern. Despite that fact that she too spends sleepless
nights following Luna Rossa she turned out a near-perfect collection reminiscent
of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never think retro when I design a collection," the designer said after
the much-applauded show. She admitted that it was her husband back in Milan
several weeks ago for a brief period between regattas who pinpointed the
similarity with the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, neat suits with short jacket and mid-calf panel pleated skirts in
knobby tweeds, coats wide at the bottom but tapered at the waist, diaphanous
slip dresses, fur scarves and open-toed shoes all hark back to that period.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday evening, Donatella Versace gave her version of the contemporary
signora look. Despite the tight fit and the disco shades, the overall look of
below-the-knee hemlines and trim jackets, silk blouses and wide-legged trousers
showed that Donatella was searching for a softer look than in past seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Thora Birch, 18-year-old American actress who stars in "American Beauty,"
was a front-row viewer for the Versace show.
</P>
<P>
	   The fun-loving Dolce and Gabbana duo, also showing Sunday, left mom at home
and concentrated on her rock star daughter for their second line D&AMP;G show.
</P>
<P>
	   There was graffiti everywhere, from the walls of the theater to the pattern
of the stockings. Hot pants, polka-dot velvet suits, plasticized raincoats,
pleated skating skirts and fur hoods, all in bright color combined to create a
happy fashion party. No matter that it had little to do with the played-down
look currently featuring on the Milan runway.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Must Deliver  </HEADLINE>
   By ANWAR FARUQI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   President Mohammad Khatami's reformist faction routed the hard-line
opposition in historic legislative elections that Iranians hope will lead to
more freedom and jobs in this fundamentalist Muslim country. Now he has to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranians are looking for a cure for their stagnant economy and rampant
unemployment. Many also want continued expansion of social freedoms.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be a new challenge for Khatami, who has pushed reforms since 1997
but thus far has been restrained by hard-liners who dominated other positions of
power.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy percent of Iran's 62 million people are below 30 years of age. Tired
of the hard-line clergy that has ruled with an iron hand since overthrowing the
U.S.-backed shah in the 1979 Islamic revolution, young people were behind
Khatami's 1997 election victory and the thrashing of the hard-liners in Friday's
voting for the Majlis, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final returns are not yet in, the reformists have won 137 of 191
seats so far -- 72 percent -- and are leading in crucial races in Tehran.
Victories there will assure them a majority in the 290-seat Majlis, or
parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, Iranians had blamed almost all of the nation's ills on the
hard-liners. But after it consolidates its new power, Khatami's pro-reform
faction will have to take direct responsibility for Iran's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
	   Official figures put the unemployment rate at 20 percent, but Iranian
economists say the rate is much higher. Nearly every family has young men and
women who can't find jobs and can't marry because they cannot afford housing.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior civil servant earns no more than the equivalent of $300 per month
-- just enough to make ends meet. In a country that is the world's third-largest
oil producer, many workers hold two or even three jobs just to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   Little is likely to change without first tackling the bonyads -- huge,
wide-ranging foundations that control millions in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   After the revolution, the enormous assets of the shah and his cronies were
given to the bonyads to care for the needy. While they still do that, their
focus has changed to acquiring wealth by controlling large chunks of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative estimates say the dozen or so main bonyads control at least a
quarter of the economy. The largest, the Bonyad Mostazafan, cares for the poor
and veterans of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, but it also owns everything from soft
drink plants to luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
	   The bonyads are not audited and it is unknown if they even pay taxes.
Constitutionally, the bonyads stand above the law and are answerable only to
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the hard-line supreme leader whose powers greatly
outstrip those of the elected president. Khamenei, who is unelected, has veto
power over virtually everything.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami has until now avoided head-on confrontation with the hard-line
clergy. But despite his new strength, he will have to find ways to work with
them. The hard-line Guardian Council has veto power over all bills passed by
parliament, and hard-liners still control the military and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran's press is one of the freest in the Middle East, and media freedoms
launched by Khatami are likely to continue. The ban on satellite dish antennas
and Western music could be lifted quickly by a reformist Majlis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Khatami will face a strong hard-line backlash if he tries to go so far
as to make the hijab -- the Islamic covering women must wear in public to hide
the shape of the female form -- a matter of choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Economic recovery here also is hampered by Tehran's relations with the
United States, which the hard-liners call the ``Great Satan'' and consider
Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington severed diplomatic ties after Islamic militants stormed the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Since
then, Iran has been under a U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington has indicated it would be more willing to deal with an Iran
controlled by reformists.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami is expected to move cautiously when it comes to the United States,
only acting if Washington provides substantive gestures of goodwill. Those could
include the freeing of billions in frozen Iranian assets or discontinuation of
the 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act when it comes up for renewal next year.
</P>
<P>
	   But Khatami may find it hard to move slowly: After more than 20 years of
waiting, Iran's young want a quick fix.

<HEADLINE> TV Groom Denies Allegations  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENCINITAS, Calif. (AP) -- The groom from "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?" returned to his house alone after his Caribbean honeymoon and
angrily denied Monday that he had abused an ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox TV canceled a rebroadcast of the show after learning that a restraining
order was issued in 1991 against Rick Rockwell because an ex-girlfriend accused
him of hitting and threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   "At no time have I ever struck any of my girlfriends, ever, for any reason,"
Rockwell, 42, told KGTV outside his home in Encinitas, a coastal city 25 miles
north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't condone it under any circumstances. It goes against my core beliefs
and I was not raised that way," he said. "You know, relationships have ups and
downs, but getting physical for me is not an option."
</P>
<P>
	   The whereabouts of Rockwell's bride, Darva Conger, 34, were unclear.
Rockwell said she was "doing well" and was not with him because "she's getting
some much needed rest right now." Conger has an unlisted phone number and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 22 million people tuned in to "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?" on Feb. 15. Fifty women competed as if they were in a
combination of "The Dating Game" and a beauty pageant, parading in bathing suits
and wedding gowns and answering questions about their tastes.
</P>
<P>
	   After the group was pared down to five finalists, Rockwell selected Conger,
a Gulf War veteran and emergency room nurse from Santa Monica. A Las Vegas judge
married them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ensuing week, critics have blasted the show as tasteless and
demeaning. Also, people who know Rockwell, a real estate investor and former
stand-up comedian, have questioned just how rich he is and whether the whole
thing was a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox executives denied that the groom and bride were acquainted before the
program. Rockwell also denied to KGTV that he knew Conger and that the marriage
was a stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   "False rumors," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men who would not identify themselves stood guard outside Rockwell's
one-story, 1,200-square-foot home Monday and wouldn't let anyone approach.
Through one of them, Rockwell declined a request for an interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   When Rockwell spoke with a reporter from KGTV, he read from a prepared
statement to address abuse allegations leveled in a 1991 restraining order
application filed in Los Angeles County by Debbie Goyne.
</P>
<P>
	   She described herself as his former fiancee and said she lived with Rockwell
for 18 months. Goyne accused Rockwell of shoving and slapping her, twice
entering her home without permission and vandalizing her car after she broke off
their engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recently, he said he would find me and kill me," her court papers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge issued a restraining order prohibiting Rockwell from coming within
100 yards of Goyne for six months. It was unclear whether Rockwell was in court
to defend himself when the order was issued.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox executives canceled the rebroadcast of "Who Wants to be a
Multimillionaire?" after hearing about the allegations Sunday and confirming
them with Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell said that the relationship with Goyne "ended poorly" but that he
would never hit a woman. He acknowledged that he didn't tell Fox about the
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
	   "I considered it a closed chapter in my life," he said, adding that he
apologized for any embarrassment the issue had caused Goyne in recent days.

<HEADLINE> Argentines Work at 1947 Crash Site  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUPUNGATO, Argentina (AP) -- Army specialists worked Monday at the site of a
1947 plane crash high in the Andes Mountains, hoping to bring down pieces of the
plane and remains of passengers missing for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were racing to do as much recovery work as possible before an
expected onslaught of bad weather at midweek on the 21,848-foot Tupungato
volcano, said Maj. Alberto Quinones, an army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Mountaineers stumbled upon the wreckage last month. Its disappearance had
been one of the longest-running aviation mysteries in the Andes, the mountain
range that was a virtual graveyard for planes during the first half of the
century. Investigators now hope that a study of the wreckage will help solve the
lingering mystery surrounding the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An advance team of 12 men have gone up to mark the area where pieces of
the plane were found,'' Quinones told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Estrella, an air force official on the team, said authorities were
studying whether the plane flew into the face of the towering volcano during a
snowstorm on Aug. 2, 1947.
</P>
<P>
	   Air force helicopters took advantage of fair weather on Sunday to fly over a
rocky field high on the volcano where the wreckage was found, Argentine news
reports said. The air force had no immediate comment on the reports that at
least one helicopter briefly landed in the wreckage field, about 16,500 feet up
the volcano.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, army soldiers escorting journalists remained at Tres Quebradas,
at 8,100 feet, hoping to ascend Tuesday by mule to a base camp supplying
investigators at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, called Stardust and operated by the now-defunct British South
American Airways, was carrying 11 people -- five crew members and six
passengers. The flight originated in London, and it made a stop Buenos Aires
before vanishing on its way to Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The passengers included three Britons, a German woman, a Palestinian and a
Swiss man.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the crash, search teams from England, Chile and Argentina searched
the area by air and on skis but turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   Theories abounded about the plane's disappearance. Some speculated it had
been sabotaged to kill a British diplomatic messenger reportedly on board.
</P>
<P>
	   But many believed severe weather was the cause. Records indicate heavy snow
fell for three days at the time the plane vanished, and aviation experts said
the plane -- a converted World War II bomber -- did not have deicing
capabilities and was unfit to travel through frigid conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane went undetected for more than five decades.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, five mountaineers climbing through ice fields atop Tupungato,
just east of the Argentine-Chilean border, came across the remains of the
four-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinones said the remains of at least three passengers also had been spotted
-- their limbs preserved in year-round subfreezing temperatures atop Tupungato.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities quickly arranged the recovery mission before the end of the
Southern Hemisphere summer and the onset of harsh weather on Tupungato.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Clifton Daniel dies at 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Clifton Daniel, who served as managing editor of The New
York Times following a career as a correspondent in wartime London and in
war-torn Europe and the Middle East, died in his Manhattan home Monday. He was
87.
<P>
	   The cause was a stroke and heart disease, said his son, Clifton Truman
Daniel.
</P>
<P>
	   As managing editor from 1964 to 1969, Daniel expanded the paper's coverage
of culture in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no profession that offers you more variety in life or more
excitement," Daniel said in 1977 when he ended 33 years with the Times. "I've
enjoyed it very much. I used to look forward to going to work every morning."
</P>
<P>
	   He started on North Carolina newspapers in the 1930s and spent six years
with The Associated Press. He joined the Times in 1944 to cover World War II,
then held a variety of posts including foreign correspondent, Washington bureau
chief and associate editor.
</P>
<P>
	   With his prematurely silver hair and penchant for Savile Row tailoring,
Daniel was known for his elegance and courtly manners. And while based in
London, he also absorbed a bit of a British accent on top of his Carolina drawl.
</P>
<P>
	   He was once described by a Times colleague as a man able to be "equally at
home at a hunt ball in Warwickshire or bombing along in a Russian jeep over the
virgin farm lands of southwestern Siberia."
</P>
<P>
	   He became well known outside journalistic circles when he married Margaret
Truman, the former president's only child, in 1956.
</P>
<P>
	   He had met Truman during a dinner party in 1955. Their romance bloomed
quietly and it was not until a month before the wedding that it became public.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple had four sons.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a lot in common," he wrote in a 1984 memoir. "We were the kind of
people who wouldn't marry anybody our mothers wouldn't approve of: a couple of
citified small-towners, puritans among the fleshpots."
</P>
<P>
	   He was Times managing editor from 1964 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was known as an encouraging editor to work for, one who welcomed new
ideas," Times reporter Deirdre Carmody wrote in 1977. "Under his influence,
coverage of cultural news was expanded and more literate obituaries began to
appear."
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel's tenure as managing editor was described extensively in Gay Talese's
1969 work, "The Kingdom and the Power," which looked at the men who ran the
venerable paper.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel had spent his first decade as a Times staffer as a foreign
correspondent. In the waning stages of World War II, he covered the Supreme
Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, in London and the U.S. advance into
Belgium and Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the war he was made the Times' chief Middle East correspondent,
reporting on Arab nationalists and ON battles between British forces and the
Jewish underground in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in London in 1952, he covered the death of King George VI and the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. "The coronation was the greatest spectacle
I've ever seen," he recalled years later. "It was probably the last time that
the British would be able to mount such a production, as they were losing their
place as an important power."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1954 Daniel went to Moscow as the only permanent correspondent of a
Western non-Communist newspaper. He won an Overseas Press Club award in 1956 for
his dispatches from the Soviet capital.
</P>
<P>
	   After his stint as managing editor, Daniel became an associate editor in
1969, and from 1973 to 1976 he was chief of bureau in Washington, writing
analyses and directing the coverage of the fall of the Nixon administration and
the beginning of the Ford caretakership.
</P>
<P>
	   His career included stints in radio and television. For WQXR, the Times
radio station, he conducted programs called "Insight" and "One Man's Opinion."
He served as moderator for "News in Perspective" on National Educational
Television.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born Elbert Clifton Daniel Jr. in Zebulon, N.C., in 1912, son of the
owner of the town drug store. During high school summers he worked for the local
newspaper and also tended his father's soda fountain. One night a man came in
with his throat slit from ear to ear; Daniel got a doctor for the man and a
story for his paper.
</P>
<P>
	   After graduating from the University of North Carolina, he worked for the
Raleigh News and Observer for three years, then came to New York where he was
hired by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next six years, before joining the Times, he worked in AP's
Washington, D.C., Bern, Switzerland, and London bureaus.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to his wife and sons, he is survived by five grandchildren. No
funeral plans were announced.

<HEADLINE> Some Stores To Get Irradiated Meat  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ground beef that's been zapped to kill deadly bacteria
could start showing up in supermarkets next month.
</P>
<P>
	   New rules that allow the irradiation of raw beef, pork and lamb take effect
Tuesday. To its advocates, irradiation could be one of the biggest advancements
in food safety since the pasteurization of milk.
</P>
<P>
	   The question is whether consumers want it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people are ready. They are sick and tired of hearing of cases of
food-borne outbreaks,'' said Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for
Consumer Research at the University of California-Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   Most meatpackers intend to start small, testing irradiated ground beef in
select markets to see how it sells. A Florida processer, Colorado Boxed Beef
Co., is expected to be the first to test the market, through grocery chains in
the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had to recall 359,000 pounds beef products in November 1998
because of possible contamination with the deadly E. coli bacteria, and Florida
officials have been promoting irradiation heavily.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, irradiated meat is likely to be most popular with hospitals and
nursing homes, because of the danger E. coli poses to patients with weakened
immune systems. But its use there could generate interest from consumers, said
Tim Willard, a spokesman for the National Food Processors Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The meat is expected to cost an extra three to five cents per pound but the
price is likely to drop as it becomes more widely available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We view this as a consumer choice issue. The consumer will ultimately
determine the success,'' said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for the nation's
biggest beef processor, IBP Inc. He said the company has not yet set a startup
date for test maketing the irradiated patties ``however we expected to begin
sometime this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   No. 2 Excel Corp. plans to start shipping treated beef to its food service
customers the first week of March.
</P>
<P>
	   Irradiation has long been allowed for poultry, as well as fruits, vegetables
and spices. It is seldom used on poultry, partly because the primary pathogens
aren't as dangerous as E. coli O157:H7, and chicken processors haven't thought
it was worth the expense, say industry experts. One big recall for E. coli,
however, can devastate a meatpacker financially.
</P>
<P>
	   The irradiation is done by three methods -- gamma rays, X-rays, or electron
beams. In addition to eliminating E. coli, the treatment can significantly
reduce levels of other pathogens, including listeria, salmonella and
campylobacter. The food isn't radioactive, and while there is a slight loss of
nutrients, the food is largely unchanged, according to the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA also is considering allowing irradiation for hot dogs, luncheon meats
and other ready-to-eat products.
</P>
<P>
	   Special labels are required, carrying the international symbol of
irradiation, known as a ``radura,'' and a statement that they were treated. The
symbol, colored green on a white background, depicts two leaves resting in a
semicircle, with a green dot above it beneath a broken-lined semicircle.
</P>
<P>
	   E. coli O157 can cause serious illness and sometimes death, especially in
children and the elderly. An estimated 73,480 people are infected every year,
and about 600 cases are fatal, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an extra layer of food safety,'' said Mark Klein, a spokesman for
Excel, which blasts beef carcasses with steam to kill E. coli. ``We definitely
view it as an additional tool and not a replacement for other technologies or
food safety programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Irradiation had to be approved by both USDA, which is responsible for
ensuring the safety of meat, and the Food and Drug Administration, which has
authority over food additives. The FDA approved irradiation for red meat in
1997, and the USDA followed last December.

<HEADLINE> Truckers To Protest Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By DERRILL HOLLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Organizers of a trucking protest said that a
demonstration Tuesday in the nation's capital against soaring diesel fuel prices
is a battle in a fight to save their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, Congress is going to come out and not ignore us," said Bill
Dickens, Jr., an owner-operator from Baltimore said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers said from 300 to as many as 500 trucks might participate. A
convoy of 60 rigs could stretch as long as a mile in length, but police and
protest organizers said attempts would be made to avoid traffic disruptions.
</P>
<P>
	   Police in the District of Columbia have arranged parking for most of the
rigs as some of the truckers visit the Capitol. But many lawmakers will not be
in town. Although the Senate returns from its Presidents Day recess on Tuesday,
the House was not returning until Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will escort the truckers to the 14th Street Bridge (crossing the Potomac
from Virginia) around 2 p.m.," said D.C. police spokesman Sgt. Joe Gentile,
expressing confidence that the demonstration will be over before the evening
rush of commuters.
</P>
<P>
	   The truckers are frustrated by soaring fuel prices in recent weeks that have
added to long-standing disenchantment among truckers over low freight rates and
the condition of cargo equipment provided by freight companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're basically running for the same rates we were in the seventies," said
Dickens, adding that many drivers are parking their rigs and refusing loads from
shippers who do not pay fuel surcharges.
</P>
<P>
	   State police in New Jersey and Maryland have agreed to escort convoys
through their states. "We want to ensure that traffic keeps a safe and steady
flow," said Pete Piringer, spokesman for the Maryland State Police.
</P>
<P>
	   Diesel prices in the central Atlantic and New England regions have risen 43
and 55 percent respectively in the past six weeks, according to the American
Trucking Association, the freight hauler trade group. The high prices have
forced many independent owner-operators to park their rigs.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade group has taken no position on the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   "It used to cost an owner operator $220 to go a distance, now it costs
$500," said Jackquie Medaglia, whose husband is a second-generation
owner-operator.
</P>
<P>
	   "We watched the fuel jump three times in one day," said Chris Van Schaick, a
driver from Levittown, Pa. He said he parked his rig after he saw one dealer
boost prices by 97 cents to $1.98 per gallon on fuel already in his storage
tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite trucker assurances that they have no interest in disrupting
Washington traffic, some motorists feared the worst.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could be in a situation where we're at complete gridlock," said Mantill
Williams, a spokesman for Mid-Atlantic Region of the American Automobile
Association.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Senegal Tour Bus Attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Separatist guerrillas in Senegal ambushed two tour
buses, killing two soldiers and two tour guides and injuring about 20 European
tourists, Senegalese newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government-owned newspaper Le Soleil said the attack on the buses
occurred Sunday at Kaliane village near Ziguinchor, the capital of the southern
region of Casamance, where rebels have fought a 16-year war for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the attack were unclear. Senegalese military officials refused to
confirm the incident, and the identities and nationalities of the tourists were
not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   The Casamance region, located about 150 miles south of the capital of Dakar
and known for its forests and beaches, has long been a popular resort
destination for French tourists, who make up the overwhelming majority of
overseas visitors to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The French Embassy declined to comment on the attack Monday, but the French
government warned its citizens to be ``very prudent'' while traveling in
Casamance, Radio France-Internationale reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence followed several rounds of peace talks in December and January
that resulted in a cease-fire accord between rebel and government leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Senegal's government has refused autonomy for Casamance, which is physically
divided from most of northern Senegal by Gambia. More than 1,200 people on both
sides reportedly have been killed since the rebellion began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance claims the region was
never colonized by the French as part of Senegal, and thus remains independent.
France, Senegal's colonial ruler until 1960, disputes the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday in Ndofane, 120 miles southeast of Dakar, four people were
killed when people alleged to be state party supporters drove cars wildly
through an opposition rally, police said. A 12-year-old boy was among those
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence did not immediately appear linked to growing political tensions
ahead of Senegal's presidential elections on Feb. 27.

	   "This is something I've been wanting to do for a long time," said Racioppi,
a firefighter for the North Hudson Regional Fire Department in North Bergen.
</P>
<P>
	   He isn't referring to marriage. He's decided to become a certified open
water scuba diver and has been taking classes at the Hoboken Dive Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Scuba organizations and dive shops offering a variety of class schedules
have enabled the $1.5 billion-a-year industry to attract people who otherwise
wouldn't have the chance to experience a world most people never get to see.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the peacefulness of it," said Racioppi, who has completed several pool
sessions required for certification. "I remember watching the 'Diver Dan'
cartoon when I was about 6, and then it was 'Sea Hunt' when I was older. I could
never get certified because I had no time, but that flexibility of going to
class on Tuesday nights was good for me."
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Powley, 34, is an attorney who is also a dive instructor. He's been
teaching since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "I get everybody from actors to investment bankers," he said. "I think most
people get into it because they tend to be a little bit more adventurous. It's a
super-safe sport, but people tend to think it's much more dangerous than it is."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, there are about 8.5 million certified scuba divers, according to the
Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), the world's largest scuba
organization, which certifies 70 percent of divers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The average diver is 36 years old. Half are college educated and earn over
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the majority - more than 70 percent - of recreational divers are
men, the number of women involved in the sport is on the rise. Their numbers
increased by 112 percent from 1989 to 1999, according to PADI. Colleen Bush, 38,
of Fairview started diving around 1987 after being certified a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "I dragged my husband skiing, so he dragged me to go diving," said Bush, who
now works at the Hoboken Dive Center.
</P>
<P>
	   She recalled what it was like aboard boats on her first dives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the guys are really great, but sometimes some of them will look at
you like, 'What are you doing here?' There's still some of that," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry is also beginning to target another group - children - and is
now marketing equipment made especially for them.
</P>
<P>
	   "So many of us in the business started as kids, and I saw a study somewhere
that said the best way to get a person to stick with a sport is to start them
young. We in the industry have just begun to recognize that," said David
Stancil, vice president for Aqua Lung America Inc., headquartered in Vista,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   As with skiing, diving involves a substantial initial outlay for equipment.
A new diver should plan on spending about $1,200, which includes a BCD (buoyancy
control device), air-flow regulators, tanks, weight belt, fins, mask and
snorkel.
</P>
<P>
	   Certification courses can run between $100 and $300, depending on location
and class size. PADI or NAUI (National Association of Underwater Instructors)
require written work and four check-out dives accompanied by an instructor.
</P>
<P>
	   Like a passport, the certification cards are recognized at shops and resorts
around the world, allowing individuals access to equipment and the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Diving can be physically taxing, and there are risks. Instructors typically
recommend getting a physical prior to taking a class, but industry officials say
the sport is less dangerous than people generally think.
</P>
<P>
	   "Per 100,000 participants, there are as many accidents as you would have in
badminton - literally," said Jeff Nadler, vice president of industry relations
for PADI. "There are three times more accidents in swimming as a recreational
activity," said Nadler, referring to statistics from the National Safety
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, 85 people were killed in diving-relating accidents in North
American waters, including the Caribbean and Canada, according to Divers Alert
Network (DAN), an organization that provides insurance for scuba divers.
</P>
<P>
	   "But 25 to 30 percent of those cases are attributable to cardiac events, so
it may not be diving that caused those deaths, but rather poor physical
fitness," said Dan Nord, a paramedic at the Durham, N.C.-based organization who
works with injured divers.
</P>
<P>
	   "As divers, we like people to think that it's dangerous because it makes us
look cooler," said Pat Iapicca, owner of the Hoboken Dive Center. "In reality,
90 percent of the entire sport is getting over the anxiety, and once you get
over it, it's all downhill."

<HEADLINE> A Seductive 'Time of the Cuckoo'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Critic
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cries of "gondola, gondola" float seductively throughout
"The Time of the Cuckoo," Arthur Laurents' 1952 drama about a lonely, unmarried
American woman learning about love -- and a whole lot more -- in one of the most
romantic places on Earth, Venice.
</P>
<P>
	   The play, slightly revised by its author, remains a sturdy piece of
entertainment, particularly in this lovely production directed with care by
Nicholas Martin and illuminated by its star, Deborah Monk. The actress portrays
heroine Leona Samish with just the right mixture of heartbreak and heartiness.
Plus a bit of bile, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lincoln Center Theater revival, which opened Monday, looks great, too.
Designer James Noone's leafy garden setting of the Pensione Fioria resembles an
Italian Eden, with an inviting backdrop of tan stone houses climbing up the back
wall of the Mitzi Newhouse Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   It is in this tranquil oasis that Laurents plunks down a cross-section of
squabbling American tourists who discover that some things are just done
differently in Italy than back home.
</P>
<P>
	   There are the youngsters, an opportunistic painter (Adam Trese), not above
cooing up to a local comtessa if it means a commission, and his bewildered wife
(Ana Reeder), who was in Firenze for two days before she realized it was
Florence.
</P>
<P>
	   In the hands of such pros as Tom Aldredge and Polly Holliday, a crotchety,
older husband and wife skirt becoming stereotypes. The performers turn obvious
moments of domestic bickering into winning, comic diversions. Their togetherness
contrasts nicely with the singleness of Leona who desperately wants to be part
of a twosome, any twosome.
</P>
<P>
	   Leona's spirits rise when she meets Renato Di Rossi, a courtly shopkeeper
who charms her with his manners and the offer of a good exchange rate for lira
on the black market. Romance blossoms briefly, but then Leona learns the man is
married, although the affection died years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   A few potent martinis -- this is the 1950s and everyone drinks a lot more
than they should -- and a bitterness comes out. Not only bitterness but the fear
at trying something new, something at which she might fail.
</P>
<P>
	   Leona plays it safe, using propriety as an excuse for not living life to the
fullest, a philosophy the playwright obviously endorses.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurents gives this sermon to Signora Fioria, a worldly wise woman who
presides over the guest house. It's not as preachy as it might sound,
particularly in the hands of the wonderful Cigdem Onat, who plays this savvy
philosopher to perfection.
</P>
<P>
	   Fioria has been around the block more than once, and she has stopped along
the way to enjoy her journey. The woman embodies a philosophy that Leona has
trouble accepting: "To make myself see what is here and now; then to accept it,
pleasant or unpleasant; and then, then to try to make it a bit sweeter, a bit
closer to what I would like it to be."
</P>
<P>
	   Leona destroys her chances with Di Rossi, portrayed with plain-spoken charm
by Olek Krupa. At least the woman realizes her mistake, something that gives
Laurents' play a melancholy, yet almost valiant tinge by the time the curtain
falls.
</P>
<P>
	   Monk, wearing a pony tail and a wide grin, follows some formidable and
vastly different ladies in the role of Leona. Shirley Booth was the original on
Broadway; Katharine Hepburn starred in the much altered film version, retitled
"Summertime."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Monk, who can be funny and touching at the same time, makes the role her
own. Watch her hilariously trying to mime a message to an uncomprehending
Italian servant or, in the play's most dramatic scene, drunkenly striking back
at a perceived hurt. The woman commands the stage. This "Time of the Cuckoo"
makes for potent and compelling theater.

<HEADLINE> Bradley sets sights on Washington state 'beauty contest'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LACEY, Wash. (AP) - Bill Bradley is shifting his insurgent's campaign to
Washington state in hopes that it's independent-minded voters will give him a
lift in next week's nonbinding Democratic presidential primary contest against
Vice President Al Gore.
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator plans to spend six days in the state with the
West's second-largest bloc of national convention delegates, after California.
Backers say the Feb. 29 showdown could give Bradley a boost heading into the
pivotal round of coast-to-coast contests a week later.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's moving in, starting Wednesday. This is a big deal to him," said state
Auditor Brian Sonntag, a populist Democrat who has endorsed Bradley. "This
primary is the only thing going for Democrats between now and Super Tuesday on
March 7."
</P>
<P>
	   The Evergreen State has been a frequent stop for Gore, who is backed by Gov.
Gary Locke, Sen. Patty Murray, labor unions and most of the state party
establishment. Gore returns Saturday for a Democratic chili feed at the
aeromachinists labor hall in Seattle. The state twice gave strong support to the
Clinton-Gore ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley has taken note of the state's independent streak, with primary
victories by Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown over establishment
favorites in previous years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state of Washington and I are in real sync," Bradley said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   He says a strong showing in the nonbinding primary could leverage a victory
in the state's Democratic caucuses a week later on March 7, when 94 convention
delegates will be awarded, as well as help his chances in other states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Elway, a Seattle-based independent pollster, said Bradley's chances
could hinge on how well Republican Sen. John McCain does among independents. In
Washington, voters do not register by party and may vote for anyone on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley isn't the only presidential candidate with plans to focus on the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain visits Wednesday, with stops in Spokane, Seattle and Bremerton.
Instead of riding on his "Straight Talk Express" bus, the campaign will christen
a local vessel the "USS Straight Talk" and ply the waters of Puget Sound between
Seattle and Bremerton.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley calls March 7 "our national primary" because 16 states hold primary
contests that day, including California, New York and Ohio. He plans to fly in
to Washington state on Wednesday and campaign through Monday, campaign officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In weekend interviews, Bradley didn't predict victory Feb. 29 but said it's
a golden opportunity for him to "demonstrate movement." Polls have shown him
trailing Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd love to win, but we want to at least make up some ground," Bradley
campaign spokesman Eric Hauser told reporters Monday in New York, where Bradley
and Gore were debating. "If we can show over the next week that kind of
progress, it will be a huge momentum boost."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plans to become "more aggressive, more comparative" against Gore on
issues ranging from the environment, education and health care to abortion and
gun control, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said key pieces of Bradley's platform - overhauling campaign finance
laws, gun control, health care, abortion rights and environmental protection -
resonate strongly with Washington voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's state campaign spokesman, called Washington a
"very important battleground" and noted Gore's "very sizable resources" here.
"But he (Gore) doesn't have all of the people, so we're going to take this
campaign straight to them," Longabaugh added.

<HEADLINE> Sotheby's Names Chairman, President  </HEADLINE>
    By KAREN MATTHEWS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The venerable auction house Sotheby's said Monday that its
chairman and president have resigned under pressure to resolve a Department of
Justice investigation into alleged antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
	   A. Alfred Taubman stepped down as chairman of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. and
will be replaced by former Columbia University President Michael Sovern, the
auction house's board of directors said in a release.
</P>
<P>
	   Taubman, who acquired the company in 1983, retains his controlling interest
in the company and a seat on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "While this clearly is not an easy decision for me, I have determined that
it is time for me to step down from my role as chairman," Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana D. Brooks will be replaced as president and chief executive officer by
William Ruprecht, who has been managing director of Sotheby's North and South
America since 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   "My decision is a very difficult one, but I have taken it in the best
interests of the company and of my colleagues," Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the Justice Department began an investigation into auction houses
including Sotheby's and its main rival, Christie's, focusing on alleged
price-fixing in the commissions paid to sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Christie's replaced its longstanding 10 percent commission to
sellers with a sliding scale of 2 percent to 10 percent, and Sotheby's soon
adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits collusion in such arrangements as
illegal restraint of trade, punishable by fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's said in its statement that it "has recently met with the
Department of Justice in order to discuss a prompt and appropriate resolution of
this investigation, which will allow the company to put this difficult matter
behind it."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Sotheby's said he could not comment on the relationship
between the resignations and the antitrust probe.

<HEADLINE> Bush-McCain, other notes and quotes from campaign 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DETROIT (AP) - Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain on the same
ticket?
<P>
	   It seemed a distant possibility for a moment Monday when Bush answered a
reporter's question about whether his rival for the GOP presidential nomination
would make a good running mate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush thought he was asked about another John - his supporter, Michigan Gov.
John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always said, 'Should the person be president, do we share the same
philosophy and does he like me?' And I think the man fills those three
categories, but nevertheless, I haven't put lists together," Bush said, giving
his usual answer to queries about potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
	   When pressed on whether he thought McCain fit the third category - of liking
him - press secretary Karen Hughes stepped in to correct Bush's
misinterpretation of the question.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, you said John McCain, or John Engler?" Bush asked, Engler standing at
his side.
</P>
<P>
	   When told the question was about McCain, he said, "Oh, let me start over."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush then apologized to McCain, saying he did not want to demean the senator
by talking about him in terms of being a running mate.
</P>
<P>
	   "As long as he's a viable presidential candidate, he deserves the respect
and ought not to be talked about in terms of the vice presidency," Bush said.

<HEADLINE> Cubans March for Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Shouting ``Free Elian! Down With Lies!'' tens of thousands of
government supporters flooded Havana's coastal highway Monday to demand the
return of the 6-year-old boy and to protest the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat.
</P>
<P>
	   Waving Cuban small flags, uniformed police officers, military cadets,
Foreign Ministry employees and a few top communist officials were among those
called to attended the latest of dozens of rallies and marches held since Dec. 5
to press for Elian Gonzalez's return.
</P>
<P>
	   It was one of the biggest marches yet in 2 1/2 months of demonstrations.
Government officials who carefully organized the march and brought the
protesters to the site in buses, estimated that more than 200,000 people paraded
down the 3 1/2-mile stretch along Havana's Malecon seawall.
</P>
<P>
	   Marchers who streamed past the U.S. Interests Section -- the American
diplomatic mission in Cuba -- were also protesting Washington's decision last
week to expel an unnamed Cuban diplomat. Cuban officials say that announcement
and the related arrest of a U.S. Immigration agent on espionage charges are a
plot to block Elian's return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The clear objective, impossible to hide or overlook, is to prevent at all
cost the return of the kidnapped child,'' read an editorial on the front page of
the Communist Party's workers' weekly, Trabajadores.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department on Saturday ordered the expulsion of a Cuban diplomat
linked to the Cuban-born U.S. immigration official. The diplomat, whose name was
not released, was given seven days to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The marches began after Elian was rescued off the coast of South Florida on
Nov. 25. Found lashed to an inner tube, the boy was one of only three people who
survived when the boat sank during a journey from Cuba to the United States.
Elian's mother and 10 others perished.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has demanded that the boy be returned
to him in Cuba, and the INS has said that father and son should be reunited.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's Miami relatives are seeking to keep Elian in the United States,
and are seeking political asylum for the boy.

<HEADLINE> Long Island police arrest man linked to Peddie School sex attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Police on Long Island have arrested a 24-year-old
drifter who Mercer County authorities say is responsible for a knifepoint sex
attack on a 16-year-old prep school student in Hightstown.
<P>
	   Emily J. Hornaday, a spokeswoman for the county prosecutor's office, said
Michael Lee Allen Jr., 24, is charged with a predawn attack at the Peddie School
on Feb. 11. Allen allegedly assaulted and robbed the boy before being chased off
the campus by security officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen could face up to 40 years in prison on the New Jersey charges of
aggravated sexual assault with a weapon, armed robbery and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Nassau County police believe Allen is responsible for a series of sex
attacks over the past three years in various jurisdictions around New York City.
He was arrested Friday in East Williston, N.Y. Nassau County authorities laid
out the details at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   They have charged Allen in a sex attack remarkably similar to the Peddie
School attack. According to police, Allen slipped into a C.W. Post College dorm
at 4 a.m. last July 5 and sexually assaulted a male teen-ager at knifepoint. The
victim was on the Old Brookville campus for a summer baseball camp.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they caught Allen after tracking his use of credit cards he
stole from the same campus on Jan. 31. Authorities in neighboring Sussex County
and in Dutchess County in upstate New York are considering charges against Allen
for similar school dormitory attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is believed and alleged that he targeted prep schools through the
Internet," Hornaday said, "and that he had actually gotten directions from the
Internet to go to these various places."
</P>
<P>
	   The Peddie School attack occurred at 4:30 a.m. Hightstown Police and Peddie
School officials said they could not tell how Allen entered the dormitory, which
has a security alarm. The campus also has its own security force.
</P>
<P>
	   "The school is actively reviewing its security provisions to make sure
nothing like this happens again," said Sandy Tattersall, Peddie's dean of
students. "I can't recall something like this."

<HEADLINE> Two Die in Floodwaters in Ohio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, Ohio (AP) -- The Ohio River continued rising Monday and many of
its tributaries remained swollen from heavy rains over the weekend. Flooding
contributed to the deaths of two people in southeast Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman died Monday when she became trapped in her submerged car in Scioto
County, about 85 miles southeast of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She had apparently pulled around road-closed signs and barricades, and her
car was caught in high water on the road,'' state Trooper Harold Fraley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Her three children -- ages 5, 6 and 8 -- escaped from the car and were
rescued from the water, authorities said. Two of the children were hospitalized
in fair condition; the third was in critical.
</P>
<P>
	   In Meigs County, a man was killed Sunday when his boat overturned in high
water on a road near Middleport, a dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although several Ohio River tributaries have already began receding in some
areas, the National Weather Service said the river was not expected to crest
until early Tuesday in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   In West Virginia, Gov. Cecil Underwood extended a state of emergency to a
total of 21 counties after heavy weekend rains flooded homes and businesses
across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The declaration allows the National Guard to help clear roads, deliver
emergency medication or assist where emergency vehicles cannot travel.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people died Friday during a rescue attempt when an inflatable boat
capsized on a swollen creek near Charleston. The body of one of the victims,
Betty Huffman, 56, of Clendenin, W. Va., was found Sunday by a barge crew. The
bodies of the two others already had been recovered.

<HEADLINE> 3d Largest Mexico Airline Bankrupt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's third-largest airline was declared bankrupt on
Monday -- a decision which was widely expected after the government grounded the
heavily indebted cut-rate airline on Nov. 23 following a crash in western
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling makes it less likely that Taesa will ever fly again. The company
had provided the only major competition for jointly owned Mexicana and
Aeromexico, which together have established a near-monopoly in domestic air
travel.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Justino Montes de Oca ruled that the company's financial condition is
unsustainable. The judge will decide later whether, or how, to liquidate the
company's assets, the government news agency Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Taesa officials had hoped to find investors willing to inject fresh capital
into the company, but those efforts were apparently unsuccessful. Only a few,
engineless Taesa jets remained at the Mexico City airport on Monday, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Another small carrier was expected to take over some of Taesa's most popular
routes, such as those linking Mexico City and Guadalajara to the border city of
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Taesa offered very low fares and sold tickets from booths in supermarkets.
But it was struggling with enormous debt, much of it incurred in the national
debt crisis of early 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The government grounded TAESA shortly after one of its vintage DC-9 jetliner
crashed Nov. 9 in central Mexico, killing all 13 passengers and five crew
members on board. Investigators blamed the crash on shoddy maintenance.

<HEADLINE> New Judge To Get Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The judge in the Elian Gonzalez case suffered a mild stroke,
delaying Tuesday's hearing on whether the court has jurisdiction in the boy's
case until a new judge is assigned.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, 77, was taken to the hospital by
ambulance with slurred speech Sunday, unable to move his right leg and arm, said
Dr. James Stewart, a neurologist at HealthSouth Doctors' Hospital of Coral
Gables.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, who suffered a mild stroke, ``has continued to show improvement
today and we expect his progress to continue,'' a hospital news release said. He
was in serious but stable condition Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is at the center of a custody battle involving his relatives in Miami
and his father in Cuba. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered
the 6-year-old boy returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler had planned to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the federal court
can intervene in the case. Chief U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said Monday
said he will preside over the hearing, but only for the purpose of informing
lawyers in the case about the assignment of a new judge, and to schedule future
hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said the new judge will be selected randomly by a computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Hoeveler had complained of ``heart racing,'' his wife, Griffin
Hoeveler, told The Miami Herald. A doctor had suggested he go to the hospital
for tests, but Hoeveler declined.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, a veteran federal judge who presided over the trial of former
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, was assigned the Elian case after another
judge withdrew last month because of a possible conflict of interest.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Sets His Sights on Wash.  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID AMMONS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LACEY, Wash. (AP) -- Bill Bradley is shifting his insurgent's campaign to
Washington state in hopes that its independent-minded voters will give him a
lift in next week's nonbinding Democratic presidential primary contest against
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator plans to spend six days in the state with the
West's second-largest bloc of national convention delegates, after California.
Backers say the Feb. 29 showdown could give Bradley a boost heading into the
pivotal round of coast-to-coast contests a week later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's moving in, starting Wednesday. This is a big deal to him,'' said
state Auditor Brian Sonntag, a populist Democrat who has endorsed Bradley.
``This primary is the only thing going for Democrats between now and Super
Tuesday on March 7.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Evergreen State has been a frequent stop for Gore, who is backed by Gov.
Gary Locke, Sen. Patty Murray, labor unions and most of the state party
establishment. Gore returns Saturday for a Democratic chili feed at the
aeromachinists labor hall in Seattle. The state twice gave strong support to the
Clinton-Gore ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley has taken note of the state's independent streak, with primary
victories by Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown over establishment
favorites in previous years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state of Washington and I are in real sync,'' Bradley said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   He says a strong showing in the nonbinding primary could leverage a victory
in the state's Democratic caucuses a week later on March 7, when 94 convention
delegates will be awarded, as well as help his chances in other states that day.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Elway, a Seattle-based independent pollster, said Bradley's chances
could hinge on how well Republican Sen. John McCain does among independents. In
Washington, voters do not register by party and may vote for anyone on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley isn't the only presidential candidate with plans to focus on the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain visits Wednesday, with stops in Spokane, Seattle and Bremerton.
Instead of riding on his ``Straight Talk Express'' bus, the campaign will
christen a local vessel the ``USS Straight Talk'' and ply the waters of Puget
Sound between Seattle and Bremerton.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley calls March 7 ``our national primary'' because 16 states hold
primary contests that day, including California, New York and Ohio. He plans to
fly in to Washington state on Wednesday and campaign through Monday, campaign
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   In weekend interviews, Bradley didn't predict victory Feb. 29 but said it's
a golden opportunity for him to ``demonstrate movement.'' Polls have shown him
trailing Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'd love to win, but we want to at least make up some ground,'' Bradley
campaign spokesman Eric Hauser told reporters Monday in New York, where Bradley
and Gore were debating. ``If we can show over the next week that kind of
progress, it will be a huge momentum boost.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley plans to become ``more aggressive, more comparative'' against Gore
on issues ranging from the environment, education and health care to abortion
and gun control, Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said key pieces of Bradley's platform -- overhauling campaign finance
laws, gun control, health care, abortion rights and environmental protection --
resonate strongly with Washington voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Longabaugh, Bradley's state campaign spokesman, called Washington a
``very important battleground'' and noted Gore's ``very sizable resources''
here. ``But he (Gore) doesn't have all of the people, so we're going to take
this campaign straight to them,'' Longabaugh added.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley To Debate in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Warming up for their debut at the Apollo, Al Gore walked
the streets of Harlem enjoying the advantages of being Bill Clinton's vice
president while Bill Bradley questioned Gore's willingness to help people who
don't have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential rivals were meeting late Monday at the Apollo
Theatre, the Harlem landmark where Ella Fitzgerald was discovered in 1934, in a
90-minute debate on urban and racial issues. The Rev. Al Sharpton called the
nationally televised forum ``the de-marginalization of our concerns as a
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York political consultant Bill Lynch, a Gore supporter estimated that
about 35 percent of voters in the state's Democratic primary on March 7 will be
minorities. The non-white vote in the last two contested Democratic primaries
was 20 percent in 1992, and 29 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Davita Cook, a forensic science student, called after Gore as he and Rep.
Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., picked their way down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,
past the Harlem Farmers Market and Uptown Jean Co., where two-piece sets of
thermal underwear advertised for $5.99.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you promise to pick up where Clinton left off? Do you promise to stay
true?'' the woman called out to Gore, who did not respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Cook told a reporter she was voting for Gore ``only because he is following
in Clinton's footsteps; it's Clinton we adore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such sentiment rankled film director Spike Lee, who said he will star in a
TV ad for Bradley in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right or wrong, black people think President Clinton can do no wrong. But
I don't think that means we should automatically transfer that allegiance from
Clinton to Al Gore,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Pena, an immigrant from Santo Domingo showed off to Gore the voter
registration card that identified him as a Democrat. ``I have three babies. I
need a job,'' the man told Gore in halting English. Gore referred him to a
caseworker in Rangel's local office.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the street, workers removed ``Amateur Night'' from the Apollo marquee
and instead advertised the face-off between Gore and Bradley -- their first
since Gore solidified his front-runner status with wins in Iowa and New
Hampshire. Bradley has since slipped far behind in some polls and is struggling
to build a comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Gore were thrashing out their differences from lecterns just beside
the Apollo's mythical hollowed-out tree stump, which performers from comedian
Chris Rock to musician James Brown traditionally rub for luck before taking the
stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley aides promised a more combative candidate for the two-week sprint to
``Super Tuesday'' when more than a dozen states will vote. Bradley scheduled a
speech on Tuesday on Long Island that was being billed as the kickoff of an
effort to expose inconsistencies and dishonesty in Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign strategist Bill Knapp dismissed the pumped-up strategy by
saying, ``He's going to throw battery acid around.'' Knapp said Gore's own sharp
critique of Bradley and his agenda was different because Gore is ``just
defending his record and saying what he wants to do as president.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bradley talked tough before 100 or so parents and other local
residents as he campaigned at Brooklyn's P.S. 24 with City Councilman Angel
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who has proposed a plan for universal access to health insurance,
warned that voters should be skeptical of Gore's criticism of that plan. ``I am
disappointed that Al Gore has attacked and distorted it. It casts doubt on his
commitment to a basic plank in the Democratic platform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Universal health care has been part of the Democratic Party's platform for
nearly 40 years, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Banks, an art teacher at a Brooklyn high school, called Bradley a
little too liberal for his taste. But Banks also said he was voting for Bradley
because, ``He's more open-minded than Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Clinton administration achievements for which Gore sought a share
of credit on Monday were the federal ``empowerment zone'' investments that have
attracted businesses to formerly rundown urban centers like the main street in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   As Gore briefly ducked into an Old Navy store to ask shoppers for their
votes, aides told reporters that Harlem was one of the empowerment zones that
Gore worked on with Rangel.
</P>
<P>
	   Omitted was a crucial piece of legislative history: that it was Bradley who,
as a senator from New Jersey in 1993, wrote the blueprint for the empowerment
zones and -- with Rangel, then-Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and New York
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- was instrumental in pushing the legislation
through Congress.

<HEADLINE> Cyanide Leaking in Northwest Romania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Melting snow brought cyanide to seven wells near a
gold mine that first leaked the poison nearly three weeks ago, contaminating
rivers in central Europe, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tons of cyanide-laced water spilled from a containment reservoir operated by
the Aurul gold mine near Baia Mare on Jan. 30, spreading into the Tisza and
Danube rivers and killing tons of fish and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a recent thaw in the Baia Mare area, more cyanide has apparently
seeped into the wells of the nearby village of Bozanta Mare, Romanian officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrei Muresan, head of the Health Authority in Baia Mare, said villagers
have been warned about the contamination and have been provided with water for
themselves and for domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, local authorities in counties along the Danube River shut down
water pumps supplying water from the Danube as the cyanide wave approached their
localities.
</P>
<P>
	   The cities of Turnu Magurele and Zimnicea in southern Romania were relying
only on wells and earlier supplies of water.
</P>
<P>
	   At Turnu Magurele, some 78 miles southwest of Bucharest, cyanide
concentration Monday afternoon was 9.4 times more than the acceptable level in
Romania for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities in the eastern Romania at the town of Cernavoda, 94 miles east
of Bucharest, said they would close the gates separating the Danube from the
channel that links it to the Black Sea.

<HEADLINE> Man Pardoned After 39 Years  </HEADLINE>
   By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton granted a full pardon Monday to Preston
King, who fled to England 39 years ago to avoid a prison sentence for draft
evasion.
</P>
<P>
	   King was a graduate student when he fled from Albany, Ga., in 1961 after
being sentenced to serve 18 months in prison. He is now a chairman of political
science at Lancaster University in England.
</P>
<P>
	   King refused to report for an Army physical until an all white draft board
in Georgia addressed him as ``Mr.,'' as they did white draftees. He noted that
the board addressed him as ``Mr. Preston King'' before learning he was black and
``Preston'' after that.
</P>
<P>
	   The full pardon means King is free to return to the United States for the
funeral this week of his brother, Clennon King, who died Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   King could not be reached Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, he was unable to attend the funerals of his parents or other
relatives for fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   His supporters, who now include the federal judge who sentenced him to an
18-month term, had made a special appeal to Clinton to pardon King in time for
him to attend the dedication of a new federal courthouse under construction in
Albany that is named for another brother, civil rights attorney C.B. King.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Clennon King moved the process up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has paid a big price,'' wrote retired U.S. District Judge William A.
Bootle, now 96, in a letter to Clinton last year. ``To lock him up today would
amount to overkill.''
</P>
<P>
	   The now racially mixed city council in Albany also supported a pardon, as
did the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the 63-year-old King, spoke about the campaign to pardon him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After 38 years, I'm still unable to return home,'' he said then. ``I'm
still subject to the threat of arrest and harassment by federal authorities. I
am still unable to visit my relations, the graves of my mother and father and
brothers.''

<HEADLINE> Medical Mistake Reports Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, responding to findings that as many as
98,000 people are killed annually because of medical mixups, wants hospitals to
agree to routine reporting of serious and deadly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the president can't require such reporting unless Congress acts,
the White House said Clinton on Tuesday will unveil a program that urges
increased reporting, would require increased reporting at veterans hospitals and
call for new error-reduction plans at 6,000 hospitals participating in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals would not have to report less serious mistakes or close calls,
although the White House hopes they would do so voluntarily, a senior White
House official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's program is a compromise between patient advocates who
want mandatory full disclosure of all medical mistakes and the medical community
that fears such disclosure would bring more lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed reporting system would be administered by the states, which
would collect information about preventable deaths and major injuries by
hospital and type of problem. Names of individual doctors or other healthcare
workers would not be public.
</P>
<P>
	   While the White House would like all hospitals within three years to develop
a system of reporting serious and fatal errors, administration officials
acknowledged the government cannot force compliance without legislation from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   However, there are already plans in Congress requiring more comprehensive
reporting. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., predicted a bipartisan medical error
bill will pass this year. Two Senate committees have scheduled hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen states already have some kind of mandatory reporting system.
</P>
<P>
	   The intense interest in additional hospital reporting, stems from a report
in November by the independent Institute of Medicine that an estimated 44,000
and 98,000 Americans are killed each year because of hospital mistakes ranging
from botched surgeries to misunderstandings over dosages and effects of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole idea here is to not blame people,'' said the White House
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Obviously we have a problem in
medical errors, and we have to acknowledge it. Acknowledging it is the first
step, but we can't make it punitive,''
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, head of the Washington-based Public Citizen's Health
Research Group, said the Clinton plan does not go far enough. Hospitals can
still mask the true level of mistakes by failing to perform enough autopsies,
and patients deserve a full accounting, Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Nancy Dickey, immediate past president of the American Medical
Association, said there is no evidence that hospitals are safer in states with
reporting systems in place and ``we are opposed to mandatory reporting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton already announced some federal steps that did not require
congressional approval, and plans to add more on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the new proposals are:
</P>
<P>
	   -- An immediate mandatory reporting requirement for military hospitals. The
500 Pentagon-administered hospitals serve an estimated 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Food and Drug Administration within a year would develop new standards
to help prevent medical mistakes caused by sound-alike drug names or look-alike
products. The agency will also come up with new labeling standards to reduce
errors.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Health Care Financing Administration would require error reduction
plans in all 6,000 hospitals that participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposed budget for next year includes $33 million to
improve the reporting system for medical mistakes at the FDA. It also includes
$20 million for new research on reducing medical errors and calls on creation of
a new patient safety clearinghouse.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Protestant leader in the Northern Ireland peace process
visited the White House on Monday and chided Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican
Army for doing ``absolutely nothing'' about disarming paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were fully aware of the situation,'' Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble said after a brief meeting with White House national security
adviser Sandy Berger. ``I was astonished at the end of January to discover that
they've done absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   A British overseer in Northern Ireland suspended the nascent power-sharing
government this month to prevent a collapse over the IRA's refusal to give up
its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble said he and Berger traded views of the current stalemate. He said he
was optimistic that the peace process can still proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we are hoping that we can bounce back from this situation as
quickly as possible but it can't be done without a clear action or response from
the public,'' Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has been closely involved in the Northern Ireland peace
effort, which he counted as a success until two weeks ago. Clinton said last
week he has frequent conversations with both sides, but has said little about
substantive ideas to resume local government in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Attacks McCain Official  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) -- In a recorded message phoned to Michigan voters,
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson attacks an official in John McCain's
campaign as ``a vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain refused to repudiate these words,'' Robertson added in the
message that was recorded Monday by a Michigan man. Robertson's remarks refer to
former senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, who is McCain's national campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending retired
Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion. Rudman also wrote about
the controversy in a book.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition who ran unsuccessfully for the
Republican presidential nomination in 1988, made no mention of Bush in the brief
message.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Harris, a McCain spokesman, did not allege any involvement by Bush's
campaign, but said: ``This is exactly the kind of politics that we had hoped we
left behind in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pat Robertson and (former Christian Coalition director) Ralph Reed hand
delivered Governor Bush's victory to him in South Carolina,'' Harris said. ``The
people of Michigan have an opportunity to repudiate these kinds of negative
smears.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign denied making the calls, and accused the McCain camp and its
allies of running get-out-the-vote phone banks that were critical of the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not making any Pat Robertson calls,'' said Bush campaign
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ``Our campaign doesn't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, George Bush easily won county caucuses in Michigan, knocking
Robertson off his then-front-runner pace, and the religious leader responded by
staging a losing legal and convention battle for a greater share of the state's
77 nominating delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain telephone calls urge voters to support McCain in Tuesday's GOP
primary. One call says McCain is more conservative than Bush, who is criticized
for spending increases in Texas where he is governor. The other warns voters not
to be ``fooled by George Bush's negative smear campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adrienne Karns, an accountant from Birmingham, Mich., said in an interview
that she received a recorded call telling her Catholics should vote for McCain.
She said she did not believe the call was endorsed by McCain's campaign, and
instead was sponsored by an outside group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It started off saying it was a 'Catholic voters' alert,''' Karns said,
noting the call mentioned Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina and school's perception as being anti-Catholic. ``It said McCain had
not been to the university, and he was a friend of all Catholics, and all
Catholics should vote for John McCain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karns said she was voting for Bush and that the call would not change her
mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Riding a wave of conservative support, Bush defeated McCain in South
Carolina's GOP primary Saturday, leaving McCain in a fight for survival in
Michigan's contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has criticized Bush in recent days for running a negative campaign in
South Carolina and now in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Robertson message came to light when a Michigan voter, Jim Pouillon,
contacted McCain's campaign to express displeasure over having received the
call.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview, Pouillon said he is a member of the anti-abortion
group Operation Rescue and that he stood outside a high school where McCain
appeared Monday displaying an anti-abortion sign. But he said of the sentiments
expressed by Robertson, ``This is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The message opens with Robertson saying ``Protect unborn babies and restore
religious freedom once again in America.'' The primary will determine whether
the party nominates a man ``who wants to take First Amendment freedom from
citizens groups while he gives unrestricted power to labor groups,'' he
continues.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a reference to McCain's advocacy of campaign finance legislation to
ban unlimited contributions known as soft money. McCain says his legislation
would also apply to unions and he says he advocates other positions to limit
their use of campaign dollars.

<HEADLINE> Commuter Train Derails in Utah  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A commuter train jumped its tracks in the center of a
downtown street, crashed into a utility pole and skidded into the roadway Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   About two dozen people on board suffered bumps and bruises, but no serious
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Monday was a holiday, few vehicles were on the street and none was
hit by the skidding train cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers on the light rail TRAX train said they heard scraping on the
rails and then a bang when the train hit the pole, throwing riders from their
seats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You just heard a crash, then you're down on the floor and people are
piling on top of you,'' said passenger Susan Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was chaos,'' said passenger Radell Donel.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Transit Authority officials did not release an official cause of the
derailment. But UTA workers marked off the spot where the train's wheels
appeared to have caught on a switch after the train came around a curve.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Look To Mich. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- Pointing toward Tuesday's second key primary clash in
four days, John McCain accused George W. Bush of waging a campaign of
``character assassination.'' The front-runner aimed his public barbs at Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   In the heart of auto country, Bush cited comments Gore made years ago in a
book critical of the internal combustion engine. ``I look forward to him
campaigning up here and saying, 'My vision for America is one where you won't be
working,''' Bush said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Texas governor's public focus on the general election, his
campaign continued to run television commercials critical of McCain in advance
of Tuesday's Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The two campaigns also traded charges of phoning voters to criticize their
rivals. Surrogates for the candidates contacted voters as well, including in a
recording by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, who attacked a McCain campaign
official as a ``vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Legitimate pollsters were out in force, and all said the race was very
close, within the margin of the polls' own potential sampling error.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes were high for both men, but higher for McCain, whose campaign can
ill afford another setback like the one in South Carolina last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, McCain was hoping for a Michigan victory to restart his campaign
momentum and the flow of contributions that followed his big win in the leadoff
New Hampshire primary. McCain's home state of Arizona is voting Tuesday, too,
but most eyes are on Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has said that even if he loses, he'll stay in the race at least until
March 7. That's when California, New York, Ohio and many other states vote in
the biggest night of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
	   At a morning appearance Monday before an overflow crowd in Traverse City,
McCain used some of his harshest words to date in describing the Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reject this negative campaigning. Reject this character assassination,''
he said. ``Reject the low road to the presidency and support the high road.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slapped McCain only when asked by reporters during the day. Questioned
about the Arizona senator's promise to break the ``iron triangle'' of lobbyists,
money and legislation, Bush said, ``He talks about the iron triangle in
Washington D.C. He's been ringing that iron triangle like a dinner bell'' -- a
reference to McCain's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, Bush sought to give the impression of a man
looking ahead to the fall campaign, not someone struggling with the nitty-gritty
of a determined primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, he touted education reform, a
biennial budget, tax reform and steps to reduce frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know we're talking about great economic times but no generation should
ever take prosperity for granted,'' he said. ``My job as your future president
is not to think about the Dow Jones today. My job is to look down the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for Clinton, he accused the president of missing opportunities for
expanded overseas trade and said, ``I'm going to seize the moment when I become
president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made a morning stop at an elementary school, where students were
dressed as presidents to mark the federal holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the school library, Bush listened to a speech by Jaclyn Romero, 9, who
was dressed as former president Bush, and by Lauren Fendt, who was dressed as
John Quincy Adams, who followed his father's footsteps into the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a chance there may be another father and son,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also traveled to a high school, where he likened himself to the Star
Wars character, Luke Skywalker, ``trying to get out of the Death Star. ...
They're all against me, (Michigan) Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the
governors, all the senators. But we're gonna kill 'em, right, we're gonna get
'em.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush indeed traveled during the day with Engler, one of numerous GOP
governors around the country who helped establish the Texas chief executive as
front-runner in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was joined at his stops by state Sen. Joe Schwarz, who proudly told
audiences he was the only member of his party in the Legislature to break ranks
and join the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defeated handily in South Carolina after he first launched
negative ads against Bush. When McCain's internal polling showed an erosion of
support, he then stopped, leaving the field clear for the attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan is different: McCain has refrained from attacking Bush in campaign
commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   His hopes for victory lie in his appeal for crossover votes from
independents and some Democrats drawn to his message of reform. But his aides
are worried about the impact of Bush's commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We already have reports of push polls, negative mail pieces; it's hard to
miss the false TV ads,'' Schwarz said in a statement issued by the campaign.
``We're not going to let Bush get away with this shadow campaign in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
	   In rebuttal, the Bush campaign said McCain's operation was making negative
calls, including one that warns voters not to be ``fooled by George Bush's
negative smear campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign denied any knowledge of the Robertson call, aimed at
former senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, McCain's national campaign
chairman. Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending
retired Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Break NATO Barrier  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French and British troops fired tear
gas to push back thousands of ethnic Albanians trying to force their way across
a bridge into the Serb-controlled side of this ethnically divided city.
</P>
<P>
	   The Albanians were the lead contingent of up to 50,000 protesters who
marched on this northwestern Kosovo industrial city.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,000 Serbs were waiting on the north side of the bridge, determined
to battle the Albanians themselves to keep them from entering their part of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   The Albanian contingent, numbering between 6,000 and 10,000, managed to
breach French positions on the approach to the bridge over the Ibar River, and
more French troops rushed to the bridge and began firing volleys of tear gas in
five-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
	   British troops blocked the bridge with armored vehicles and pushed away
ethnic Albanian men who tried to climb over the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   By the 6 p.m. start of a daily 12-hour curfew, crowds on both sides were
dispersing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign that the Serbs were prepared for a showdown, some Serb women and
children began evacuating the city, and a local Serb leader, Nikola Kabasic,
told a Belgrade radio station that the Serbs were bringing in reinforcements
from neighboring villages to defend their part of the city if NATO cannot
control the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   No American troops were involved in the scuffles at the bridge. On Sunday,
U.S. troops taking part in a weapons search in the Serb part of the city
withdrew to the ethnic Albanian south bank after Serbs pelted them with stones.
</P>
<P>
	   The commander of the embattled, NATO-led Kosovo Force, German Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt, congratulated the troops for showing restraint in the face of
escalating tensions, which threaten to engulf this city and perhaps the entire
province in a new round of bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The key thing really was to prevent an escalation in which somebody fired
on the other one,'' Reinhardt said. ``It would have been a disaster. My soldiers
were very reasonable. They used just the amount of power needed and did not
overreact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically tense city in Kosovo because it
contains the largest Serb community remaining in the province. Most Kosovo Serbs
fled following the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops in June and the arrival of
NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, blamed the Yugoslav government for fomenting trouble in Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there is no question who's responsible for it. It's Belgrade,''
Holbrooke told reporters at the United Nations. ``The leadership in Belgrade is
fomenting trouble north of the Mitrovica bridge.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 9,000 Serbs who remain here fear that if the 90,000 ethnic Albanians
living across the river are allowed free access to the north side, they will
launch reprisal attacks such as occurred elsewhere in Kosovo after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic halted his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists and withdrew his troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the price for ending the 78-day NATO bombing campaign that began
last year after Milosevic rejected a Western-dictated peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent tensions began after a grenade attack on a U.N. bus Feb. 2 killed
two elderly Serbs just south of the city. That triggered a round of revenge
attacks that have left nine dead and scores injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of an ethnic explosion mounted Monday as tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians set out from the provincial capital Pristina on a 25-mile march to
Kosovska Mitrovica. Different NATO officials gave varying estimates of the crowd
size -- ranging from 25,000 to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. police and NATO-led troops accompanied the demonstrators and U.S.
military vehicles and soldiers lined the road into the center of town to prevent
the protesters from entering the city center, though thousands did manage to
break through to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnic Albanian leader of the city, Bajram Rexhepi, said Albanian
organizers decided to return the marchers to their homes because the crowd ``got
out of control.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mitrovica needs peace and dialogue,'' Rexhepi said. ``I am against any
incidents at the bridge and those who organize them are against law and order.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Gets $15.2M in Privacy Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PAYNE, Ala. (AP) -- A jury awarded a top state senator $15.2 million in
damages Monday, deciding that his privacy had been invaded by an investigation
by an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Sen. Lowell Barron, the Senate president pro tem, said Alfa
insurance tried to dig up dirt to get him to support a company vice president
for a seat on the University of Auburn Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   Barron, an Auburn trustee, started crying after the verdict and said, ``It
will have a very positive impact on the political process and the future of this
state.''
</P>
<P>
	   The jury decided on $200,000 in compensatory damages and $15 million in
punitive damages against Alfa insurance, the Alabama Farmer's Federation and
former executives Goodwin Myrick and John Dorrill.
</P>
<P>
	   Barron's attorney, Jere Beasley, said the verdict would rein in special
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to do more to clean up Alabama politics than anything that
has happened in the past 50 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfa spokeswoman Debra Davis said an appeal is planned.
</P>
<P>

interviewing of acquaintances of an elected official was viewed in a threatening
manner and wound up in court,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Kurds Protest Detentions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Some 1,500 people rallied in the largest city in the
overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast to protest the detention of three Kurdish
mayors by Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters in Diyarbakir dispersed peacefully after the demonstration to
show support for the mayors of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party who were
detained by police for allegedly having ties to Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The detentions follow meetings that the mayors had in Europe and Turkey with
European politicians who are demanding cultural rights for Kurds, a call that
the People's Democracy Party and Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, both back.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has said it will never negotiate with Ocalan's rebels and is wary of
granting minority rights to Kurds, who are banned from teaching or broadcasting
in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released in Rome, the PKK said, ``the Kurdish people and
democratic public opinion, both at home and abroad, must not remain in silence
in the face of the arrests.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our people who have elected the mayors must embrace them and must respond
through democratic action,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Private NTV television said the prosecutor's office in Diyarbakir accused
the mayors of holding meetings in Europe as part of a campaign to pressure
Turkey on the Kurdish issue and declare a general amnesty for Kurdish rebels,
including Ocalan, who is on death row in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   NTV also said that the mayors were accused of having contacts with rebels
during 20 recent visits to Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   A government statement Saturday said the mayors were accused of extorting
money from citizens, gathering conscripts in Europe for the rebels and
establishing a network of communication between rebels and imprisoned comrades.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union is demanding that Turkey improve its human rights record
and grant cultural rights to Kurds before it can become a member.
</P>
<P>
	   The pro-Kurdish party, which swept April mayoral elections in 37
southeastern cities and towns, has campaigned for a peaceful settlement to
fighting in the southeast between the PKK and Turkish soldiers and the
recognition of cultural rights. Prosecutors are trying to close the party,
saying it is a front for rebels.

   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two armed death row inmates grabbed a female
correctional officer Monday and were holding her hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates were talking to the warden and attempting to reach a resolution
but officials were not hopeful that the situation would be resolved quickly,
said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Todd.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates got out of their cells around 4:15 p.m. and grabbed the guard,
whose name was not released. It was unclear how the inmates got out of their
cells.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer, who was not harmed, was handcuffed and sitting on the floor in
the recreational area at the Terrell facility, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmates are being relocated to the Terrell unit from the Ellis
unit near Huntsville due to an escape attempt by seven inmates there in 1998.
One inmate to made it out but drown in a creek about a mile from the prison. The
two inmates who took the hostage Monday participated in the botched escape.

<HEADLINE> Japan Police Arrest Cult Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Police on Tuesday arrested the leader of a religious cult that
had kept a mummified corpse in an airport hotel northeast of Tokyo for several
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Koji Takahashi, 61, leader of the Life Space cult, was taken into custody by
police in Chiba prefecture (state), said police spokesman Makoto Arai.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrest comes after police in November found a partially mummified body
in a Chiba hotel room near Tokyo's Narita international airport, with the dead
man's wife and son keeping vigil.
</P>
<P>
	   Takahashi, a silver-bearded former tax accountant, told reporters later that
the man, Shinichi Kobayashi, was undergoing treatment for an illness and
required ``complete rest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Takahashi, along with the dead man's wife and son, were arrested on charges
of not seeking proper medical care for Kobayashi, who had been receiving
treatment for a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   At its peak, Life Space is said to have drawn nearly 10,000 people to
seminars on enlightenment, but that number has dropped to around 150, the media
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan in recent years has seen growing numbers of new religious groups and
occult movements. Experts are divided over the reasons, but many believe the
postwar stress on material wealth has left people with a need for spiritual
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a recently enacted special law, Japanese authorities placed the
doomsday cult behind the 1995 fatal gassing on the Tokyo subways under strict
surveillance for up to three years because of fears the group is reviving. That
attack killed 12 people and sickened thousands.

<HEADLINE> Starr Defends Lewinsky Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By DON BABWIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Former independent counsel Kenneth Starr blamed
President Clinton on Monday for the years and millions of dollars spent on the
investigation that ultimately led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton could have spared the country the ordeal by being forthright
about his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could all have been (avoided) simply by saying, `There was this
activity, I shouldn't have done it, let's get it behind us as reasonably as we
can,''' Starr said in a speech at the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr said Clinton has ``this unfortunate side, this unwillingness to come
to grips with the situation that would have spared everyone all the angst ... by
coming to grips with it and to say `here it is' as opposed to dragging the
country through it and then suggesting that it's all the law officer's fault.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr also said he was disappointed with the coverage of the investigation,
comparing the media to a microphone that magnifies what is being said without
screening or filtering it.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr's successor as independent counsel, Robert Ray, is closing out the
six-year, $50 million probe, which led to the convictions of 14 people. In
addition to Whitewater and Lewinsky, Starr's office looked into the purge of the
White House travel office and the White House's improper gathering of FBI
background files on employees and presidential appointees from Republican
administrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr defended the investigation into the Lewinsky matter, saying it was as
much about perjury as an inappropriate relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our solemn obligation was to examine whether crimes -- not about the
nature of private relationships - but whether crimes have been committed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton was bound to answer questions that many considered
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we've created an exception in our law -- I know we haven't
-- if the question is embarrassing, you get a pass.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr sounded gracious when talking about first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
saying her statement that Starr's investigation was part of a vast right-wing
conspiracy was ``sort of an understandable defense mechanism.''

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a Harlem debate, Al Gore and Bill Bradley promised
Monday night to act against racial profiling from the White House -- and then
tried to turn the question against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley demanded to know why the vice president hadn't gone down the hall to
get President Clinton to issue an executive order outlawing racial profiling.
Gore shot back that racial profiling practically began in Bradley's New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange was prompted by the leadoff question, accorded to The Rev. Al
Sharpton. ``Many in our community have to live in fear of both the cops and the
robbers,'' the black activist told the presidential candidates. He asked how
they would deal with police brutality and racial profiling while avoiding an
increase in crime.
</P>

	   In a high profile case, Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man, died in a
barrage of 41 police bullets a year ago in his Bronx apartment building. White
police officers say they fired upon the West African immigrant after he refused
orders to halt and appeared to draw a gun, but the black object in his hand
turned out to be a wallet.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   Some results from polls on voter preferences in Tuesday's Republican
presidential primary in Michigan. When results don't total 100 percent, the
remainder either picked another candidate, didn't know or declined to answer.

</P>
<P>

wallet in the hands of a white man as what it is, ``and a wallet in the hand of
a black man as a gun,'' as in the Diallo shooting.
</P>

society.
</P>
<P>

executive order. ``I am questioning why you haven't done that or why you haven't
made this happen in the past 7 1/2 years,'' Bradley said.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press Note: All dollars are Canadian unless otherwise noted
Government Admits 51 Grant Recipients Folded
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Human Resources Department handed out more than $9
million in job creation grants between 1996 and 1999 to 51 companies that went
bankrupt or otherwise closed shop before the projects were completed, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials insist the failure rate was an acceptable one considering more
than 1,000 grants were awarded over those three years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about a five-per-cent rate of bankruptcy,'' David Good, an assistant
deputy minister at Human Resources, told a briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted it can be a ``challenge'' to make a go of a business in depressed
regions with high unemployment rates -- the kind of areas primarily targeted by
the Transitional Jobs Fund and its successor, the Canada Jobs Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you compare it to other rates of small- and medium-sized industries in
areas of high unemployment ... five per cent does not seem like an excessive
number.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are thousands of business and personal bankruptcies each year. The
latest monthly statistics, for October 1999, showed more than 6,900 across
Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Records released by Human Resources showed the 51 grants recipients that
went out of business were originally slated to receive $15 million in funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Bureaucrats estimated that would create more than 2,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, some $9.17 million in federal cash was actually paid to the firms
before they folded.
</P>
<P>
	   The department credited that spending with temporarily creating 751 jobs.
But all of them disappeared -- along with any pre-existing jobs at the same
companies -- when business ceased.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials offered no estimate of the net loss of jobs once the financial
dust had settled.

British Columbia Supreme Strikes Down Tobacco Suit
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The provincial government's lawsuit
against tobacco companies can't go ahead because it's based on a provincial law
that is unconstitutional, the British Columbia Supreme Court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   Several provinces have been watching the British Columbia action with a view
to launching similar suits of their own. Some are already in the works.
</P>
<P>
	   The court decision, released Monday by the British Columbia parties involved
Monday, said sections of the provincial law try to lump all the tobacco
companies together while ignoring the fact they are federally incorporated and
individual.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find the Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act to be
inconsistent with the provision of the Constitution of Canada'' and is beyond
the jurisdiction of the province, wrote Justice Ronald Holmes.

A Dozen Canadian Audiovisual Works Preserved
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Oscar Peterson's dazzling jazz performances, or Wayne and
Shuster's hilarious Rinse the Blood Off My Toga sketch may be ingrained in
Canadian memory, but they're quickly fading from the reels of celluloid and
stacks of vinyl.
</P>
<P>
	   A new project jointly funded by federal agencies and private industry has
chosen a dozen favorite Canadian audiovisual classics -- such as Peterson's 1961
The Trio album -- for special preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson was among the guests at a ceremony Monday on Parliament Hill to
honor those who will have their recordings and films preserved in the
Masterworks program.
</P>
<P>
	   The AV Preservation Trust, which administers the Masterworks program, is
pushing the federal government to make proper storage and archiving a condition
of receiving film and TV production funding or tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   Heritage Minister Sheila Copps said Monday that idea is already being
studied within her department.

Police Abuse Vs. Aboriginals Spreads to Regina
</P>
<P>
	   REGINA, Sasketchewan (AP) -- A racial firestorm engulfing Saskatoon police
over allegations that officers mistreated aboriginals -- possibly leading to
several deaths -- has spread to Regina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Regina police service is investigating a complaint by a native man that
two of its officers dumped him on the outskirts of town last summer as
punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   The story is similar to an allegation made last week by a Saskatoon man who
says he was dropped off on the edge of that city by police.
</P>
<P>
	   The RCMP are investigating the earlier complaint as well as suggestions
Saskatoon police may have been involved in the deaths of up to four aboriginal
men -- two of whom were found frozen outside the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Dave Wyatt of Regina police said his department's internal affairs unit
is handling the latest complaint.

	   Gun-Control Opponents Appear at Hearing
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Eight provinces and territories ganged up on Ottawa at an
unusually lively court hearing Monday on whether the federal government has
gutted their power to make law.
</P>
<P>
	   The provinces, supported by the gun lobby, are contesting Ottawa's ability
to implement a national gun-control system that forces owners to get licenses
and register their weapons. They say guns are private property and should be
regulated by the provinces.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day Supreme Court of Canada hearing began with a presentation by
Alberta, which sparked the legal wrangling in 1998 when it unsuccessfully
challenged the system at its own court of appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer Roderick McLennan told the nine Supreme Court justices that an
existing handgun registry has failed to stop criminals from using them to commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The matter before the court is a narrow one, a constitutional question on
whether Ottawa has the power to pass regulatory laws controlling ordinary guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Early on, judges took issue with lawyers' insistence on discussing whether
the gun registry and licensing system works.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to me that that's an argument for Parliament. If you were in
Parliament, you could make that, but you're not in Parliament now,'' said Chief
Justice Beverley McLachlin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I share some of the concerns that have already been expressed that how
effective the law is going to be is really not before us.''

<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- A state police commander was
killed and several people were injured in a clash Monday involving farmers
protesting low prices for coffee, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The farmers in Yajalon, about 40 miles north of here, accused local
officials of shortchanging them on the price paid for their coffee crops, said
Attorney General Eduardo Montoya. Coffee is a major crop in Chiapas, Mexico's
southernmost state.
</P>
<P>
	   Montoya said a protest march in the town led to a clash at the police
headquarters as protesters armed with clubs and rocks fought with agents, who
fired bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commander Rodrigo Ortega was killed and several people were injured
by rocks and clubs.

<HEADLINE> Search finds missing snowmobiler's body  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MINETTO, N.Y. (AP) - State police have found the body of a 28-year-old
teacher whose snowmobile was found in the icy Oswego River.
<P>
	   Investigators believe Kip L. Kelsey died after he drove along the river
sometime late Saturday or early Sunday as he was returning home after a day of
snowmobiling with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   The body was found Monday evening in 20 feet of water about 300 feet from
shore where his snowmobile was located.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday to determine the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday morning friends found his helmet on a patch of ice atop the river,
said state police Sgt. Dale R. Crisp. Divers located the snowmobile in the river
Sunday afternoon, he said. A search Sunday was called off when darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Rough terrain along the icy river made the search difficult, Crisp said.
State police used a front-end loader to dump sand over a steep bluff so rescuers
had better footing as they carried down heavy rafts and other equipment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Divers had to fight swift currents, Crisp said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other snowmobilers said they and Kelsey had consumed alcohol on
Saturday, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelsey, who had an infant daughter with his girlfriend, was a popular
technology teacher at Fulton Junior High School, where he taught for the past
five years.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Ethnic Albanians Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French and British troops fired tear
gas to push back thousands of ethnic Albanians trying to force their way across
a bridge into the Serb-controlled side of this ethnically divided city.
</P>
<P>
	   The Albanians were the lead contingent of up to 50,000 protesters who
marched on this northwestern Kosovo industrial city.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4,000 Serbs were waiting on the north side of the bridge, determined
to battle the Albanians themselves to keep them from entering their part of
Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   The Albanian contingent, numbering between 6,000 and 10,000, managed to
breach French positions on the approach to the bridge over the Ibar River, and
more French troops rushed to the bridge and began firing volleys of tear gas in
five-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
	   British troops blocked the bridge with armored vehicles and pushed away
ethnic Albanian men who tried to climb over the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   By the 6 p.m. start of a daily 12-hour curfew, crowds on both sides were
dispersing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign that the Serbs were prepared for a showdown, some Serb women and
children began evacuating the city, and a local Serb leader, Nikola Kabasic,
told a Belgrade radio station that the Serbs were bringing in reinforcements
from neighboring villages to defend their part of the city if NATO cannot
control the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   No American troops were involved in the scuffles at the bridge. On Sunday,
U.S. troops taking part in a weapons search in the Serb part of the city
withdrew to the ethnic Albanian south bank after Serbs pelted them with stones.
</P>
<P>
	   The commander of the embattled, NATO-led Kosovo Force, German Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt, congratulated the troops for showing restraint in the face of
escalating tensions, which threaten to engulf this city and perhaps the entire
province in a new round of bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The key thing really was to prevent an escalation in which somebody fired
on the other one,'' Reinhardt said. ``It would have been a disaster. My soldiers
were very reasonable. They used just the amount of power needed and did not
overreact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically tense city in Kosovo because it
contains the largest Serb community remaining in the province. Most Kosovo Serbs
fled following the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops in June and the arrival of
NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, blamed the Yugoslav government for fomenting trouble in Kosovska
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there is no question who's responsible for it. It's Belgrade,''
Holbrooke told reporters at the United Nations. ``The leadership in Belgrade is
fomenting trouble north of the Mitrovica bridge.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 9,000 Serbs who remain here fear that if the 90,000 ethnic Albanians
living across the river are allowed free access to the north side, they will
launch reprisal attacks such as occurred elsewhere in Kosovo after Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic halted his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists and withdrew his troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the price for ending the 78-day NATO bombing campaign that began
last year after Milosevic rejected a Western-dictated peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent tensions began after a grenade attack on a U.N. bus Feb. 2 killed
two elderly Serbs just south of the city. That triggered a round of revenge
attacks that have left nine dead and scores injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears of an ethnic explosion mounted Monday as tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians set out from the provincial capital Pristina on a 25-mile march to
Kosovska Mitrovica. Different NATO officials gave varying estimates of the crowd
size -- ranging from 25,000 to 50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. police and NATO-led troops accompanied the demonstrators and U.S.
military vehicles and soldiers lined the road into the center of town to prevent
the protesters from entering the city center, though thousands did manage to
break through to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnic Albanian leader of the city, Bajram Rexhepi, said Albanian
organizers decided to return the marchers to their homes because the crowd ``got
out of control.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mitrovica needs peace and dialogue,'' Rexhepi said. ``I am against any
incidents at the bridge and those who organize them are against law and order.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, meanwhile, the Yugoslav ambassador to Russia accused the
Americans of violating the U.N. resolution which established the Kosovo mission
by upgrading the giant Camp Bondsteel near the town of Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
	   Borislav Milosevic, brother of the Yugoslav president, said the construction
violates Belgrade's sovereignty over the province and indicates the Americans
plan to remain in Kosovo indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Debate in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a Harlem debate, Al Gore and Bill Bradley promised
Monday night to act against racial profiling from the White House -- and then
tried to turn the question against each other.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley demanded to know why the vice president hadn't gone down the hall to
get President Clinton to issue an executive order outlawing racial profiling.
Gore shot back that racial profiling practically began in Bradley's New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange was prompted by the leadoff question, accorded to The Rev. Al
Sharpton. ``Many in our community have to live in fear of both the cops and the
robbers,'' the black activist told the presidential candidates. He asked how
they would deal with police brutality and racial profiling while avoiding an
increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In a high profile case, Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man, died in a
barrage of 41 police bullets a year ago in his Bronx apartment building. White
police officers say they fired upon the West African immigrant after he refused
orders to halt and appeared to draw a gun, but the black object in his hand
turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said racial profiling is a state of mind in which a policeman sees a
wallet in the hands of a white man as what it is, ``and a wallet in the hand of
a black man as a gun,'' as in the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would issue an executive order against racial profiling, and
would declare ``quite clearly that white Americans can no longer deny the plight
of black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you elect me to the presidency, the first civil rights act of the 21st
century will be a federal law outlawing racial profiling,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it would cover not only law enforcement but all aspects of American
society.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's rejoinder was to ask why the administration has not produced an
executive order. ``I am questioning why you haven't done that or why you haven't
made this happen in the past 7 1/2 years,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Clinton has issued a directive to prepare for an executive order.
``You know racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator,'' Gore
shot back.
</P>
<P>
	   The audience was demonstrative, sometimes raucous, alternating between
applause and jeers as the Democratic rivals argued about affirmative action, and
their records when both were senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, asked about reparations from the government to atone for slavery, said
``I believe the best reparation is a good education,'' and affirmative action to
open opportunities to black Americans. He said general reparations would not be
approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley accused Gore of trying to end affirmative action at the federal
level, which the vice president vehemently denied. He said his program for
overhauling the bureaucracy as vice president was against quotas, not
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley confronted
Gore with a sheaf of papers documenting his five votes between 1979 and 1981 to
preserve tax-exempt status for colleges that racially discriminate. In those
votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including New
York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to face up to this if you're going to be a strong leader,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and, without elaborating, explained away the
votes as ``a vote on quotas.'' In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995
vote that Gore described as a rejection of expanding minority ownership of
broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley pressed his own point and Gore earned loud boos from the audience
when he cut Bradley off. ``You're sounding a little desperate because you're
trying to build yourself up by tearing everybody else down,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute debate was held at the Apollo Theatre, the Harlem landmark
where Ella Fitzgerald was discovered in 1934.
</P>
<P>
	   New York political consultant Bill Lynch, a Gore supporter estimated that
about 35 percent of voters in the state's Democratic primary on March 7 will be
minorities. The non-white vote in the last two contested Democratic primaries
was 20 percent in 1992, and 29 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley aides promised a more combative candidate for the two-week sprint to
``Super Tuesday'' when more than a dozen states will vote on March 7. Bradley
scheduled a speech on Tuesday on Long Island that was being billed as the
kickoff of an effort to expose inconsistencies and dishonesty in Gore's record.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign strategist Bill Knapp dismissed the pumped-up strategy by
saying, ``He's going to throw battery acid around.'' Knapp said Gore's own sharp
critique of Bradley and his agenda was different because Gore is ``just
defending his record and saying what he wants to do as president.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmates Take Officer Hostage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) -- Two armed death row inmates who were part of a
botched escape in 1998 were holding a female correctional officer hostage Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates were talking to the warden and attempting to reach a resolution
but officials were not hopeful that the situation would be resolved quickly,
said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Todd.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates got out of their cells around 4:15 p.m. and grabbed the guard,
whose name was not released. It was unclear how the inmates got out of their
cells.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer, who was not harmed, was handcuffed and sitting on the floor in
the recreational area at the Terrell facility, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say what, if anything, the inmates were demanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Death row inmates are being relocated to the Terrell unit from the Ellis
unit near Huntsville due to an escape attempt by seven inmates there in 1998.
One inmate to made it out but drown in a creek about a mile from the prison. The
two inmates who took the hostage Monday participated in the botched escape.

<HEADLINE> Sotheby's announces new chairman, president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The venerable auction house Sotheby's announced Monday
that its chairman and president have resigned under pressure from a U.S.
Department of Justice investigation into alleged antitrust violations.
<P>
	   A. Alfred Taubman has stepped down as chairman of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
and will be replaced by former Columbia University President Michael Sovern, the
auction house's board of directors said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Taubman, who acquired the company in 1983, retains his controlling interest
in the company and a seat on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "While this clearly is not an easy decision for me, I have determined that
it is time for me to step down from my role as chairman," Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana D. Brooks will be replaced as president and chief executive officer of
Sotheby's by William Ruprecht, who has been managing director of Sotheby's North
and South America since 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very proud of the achievements and initiatives that Sotheby's has
undertaken in recent years and I am confident that in the future it will build
upon its great franchise and reputation for excellence," Brooks said. "My
decision is a very difficult one, but I have taken it in the best interests of
the company and of my colleagues."
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Justice began an investigation in 1997 into auction houses
including Sotheby's and its main rival, Christie's, focusing on alleged
price-fixing in the commissions paid to sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Christie's replaced its longstanding 10 percent commission to
sellers with a sliding scale of 2 percent to 10 percent, and Sotheby's soon
adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits collusion in such arrangements as
illegal restraint of trade, punishable by fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's has also been hit with several civil lawsuits from clients
charging collusion between the two auction houses and shareholder class action
complaints alleging failure to disclose the alleged agreements and their impact
on Sotheby's financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's said in its statement that it "has recently met with the
Department of Justice in order to discuss a prompt and appropriate resolution of
this investigation, which will allow the company to put this difficult matter
behind it."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Sotheby's said he could not comment on the relationship
between the resignations and the antitrust probe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Justice said last month that Christie's had been given
conditional amnesty in the investigation after supplying the department with new
information on its practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Sotheby's traces its roots to the firm of Samuel Baker, a London bookseller
who first held an auction of rare books in 1744.
</P>
<P>
	   The company now operates in 38 countries, with principal salesrooms in New
York and London.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early Tuesday amid
continued bullish sentiment toward the greenback. Japanese stocks posted
moderate gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 111.28 yen, up 0.70 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
above its late London level of 111.22 yen overnight. U.S. markets were closed
Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 103.29 points, or 0.53
percent, to 19,647.04 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the average
closed down 245.28 points, or 1.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher as investors in Europe bought
dollars in early Asian trading Tuesday after a quiet session Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar in recent weeks has been gaining ground against the yen amid
sentiment that Japan's economic recovery is not as firm as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.80 yen, up from 109.37 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started slightly higher following Monday's steep
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were cautious over uncertainty about the direction of New York
markets. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 295.05 points, or
2.8 percent, to close at 10,219.52.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 3.75 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,684.47. The TOPIX closed down
39.05 points, or 2.27 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8200
percent from Monday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its price fell 0.17 point to
98.97. (km-dj)

<HEADLINE> Experts Rebuke Racial Profiling Vows  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Al Gore offered minority voters a magic
bullet against racial profiling Monday that does not exist within a president's
authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley challenged the vice president in a debate for not persuading
President Clinton to issue an executive order against racial profiling --
generally defined as when police stop motorists based on their race.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore vowed that if he becomes president, ``the first civil rights act of
the 21st century will be a national law outlawing racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the problem is not one that can be remotely solved by a presidential
order, or indeed by a president at all, experts say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds good,'' said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank. But,
``There's virtually nothing that a president of the United States can do.''
</P>
<P>
	   An executive order affecting only federal law enforcement agencies may be
conceivable but state and local police are overwhelmingly the ones that pull
motorists aside -- not the likes of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Probably 99 percent of racial profiling takes place on the highways,''
Bositis said. ``The federal government does not police the highways.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the Supreme Court has invalidated attempts to use statistical
information -- such as data on how many black people are stopped by police, or
executed by states -- to shape how criminal justice is applied.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is campaigning against racial
profiling and fighting it in court, is proposing a range of actions to remedy
the problem -- none as simplistic as a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the ACLU is urging states to take legislative action and is
supporting a bill in Washington state that would encourage the collection of
information quantifying racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   These complexities were only hinted at in the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why doesn't he walk down the hall now and have President Clinton issue an
executive order?'' Bradley asked rhetorically of his opponent, repeating that
question from an earlier debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley gave a mere taste of the nuances when he said: ``I would issue an
executive order that would eliminate racial profiling at the federal level. I
would try to pass a law to get information gathered at local levels so that we
could see how the police departments are acting. I would make sure that the
Justice Department was involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore only obliquely referred to a president's true weapon against racial
profiling -- the bully pulpit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that we have to make certain that, in this country, not only will
driving while black never be allowed to be a crime,'' he said, ``but we just
have to say that we are going to become one people and prevent these incidents,
partly by putting as much energy into education as we do into incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bositis said that to extent the federal government can do anything to
alleviate racial profiling, it would be to the benefit of Arab-Americans more
than blacks, because federal officers often give undue scrutiny to
Arab-Americans at airports.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Look To Mich. Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- Pointing toward Tuesday's second key primary clash in
four days, John McCain accused George W. Bush of waging a campaign of
``character assassination.'' The front-runner aimed his public barbs at Bill
Clinton and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   In the heart of auto country, Bush cited comments Gore made years ago in a
book critical of the internal combustion engine. ``I look forward to him
campaigning up here and saying, 'My vision for America is one where you won't be
working,''' Bush said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the Texas governor's public focus on the general election, his
campaign continued to run television commercials critical of McCain in advance
of Tuesday's Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The two campaigns also traded charges of phoning voters to criticize their
rivals. Surrogates for the candidates contacted voters as well, including in a
recording by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, who attacked a McCain campaign
official as a ``vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.''
</P>
<P>
	   Legitimate pollsters were out in force, and some said the race was very
close, within the margin of the poll's own sampling error. One even gave McCain
a slight lead, based on his big advantage among Democrats and independents who
said they will vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes were high for both men, but higher for McCain, whose campaign can
ill afford another setback like the one in South Carolina last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, McCain was hoping for a Michigan victory to restart his campaign
momentum and the flow of contributions that followed his big win in the leadoff
New Hampshire primary. McCain's home state of Arizona is voting Tuesday, too,
but most eyes are on Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has said that even if he loses, he'll stay in the race at least until
March 7. That's when California, New York, Ohio and many other states vote in
the biggest night of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
	   At a morning appearance Monday before an overflow crowd in Traverse City,
McCain used some of his harshest words to date in describing the Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Reject this negative campaigning. Reject this character assassination,''
he said. ``Reject the low road to the presidency and support the high road.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush slapped McCain only when asked by reporters during the day. Questioned
about the Arizona senator's promise to break the ``iron triangle'' of lobbyists,
money and legislation, Bush said, ``He talks about the iron triangle in
Washington D.C. He's been ringing that iron triangle like a dinner bell'' -- a
reference to McCain's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, though, Bush sought to give the impression of a man
looking ahead to the fall campaign, not someone struggling with the nitty-gritty
of a determined primary challenger.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, he touted education reform, a
biennial budget, tax reform and steps to reduce frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know we're talking about great economic times but no generation should
ever take prosperity for granted,'' he said. ``My job as your future president
is not to think about the Dow Jones today. My job is to look down the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for Clinton, he accused the president of missing opportunities for
expanded overseas trade and said, ``I'm going to seize the moment when I become
president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush made a morning stop at an elementary school, where students were
dressed as presidents to mark the federal holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the school library, Bush listened to a speech by Jaclyn Romero, 9, who
was dressed as former president Bush, and by Lauren Fendt, who was dressed as
John Quincy Adams, who followed his father's footsteps into the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a chance there may be another father and son,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also traveled to a high school, where he likened himself to the Star
Wars character, Luke Skywalker, ``trying to get out of the Death Star. ...
They're all against me, (Michigan) Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the
governors, all the senators. But we're gonna kill 'em, right, we're gonna get
'em.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush indeed traveled during the day with Engler, one of numerous GOP
governors around the country who helped establish the Texas chief executive as
front-runner in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was joined at his stops by state Sen. Joe Schwarz, who proudly told
audiences he was the only member of his party in the Legislature to break ranks
and join the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was defeated handily in South Carolina after he first launched
negative ads against Bush. When McCain's internal polling showed an erosion of
support, he then stopped, leaving the field clear for the attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan is different: McCain has refrained from attacking Bush in campaign
commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   His hopes for victory lie in his appeal for crossover votes from
independents and some Democrats drawn to his message of reform. But his aides
are worried about the impact of Bush's commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We already have reports of push polls, negative mail pieces; it's hard to
miss the false TV ads,'' Schwarz said in a statement issued by the campaign.
``We're not going to let Bush get away with this shadow campaign in Michigan.''

<P>
	   In rebuttal, the Bush campaign said McCain's operation was making negative
calls, including one that warns voters not to be ``fooled by George Bush's
negative smear campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign denied any knowledge of the Robertson call, aimed at
former senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, McCain's national campaign
chairman. Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending
retired Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion.

<HEADLINE> Continental Jet Lands in Emergency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A MD-80 passenger jet headed from Las Vegas to
Cleveland made an emergency landing Monday at the South Bend Regional Airport
after its crew reported problems maintaining level flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Flight 1416 carrying 141 passengers and five crew members landed
about 4:30 p.m., authorities said. No one aboard was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety experts were checking the plane, which is similar to the one that
crashed Jan. 31 offshore northwest of Los Angeles, killing 88 people aboard
Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Tom Kenney said crew members
reported problems with aileron trim. The aileron is a control surface on the
wing that controls the rolling movements of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers were transferred to another plane and departed for Cleveland
about 8:15 p.m., airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 has a strong safety track record, according to FAA data.
</P>
<P>
	   But after the January crash, the FAA ordered the inspection of the
horizontal stabilizer on more than 1,100 MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717
planes, which use similar control mechanisms as the jet that crashed, after
jackscrew problems were found in the Alaska Airlines wreckage.

<HEADLINE> Michael Ross penalty hearing to begin Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - There's no question Michael Ross is a rapist
and a murderer.
<P>
	   He's admitted it. He's been convicted of it.
</P>
<P>
	   And now a jury must decide if he should die for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-awaited, long-delayed penalty hearing for Ross is scheduled to get
underway Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury must decide if Ross deserves life in prison or the death penalty
for killing four teen-age girls in New London County in 1983 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross, 40, already is serving two life sentences for killing two other women
in Windham County. He's also admitted to killing two women in New York, but he
has not been prosecuted for these deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ross was convicted of the four killings and sentenced to death in 1987,
it was the first time Connecticut had someone on death row since the U.S.
Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Ross' case has taken wild twists through the legal system that
have infuriated the victims' families and set new precedents for how death
penalty cases are treated.
</P>
<P>
	   The case has been before the state Supreme Court three times. Ross is on his
fourth Superior Court judge and second prosecution team.
</P>
<P>
	   He's also been through two sets of defense lawyers, and for a while, the
Cornell University graduate with an IQ of 122 represented himself.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked to be executed in 1994 before his first Supreme Court appeal - an
appeal that is automatic in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court upheld the conviction but overturned the death sentence
because prosecutors withheld from the jury a letter written by a psychiatric
expert. In it, the expert cast doubt on his earlier claim that Ross did not
suffer from a disorder that would make him incapable of handling violent sexual
impulses.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Ross tried to sign his life away in a deal with prosecutors, saying
he wanted to spare his victims' families another grueling trial. The current
judge on the case, Judge Thomas Miano, rejected the pact as illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1998, Ross tried to kill himself with an overdose of
prescription medicine. Ross also has asked to be castrated and went on a hunger
strike in protest of the appeals process that has delayed his execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross had spent his years in court writing everything from letters to
reporters and op-ed pieces to an article that was published in The Journal of
Psychiatry &AMP; Law.
</P>
<P>
	   His pen has been silent for more than a year since Miano issued a gag order.
The order also bars prosecutors, defense attorneys and possible witnesses,
including relatives of Ross' victims, from speaking about the case outside of
court.
</P>
<P>
	   Some relatives of Ross' victims are expected to testify at the hearing about
the brutal way the young women were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross captured his victims as they walked along quiet, deserted roads in
eastern Connecticut. He raped most of them, then flipped them over onto their
stomachs and strangled them.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1982, Tammy Williams, 17, of Brooklyn, and 23-year-old Debra Smith
Taylor, of Griswold, were killed. Ross pleaded guilty to their killings in 1985
and got two life sentences in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1983, 19-year-old Robyn Stavinsky, of Norwich, an athlete described in
court papers as a "very carying, trusting person," was raped and murdered.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross told investigators Stavinsky was stronger than other girls he had
strangled and that his hands cramped from gripping her around the neck. Medical
examiners said the strangulation may have taken as long as 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The following year, Wendy Baribeault, 17, of Jewett City, was found dead
under a pile of stones in the woods off Route 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Baribeault, who was described as a "caring and sensitive young lady,"
struggled with Ross as he dragged her over two stone walls. He raped her, then
sat on top of her and strangled her, his hands again cramping so that he had to
relax them before resuming the hold around her neck.
</P>
<P>
	   On Easter Sunday 1984, Ross killed two 14-year-old friends, Leslie Shelley
and April Brunais, both of Griswold.
</P>
<P>
	   April was tall for her age and described as a "sensitive girl concerned with
others," while Leslie, described as "shy, withdrawn and a quiet little girl,"
was petite and weighed less than 90 pounds.
</P>
<P>
	   They were returning to Wendy's home from a walk to Jewett City along Route
138 when Ross offered them a ride. When he drove past their destination, the
girls became upset and April pulled out a knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross wrested the knife from April and drove to a secluded area off a dirt
road. He made April take off her jeans and cut them into strips, which he used
to bind the girls. He raped April and strangled her, then strangled Leslie.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Ross should get the death penalty because the killings
were especially cruel and that Ross was indifferent to his victims' suffering.
Prosecutors also argue Ross was in control of his actions and killed his victims
so they could not send him back to jail, as did a 1982 assault victim in Ohio
identified him.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers claim Ross' history and psychological problems mean that he
should be spared execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross was abused as a child on his family's egg farm in Brooklyn, where one
of his jobs was killing malformed and sick chicks.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been diagnosed with a mental disorder called "sexual sadism," which
urges him to repeatedly engage in violent sexual activity. An expert found Ross'
brain has a smaller-than-average cerebellum - a sign of behavioral deficiency.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Debate in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an angry Harlem debate, Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of
trying to conceal his record as ``a conservative congressman,'' and the vice
president said his rival's tactics ``divide us as Democrats'' instead of dealing
with the Republican enemy in the campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   In the historic Apollo Theatre, to the cheers and sometimes the jeers of a
largely black audience, Gore and Bradley began by promising that they would act
against racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley demanded to know why the vice president hadn't gone down the hall to
get President Clinton to issue an executive order outlawing racial profiling.
Gore shot back that racial profiling practically began in Bradley's New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange was prompted by the leadoff question, accorded to The Rev. Al
Sharpton. ``Many in our community have to live in fear of both the cops and the
robbers,'' the black activist said, asking how they would deal with police
brutality and racial profiling while avoiding an increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In a high profile case, Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man, died in a
barrage of 41 police bullets a year ago in his Bronx apartment building. White
police officers say they fired upon him after he refused orders to halt and
appeared to draw a gun, although the black object in his hand was a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said racial profiling is a state of mind in which a policeman sees a
wallet in the hands of a white man as what it is, ``and a wallet in the hand of
a black man as a gun,'' as in the Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would issue an executive order against racial profiling, and
would declare ``quite clearly that white Americans can no longer deny the plight
of black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you elect me to the presidency, the first civil rights act of the 21st
century will be a federal law outlawing racial profiling,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it would cover not only law enforcement but all aspects of American
society.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's asked why the administration has not produced an executive order.
``I am questioning why you haven't done that or why you haven't made this happen
in the past 7 1/2 years,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said Clinton has issued a directive to prepare for an executive order.
``You know racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator,'' Gore
shot back. Profiling episodes involving state troopers led New Jersey to appoint
a civilian monitor against the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, asked about reparations from the government to atone for slavery, said
``I believe the best reparation is a good education,'' and affirmative action to
open opportunities to black Americans. He said general reparations would not be
approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley accused Gore of trying to end affirmative action at the federal
level, which the vice president vehemently denied. He said his program for
overhauling the bureaucracy as vice president was against quotas, not
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley held out a
sheaf of documents he said documented five votes by Gore between 1979 and 1981
to preserve the tax-exempt status of colleges that racially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   In those votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
including New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to face up to this if you're going to be a strong leader,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and explained away the votes as ``a vote on
quotas.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995 vote that Gore described as
a rejection of expanding minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley pressed his own point and Gore was jeered when he cut his rival off.
``You're sounding a little desperate because you're trying to build yourself up
by tearing everybody else down,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley wasn't spared boos, either, when he went after Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   He said repeatedly that Gore's record in Congress was that of a
conservative. ``He was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill Clinton's vice
president.'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In those days, he said, Gore was ``poster boy'' for the opponents of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What you see is an elaborate what I call `Gore dance,''' Bradley said.
``It is a dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems,'' Gore said. ``They
do divide us as Democrats. They distract us from the real enemy, the right wing
extremists, Confederate flag-waving Republicans, who are trying to roll back the
progress that we have made,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he has the endorsement of organized labor, abortion rights
activists, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and the Congressional Black Caucus. ``Do you
think they all have such poor judgment, Senator Bradley?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I think is they don't know your record as a conservative Democrat,''
Bradley said, drawing jeers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my experience the Black Caucus is pretty savvy,'' Gore retorted. ``They
know a lot more than you think they know.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also pressed his argument that Democrats will suffer for Gore's
involvement in 1996 campaign fund-raising excesses unless the vice president
more fully explains his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You must be the only Democrat in America who misses Ken Starr,'' Gore told
him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not propose a special prosecutor,'' Bradley said. ``I said that the
Democratic party will lose its mantle as a reform party if we don't come to
terms with what happened in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their clashes, Bradley said he would support Gore if he won the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The rivals met on the stage of the landmark Apollo Theater, where Ella
Fitzgerald was discovered in 1934, their 90-minute debate concentrating on urban
and racial issues.
</P>
<P>
	   New York political consultant Bill Lynch, a Gore supporter estimated that
about 35 percent of voters in the state's Democratic primary on March 7 will be
minorities. The non-white vote in the last two contested Democratic primaries
was 20 percent in 1992, and 29 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Henson Co. Sold to German Media Co.  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- It's not easy bein' gruen.
</P>
<P>
	   Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are becoming the latest American icons to go
German, following in the footsteps of Chrysler Corp. and Random House.
</P>
<P>
	   Munich-based media company EM.TV and Merchandising is buying the Jim Henson
Co. for $680 million in cash and stock, giving it exclusive rights to such fuzzy
critters as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Bert and Ernie, and the scraggly green
furball, Oscar the Grouch.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are a strong believer in brands," deputy chairman of EM.TV Florian Haffa
said Monday. "With the Jim Henson Company, you don't get bigger internationally
recognized brands than Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, in the works for several months, also seals ownership of some of
the world's best loved children's shows including "The Muppet Show," "Jim
Henson's Muppet Babies" and "Fraggle Rock," not to mention a string of Muppet
films.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale does not include the program "Sesame Street," only the rights to
the characters developed for the show, first broadcast in 1969 and now seen in
140 countries alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyout gives EM.TV rights to more than 5,000 licensed Muppet products
that have hit toy stores over the last 10 years. That includes the
talking-and-laughing Tickle Me Elmo doll -- which triggered buying frenzies at
toy stores across the United States -- and more than 30 million Muppet books
sold in 45 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV also gets access to the Los Angeles-based company's science-fiction
shows, which include "Farscape," a top-rated show on Britain's BBC and the Sci
Fi Channel in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV is well-established in Europe with television and marketing rights to
the popular Japanese animation Pokemon as well as Bugs Bunny in Germany. It said
the deal would help it penetrate the American and Asian markets where Jim
Henson's Muppets already have deep roots.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV hasn't been the only German company to expand its market share
overseas through corporate takeovers. Besides Daimler-Benz, which acquired
Chrysler Corp. in 1998 to help penetrate the American market, German media giant
Bertelsmann bought the No. 1 U.S. publisher Random House that same year.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Henson, creator and alter-ego of Kermit the Frog and scores of other
Muppet characters, founded his self-named company in 1958, inventing the term
"muppet" as a cross between the words marionette and puppet. Kermit was known
for singing songs such as "Bein' Green."
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Henson Co. has been run by Henson's son and daughter and chief operating
officer Charles H. Rivkin since Henson's death in 1990. EM.TV plans no shakeups
for the Jim Henson crew, which will continue to have creative independence with
its headquarters in Los Angeles and studios in New York and London, Haffa said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Germany, we have a term that comes from English: 'Never change a winning
team,"' Haffa said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jim Henson Co. also has production agreements with the American cable
company Odyssey Channel, Capital Cities/ABC and Sony's Columbia Tristar Home
Video.
</P>
<P>
	   EM.TV says it wants to work with the Henson Company on investing more in the
fast-growing Odyssey Channel, which is operated jointly with Hallmark
Entertainment. Odyssey Channel is seen in nearly 30 million households in the
United States, though officials hope to increase that number to 50 million
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded by Thomas Haffa in 1989, EM.TV produces children's and family
programs, manages the distribution of such TV shows as "Pigs Next Door" and
"Norman Normal," and produces various television specials such as the Snowboard
World Championships 1999. The company has a portfolio of about 28,500 half-hour
episodes marketed under the brand Junior.

<HEADLINE> 'Peanuts' Creator Honored in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY ANN LICKTEIG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP)-- Tennis great Billie Jean King, cartoonist Cathy
Guisewite and other fans of Charles Schulz remembered the ``Peanuts'' creator
Monday as a humble genius who never realized until his dying days how much the
world loved him.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of Schulz's death from colon cancer nine days ago, just as his
final strip was being published, was no coincidence, said Amy Johnson, one of
his five children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was taken from this world to the next at the most sacred of moments for
him because he earned it,'' she told the audience of more than 2,000, which
filled an arts center in the town where Schulz lived for 27 of his 77 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz's widow, Jean, said the world's most widely syndicated cartoonist was
a humble artist who never realized how beloved his creations were until after
his cancer diagnosis in November and decision to retire that followed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could not know the extent of the impact he had made. I believe that's
what these last months have been about,'' she said. ``My comfort comes from
knowing that he fully received the love and appreciation that poured out to
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz, who made more than $30 million a year from the ``Peanuts'' strip and
the many products, videos and licensing deals it generated, is better known in
town for giving than receiving, both publicly and anonymously.
</P>
<P>
	   His money founded or fostered a symphony, community foundation, library,
housing development, dogs-for-the-disabled training center and many other
projects in the area, as well as the Redwood Empire Ice Arena where Schulz
played hockey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just a good man,'' said Doug Lightfoot, a retired pharmacist who
recalled how Schulz let his wife's troop of campfire girls skate for free. ``He
was always very supportive of the community.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guisewite, who draws the comic strip ``Cathy,'' said Schulz sought her out
from time to time. One day, he called her when he couldn't think of anything to
draw.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said 'What are you talking about, you're Charles Schulz!''' she said,
recalling how reassuring it felt to know that even the greatest struggle
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What he did for me that day he did for millions of people in zillions of
ways,'' Guisewite said. ``He gave everyone in the world characters who knew
exactly how we felt.''
</P>
<P>
	   King, who helped Schulz raise money for youth grants by playing at the
Snoopy Cup, a senior tennis circuit match at the ice rink, wore a Snoopy lapel
pin as she recalled how Schulz sought her out at a match and invited her to
Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
	   What he really wanted to know, she said, was what made her compete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He would probe and probe and probe, ask questions all the time. We talked
about our own insecurities, which are many. We talked about how anxious we both
are,'' King said. ``It was the Lucy in him, asking me. A little psychology
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the ceremony, the crowd was fed chocolate chip cookies and root beer
-- standard fare for the ``Peanuts' gang.'' British World War II-era fighter
planes flew over in a missing man formation, the middle plane trailing smoke
from its wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Schulz was buried in nearby Sebastopol after a private funeral last week.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Attacks McCain Official  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) -- In a recorded message phoned to Michigan voters,
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson attacks an official in John McCain's
campaign as ``a vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics
are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain refused to repudiate these words,'' Robertson added in the
message that was recorded Monday by a Michigan man. Robertson's remarks refer to
former senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, who is McCain's national campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudman angered leaders of the religious right in 1995 by defending retired
Gen. Colin Powell against their attacks over abortion. Rudman also wrote about
the controversy in a book.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition who ran unsuccessfully for the
Republican presidential nomination in 1988, made no mention of Bush in the brief
message.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Harris, a McCain spokesman, did not allege any involvement by Bush's
campaign, but said: ``This is exactly the kind of politics that we had hoped we
left behind in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pat Robertson and (former Christian Coalition director) Ralph Reed hand
delivered Governor Bush's victory to him in South Carolina,'' Harris said. ``The
people of Michigan have an opportunity to repudiate these kinds of negative
smears.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign denied making the calls, and accused the McCain camp and its
allies of running get-out-the-vote phone banks that were critical of the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not making any Pat Robertson calls,'' said Bush campaign
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ``Our campaign doesn't know anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gene Kapp, a spokesman for Robertson, confirmed that Robertson had recorded
the message but said it had nothing to do with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was an issues education call that was made on behalf of the Christian
Coalition to members on the Christian Coalition list in Michigan,'' Kapp said
Monday night. ``It was made to get out the vote. It did not endorse or request a
vote for a specific candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, George Bush easily won county caucuses in Michigan, knocking
Robertson off his then-front-runner pace, and the religious leader responded by
staging a losing legal and convention battle for a greater share of the state's
77 nominating delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain telephone calls urge voters to support McCain in Tuesday's GOP
primary. One call says McCain is more conservative than Bush, who is criticized
for spending increases in Texas where he is governor. The other warns voters not
to be ``fooled by George Bush's negative smear campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adrienne Karns, an accountant from Birmingham, Mich., said in an interview
that she received a recorded call telling her Catholics should vote for McCain.
She said she did not believe the call was endorsed by McCain's campaign, and
instead was sponsored by an outside group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It started off saying it was a 'Catholic voters' alert,''' Karns said,
noting the call mentioned Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina and school's perception as being anti-Catholic. ``It said McCain had
not been to the university, and he was a friend of all Catholics, and all
Catholics should vote for John McCain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karns said she was voting for Bush and that the call would not change her
mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Riding a wave of conservative support, Bush defeated McCain in South
Carolina's GOP primary Saturday, leaving McCain in a fight for survival in
Michigan's contest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has criticized Bush in recent days for running a negative campaign in
South Carolina and now in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Robertson message came to light when a Michigan voter, Jim Pouillon,
contacted McCain's campaign to express displeasure over having received the
call.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview, Pouillon said he is a member of the anti-abortion
group Operation Rescue and that he stood outside a high school where McCain
appeared Monday displaying an anti-abortion sign. But he said of the sentiments
expressed by Robertson, ``This is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The message opens with Robertson saying ``Protect unborn babies and restore
religious freedom once again in America.'' The primary will determine whether
the party nominates a man ``who wants to take First Amendment freedom from
citizens groups while he gives unrestricted power to labor groups,'' he
continues.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a reference to McCain's advocacy of campaign finance legislation to
ban unlimited contributions known as soft money. McCain says his legislation
would also apply to unions and he says he advocates other positions to limit
their use of campaign dollars.

<HEADLINE> Continental Jet Lands in Emergency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A MD-82 passenger jet headed from Las Vegas to
Cleveland made an emergency landing Monday at the South Bend Regional Airport
after its crew reported problems maintaining level flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Flight 1416 carrying 141 passengers and five crew members landed
about 4:30 p.m., authorities said. No one aboard was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane had been cruising at 33,000 feet when the crew reported a change
in altitude of less than 1,000 feet, the airline said in a statement. It was not
known what caused the plane to drop in altitude, and repair crews were seeking
an explanation, Continental spokeswoman Catherine Stengel told the South Bend
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Tom Kenney said crew members
reported problems with aileron trim. The aileron is a control surface on the
wing that controls the rolling movements of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers were transferred to another plane and departed for Cleveland
about 8:15 p.m., airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane is similar to the MD-83 that crashed Jan. 31 offshore northwest of
Los Angeles, killing 88 people aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-82, one of the MD-80 series of planes made by McDonnell Douglas, has
a strong safety track record, according to FAA data.
</P>
<P>
	   But after the January crash, the FAA ordered the inspection of the
horizontal stabilizer on more than 1,100 MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717
planes, which use similar control mechanisms as the jet that crashed, after
jackscrew problems were found in the Alaska Airlines wreckage.

<HEADLINE> Experts Rebuke Racial Profiling Vows  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Al Gore offered minority voters a magic
bullet against racial profiling Monday that does not exist within a president's
authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley challenged the vice president in a debate for not persuading
President Clinton to issue an executive order against racial profiling --
generally defined as when police stop motorists based on their race.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore vowed that if he becomes president, ``the first civil rights act of
the 21st century will be a national law outlawing racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the problem is not one that can be remotely solved by a presidential
order, or indeed by a president at all, experts say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds good,'' said David Bositis, senior political analyst at the
Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank. But,
``There's virtually nothing that a president of the United States can do.''
</P>
<P>
	   An executive order affecting only federal law enforcement agencies may be
conceivable but state and local police are overwhelmingly the ones that pull
motorists aside -- not the likes of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Probably 99 percent of racial profiling takes place on the highways,''
Bositis said. ``The federal government does not police the highways.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, the Supreme Court has invalidated attempts to use statistical
information -- such as data on how many black people are stopped by police, or
executed by states -- to shape how criminal justice is applied.
</P>
<P>
	   That fact also complicates other proposals heard in the debate as both
candidates stressed the need to reduce racial disparities in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised to ``pass the Racial Justice Act'' aimed at reducing the
disproportionate use of the death penalty against blacks and tackling other
racial disparities. ``I will not at the end of the day compromise it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bositis said that because the Supreme Court has held that racial data
cannot impact the course of criminal justice, Washington can't do much, short of
getting rid of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's absolutely minimal support for that in the Congress,'' he said.
``They'd be lucky if they got 100 votes'' in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   As for racial profiling, the American Civil Liberties Union is campaigning
against the problem and fighting it in court. But the solutions it is proposing
are not as simplistic as a presidential order.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the ACLU is urging states to take legislative action and is
supporting a federal bill that would encourage the collection of information
quantifying racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   These complexities were only hinted at in the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why doesn't he walk down the hall now and have President Clinton issue an
executive order?'' Bradley asked rhetorically of his opponent, repeating a
question from an earlier debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley gave a taste of the nuances when he said: ``I would issue an
executive order that would eliminate racial profiling at the federal level. I
would try to pass a law to get information gathered at local levels so that we
could see how the police departments are acting. I would make sure that the
Justice Department was involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore obliquely referred to a president's true weapon against racial
profiling -- the bully pulpit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that we have to make certain that, in this country, not only will
driving while black never be allowed to be a crime,'' he said, ``but we just
have to say that we are going to become one people and prevent these incidents,
partly by putting as much energy into education as we do into incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bositis said that to extent the federal government can do anything to
alleviate racial profiling, it would be to the benefit of Arab-Americans more
than blacks, because federal officers often give undue scrutiny to
Arab-Americans at airports.

<HEADLINE> Hung Jury in Irish Financier Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- An Irishman extradited from Oklahoma to
Northern Ireland last year was freed on bail Monday after a judge declared a
hung jury in his six-week trial.
</P>
<P>
	   George Finbarr Ross, 54, faces probable retrial on 39 criminal charges
related to the 1984 collapse of his Gibraltar-registered investment bank,
International Investments Ltd., which owed creditors $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors offered no reason for their inability to reach a verdict after two
days of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice John Gillen ordered Ross freed on $230,000 bail on condition he
report weekly to police.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross remains charged with 36 counts of false accounting and three counts of
procuring funds under false pretenses. During the trial, Gillen threw out two
other charges of procuring funds falsely.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence offered by prosecutors showed that letters sent in Ross' name to
his clients in December 1983 reported their accounts were in good order. Months
later, auditors declared the company hopelessly in debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Small-time investors -- many of them retirees who had invested between
$1,100 and $35,000 on promises of returns ranging from 10 percent to 17 percent
annually -- lost their entire holdings.
</P>
<P>
	   During his testimony, Ross said he had left Ireland for the United States in
1983 to develop the company's American investment portfolio and did not realize
how seriously in debt the venture was. He accused his business partners of
mishandling its Irish investments and selling off the bank's assets far too
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross resurfaced in the early 1990s in Oklahoma, serving as the financial
director of a Christian religious community.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland authorities filed an extradition warrant with the U.S.
government in 1996 after Irish newspapers discovered where he was living.

<HEADLINE> Southern Calif. Hit by Floods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Pacific storm soaked Southern California for a second
consecutive day Monday, causing street flooding, triggering small mudslides,
spawning heavy surf and a damaging tornado-like wind.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite light traffic because of the Presidents Day holiday, California
Highway Patrol officials reported more than 400 accidents by late afternoon --
twice the normal number.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just kind of hit too hard, too fast,'' CHP Officer Rosa Ray said.
</P>
<P>
	   City and county fire departments reported numerous incidents of street
flooding. Mud and water flowed off a burned area of the San Gabriel Mountains
above suburban Arcadia but city crews largely kept the flow from damaging
property.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service said a large low-pressure system and cold front
associated with the storm produced heavy rain across southwestern areas of the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   In Anaheim, residents reported that a funnel cloud damaged 25 houses, tore a
camper shell off a pickup and blew a big tree into the living room of one old
house, said city spokesman Bret Colson.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Democratic Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from Monday's debate between Democratic presidential candidates
Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore, as transcribed by the Federal Document
Clearing House:
</P>
<P>
	   Question about reducing police brutality and positions on racial profiling:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: When I think of Amadou Diallo, I think of an unarmed man who was
fired at 41 times by the police, who was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   I think it was an outrage. I feel it. Everybody in this room feels it. I
think it was also a tragedy. But I also think it reflects racial profiling, in
the sense of racial profiling that seeps into the mind of someone so that he
sees a wallet in the hand of a white man as a wallet, but a wallet in the hand
of a black man as a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   And we -- we have to change that. I would issue an executive order that
would eliminate racial profiling at the federal level. I would try to pass a law
to get information gathered at local levels so that we could see how the police
departments are acting. I would make sure that the Justice Department was
involved. And I would say quite clearly that white Americans can no longer deny
the plight of black Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I don't disagree with anything that Senator Bradley just said. But let
me sharpen it a little bit from my part by saying that if you entrust me with
the presidency, the first civil rights act of the 21st century will be a
national law outlawing racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
	   We have to recognize that racial profiling is a problem not only in law
enforcement, but also in insurance, in banking, inside schoolrooms, inside
people's hearts.
</P>
<P>
	   And we have to -- we have to confront it.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo case, the Louima case and the other cases are just heartbreaking,
and they have awakened the conscience of many Americans who have not looked at
this problem squarely.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that we have to do a lot to get at police misconduct, to measure
performance according to the attitudes toward the community also.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that we have to make certain that in this country not only will
driving while black never be allowed to be a crime. But we just -- we have to
say that we are going to become one people and prevent these incidents, partly
by putting as much energy into education as we do into incarceration.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Question on reparations for descendants of former slaves:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I believe the best reparations is a good education and affirmative
action to make available resources, to make available the kind of direct
assistance that has brought an empowerment zone here to Harlem, that has created
new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that we still need affirmative action in this country. I don't think
that it's time for anybody to say, Look, we have made so much progress. I think
that's a ridiculous conclusion.
</P>
<P>
	   The average African-American family wealth -- and also, the average Latino
family wealth, is less than one-tenth that of the average white family wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   To me, that justifies making available capital for young entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
	   It means -- it justifies making available opportunities for advancement and
affirmative action in every sphere.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, I personally have supported these measures. And here -- we have created
in the last seven years 20 million new jobs in America and the lowest
African-American ... unemployment rate and poverty rate in history. We need to
keep on going and make sure nobody is left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: The issue of reparations is what you really raised. And it seems to
me that what the issue raised is not just the issue of money, but the issue of
acknowledging the contributions of African-Americans to this country's history
over its entire history.
</P>
<P>
	   I think it is very important to do that. There are varieties of ways to do
that. You could establish a commission, which I think has already been proposed
in the Congress by Mr. (John) Conyers that would look at the possibility of
finding a way to acknowledge those contributions that have been made from the
days of slavery to the days today. And also, not denying anymore those
contributions. American -- white Americans are in denial of black Americans
contributions through slavery, denial in Jim Crow ... and continue to deny today
the indignities that African-Americans suffer. I believe that we can change that
with a major new investment in education, in economic development ... and in
beginning to see things a little deeper than skin color.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Question about reducing the gap in access to computers between rich and poor
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: One of the first things I would do is I would give 10,000
scholarships a year at $7,500 a year scholarship to people who after four years
would agree to teach in an urban or rural school district in the areas of
computer science, math, science or foreign languages. We need teachers in our
communities who understand these subjects and have the equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   The next thing I would (do) is something I call info-stamps, which empowers
those who don't have to be able to get the equipment and the software that they
need in order to be a part of the digital revolution. We have food stamps. We
need info-stamps to be able to accomplish this objective.
</P>
<P>
	   And in terms of education, I think -- and you mentioned race in education --
I think it is important to know that in 1980, '81 and 1979 there was an issue
before the Congress that related to whether the -- whether the government would
provide tax-exempt status to schools that racially discriminate. Al Gore
supported those measures, and I'd like to know today why.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I made a speech last week on how to close the digital divide.
I'll deal with this briefly and then respond to Bill's false charge.
</P>
<P>
	   I believe that we need to get computing centers in the community for
children and for adults, and we need to finish connecting every classroom and
library to the Internet. We need to get computers in the schools, and we need to
train the teachers. We cannot allow a digital divide to exacerbate the gap
between rich and poor. Now, as for this false charge -- two in a row. First of
all, on government procurement, there was no change there. That's a false
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Secondly, look, you have misrepresented that vote entirely, Senator Bradley.
That was not about affirmative action. That was about quotas. It was 337 members
of the Congress voted against that. You voted for -- the same way on final
passage.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, let me -- let me talk about a more recent vote. Not 20 years ago. In
1995, you were the only Democratic senator ... to vote against affirmative
action to help expand the number of African-American-owned broadcasting outlets
-- radio stations and TV stations. Why did you -- why were the only Democratic
senator on the Finance Committee to vote against that?
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Given Al's answer, I kind of expected his answer on his vote to
preserve tax exempt status for schools like Bob Jones (University) that racially
discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   So, I brought today, a copy of all five of those votes ... I've also brought
today, my statement in opposition, the Congressional Black Caucus's statement in
opposition, and Trent Lott's statement in support, saying that this would go to
Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   I'd like to give it to each member of the panel and Bernie at the break, but
I'd like you to have it now, Al.
</P>
<P>
	   Question on reducing number of guns in America:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: The answer is, yes, we can limit the number of guns that people
buy. In fact, I've offered the strongest gun control proposal of any
presidential candidate in history. I want registration and licensing of all
handguns. All handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   I want to make sure that there're trigger locks on guns, no gun dealers in
residential neighborhoods; that we have background checks at gun shows, as well
as gun dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   And I'll tell you something else. Al has been Bill Clinton's vice president
for seven years. He's done a good job as vice president. But he was also a
conservative congressman. And when he was a conservative congressman, he voted
with the NRA, and the head of the NRA said that he was the poster child or man
of the year. So there are two differences here ... there are two differences.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Senator Bradley, a couple of days ago your campaign said that you
wanted to get some things off your chest. Well, since then you've made personal
attack after personal attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Problem is these attacks don't solve any problems. They do divide us as
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   They distract us from the real enemy, the right-wing extremist,
Confederate-flag-waving Republicans who are trying to roll back the progress
that we have made.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Clinton-Gore administration has passed the toughest gun control
measures in the last 30 years. I cast the tie-breaking vote to close the gun
show loophole. Where were you? You had left. You had left. And on the very day
... on the very day when I cast that tie-breaking vote, you were out speaking at
a fund-raiser. So, let's not kid ourselves, we've got a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Well, what you've seen is an elaborate what I call Gore dance. It
is ... it is a dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record on guns.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE ... By all means, Bill, get the negativity off your chest. But then
when you get through, let's return to face the real problems that we're facing
in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was asked whether he believed Gore has the character,
trustworthiness and intellectual honesty to make a good president:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY; My view is that the people will make this decision. My view also is
that if Al were the nominee, I would support him.
</P>
<P>
	   My view -- my view, however, is that we have very different views of the
Democratic Party. I -- in Congress, he introduced four bills that dealt with
education and zero bills that dealt with health care. He was a conservative
Democrat, did not support national health insurance, an 84 percent right-to-life
voting record and was the poster boy for the NRA.
</P>
<P>
	   What I'm saying is, That's one view of what the Democratic Party can be. The
other view is to go the road of making access to quality affordable health care
available to every one in this country, making major investments in urban public
schools that need those investments so much ... doubling the amount of money
spent on Title I, so that urban public schools will have qualified teachers and
be accountable to parents.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, you've got it right, Mr. Greenfield. He questions the character
of people who disagree with him.
</P>
<P>
	   When NARAL, the leading pro-choice organization in America, endorsed my
candidacy, his campaign put out information questioning their character --
questioning the character of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   When the AFL-CIO endorsed me, he put out a statement attacking them.
</P>
<P>
	   He confuses disagreement with somebody not being a good person.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, yesterday, he even proposed the appointment of new special prosecutor
to investigate Democrats. Senator Bradley, you must be the only Democrat in
America who misses Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I did not propose a special prosecutor. I said that the Democratic
Party will lose its mantle as a reform party if we don't come to terms with what
happened in 1996. And I think the best way to come to terms with what happened
in 1996 is for you to tell people exactly what happened, in your own words, so
that -- let me tell you, if you are...
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, let me just read you the front -- ``The New York Times'' today,
recalling -- reporting on your statement yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Incorrect.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: ``Former Senator Bill Bradley publicly endorsed today the appointment
of a special prosecutor...
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: It's incorrect.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: ... for the Clinton-Gore campaign in '96.''
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: It's incorrect.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, take it up with The New York Times. You're the one that is
reported as having said that...
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: No. No. It's incorrect.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Question on considering a black running mate if nominated:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Now as for a vice presidential running mate or a Cabinet or anything
like that, I have refrained from making any short list or long list because I
don't want to get ahead of myself. I'm focused on trying to convince folks to go
to the polls and support my candidacy on March the 7th. And so I don't want to
get ahead of myself.
</P>
<P>
	   But I'll tell you this: The one criterion that I would use if I have that
privilege is to select someone who would be capable of becoming president on a
moment's notice in case that had to happen. And of course, I would make that
selection without regard to race or gender or ethnicity ...
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think the first criteria is that the person should be able to
step into the office if the president was not there and perform the duties
exceptionally well.
</P>
<P>
	   I think the second criteria is that the person should be able to help in a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The third is that the person should be someone that the president has the
ability to get along with and can be a partner.
</P>
<P>
	   I think there are plenty of African-Americans in this country who fit that
criteria.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Question about imposing a moratorium on the death penalty:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I think that the problem of racial profiling that we started with is
just the beginning of the problems we have to face within the criminal justice
system, including sentencing; the disparities between crack and powder cocaine,
for example, as they're currently written, are not justified by the scientific
evidence; the practices of many law enforcement agencies need to be changed, as
we've talked about; and, where the death penalty is concerned, I strongly
support the inquiry under way right now in the U.S. Justice Department to see
whether or not the racial disparity on the surface of the data justifies action
of a kind that they're now exploring.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that the record that the governor of Illinois confronted was, kind
of, different from what it is nationally so far.
</P>
<P>
	   I do support the death penalty, but I -- and I do not support a moratorium
at this time. Senator Bradley's attacked me for not supporting the death penalty
enough.

Gore-Bradley Debate Is Lively
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a hard-hitting debate, Democratic presidential campaign
rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley tonight each denounced racial profiling. They
faced each other at a nationally televised event in Harlem. Bradley demanded to
know why the vice president hadn't convinced President Clinton to issue an order
outlawing racial profiling. Gore said racial profiling practically began in New
Jersey, where Bradley had served as a senator. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil
rights leader, called the debate "the de-marginalization of our concerns as a

<HEADLINE> Pistons 95, Heat 87  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Terry Mills had six 3-pointers -- one shy of his
career high -- as the Detroit Pistons, winless in three games since the All-Star
break, beat the Miami Heat 95-87 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant Hill scored 24 points while Jerry Stackhouse and Lindsey Hunter each
had 22 for the Pistons, who have won three in a row at The Palace and 13 of
their past 17 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning scored 20 points for Miami despite having his nose broken
before fouling out with 2:24 remaining. Jamal Mashburn added 14 for the Heat,
who went 1-3 on their four-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pistons, who had a five-point halftime lead, hit six 3-pointers -- three
by Mills -- to take a 75-64 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills' sixth 3 gave Detroit an 83-71 lead with 5:49 left in the fourth
quarter, but three baskets by Mourning fueled a run that cut it to 86-79 with
3:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Hardaway made two free throws to cut Detroit's lead to 86-81 with 1:50
left and a three-point play by P.J. Brown cut it to 88-84 with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Heat scored just three points the rest of the way, a free throw by
Voshon Lenard and a jumper by Mashburn with 11.2 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami was forced to foul and the Pistons had five free throws plus a basket
by Jerome Williams down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills sank a pair of 3s as the Pistons opened the second half with a 10-2
run for a 57-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 3 by Mills put the Pistons up 60-46 with 6:40 left in the quarter,
and a dunk by Stackhouse off an ally-oop pass from Mills gave the Pistons their
biggest lead, 62-47 with 5:40 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning's layup with 5:19 left in the quarter was the first field goal of
the second half for Miami, which had five free throws to that point.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, Stackhouse and Hunter accounted for all of Detroit's points in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   With 3.0 seconds left in the half, Stackhouse -- whom the Heat tried to
acquire last August -- slammed down an alley-oop pass from Hill to send the
Pistons off with a 47-42 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Hlinka Debuts Behind Penguins Bench  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Ivan Hlinka stood behind the Pittsburgh Penguins bench
for the first time Monday night, not officially in charge but certainly looking
like the head coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Very soon, he could be. The only question is when, not if, he will shed the
title of associate coach and take over a team that is still very much in the
Eastern Conference playoff race despite a 2-1 loss Monday to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   This certainly isn't the way Hlinka wanted to debut -- losing a game and the
Penguins' best player, Jaromir Jagr, who injured his right hamstring and will be
out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a big game for me," said Hlinka, the former Czech Olympic coach.
"I hoped it would be better."
</P>
<P>
	   His first impressions of the Penguins are much like those who have watched
the team all season; they often try to make an easy play difficult and overpass
when they have good scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We play too complicated a game," Hlinka said. "We have to move the puck
more. We have to shoot the puck more. We play a lot in the corners ...."
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Hlinka is undergoing an NHL orientation course, learning the
players, the organization and the league while another former Olympic coach of
renown, Herb Brooks, runs the team.
</P>
<P>
	   But Brooks suggested Hlinka's transition will be a short one. And, from the
way he acted as soon as the game began, Hlinka clearly understands the Penguins
now are his team.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though he had only one practice and one pregame skate beforehand,
Hlinka was soon patting players on the back, leaning over when a player came off
the ice to offer encouragement and a word or two of advice.
</P>
<P>
	   "Give me a couple of days, and we'll see what happens," Hlinka said. "I have
to know about the players, know more about the players. After that, I will make
decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   When the Penguins announced Feb. 7 that Hlinka would join them as soon as he
finished coaching his former Czech team in a tournament, it was assumed Brooks
would finish out the season and Hlinka would take over next season.
</P>
<P>
	   But from the body language being offered by both Hlinka and Brooks, who has
not seemed to especially enjoy his return to NHL coaching, Hlinka's learning
curve will be a short one.
</P>
<P>
	   "We welcome him with open arms," said Brooks, who was recalled from a
scouting assignment to take over as interim coach when Kevin Constantine was
fired Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Hlinka said he would be "very happy if Herb Brooks stays the rest of
the season." And general manager Craig Patrick said he will allow Brooks to
decide how long he wants to stay around, even though Brooks is still living in a
hotel and has never moved his wife to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not going to coach forever," Patrick said. "We don't know when that
time will come. He is welcome to stay as long as he wants."
</P>
<P>
	   But Patrick said Hlinka "will have more say" once he becomes more familiar
with his new team.
</P>
<P>
	   Before getting hurt, Jagr, clearly tried to make an impression on his old --
and new -- coach. He went to the ice in the first period to block a shot on a
Lightning 2-on-1 break, which might have been a first this season for the NHL's
leading scorer. He later drew a high-sticking penalty during what for Jagr was
an especially physical game.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlinka was expected to join the Penguins in Pittsburgh last week in advance
of their four-game road trip, which continues Tuesday night against the New York
Rangers. Coincidentally, that will be the 20th anniversary of the Brooks-coached
U.S. Olympic hockey team's "Miracle on Ice" victory over the Soviet Union in the
1980 Lake Placid Games.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hlinka, who coached a mini-miracle of his own as the Czech Republic won
the 1998 gold medal in Nagano, was delayed for several days as he awaited a work
permit. He finally joined the Penguins on Sunday in Tampa, even if one of his
three suitcases didn't. It was lost in transit.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlinka acknowledged part of his adjustment will be to speak English as a
primary, not a secondary language. He will talk individually to the Penguins'
half-dozen Czech players in Czech, but he will always use English when
addressing more than one player.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can promise my English will be better every day," he said. "English will
be my language. I have to respect the other players, too."

<HEADLINE> Predators 5, Stars 2  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ville Peltonen scored a goal and added an assist
and Tomas Vokoun stopped 23 shots as the Nashville Predators snapped a six-game
losing skid by beating the Dallas Stars 5-2 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville hadn't scored more than two goals in a game since Feb. 2, also the
last time it won a game. Cliff Ronning, not invited to the All-Star game earlier
this month, set the tone 26 seconds in when he scored his 21st goal off a
rebound of David Legwand's missed backhander.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stanley Cup champions, who beat Colorado 2-1 at Denver on Sunday, looked
tired. The Stars couldn't get any offense going and had only five shots in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Manny Fernandez shut out the Predators last week and had been giving up just
a league-best 1.74 goals per game. But he allowed two goals within the first
nine minutes as Vitali Yachmenev scored his 12th at 8:49. Fernandez gave up the
most goals scored against Dallas since Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas pulled within 2-1 4:10 into the second when Brenden Morrow backhanded
the puck in off Sylvain Cote's pass from the slot on a power play.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville answered 33 seconds later when Kimmo Timonen got his eighth goal
off an assist from Peltonen and Sebastien Bordeleau. It got so bad for the Stars
that Vokoun got an assist at 14:53 when he set up Scott Walker who fed Peltonen
on the right wing where he scored for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas came alive in the third and finished the game outshooting Nashville
25-22. Guy Carbonneau got his eighth goal on a backhander at 1:53, but that was
it as Vokoun had several big saves, including a glove stop off Richard Matvichuk
with five minutes left.

<P>
	   Patric Kjellberg tied Ronning for the team lead in goals when he scored on a
power play with 1:01 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   The only bright side for Dallas was Brett Hull. He had an assist on Morrow's
goal, giving him 100 points in his 118 games since joining the Stars before last

    CLEVELAND (AP) -- Wesley Person forced overtime with a 3-pointer at the
buzzer and Bob Sura slapped the ball away from Michael Dickerson with three
seconds to play Monday night to preserve Cleveland's 109-108 victory over
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Bryant gave Cleveland its only lead of overtime by converting a
three-point play with 2:01 left. Bryant made a hook shot in the lane, was
fouled, and sank the free throw for a 109-108 advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams missed chances to score and Vancouver got the ball back with 15
seconds to play. Dickerson caught a pass from Mike Bibby near the top of the
key, and Sura reached in from behind and slapped the ball away.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn Kemp's 26 points led the Cavaliers, Lamond Murray had 25 and Person
added 18, including five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson scored 27 points, including four free throws in the final 9.4
seconds of regulation, to lead Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson made two foul shots to put the Grizzlies ahead, 100-99. Cleveland
called timeout and set up a shot for Kemp, who drove the lane but misfired badly
with 3.1 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickerson grabbed the rebound, was fouled by Danny Ferry and made two more
free throws for a 102-99 advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   After another timeout, Person took an inbounds pass from Andre Miller, faked
Doug West into the air, then tied the score with a 26-foot jumper from the wing.
</P>
<P>
	   Murray already had 17 points with 1:30 left to play in the first quarter,
then did not take another shot for the next 17:21.
</P>
<P>
	   Bibby scored four of his 25 points in overtime for Vancouver.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 95, Heat 87  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY ATKINS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Terry Mills had six 3-pointers -- one shy of his
career high -- as the Detroit Pistons, winless in three games since the All-Star
break, beat the Miami Heat 95-87 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant Hill scored 26 points while Jerry Stackhouse and Lindsey Hunter each
had 22 for the Pistons, who have won three in a row at The Palace and 13 of
their past 17 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning scored 20 points for Miami despite having his nose broken
before fouling out with 2:24 remaining. Jamal Mashburn added 14 for the Heat,
who went 1-3 on their four-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pistons, who had a five-point halftime lead, hit six 3-pointers -- three
by Mills -- to take a 75-64 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills' sixth 3 gave Detroit an 83-71 lead with 5:49 left in the fourth
quarter, but three baskets by Mourning fueled a run that cut it to 86-79 with
3:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Hardaway made two free throws to cut Detroit's lead to 86-81 with 1:50
left and a three-point play by P.J. Brown cut it to 88-84 with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Heat scored just three points the rest of the way, a free throw by
Voshon Lenard and a jumper by Mashburn with 11.2 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami was forced to foul and the Pistons had five free throws plus a basket
by Jerome Williams down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills sank a pair of 3s as the Pistons opened the second half with a 10-2
run for a 57-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Another 3 by Mills put the Pistons up 60-46 with 6:40 left in the quarter,
and a dunk by Stackhouse off an ally-oop pass from Mills gave the Pistons their
biggest lead, 62-47 with 5:40 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning's layup with 5:19 left in the quarter was the first field goal of
the second half for Miami, which had five free throws to that point.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill, Stackhouse and Hunter accounted for all of Detroit's points in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   With 3.0 seconds left in the half, Stackhouse -- whom the Heat tried to
acquire last August -- slammed down an alley-oop pass from Hill to send the
Pistons off with a 47-42 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Debate in Harlem  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an angry Harlem debate, Al Gore accused Bill Bradley of
attack tactics that ``divide us as Democrats,'' while the challenger described
the vice president as a sometime conservative with a suspect record on
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ninth of their presidential campaign debates, Gore said he was an
advocate of affirmative steps to open opportunities for black Americans, and to
improve education as well, calling those steps ``the best reparation'' for
slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued Gore was a closet conservative. ``Calling attention to the
fact that he was a conservative Democrat before he was Bill Clinton's vice
president is simply truth-telling,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Gore wants to increase Pentagon spending more than education
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not true, either,'' Gore shot back.
</P>
<P>
	   The tone of the argument on the stage of the historic Apollo Theater was set
at the start, when the presidential rivals agreed that they'd both take steps
against racial profiling -- and immediately tried to turn the question against
each other.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute debate was televised by CNN. The largely black audience
cheered, applauded, jeered, sometimes booed. Neither candidate was spared the
raucous reactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley demanded to know why the vice president hadn't gone down the hall to
get President Clinton to issue an executive order outlawing racial profiling.
Gore shot back that racial profiling practically began in Bradley's New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange was prompted by the leadoff question, accorded to The Rev. Al
Sharpton. ``Many in our community have to live in fear of both the cops and the
robbers,'' the black activist said, asking how they would deal with police
brutality and racial profiling while avoiding an increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he would issue an order against racial profiling, and would
declare ``quite clearly that white Americans can no longer deny the plight of
black Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you elect me to the presidency, the first civil rights act of the 21st
century will be a federal law outlawing racial profiling,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's asked why the administration has not already produced an executive
order on racial profiling. Gore said Clinton is preparing to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, senator,'' Gore
shot back. He said Bradley didn't respond to the problem when he was in the
Senate. Profiling episodes in 1999 forced New Jersey to appoint a civilian
monitor to deal with the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley accused Gore of trying to end affirmative action at the federal
level, which the vice president vehemently denied. He said his program for
overhauling the bureaucracy as vice president was against quotas, not
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaching across the three feet separating their lecterns, Bradley held out a
sheaf of documents he said documented five votes by Gore between 1979 and 1981
to preserve the tax-exempt status of colleges that racially discriminate.
</P>
<P>
	   In those votes, Gore split with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,
including New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a leading Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to face up to this if you're going to be a strong leader,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore refused to take the papers and explained away the votes as ``a vote on
quotas.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, he challenged Bradley to explain a 1995 vote that Gore described as
a rejection of expanding minority ownership of broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley pressed his own point and Gore was jeered when he cut his rival off.
``You're sounding a little desperate because you're trying to build yourself up
by tearing everybody else down,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said repeatedly that Gore's record in Congress was that of a
conservative. In those days, he said, Gore was ``poster boy'' for the opponents
of gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What you see is an elaborate what I call `Gore dance,''' Bradley said.
``It is a dance to avoid facing up to your conservative record.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is these attacks don't solve any problems,'' Gore said. ``They
do divide us as Democrats. They distract us from the real enemy, the right wing
extremists, Confederate flag-waving Republicans, who are trying to roll back the
progress that we have made,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he has the endorsement of organized labor, abortion rights
activists, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and the Congressional Black Caucus. ``Do you
think they all have such poor judgment, Senator Bradley?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I think is they don't know your record as a conservative Democrat,''
Bradley said, drawing jeers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my experience the Black Caucus is pretty savvy,'' Gore retorted. ``They
know a lot more than you think they know.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also pressed his argument that Democrats will suffer for Gore's
involvement in 1996 campaign fund-raising excesses unless the vice president
more fully explains his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You must be the only Democrat in America who misses Ken Starr,'' Gore told
him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not propose a special prosecutor,'' Bradley said. ``I said that the
Democratic party will lose its mantle as a reform party if we don't come to
terms with what happened in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their clashes, Bradley said he would support Gore if he won the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In his closing debate statement, Gore boasted of his campaign manager, a
black woman. He said Donna Brazile is ``helping to change this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said ``a lot of people want to change the world, but only a few
people want to change themselves. When it comes to the issue of race in America,
we have to do both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York political consultant Bill Lynch, a Gore supporter estimated that
about 35 percent of voters in the state's Democratic primary on March 7 will be
minorities. The non-white vote in the last two contested Democratic primaries
was 20 percent in 1992, and 29 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls give Gore a prohibitive lead among minority voters, much of it
inherited from Clinton.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As Spike Lee was being interviewed, the Rev. Al Sharpton
waited for a photo-op with the film director. Whoopi Goldberg held Lee's leather
jacket and waited for her turn with the press.
</P>
<P>
	   The red velvet seats in the orchestra section and two mezzanines of the
Apollo Theatre were dotted with celebrities -- and celebrity attorneys -- for
Monday night's Democratic presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   There was Dallas Cowboys veteran Calvin Hill and Los Angeles Lakers coach
Phil Jackson, both Bradley supporters. Gore acknowledged Martin Luther King III
midway through. There also was O.J. Simpson's defense lawyer, Johnnie Cochran,
whose favorite was unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   Some flocked to the press filing center across the street afterward to join
the political talking heads. Goldberg, a Gore partisan, said she wasn't too
impressed by the candidates' zingers. ``I had better putdowns sitting in my
seat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton told reporters before the forum that he did not expect to make an
immediate endorsement ``unless somebody knocks me off my seat.''

<HEADLINE> TV Groom Denies Abuse Allegations  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN FOX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENCINITAS, Calif. (AP) -- The husband from "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?" returned to his house alone after his Caribbean honeymoon and
angrily denied that he had abused an ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox TV canceled a rebroadcast of the show after learning that a restraining
order was issued in 1991 against Rick Rockwell because an ex-girlfriend accused
him of hitting and threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
	   "At no time have I ever struck any of my girlfriends, ever, for any reason,"
Rockwell, 42, told KGTV on Sunday night outside his home in Encinitas, a coastal
city 25 miles north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't condone it under any circumstances. It goes against my core beliefs
and I was not raised that way," he said. "You know, relationships have ups and
downs, but getting physical for me is not an option."
</P>
<P>
	   By the time he emerged from his house again, at 6 p.m. Monday, Rockwell's
demeanor had brightened considerably, and he laughed, joked with reporters and
passed out 10 large cheese and pepperoni pizzas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would love to talk about all this stuff but I'm so busy. I have to feed
all of you," a jovial Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say where his wife, Darva Conger, 34, was or what their
situation was.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's doing great. We talked a couple of minutes ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the future of their marriage, he replied: "I don't know what's
going to happen about that, but I think she's a great person."
</P>
<P>
	   Conger could not be reached Monday. A phone message left at her home was not
returned and a receptionist at the Thousand Oaks hospital where she worked as an
emergency room nurse said she was no longer employed there.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 22 million people tuned in to "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?" on Feb. 15. Fifty women competed as if they were in a
combination of "The Dating Game" and a beauty pageant, parading in bathing suits
and wedding gowns and answering questions about their tastes.
</P>
<P>
	   After the group was pared down to five finalists, Rockwell selected Conger,
a Gulf War veteran, to be his wife. A Las Vegas judge married them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ensuing week, critics have blasted the show as tasteless and
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, people who know Rockwell, a real estate investor and former stand-up
comedian, have questioned just how rich he is and whether the whole thing was a
publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox executives denied that the pair were acquainted before the program.
Rockwell also denied to KGTV that he knew Conger and that the marriage was a
stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   "False rumors," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the day, two men who would not identify themselves stood guard
outside Rockwell's one-story, 1,200-square-foot home Monday and wouldn't let
anyone approach. Through one of them, Rockwell declined a request for an
interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   When Rockwell spoke with a reporter from KGTV, he read from a statement to
address abuse allegations leveled in a 1991 restraining order application filed
in Los Angeles County by Debbie Goyne.
</P>
<P>
	   She described herself as his former fiancee and said she lived with Rockwell
for 18 months. Goyne accused Rockwell of shoving and slapping her, twice
entering her home without permission and vandalizing her car after she broke off
their engagement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Recently, he said he would find me and kill me," her court papers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge issued a restraining order prohibiting Rockwell from coming within
100 yards of Goyne for six months. It was unclear whether Rockwell was in court
to defend himself when the order was issued.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell said that the relationship with Goyne "ended poorly" but that he
would never hit a woman. He acknowledged that he didn't tell Fox about the
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
	   "I considered it a closed chapter in my life," he said, adding that he
apologized for any embarrassment the issue had caused Goyne in recent days.

<HEADLINE> Starr Defends Lewinsky Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By DON BABWIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Former independent counsel Kenneth Starr blamed
President Clinton on Monday for the years and millions of dollars spent on the
investigation that ultimately led to Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said he was disappointed with media coverage of the investigation,
comparing the press to a microphone that magnifies what is being said without
screening or filtering it.
</P>
<P>
	   But Starr reserved his most pointed criticism for Clinton during a
question-and-answer session with Northwestern University journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the president could have spared the country the ordeal by being
forthright about his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could all have been (avoided) simply by saying, `There was this
activity, I shouldn't have done it, let's get it behind us as reasonably as we
can,''' Starr said in a speech at the Medill School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr said Clinton has ``this unfortunate side, this unwillingness to come
to grips with the situation that would have spared everyone all the angst ... by
coming to grips with it and to say `here it is' as opposed to dragging the
country through it and then suggesting that it's all the law officer's fault.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr said he regrets not establishing a public information office,
conceding his office was ill-prepared to handle the avalanche of questions from
reporters all over the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he criticized coverage as often presenting an incomplete, and
therefore misleading, picture of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr pointed to the coverage of the trial of former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy
Tucker in the Whitewater investigation as an example of the media's failure. He
said the press did not provide accurate reports in large part because reporters
did not cover the trial ``day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr's successor as independent counsel, Robert Ray, is closing out the
six-year, $50 million probe, which led to the convictions of 14 people. In
addition to Whitewater and Lewinsky, Starr's office looked into the purge of the
White House travel office and the White House's improper gathering of FBI
background files on employees and presidential appointees from Republican
administrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Starr defended the investigation into the Lewinsky matter, saying it was as
much about perjury as an inappropriate relationship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our solemn obligation was to examine whether crimes -- not about the
nature of private relationships - but whether crimes have been committed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Clinton was bound to answer questions that many considered
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think we've created an exception in our law -- I know we haven't
-- if the question is embarrassing, you get a pass.''
</P>
<P>
	   Starr sounded gracious when talking about first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
saying her statement that Starr's investigation was part of a vast right-wing
conspiracy was ``sort of an understandable defense mechanism.''

<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Taking advantage of an injury to Tim Duncan, Rodney
Rogers scored 22 points to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 98-89 come-from-behind
victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan left the game with 11:08 to play in the second quarter with a lower
abdominal strain. Duncan, who has never missed a game in his NBA career, ended
the night with four points and three rebounds in 13 minutes. He has played in
184 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta added 21 points for Phoenix, which extended its winning streak
to six games.
</P>
<P>
	   David Robinson led San Antonio with 31 points and 18 rebounds, while Malik
Rose chipped in 17 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing by as many as 13 points in the third quarter, Phoenix opened
the fourth quarter with an 8-0 run to lead 73-71 on Clifford Robinson's jump
shot with 8:52 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns increased the advantage to 81-74 with 6:21 left on a free throw by
Penny Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
	   After San Antonio rallied to 81-80 on Terry Porter's 3-pointer with 5:44 to
play, Phoenix answered with a 10-4 run and took a 91-84 lead on a dunk by
Gugliotta with 3:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio would get no closer than four points the rest of the way as
Phoenix outscored the Spurs 33-18 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs opened the third quarter with a 20-8 run to lead 63-50 on a
driving layup by Avery Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix closed the quarter with an 11-4 run to pull to 71-65 on a 3-pointer
by Randy Livingston at the third quarter buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind 15 points from Robinson, San Antonio led 43-42 at halftime. The Suns
stayed close behind 13 points apiece from Rogers and Rex Chapman off of the
bench.

<HEADLINE> China Threatens Unification or War  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- With a month to go in Taiwan's presidential election
campaign, China warned Monday that it might attack the island if Taiwanese
leaders indefinitely refuse to talk unification.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat, delivered in a policy paper from China's Cabinet, was intended
to increase the pressure on Taiwan's three presidential candidates. Although
there was no immediate reaction from Taiwan's government or the candidates'
camps, policy toward China has been at the center of the campaign, which ends
March 18.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mainland Affairs Council, which handles Taiwan's China policy, planned
to have a news conference later Tuesday after the council has had an opportunity
to review the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Chao Chun-shan, a professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei, said
the policy paper was a disapointment for Taiwanese. In recent months, the
candidates have done a lot of creative thinking about how to improve relations
with China, and Beijing responded by repeating its old line with a new threat,
Chao said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The presidential candidates have to feel disappointed and the voters have
to feel disappointed,'' Chao said.
</P>
<P>
	   Already this month, China sailed its newly acquired, heavily armed
Russian-built destroyer through the Taiwan Strait. And Chinese President Jiang
Zemin over the weekend toured military bases in southern China that would be the
ones used in any invasion of Taiwan, the Hong Kong media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Such tactics, and Monday's heated words from the State Council, were ominous
reminders that Taiwan and China remain antagonists in an unfinished,
seven-decade civil war. Although democratic Taiwan has relinquished its claim to
the communist mainland, China considers the island a rebel province.
</P>
<P>
	   China has long vowed to wage war if Taiwan declared independence outright or
foreign forces meddle. The policy paper from the State Council added Taiwanese
foot-dragging over unification talks to the list of provocative circumstances
that would compel China to attack.
</P>
<P>
	   If any of those three situations arose, ``then the Chinese government will
be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force, to
... fulfill the great cause of reunification,'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
	   It included a warning to the United States to scale back arms sales to
Taiwan -- once a close ally whose defense Washington must by law assist -- and
``not to stand in the way of the reunification of China.''
</P>
<P>
	   China's new Taiwan policy statement was not all barbs. It reiterated that
force was a last resort and offered to hold talks as equals with any Taiwanese
politicians so long as they recognized the island as part of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Taiwan's last presidential campaign four years ago, China tested missiles
and staged intimidating war games to deter pro-independence Taiwanese and the
United States sent warships to counter the threats. It was the closest the sides
had come to armed confrontation since the late 1950s.

<HEADLINE> Commuter Train Derails in Utah  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A light rail train jumped the tracks in the center of
a downtown street, crashed into a utility pole and skidded into the roadway
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   About two dozen people on board suffered bumps and bruises, but no serious
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Monday was a holiday, few vehicles were on the street and none was
hit by the skidding train cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers on the light rail TRAX train said they heard scraping on the
rails and then a bang when the train hit the pole, throwing riders from their
seats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You just heard a crash, then you're down on the floor and people are
piling on top of you,'' said passenger Susan Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was chaos,'' said passenger Radell Donel.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Transit Authority officials believed the accident was caused by a
malfunctioning switch. The train's wheels apparently caught on the switch after
coming around a curve, jarring the third car off the tracks. The train then slid
across the pavement, slammed sideways into a utility pole and bounced into the
street.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Portugal Pileup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Four people were killed and 70 were injured when
heavy fog along Portugal's main highway caused traffic pileups that involved
about 100 cars, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The collisions occurred 45 miles north of Lisbon on the A1 highway that
links the capital with the northern city of Oporto.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic along a 20-mile stretch was halted both ways for at least five hours
as 250 rescue officials removed the injured and worked to free up the road,
emergency services spokesman Manuel Laje said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 6,000 cars were stuck in traffic jams as a result of the accidents,
according to TSF radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The accident believed to have triggered the pileups occurred at 7:30 a.m. in
the North-South direction of the highway because of reduced visibility due to
the fog, Laje said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers in the opposite direction slowed down to look at the accidents,
causing further collisions, Laje said.

<HEADLINE> Help Sought for Argentina Victims  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jewish dissidents endured especially cruel treatment
during Argentina's ``dirty war,'' their families said Monday as they called on
Israel to help recover the bodies of those who disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Oskar Jaimovich told Parliament's immigration committee that anti-Semitism
played a role in the torture and execution of his 17-year-old sister, Alejandra,
by paramilitary forces in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is expected that the Israeli government represents Jews and should deal
with such problems -- to check what role anti-Semitism played and why Jews were
treated worse,'' Jaimovich said.
</P>
<P>
	   During Argentina's 1976-83 military dictatorship, at least 9,000 leftists
and dissidents vanished after being detained by the junta's security forces,
according to an Argentine government report. Human rights groups say the figure
is closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Of those who vanished, up to 2,000 were Jewish, said Israeli Diaspora
Affairs Minister Michael Melchior, although Argentine Jewish groups estimate the
number to be approximately 1,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Melchoir said Argentina's new president pledged to track down the bodies of
Jews who disappeared during the so-called dirty war, although President Fernando
de la Rua has since said his offer was misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaimovich, a 50-year-old economist living in central Israel, said he learned
from former prison camp inmates that his sister's Jewishness led her captors to
subject her to especially harsh treatment and increased torture.
</P>
<P>
	   Others who lost family members during the military years said it is not
necessarily Israel's role to track down the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Rua's predecessor, Carlos Menem, pardoned the top junta leaders in
1990, just five years after they were jailed for life for human rights abuses.

<HEADLINE> Shareholders sue Campbell, allege sham shipments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Several Campbell Soup Co. shareholders have sued the
company, alleging that it set up "sham shipments" of unwanted soup to make its
profits look larger than they were last year, according to a published report.
The company has denied the accusation.
<P>
	   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Tuesday's editions that the first
lawsuit, filed last month by the pension fund of New York-based Laborers Local
1298, accused Campbell of having arranged with large resellers to receive their
products at the end of each quarter. These "transactions" were induced by
offering the resellers deep discounts and rebates, the Laborers alleged.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since these customers did not want the product, Campbell arranged for
hundreds of trucks to line up at each of Campbell's four U.S. facilities (in
Ohio, Texas, California and North Carolina) on the last days of each quarter and
physically move product" to other Campbell storage facilities, booking the
transfers as sales, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell denied in meetings with analysts and reporters last week that the
company had set up phony shipments to enable the company to book higher profits
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   At least half a dozen investors have filed similar lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell last month said it was ending a long-term practice of offering
steep quarterly discounts to encourage retailers to stock up. But company
spokesman John Faulkner said Friday there were no improper sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The pension fund's lawsuit said one of the companies that had arranged to
receive Campbell's products in exchange for discounts or rebates was Fleming
Cos. Fleming spokesman Shane Boyd told the newspaper, "Our business with
Campbell's reflects nothing unusual. The goods we paid for, we got. We got
product offered to us at deep discounts, and we bought it."
</P>
<P>
	   The case is pending before U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas in Camden.

Gore, Bradley Debate in Harlem
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an angry Harlem debate, Al Gore accused Bill Bradley of
attack tactics that "divide us as Democrats," while the challenger described the
vice president as a sometime conservative with a suspect record on affirmative
action. The tone of the argument on the stage of the historic Apollo Theater was
set at the start, when the presidential rivals agreed that they'd both take
steps against racial profiling -- and immediately tried to turn the question
against each other. The 90-minute debate -- the candidates ninth presidential
debate -- was televised by CNN. The largely black audience cheered, applauded,
jeered, sometimes booed. Neither candidate was spared the raucous reactions.
