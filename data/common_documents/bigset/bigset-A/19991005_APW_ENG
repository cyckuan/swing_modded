<HEADLINE> Quayle Appears on Letterman Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With his Republican presidential campaign  
officially over, Dan Quayle has made peace with an old nemesis: 
David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe you don't know this, but over the years I've actually  
told a lot of jokes about you,'' Letterman confessed to the former 
vice president in a skit at the start of CBS' ``Late Show'' Tuesday 
night. ``Many of them were less than complimentary, so I really 
feel like it's a nice thing for you to be on the show,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle played along, pretending he was on an NBC comedy:  
</P>
<P>
	``No hard feelings, Dave, but there's one thing I've got to say:  
'Live from New York, It's Saturday Night!''' 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview later, Letterman quipped: ``You've got to be  
nuts to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, making his first appearance ever on the program, drew  
rousing applause when told the comedian: ``I'm here for my 
apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the pair attempted a serious discussion of politics  
(Quayle said he quit the GOP presidential campaign because he was 
dwarfed by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's financial warchest), there 
was no mistaking this was a comedy show. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle: ``Bill Bradley seems to be coming on fairly strong ... I  
know them both, served with them in the Senate, they're both very 
accomplished people. But I tell what, if you think Al Gore is 
boring, just wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman: ``I know what you're saying ... (Bradley) ain't  
exactly Robin Williams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle also lamented an atmosphere of what he called ``gotcha  
journalism,'' where reporters are more interested in whether a 
candidate ``inhaled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman couldn't resist. ``So, did you inhale?''  
</P>
<P>
	``I was a Pabst Blue Ribbon guy,'' Quayle joked.  
</P>
<P>
	Letterman even brought up ``the potato thing,'' recalling how  
the former vice president became the butt of jokes for once 
misspelling 'potato' while appearing at a New Jersey school. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said he was shown a card with the incorrect spelling. ``I  
just thought it was creative spelling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman also asked whether Quayle would consider the No. 2  
spot if Bush wins the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been there, done that,'' he said. ``I don't want to get  
back on your show as often as I was.''

<HEADLINE> Rider a No-Show As Hawks Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- For most members of the Atlanta Hawks,  
Tuesday was the first day of training camp. For Isaiah Rider, it 
was an extension of his offseason vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting for him to contact us and show up,''  
general manager Pete Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's agent, Arn Tellem, told Babcock in two conversations  
Tuesday that he also was trying to track down Rider, and had not 
heard from him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, a guard acquired in an August trade with the Portland  
Trail Blazers, failed to arrive Monday for the Hawks' mandatory 
media day in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative from Tellem's office called Babcock on Monday  
afternoon and told him that Rider had missed several flights, but 
would attempt to be on an evening plane to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't happen, and Rider missed the team bus to  
Chattanooga, where the Hawks are holding training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left a message for him this morning on his cell phone,''  
Babcock said Tuesday morning during the team's opening practice. 
``(I told him) I hoped that he was OK, that if he needed any help 
to give us a call, we'd be happy to help. We're looking forward to 
having him in camp. And I gave him my numbers, which he already 
has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lenny Wilkens, entering his 27th season as an NBA head coach,  
said he's never had a player disappear before the start of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has had a troubled history during his six-year NBA career.  
He showed up late for his first pro practice with the Minnesota 
Timberwolves in 1993, and has been adding to his list of offenses 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	He has feuded with coaches, missed flights, been suspended by  
the league and convicted in court of marijuana possession, assault 
and illegal possession of cell phones. He also spent four days in 
jail for violating his probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks knew they were getting a player with a penchant for  
trouble when they traded Steve Smith and Ed Gray for Rider and Jim 
Jackson. But Rider's considerable talents -- he has averaged 18 
points and shown the ability to dominate offensively -- outweighed 
the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed that he wasn't there yesterday, but I  
wasn't surprised,'' Babcock said. ``We expected there to be some 
rocky moments. We didn't want it to start that way, but it has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks will fine Rider for his absence. Players are fined by  
the number of team activities they miss. By Tuesday night, Rider 
had accumulated six fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Tuesday morning practice, Rider missed three  
activities on Monday -- the media session, the team dinner and a 
team meeting. He missed two practices and a team dinner on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Center Dikembe Mutombo said the players don't have time to worry  
about Rider's absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, we're getting ourselves ready for a long season. I  
don't want to let this thing disrupt me,'' Mutombo said. ``Each one 
of us here is a professional. We have a duty to fulfill. If you 
don't fulfill your duty, that's your problem, and something for 
management to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider had told several people that even though training camp  
didn't start until the beginning of October, he planned to be in 
Atlanta by September. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock had only one question: ``Did he say what year?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $289B Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $289 billion  
defense bill Tuesday that includes a pay raise and other incentives 
the Pentagon hopes will attract more recruits and keep today's 
troops in uniform longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe you the tools you need to do the job and the quality of  
life you and your families deserve,'' Clinton told a couple hundred 
service members at a brief ceremony on the steps of the Pentagon 
overlooking the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the pay package, including a 4.8 percent  
across-the-board raise effective Jan. 1 and a change in pay scales 
effective next July, represents the biggest increase in 
compensation in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excellence of our military is the direct product of the  
excellence of our men and women in uniform,'' he said. ``This bill 
invests in that excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined in the ceremony by Defense Secretary William  
Cohen and the uniformed service chiefs and civilian service 
secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill says that the dedication and sacrifices of our  
soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, frequently deployed far from 
home and family in defense of our security interests around the 
world, are understood and appreciated,'' said Army Gen. Henry H. 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which authorizes an $18 billion increase in the  
defense budget over fiscal 1999, which ended Sept. 30, also directs 
a reorganization of the Energy Department to create a largely 
independent nuclear weapons agency within the department. The 
reorganization was prompted by controversy over allegations of lax 
security and Chinese espionage involving the nuclear weapons labs 
under the Energy Department's control. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent pay raise is the highest since a 14.3 percent  
boost in 1981 during the Reagan administration's military buildup. 
The Clinton administration had proposed a 4.4 percent increase for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the Air Force ended the 1999  
fiscal year with a manpower shortage of about 10,000 -- a 
combination of too few recruits and too many people -- particularly 
pilots -- leaving the service for commercial aviation jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, Navy and Marine Corps reached troop strength levels  
set by Congress, although only the Marines -- the smallest of the 
major services with 172,500 people -- met their goals in both 
recruiting and retention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force, which for years didn't need to bother with TV  
advertising, fell short in both recruiting and retention, whereas 
the Army overcame a recruiting shortfall by exceeding its retention 
goal. The Navy, which was nearly 7,000 recruits short in 1998, met 
its goal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among reserve forces, only the Army National Guard and Marine  
Reserve met their force goals. The Army Reserve, Air National 
Guard, Air Force Reserve and Navy Reserve fell slightly short. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal 2000 defense budget attempts to address the problem  
of maintaining adequate force levels by providing a combination of 
financial incentives. In addition to the pay raise, the Pentagon 
also is authorized to adjust pay scales next summer to put more 
emphasis on rewarding performance than longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Congress authorized the Pentagon to make a major change in  
its retirement pay system. Service members will be allowed to 
retire after 20 years of service at 50 percent of basic pay, up 
from the current 40 percent. Or, a service member could take a 
one-time $30,000 cash bonus after 15 years of service, stay another 
five years and then get the 40 percent retirement pay instead of 50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said in advance of the bill-signing ceremony  
that they believe these adjustments will enable active-duty 
services to retain more people. They also say the services are 
looking for more effective means of recruiting young people, 
including making more use of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has had an acute problem with pilots leaving for  
commercial aviation, in part because of dissatisfaction with 
deploying abroad for long periods at irregular intervals. In 
response, the Air Force is trying to give air crews more 
predictable and fixed overseas duty schedules.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Modest Medicare Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between President Clinton and Senate  
Finance Committee leaders have yielded little progress toward an 
agreement on a major overhaul of Medicare this year or new 
prescription drug benefits for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clinton and the committee's chairman, Sen. William  
Roth, R-Del., have agreed to consider some incremental changes to 
the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled that 
could yield more money for hospitals and nursing homes complaining 
of too-tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, Roth and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the  
Finance Committee's senior Democrat, met at the White House on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Roth believes there is some common ground, but  
Medicare reform is a complex issue and he doesn't want to rush into 
meeting any artificial deadlines,'' Roth spokeswoman Tara Bradshaw 
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Clinton has agreed, however, to work  
with lawmakers to find money and make regulatory changes that could 
moderate the billions of dollars in Medicare cuts that were part of 
the 1997 balanced budget act. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested that the money needed could come from some  
changes he has proposed making in the way Medicare does business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president indicated his openness to such initiatives, but  
in the context of providing additional statutory authority to 
modernize the purchasing practices of (Medicare),'' said a written 
statement from Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton in June proposed a package of such purchasing changes  
that the administration has estimated could save Medicare $25 
billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them: requiring competitive bidding by medical suppliers  
and giving retirees the chance to save money if they see doctors 
and other health care providers who agree to special discount 
contracts with Medicare -- much like the many private health plans' 
``preferred provider'' networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth and Moynihan agreed to look at those proposals as possible  
ways to pay for the balanced budget act modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Caregivers -- especially hospitals and nursing homes -- have  
complained in massive lobbying campaigns that they are painfully 
strapped for cash because of the 1997 payment cuts. Some studies 
have also found evidence that Medicare patients with expensive 
medical problems are having trouble getting services such as home 
health care.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Man Illegally Gave to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A New Jersey businessman has pleaded guilty  
to funneling $32,000 in illegal donations to the 1996 campaigns of 
President Clinton and Sen. Robert Torricelli. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Penna is the second person to admit wrongdoing in the  
funding for Torricelli, a Democrat. In May, Berek Paul Don, the 
onetime Republican leader in Torricelli's base of Bergen County, 
pleaded guilty to illegally funneling $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A third man, Mark Jimenez of Miami, fled the country last year  
after being accused of making $40,000 in illegal contributions to 
Clinton, Torricelli and other Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli lawyer Abbe Lowell said ``it is not surprising that a  
handful of people would violate the rules,'' noting that 
Torricelli's 1996 campaign raised more than $10 million from 20,000 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no allegation that anyone at the campaign knew of this  
or solicited this,'' said Lowell, who served as chief Democratic 
counsel in Clinton's impeachment hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	The money donated by Don and Penna will be given to charity,  
Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penna, president of the now-defunct Investors Associates Inc.  
securities firm in Hackensack, on Tuesday admitted conspiring to 
reimburse employees for $12,000 in illegal donations to Clinton and 
about $20,000 to the Torricelli campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pleaded guilty to stock fraud, admitting his firm  
illegally made $33 million by manipulating initial public offerings 
of five stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines, but  
sentencing guidelines call for less-severe penalties.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early  
Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve warned of further interest 
rate increases. Tokyo stock prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.12 yen, down 0.48 yen from its level of  
106.60 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 106.41 
yen late Tuesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Nikkei-225 Stock Average rose 65.36 points, or  
0.37 percent, to 17,849.51 in the first 30 minutes of trading. The 
average closed up 20.44 points, or 0.12 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping rates unchanged Tuesday, the U.S. central bank  
switched its policy directive from neutral to one leaning toward 
increased rates. It warned that it would remain ``especially 
alert'' to any inflation threats coming from tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Fed's unexpected decision to adopt a tightening bias  
is putting some downward pressure on the dollar,'' said Takeo 
Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust and 
Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 114.22 yen in early  
trading, up 0.32 yen from its level of 113.90 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened higher amid hopes for  
more economic stimulus measures by Japan's new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reshuffled his Cabinet on Tuesday  
and kicked off a three-party coalition government, retaining 
economic ministers who have played a key role in bringing the 
economy to the verge of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Shizuka Kamei, the policy chief of the ruling party, said he  
expects the government's new economic stimulus package to include 
around 13 trillion yen (dlrs 123 billion) in total spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
closed 0.64 point lower at 10,400.59 Tuesday, having swung from a 
106-point gain to a 124-point loss over the final two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 0.91 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,510.97. The 
TOPIX closed up 0.90 point, or 0.06 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6350 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6100 percent. Its 
price fell 0.22 point to 100.56.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says UN Needs Reform, Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Nearly three years after embarking on a  
major overhaul of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
said Tuesday the world body still had too many administrators and 
rules, and too little money. 
</P>
<P>
	Member countries, primarily the United States, owed the United  
Nations more than $2 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unpaid dues and bureaucratic delays have made it virtually  
impossible for the United Nations to respond quickly to crises like 
those in Kosovo and East Timor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For an organization that must respond regularly to crisis,  
this is a sure path to frustration, failure and irrelevance,'' 
Annan told the General Assembly's budget and finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite promises by members, the organization's financial  
trouble remains virtually unchanged: the world body is owed about 
$2.15 billion in dues and assessments for peacekeeping operations -- 
the same amount it was owed in December 1996, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are running a globally important organization without the  
predictable, assured, financial support of its members,'' said 
Joseph Connor, the U.N. undersecretary-general for management. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States owes $1.5 billion, and if Washington doesn't  
pay $550 million by the year's end, it will lose its voting rights 
in the General Assembly, Connor warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has appropriated $200 million, but legislation to pay  
the remaining $350 has not yet been passed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the U.N. budget committee  
that the Clinton administration was working to resolve the issue, 
but would insist on ``meaningful reform of the United Nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan has proposed time limits on new U.N. programs with major  
funding commitments. He suggested programs be budgeted based on 
specific results, with criteria set at the start to regularly 
measure achievements and impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke endorsed the reforms. He also called on the United  
Nations to reduce the U.S. share of annual U.N. dues from 25 
percent to 22 percent, and the U.S. share in U.N. peacekeeping 
operations from 31 percent to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of the problems the U.N. faces, Annan noted that  
for Kosovo he initially had asked for $200 million to administer 
the province following NATO's bombing, the withdrawal of Yugoslav 
forces and the return of over 800,000 ethnic Albania refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Assembly, however, authorized only $125 million, and  
to date, member states have sent checks for just $35 million.

<HEADLINE> Length of Baseball Games Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- So much for commissioner Bud Selig's desire to  
quicken major league games. 
</P>
<P>
	The average time of a nine-inning game increased six minutes  
this year to 2:53, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's 
statistician. That's one minute short of the record length set in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig became angry about the length of games during the 1997  
World Series between Florida and Cleveland. The average time was 
3:31 and Game 3 lasted 4:12. 
</P>
<P>
	``The `Unfinished Symphony' had a better chance of finishing  
before that game,'' Selig said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, one of his consultants, Hall of Famer Frank  
Robinson, was assigned to monitor the length of games. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, a memo was sent to teams outlining a series of  
steps to speed up games. The commissioner's office hoped it would 
shave 15 minutes off the average game time, which was 2:52 during 
the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Umpires should not grant time for batters to step out of the  
box unless, in the umpire's judgment, it is absolutely necessary,'' 
the memo said. ``When given permission to leave the batter's box 
... batters may not step more than 3 feet from the batter's box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average dropped five minutes last year to 2:47, but  
enforcement seems to have slackened this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Length of games has mostly increased over the years. In 1981,  
the average was 2:33.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Hit by Foul Ball in Dugout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer  
sustained cuts to the left jaw and ear when he was hit by a foul 
ball, and missed a few minutes of Tuesday night's playoff opener 
against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer was assisted out of the dugout after being struck by  
Chuck Knoblauch's foul in the fifth inning. The 68-year-old Zimmer 
returned with an icepack on his jaw while the Yankees were still 
batting, and joked with Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch lined a 2-1 pitch into the first-base dugout, and it  
struck Zimmer, who usually sits on the bench next to manager Joe 
Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was stopped for several minutes and, after Zimmer was  
helped off the floor, he was assisted back to the clubhouse by 
pitcher Andy Pettitte and assistant trainer Steve Donohue. 
Knoblauch crouched in the batter's box with a concerned look. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer managed the Yankees to a 21-15 record earlier this year  
while Torre recovered from prostate cancer surgery. Zimmer had 
talked of retirement during that time, hobbled by a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer twice had seasons ended by beanings, in 1953 at St. Paul  
and 1956 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in his 51st season in professional baseball. Zimmer, who  
coached for the Yankees in 1983 and 1986, rejoined the club as the 
bench coach in 1996, shortly after Torre was hired.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Jewell Was Public Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge has ruled that Richard Jewell was a  
public figure to a certain degree before The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution identified him as a suspect in the 1996 
Centennial Olympic Park bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling issued Tuesday means Jewell now has a tougher burden  
in proving the newspaper libeled him. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County State Court Judge John Mather said Jewell became a  
voluntary ``limited purpose'' public figure through media 
interviews he gave after he discovered a knapsack with the bomb. 
The interviews happened before he was identified by the newspaper 
as a suspect, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While news coverage alone would be insufficient to convert him  
to a public figure, plaintiff granted 11 interviews in which he not 
only related the events witnessed but also spoke repeatedly of the 
training which he and others had received, commented on park safety 
and encouraged the general public to return to the park,'' Mather 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell was working as a park security guard when the bomb  
exploded, killing one person and injuring more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was initially praised as a hero for his role in helping  
evacuate the park, he was then investigated by the FBI and 
identified as a suspect by the newspaper. The Justice Department 
cleared him three months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell sued the newspaper in January 1997, claiming he was  
libeled ``in a series of false and defamatory articles which 
portrayed him as an individual with a bizarre employment history 
and an aberrant personality who was likely guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's attorney, Peter Canfield, has said the reporting  
was accurate and has asked that Mather dismiss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	A private person claiming libel must prove a news organization  
was negligent in reporting information that was false and damaging. 
But a public figure must prove malice, which means a news 
organization knew or suspected it was reporting harmful falsehoods 
and acted with reckless disregard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell will probably appeal the ruling, said his attorney, Lin  
Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you sue a media defendant such as The Atlanta  
Journal-Constitution and Cox Enterprises, you know going in you 
have to climb a large mountain,'' Wood said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Looks To Liven Up Her Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watching her bankroll dwindle and her  
second-tier star on the national stage being eclipsed by Sen. John 
McCain, Elizabeth Dole will try to punch up her strategy and stake 
a claim to McCain's home turf in hope of winning back some 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Once-gentle Dole aides now make no pretense about the gritty  
battle Dole must wage to survive in a Republican presidential field 
dominated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush and enlivened, of late, by 
McCain and his best-selling memoir of his Vietnam war days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud the McCain people, they've gotten a good ride,''  
said Dole strategist Tony Fabrizio. But it's time for Dole to try 
and stop him, he added, since McCain's good publicity has yet to 
carry him above Dole in national horserace polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole travels Friday to McCain's home state of Arizona to  
showcase her endorsement by Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza. And she told 
aides Tuesday she wants to ``make a real splash'' with a 
get-tough-on-drugs speech scheduled for Thursday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is that we're not going to cede any territory,''  
said Dole spokeswoman Kathleen Harrington. ``We'll fight on as many 
fronts as we can with our opponents because we want to position 
ourselves as the principal alternative to George W. Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for McCain, Fabrizio said: ``Here's a guy who lost his  
governor's endorsement to George W. Bush and now his mayor to 
Elizabeth Dole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's campaign also wants it known that, despite favorable  
media coverage of McCain's book tour and the formal launch of his 
campaign last week, Dole is the only GOP candidate besides Bush to 
consistently score in double digits in national polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole followed a Sunday television talk show appearance, where  
she defended her commander-in-chief credentials against those of 
McCain, with a forceful national security speech Monday night in 
New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outwardly more aggressive strategy contrasts with  
murmurs in GOP circles about the longevity of her campaign. Except 
for a September speech on education that caught attention by 
calling for stern classroom discipline, Dole all but vanished from 
the national stage after her impressive third-place showing in an 
Iowa straw poll in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides recognize Dole's effort has not been sufficiently  
blockbuster for national coverage. They and their candidate focus 
instead on the enthusiastic reception Dole garners locally wherever 
she travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding unworried, campaign manager Thomas Daffron said the  
Iowa straw poll, in which a vastly outspent Dole placed third 
behind Bush and millionaire Steve Forbes, was the last real 
barometer that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dole's fund-raising over the past three months fell a  
disappointing $500,000 below her own goal, leaving her with just 
$850,000 in the bank as of Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reported $37 million in cash on hand. McCain, considered  
Dole's closest competition to be the also-ran moderate Republican 
after Bush, had $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Close associates privately have urged Dole to seriously consider  
dropping out of the race because of money woes. Both Harrington and 
Daffron described Dole as ``incensed'' by such talk and committed 
to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	At her northern Virginia headquarters on Tuesday, Dole named a  
13-person team -- 11 of them women -- to organize her campaign in 
Connecticut. She gave the go-ahead on five fund-raisers for the 
first week in November and another set of receptions for Nov. 
15-16. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-delayed ``kickoff'' rally in her hometown of Salisbury,  
N.C., is still in the works but Dole first wants to round out her 
issues portfolio with the speech on drug policy and another on 
taxes and the economy, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, she hopes to widen her advantage over McCain in  
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads the pack by a whopping 50-point-or-better margin, but  
Dole's well-recognized name so far has kept her above 10 points 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, where tradition favors the underdog and where  
McCain and Dole have staked their fortunes, both are in a 
statistical dead heat for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has shown the most progress in New York, where a Marist  
Institute poll released Tuesday gave him 16 percent of the vote -- 
second to Bush -- and Dole was third with 8 percent. The positions 
of McCain and Dole were reversed in this same statewide poll last 
month.

<HEADLINE> De Beers Won't Buy Angolan Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- De Beers will stop buying diamonds originating  
from Angola, except for those it has already contracted to 
purchase, the diamond mining and marketing giant announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it was also reviewing purchases from Guinea and  
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	De Beers managing director, Gary Ralfe, said the company acted  
to reinforce sanctions imposed by the United Nations against 
Angolan rebels. UNITA rebels have used Angolan diamonds, which can 
easily be identified by diamond experts, to finance their 
insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
	De Beers said it will continue to buy Angolan diamonds under its  
contract with SDM, a joint venture of the Angolan government and 
the Australian mining company Aston.

<HEADLINE> NCAA OKs Missouri Recruits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The NCAA on Tuesday declared two Missouri basketball recruits  
eligible to play at the school after investigating whether it broke 
any rules over the players' mothers accompanying them on a campus 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Mike Alden notified the NCAA last Friday that  
the university may have violated recruiting rules by allowing the 
mothers of Detroit basketball standouts Arthur Johnson and Rickey 
Paulding to join their sons on a chartered plane to Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	But a news release from the university late Tuesday night said  
they had been reinstated, ``conditioned upon additional 
remuneration, by the parents, to further account for a portion of 
the charter flight costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the statement, the university said it would appeal the terms.  
</P>
<P>
	``The university is grateful for the resolution of this issue,''  
it read. ``MU continues to accept full responsibility for its 
actions, but will appeal the terms of the reinstatement based on 
the punitive impact to the prospects' families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden didn't return phone calls from The Associated Press on  
Tuesday, and NCAA officials said they were prohibited by law from 
releasing the information to the public. The school must do that, 
an official said earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said the mothers of both Paulding and Johnson paid the  
university between $200 and $300 each for their tickets prior to 
flying from Detroit to Columbia Regional Airport Sept. 17 and 
returning Sept. 19. Alden said the university believed the NCAA 
rules allow a prospect to be accompanied on a noncommercial flight 
if the extra party paid fair market value for the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding and Johnson, both seniors, orally committed to Missouri  
last week, become new coach Quin Snyder's first recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	Paulding, a 6-foot-4 guard, averaged 25.6 points, 11.2 rebounds,  
4.0 assists and 3.0 blocked shots last season at Detroit 
Renaissance High. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a 6-9 forward, averaged 16.4 points last season at  
Detroit Pershing High.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks Cuts in Spending Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to replace their plan to slow  
income-support checks to the working poor, House Republicans are 
moving toward an alternative: across-the-board cuts in all spending 
bills. But the White House said that was a ``horrible idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an easy message,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said  
after Republicans held a private meeting Monday to discuss their 
budget fight with President Clinton. ``We go back home and say, `We 
have two choices, this or spending the Social Security trust 
fund.''' 
</P>
<P>
	However, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the GOP  
proposal would force drastic cuts in everything from medical 
research to the FBI and the battle against terrorism. ``It takes 
the worst elements of a lot of bad ideas into one really big, 
horrible idea,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have made paying for the new fiscal year's spending  
bills without eating into Social Security surpluses a central 
promise this year. 
</P>
<P>
	To claim $8.7 billion in savings for fiscal 2000, which began  
Friday, House Republicans last week proposed delaying some earned 
income tax credit checks for low-income families into fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP leaders began searching for an alternative after the  
plan drew criticism from Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the 
Republicans' front-running presidential contender, and continued 
opposition from Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said that while not explicitly calling the payment  
slowdown dead, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and other GOP 
leaders at Monday's meeting had implied that they needed to find an 
another source of savings. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, told  
Republicans they could find the $8.7 billion in savings by cutting 
all 13 annual spending bills enough to reach that total amount of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich's proposal would apply the cuts to defense spending --  
something not all Republicans like. The leaders made no final 
decisions, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bills control more than $550 billion. It would take  
a 2.7 percent cut to produce $8.7 billion in savings this year, 
since some of the savings would not take effect until later years, 
Kasich told them, lawmakers and aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The across-the-board cut idea is also popular among Senate  
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say it would let Republicans argue that the  
reductions are preferable to using Social Security surpluses, and 
to President Clinton's plan for paying for extra spending: Raising 
the federal tax on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	But since across-the-board reductions, by definition, would  
affect many programs, other Republicans say it would be easy for 
Clinton to portray them as recklessly cutting popular programs for 
children, the elderly and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republicans proposed that the 20 million people  
receiving the earned income tax credit get their money in 12 
monthly checks, rather the current lump sum most receive in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	That would have let lawmakers take credit for saving $8.7  
billion in fiscal 2000, which began Friday, because with the 
delays, that amount of money would have been paid after Oct. 1, 
2000 -- in fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the $8.7 billion cut, the House remained $1.2 billion  
short of savings, said one Republican aide, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	And Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., has  
told fellow Republican senators that they still need to find about 
$4 billion in savings for that chamber's spending bills to avoid 
draining Social Security surpluses, said another GOP aide who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2000, only four have  
been signed into law and one vetoed. Altogether, Clinton has 
threatened to veto six of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Senate voted 88-3 to send Clinton a $50 billion  
measure for transportation programs, with increased spending for 
highways, mass transit and aviation. Clinton is expected to sign 
that bill.

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Ready To Learn Triangle Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- The players in the drab gym worked  
on pivoting, setting picks and making layups all without a 
basketball. This was no junior high skills camp. It was Phil 
Jackson's first practice as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kobe Bryant described the experience as weird. Rick Fox likened  
it to being overanxious on the first day of school. But Shaquille 
O'Neal best summed up Tuesday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being at a boot camp with this general guy that you  
always see on TV beating people up,'' he said. ``You know if you 
don't want to get in trouble, just keep your mouth quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As training camps opened around the NBA on Tuesday, nobody was  
more eager than the Lakers to find out what the future holds. 
Jackson was hired in June to do what he did six times in eight 
years of coaching the Chicago Bulls -- win an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Bryant was especially enthusiastic about  
Jackson's style, even if he was still a bit confused. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple times I ran into my guy, a couple times Shaq ran into  
his guy, then after a while things started clicking,'' he said. 
``It's really fun because you're doing things that you really 
haven't done ever, especially in an NBA setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody complained about two hours of running, practicing moves  
without the ball and having partners for drills. And they would be 
back for another two hours in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty good so far,'' O'Neal said. ``Everybody was  
focused, everybody is willing to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what Jackson wants -- a team of open minds willing to  
relearn fundamentals they were either taught as youngsters or never 
thoroughly mastered playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to commit to it or submit to the fact that you're  
going to learn and you have to be flexible, be able to make 
mistakes and not feel embarrassed, not feel irritated, be 
patient,'' Jackson told a horde of reporters and TV cameras on the 
campus of UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won't begin playing seriously until later in the  
week. For now, Jackson wants them to grasp basic concepts like 
getting the ball up and down the floor and organizing in specific 
spots on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of like going around with blindfolds on, they're  
trying to figure out where to go and how to please the coaches,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when the gym was at its most quiet, the Lakers glimpsed a  
bit of Jackson's personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a funny guy,'' Bryant said. ``He'll be serious, then all  
of a sudden he'll just say something weird. He'll just lighten it 
up for a split second, then get things going again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal admitted he and some others had trouble with a few of the  
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reminds me of my father and (LSU coach) Dale Brown, where  
they teach you and they only say it once,'' he said of Jackson. 
``They say it crisp and they expect you to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Bryant found out, Jackson is quick to set players  
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you mess it up, he'll definitely tell you. If you're doing  
a good job, he'll pat you on the butt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So what did Jackson think of his new charges after one practice?  
</P>
<P>
	``There's about nine out of 10 ballplayers on this team that  
still have a long ways to go of being a complete player,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said a complete player doesn't ``just let their size or  
their athleticism be the motivating factor to their dominance on 
the floor, but that they use the subtleties of basketball to help 
not only themselves but their teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, the 7-foot center who lacks a championship after seven  
years in the NBA, doesn't think he'll have any problems living up 
to Jackson's ideas about sharing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teamwork is the key,'' he said. ``If there was a way for one  
person to do it by himself, I would have five rings already.''

	``A couple times I ran into my guy, a couple times Shaq ran into  
his guy, then after a while things started clicking,'' he said. 
``It's really fun because you're doing things that you really 
haven't done ever, especially in an NBA setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody complained about two hours of running, practicing moves  
without the ball and having partners for drills. And they would be 
back for another two hours in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty good so far,'' O'Neal said. ``Everybody was  
focused, everybody is willing to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what Jackson wants -- a team of open minds willing to  
relearn fundamentals they were either taught as youngsters or never 
thoroughly mastered playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``You got to commit to it or submit to the fact that you're  
going to learn and you have to be flexible, be able to make 
mistakes and not feel embarrassed, not feel irritated, be 
patient,'' Jackson told a horde of reporters and TV cameras on the 
campus of UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers won't begin playing seriously until later in the  
week. For now, Jackson wants them to grasp basic concepts like 
getting the ball up and down the floor and organizing in specific 
spots on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're kind of like going around with blindfolds on, they're  
trying to figure out where to go and how to please the coaches,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when the gym was at its most quiet, the Lakers glimpsed a  
bit of Jackson's personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a funny guy,'' Bryant said. ``He'll be serious, then all  
of a sudden he'll just say something weird. He'll just lighten it 
up for a split second, then get things going again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal admitted he and some others had trouble with a few of the  
drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reminds me of my father and (LSU coach) Dale Brown, where  
they teach you and they only say it once,'' he said of Jackson. 
``They say it crisp and they expect you to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as Bryant found out, Jackson is quick to set players  
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you mess it up, he'll definitely tell you. If you're doing  
a good job, he'll pat you on the butt,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So what did Jackson think of his new charges after one practice?  
</P>
<P>
	``There's about nine out of 10 ballplayers on this team that  
still have a long ways to go of being a complete player,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said a complete player doesn't ``just let their size or  
their athleticism be the motivating factor to their dominance on 
the floor, but that they use the subtleties of basketball to help 
not only themselves but their teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, the 7-foot center who lacks a championship after seven  
years in the NBA, doesn't think he'll have any problems living up 
to Jackson's ideas about sharing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teamwork is the key,'' he said. ``If there was a way for one  
person to do it by himself, I would have five rings already.''

<HEADLINE> Agassi Wins at Swiss Indoors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- World No. 1 Andre Agassi, the French  
and U.S. Open champion, began his bid for another title Tuesday, 
beating Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands 6-3, 6-4 at the Swiss 
Indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, seeking his fifth title of the year, dominated from the  
start, his scintillating serve largely responsible for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi opened the match with a love service game before serving  
three successive aces, then breaking to take a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second set, Agassi waited until 5-4 before breaking the  
Dutchman, still winless this season. The struggling Siemerink has 
slipped from 19th to 94th over the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jan is a tough opponent. It's very deceiving,'' said Agassi,  
the losing finalist to Tim Henman last year. ``He makes you take 
tough shots, good shots early in the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's left-handed and I haven't played a lefty in quite a  
while. It's not always easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round matches, Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev, who  
lost to Agassi in the French Open final, rallied to beat Russia's 
Marat Safin 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). Medvedev, ranked 34th, is seeking 
his first title of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	American qualifier Chris Woodruff upset Austria's Stefan Koubek  
3-6, 6-2, 6-2 and Slovakia's Karol Kucera defeated Sweden's Thomas 
Johansson 7-5, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Sex-Change Doctor Guilty of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A doctor whose license was suspended 22 years  
ago for performing shoddy sex-change operations was convicted of 
second-degree murder Tuesday in the death of a man who had a 
healthy leg amputated to satisfy a sexual fetish. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ronald Brown could face life imprisonment. Sentencing was  
set for Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 77, amputated the leg of Philip Bondy, a New York man who  
paid Brown $10,000 for the operation in May 1998. Bondy, 79, died 
of gangrene poisoning in a suburban San Diego hotel two days after 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	New York psychologist Gregg Furth testified during the two-week  
trial that he and Bondy contacted Brown as a last resort to fulfill 
lifelong desires to amputate their legs. They shared a fetish known 
as apotemnophilia, getting sexual gratification from the removal of 
a limb. 
</P>
<P>
	Furth paid Brown to amputate one of his legs last year but  
changed his mind, in part, because he saw a Mexican doctor who was 
to assist in the surgery walk into the clinic carrying a butcher 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Sheldon Sherman argued that Brown was guilty  
only of operating on the fringe and providing ``help for the 
weirdos'' because traditional doctors wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one would deal with these transsexuals. They are a cancer  
and a plague on society. We don't want to deal with them. John 
Brown was willing to deal with them,'' Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Stacy Running said Brown ``just chopped off''  
Bondy's leg below the knee and then dumped him at a hotel to 
recuperate alone while he buried the leg in the desert to hide the 
evidence from Mexican clinic inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bondy called Brown the next day, complaining that he was  
bleeding and oozing from the stump, Running said. Brown returned to 
the hotel, rewrapped the leg and suggested Bondy take more pain 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown did not perform a preoperative examination on Bondy, which  
would have revealed pneumonia and past heart operations, Running 
said. Coupled with Bondy's age, he was a risky candidate for 
surgery, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who lost his medical license in 1977, was convicted in  
1989 in San Francisco for an unsuccessful scalp surgery to shift 
the hairline of a man during a sex-change operation. Brown served 
three years and then moved to San Ysidro at the U.S.-Mexico border 
to start his underground medical practice again. 
</P>
<P>
	He conducted business from his home and operated at clinics in  
Tijuana, Mexico, Running said.

<HEADLINE> Car Drives Into Lake Mich., 3 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- By the time officers arrived, it was too late:  
The car with a mother and two of her children inside had sunk in 
about 17 feet of water after plunging into Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we saw was bubbles coming up,'' Officer Frank Guerrero  
said, recounting the scene he and other officers encountered Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the car veered off Lake Shore Drive, went slowly  
down some steps and paused before suddenly accelerating and diving 
into Monroe Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, police were investigating whether Shirley Combest  
intentionally drove her car into the dark, 59-degree water, killing 
herself, 8-year-old Shaniqua and 6-year-old John. 
</P>
<P>
	Police suspect it was a murder-suicide, in part because family  
members say the 33-year-old mother had a history of depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Combest had been under a doctor's care for depression a few  
months ago, said her mother, Ruthie Mae Combest. She said her 
daughter also was grieving over the death of an older sister in a 
car accident last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was taking it awful hard,'' the mother said.  
</P>
<P>
	But all Guerrero and Officer Edward Tribe knew Monday night was  
that people in the car were dying. With little time to think, they 
pulled off their boots and blue police sweaters, took off their 
guns and dove in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got children, much older; they're the most precious thing  
I have.... That was about the first thing I thought of,'' Tribe 
said. ``I thought maybe there was a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both officers, overcome by the cold, had to be pulled out by  
other officers. Police divers got the victims out an hour later.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesia Military Marks Army Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian military celebrated its  
54th anniversary today in the shadow of the East Timor crisis and 
ahead of the selection of a new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Children in the red and white of the Indonesian flag sang  
nationalist songs while performers in bright costumes interpreted 
Javanese mythology through dance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of troops in fatigues, representing all branches of the  
military, marched and saluted President B.J. Habibie and Gen. 
Wiranto, the defense minister and leader of the military. Wiranto, 
like many Indonesians, uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie has been trying hard to keep his job, but his popularity  
has sunk as one crisis after another has hit since he took office 
in May 1998. A special assembly of legislators and government 
appointees will chose the next president on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Habibie wants the assembly to adopt sweeping changes to  
Indonesia's 1945 constitution, including adoption of direct, 
popular election of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	At today's celebrations, he called on the army to maintain  
security and avoid excessive violence, but made no mention of East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian troops have been widely blamed for participating in a  
violent purge in the territory after residents voted overwhelmingly 
on Aug. 30 to separate from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	There has also been criticism at home for the way troops and  
police have handled demonstrations. Seven people died in two days 
of protests in Jakarta recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Violence has become almost uncontrollable'' in Indonesia,  
Habibie said, calling on the army and police to use restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	The military and police hold 38 nonelected seats in the  
700-member People's Consultative Assembly. Because none of the 
three parties fielding candidates for president have enough seats 
to win a majority on their own, those seats could be enough to sway 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul Harris Nasution, a former general and the father of the  
``dual function'' doctrine that gives the army a place in politics, 
said the military's powers are excessive and the concept should be 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto and other generals said Monday that the army would  
remain neutral during the election process. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiranto issued a five-point decree to the military Monday  
calling for increased cooperation with the public.

<HEADLINE> Case Keeps Sprewell Away From Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell stayed away from  
training camp for another day Tuesday, surprising the New York 
Knicks by waiting out the verdict in his civil suit in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent had originally told the Knicks he would join  
the team following closing arguments in the trial, but the player 
then decided to wait for the jury to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not present in court, however, when the verdict came in.  
There were no punitive damages, although Sprewell must pay $105,000 
to two people who were injured in a car accident that he admittedly 
caused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we just hope he's here soon, and hopefully we'll hear  
soon what his plans are,'' general manager Scott Layden said 
following an evening practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, did not return numerous phone  
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the team went through a 3-hour, 40-minute practice  
Tuesday morning, followed by another long workout in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-a-day practices will continue through Friday, with the team  
flying back to New York following Saturday morning's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody with the Knicks knew exactly what to think Tuesday  
afternoon following the first practice. Sprewell failed to take a 
red-eye flight from the Bay area to the East Coast, which would 
have enabled him to be in Charleston by the morning, and Layden was 
only able to exchange phone messages with Sprewell's 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him here as soon as possible,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy  
said. ``Until I can talk to him, I don't know what the situation 
is. So I'm going to wait, talk to him and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the afternoon, Layden found out that Sprewell had  
decided to wait out the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's different from what we were told earlier,''  
he said. ``The attorney felt it was very important, almost 
critical, that he be there when it was with the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was sued by Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma Feliciano, 54,  
of Antioch, Calif., whose car overturned when Sprewell tried to 
drive his Mercedes-Benz back onto a freeway from an exit lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was  
sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he served under electronic home 
detention in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs asked for $450,000 in actual damages, plus two  
months of his $9 million salary for the upcoming season in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's attorney said the plaintiffs were trying to make  
minor injuries seem major and asked the jury to award $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas was awarded about $75,000 for economic and non-economic  
damages. Feliciano was awarded $30,000, mostly in economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a matter of someone trying to get some money off a  
professional athete again,'' teammate Chris Childs said. ``I'm glad 
he got off and is able to go on with his life. to go through what 
he's been through the last couple of years, whenever he gets here 
it's understandable by his teammates.''

<HEADLINE> Former Sooners All-American Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPIRO, Okla. (AP) -- Rod Shoate, whose speed and strength helped  
make him a two-time All-American linebacker at Oklahoma during the 
1970s, has died after a long illness. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoate died Monday at his home, where he farmed with his family.  
</P>
<P>
	Shoate earned All-American honors in 1973 and 1974. He later  
played with the New England Patriots and in the United States 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
	During Shoate's playing days, Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer  
called him ``the best linebacker to don a Sooner uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Oklahoma, Shoate had 420 career tackles, ranking him third on  
the school's career list. He led the team in tackles in 1972, 1973 
and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	He played for Sooners teams that went 29-4-1 and won the 1974  
national championship. Shoate finished seventh in the Heisman 
Trophy voting as a senior in 1974 and was one of four finalists for 
the Lombardi Award that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoate was drafted in the second round by the Patriots in 1975.  
He played in 76 games with the Patriots, starting 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoate was traded to the Chicago Bears in 1982 and released  
before the start of the season. He played in the USFL for New 
Jersey in 1983 and Memphis in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Services are scheduled Thursday at Mt. Triumph Baptist Church in  
nearby Fort Coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoate is survived by his parents, Levester and Lula Shoate of  
Fort Coffee, five sisters and five brothers.

	SHOP AROUND: That's the advice of Consumer Reports magazine for  
people with prescriptions to fill but whose health insurance 
doesn't cover medications. Consumer Reports compared the prices for 
commonly-prescribed drugs and found a big disparity among the 
amounts charged by drugstore chains, independent pharmacists, 
supermarkets, mass retailers like Wal-Mart and online or mail-order 
pharmacies. For example, a prescription for the anti-allergy drug 
Claritin averaged $60 at online and mail-order druggists and $84 at 
independent drugstores. The antibiotic Biaxin cost $46 online and 
through the mail, was $57 in drugstore chains and $59 at the 
independents. However, the magazine noted, while order through the 
Internet or mail generally will give you the best deal, if you're 
looking for extra service and face-to-face contact with the 
pharmacist, an independent store may be the place for you to shop.

	HALLOWEEN BUDGETS: With each year, Halloween is becoming a

are growing accordingly. A survey by American Express found 
consumers will spend an average of $98 on Halloween candy, 
decorations and costumes for themselves and their children, up from 
$81 last year. Of that amount, $30 will be spent on candy, $22 on 
costumes, $16 on pumpkins, $11 on other decorations, $11 to attend 
parties or other functions and $8 on home entertaining. The survey 
found Snickers is the candy most likely to be handed out to 
trick-or-treaters, followed by candy corn, Reese's Peanut Butter 
Cups and Tootsie Rolls, Hershey's and M&AMP;Ms.

	A MARKETER'S DREAM: For years, the common wisdom was that people  
ages 18-34 made up the primary group for marketers to target. Some 
marketers aimed for a larger and somewhat older group, ages 18-49. 
But there is growing evidence that people age 50 and over with time 
and disposable income represent a great marketing opportunity, 
particularly when it comes to the leisure and sporting industries. 
The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association reports that sales of 
exercise equipment to people between the ages of 45 and 64 rose 53 
percent in 1998. The trade association also notes a proliferation 
of clubs and groups for older people interested in fitness, and 
reports that people over 50 spend more time at health clubs than 
younger people do. The most popular fitness or athletic activities 
for older Americans are aquatic exercise, followed by fitness 
walking, golf, stationary cycling and cross-country skiing.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Union Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore won endorsement Tuesday  
by the nation's second-largest teachers' union for his steadfast 
opposition to private-school vouchers. But the AFL-CIO's bigger 
prize remained an agonizingly open question for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	With the AFL-CIO biennial convention looming next week, the  
Teamsters union stood ready to resist Gore's once-certain early nod 
from the federation. But labor and political operatives close to 
the wrangling said they believed Gore would overcome such 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a position that it's too early,'' said Teamsters  
political director Mike Mathis. ``This is not an anti-Al Gore 
thing. But there's still so much gray area out there on worker 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the United Auto Workers, Machinists, Food and  
Commercial Workers, and International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers also have signaled some reservations to backing Gore this 
early in a tightening Democratic nomination race with Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several leaders who have questioned an early endorsement  
of Gore have indicated to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney that they 
would be willing to support the vice president at the convention if 
Sweeney pushed for a vote, according to the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all boils down to John Sweeney and whether he will push  
it through,'' said Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney did not tip his hand, telling The Washington Post: ``We  
are going through a process. ... There are some people who think we 
should take a little longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A final decision wasn't expected until after the union  
presidents who comprise the federation's executive council meet 
Friday in advance of the convention, which convenes in Los Angeles 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley continue to fight intensively for the  
endorsement. Neither was scheduled to address the convention, but 
both were planning to be in California with open space on their 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive council of the American Federation of Teachers,  
which represents nearly a million teachers, mostly in the nation's 
largest school districts, overwhelmingly endorsed Gore on Tuesday. 
There was one abstention among the 38 members, said spokesman 
Gregory King. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very positive endorsement of Al Gore on the record,  
not an endorsement against anyone,'' said Sandra Feldman, president 
of the AFT, who said the endorsement has support from the larger 
membership, which was polled earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, like the teachers unions, opposes voucher programs.  
Bradley has voted for school voucher experiments but has said he 
doesn't believe they are the solution to fundamental problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said the endorsement is more about supporting Gore and  
less about punishing Bradley: ``We're not using that (the voucher 
issue) as a single-issue litmus test at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Republican presidential candidates favor voucher  
programs. Front-runner George W. Bush has steadily touted vouchers, 
which in some parts of the country are providing public money for 
private education. In a speech Tuesday, he suggested money from the 
nation's largest federal education program could be used to fund 
state voucher programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said, ``We expect  
(Texas) Governor Bush to receive many endorsements from individual 
teachers but we are not surprised that an entrenched organization 
that has defended the status quo would endorse Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association, the nation's largest  
teachers' union with 2.4 million members, may issue an endorsement 
as early as Friday, said spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley have fought for the favor of the traditional  
Democrat stronghold of organized labor, with Bradley waging a 
tougher-than-expected challenge to Gore's institutional support. 
Gore allies have been pushing for the AFL-CIO endorsement since 
February, and the Bradley camp claims a small victory in 
forestalling them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly making a case to labor and have throughout the  
campaign, said Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser. ``They 
haven't made an endorsement yet; we'll keep making a case.''

	The AFT nod, some observers say, may have come early in an  
attempt to prod its parent organization, the AFL-CIO, and other

happen,'' said Feldman.

	Late Tuesday, Gore's campaign said he had won endorsement by the

statewide.''

<HEADLINE> Manuscript Thief Charged in Conn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A man convicted of stealing papers signed  
by Thomas Edison and Thomas Jefferson has pleaded innocent to 
trying to pawn the documents to an antiques dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Spiegelman, 35, entered the plea Monday in Superior Court  
to charges that he tried to sell $250,000 worth of pilfered papers. 
He was is federal custody Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman, of New York City, was convicted of stealing $1.3  
million worth of historical documents from Columbia University's 
Rare Collection Library in 1994 and sentenced to a five years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the items in the collection were recovered by the FBI,  
but Spiegelman apparently hid some of what he stole. Police say 
Spiegelman tried to sell rare and historically significant 
documents signed by Edison and Jefferson as well as James Monroe 
and Andrew Jackson at Alexander Autographs Inc. in Greenwich. 
</P>
<P>
	The store's owner called police Friday after he recognized that  
what Spiegelman had for sale matched the items stolen from the 
Columbia library. Spiegelman used an alias while trying to make the 
deal, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman was arrested Friday and charged with first-degree  
larceny, third-degree forgery, criminal impersonation and 
interfering with an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman was still serving time under his federal sentence  
when he was arrested. He was living under federal supervision at a 
halfway house.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A season-ending injury to 1998 league MVP Terrell  
Davis is forcing the Denver Broncos to adjust their backfield, and 
the changes might not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to pull the winless Broncos out of an unprecedented  
tailspin, Denver coach Mike Shanahan is seriously considering 
replacing starting quarterback Brian Griese. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to do something since we're 0-4. Exactly  
what we're going to do, I can't tell you because I don't know right 
now,'' Shanahan said Monday. ``We'll definitely look at a few 
different things to shake the team up and see if we can get back on 
the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's train wreck of a season took another wrong turn Sunday  
when Davis tore two ligaments in his right knee while making a 
tackle after an interception in the first quarter of a 21-13 loss 
to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis is scheduled to have reconstructive surgery in the next 10  
days to repair the anterior cruciate ligament, the medial 
collateral ligament and cartilage. The recovery time is 4-6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, my spirits are high,'' Davis said in an interview  
on ABC's ``Monday Night Football.'' ``I know I'll be back 100 
percent and I'll be as good as new. The type of person I am, my 
mentality, I'm a workhorse and I just want to get back and play 
with my teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' injury is the same one suffered by Atlanta running back  
Jamal Anderson in the first week of the season, leaving the NFL's 
two top rushers from a year ago out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he's working through it right now,'' Shanahan said.  
``I said, `Hey, I love you. You've done everything we've asked you 
to do. Just hang in there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming the fourth player in NFL history to run for 2,000  
yards in a season last year, Davis was faced with the challenge of 
succeeding without quarterback John Elway, who retired in May. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 211 yards on 67 carries in Denver's four games. He  
averaged 3.1 yards per rush, 1.7 yards below his career average. 
</P>
<P>
	In Davis' absence, the Broncos will turn to Derek Loville, whose  
last stint as a starter was with San Francisco in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want it this way,'' Loville said. ``I'd rather be 0-6  
and have Terrell in there. That's my man. ... I spoke to him when 
he was getting a little treatment. He said, `Hey, you've got to be 
a soldier.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers figure to be operating under a different platoon  
leader this Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching Griese struggle through four games, Shanahan said  
he is worried about damaging the second-year quarterback's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said he will decide by Wednesday whether to stick with  
Griese or replace him with either Bubby Brister or Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's tough any time you're 0-4 and you're the  
quarterback,'' Shanahan said. ``The pressure that you have in this 
town is overwhelming. For a young guy to come in, especially with 
the success that we've had, I think it does mount on you. I am 
worried about him. It's a lot to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, 4-0 as an emergency starter last year, was Elway's  
anointed successor in training camp, but lost his job in the 
preseason. He said he felt blindsided by the move at the time and 
had no comment Monday on a possible promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller spent the last three seasons out of football after a  
series of concussions. He said he supports Griese, but would 
welcome a chance to help the Broncos as they try to salvage their 
season in the wake of consecutive Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main thing is we all just want to get a win,''  
Miller said. ``That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese had no comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The unstable quarterback situation and Davis' injury are the  
latest obstacles that have impeded the Broncos since they won their 
second straight Super Bowl in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's expected retirement announcement came in May, and  
linebacker John Mobley was charged with drunken driving nearly two 
months later. Mobley's season ended in Week 1 when he tore the ACL 
in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's off-field problems continued in September when  
linebacker Bill Romanowski was named as a subject in an 
investigation into illegal drug prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, the Broncos are off to the worst start for a  
defending Super Bowl champion in a non-strike year. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it rains it pours,'' Loville said. ``It's been tough.  
It's been tough this whole year -- losing John, now losing Terrell. 
It's rough''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Play Down Games Vs. Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Who are these Cleveland Indians who went 4-8  
with a .236 batting average against the Boston Red Sox?. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly not the fearsome Indians who are one of only seven  
teams in major league history to score more than 1,000 runs in a 
season. And definitely not the determined Indians the Red Sox 
expect to see in the division series starting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what? Those games are already played, those days are  
gone,'' Boston Game 1 starter Pedro Martinez said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the days when Cleveland's Manny Ramirez managed just  
three RBIs in eight games against Boston. He had 162 RBIs in his 
other 139 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the days when Boston's Nomar Garciaparra hit. 451  
with five homers in 12 games against Cleveland. He hit 22 homers in 
his other 123 games and led the AL with a .357 average. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just happens,'' Garciaparra said of his success against  
Cleveland. ``I don't even know what I've done statistically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics show just how meaningless regular season performances  
can be. The Red Sox were 8-3 against the Indians last season then 
lost the division series to them 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	End of discussion.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would probably make a difference if you were 0-12,'' said  
Mike Stanley, who hit .281 this season but .344 against Cleveland. 
``But we know they're a tough team. They scored 1,000 runs this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a lot of talent and there are games that they lose  
during the regular season you wonder why they lose them,'' John 
Valentin said, ``but I think in the playoffs they're going to be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nicked up left side of Boston's infield, Valentin and  
Garciaparra, should be ready. Valentin was on the disabled list 
from Aug. 31 to Sept. 23 with tendinitis in his left knee. 
Garciaparra missed the last five games with a bruised right wrist 
after he was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, after his first workout since he played in the  
wild-card clincher last Wednesday in Chicago, he was as eager to 
talk about his condition as he is to strike out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' Garciaparra said repeatedly, his eyes looking  
past his questioners and his wrist wrapped in ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took batting practice today and he stayed out there for the  
complete round,'' manager Jimy Williams said. ``He's going to play. 
But is he 100 percent? No. But I don't think anybody in either 
dugout is 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is taking precautions in case the wrist gets worse. In  
fact, Valentin's knee and the health of starters Bret Saberhagen, 
Ramon Martinez and Kent Mercker influenced Williams' roster 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen has been pitching with a cranky shoulder, Ramon  
Martinez missed more than a year following shoulder surgery and 
Mercker spent 16 days on the disabled list last month with a 
strained rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	So Williams kept 11 pitchers instead of the 10 he went with a  
year ago and is carrying two spare infielders, Donnie Sadler and 
Lou Merloni. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're quite a dropoff from Garciaparra, who has a .392  
career average against the Indians. He's not the only Boston hitter 
who enjoys facing Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Troy O'Leary hit .280 this season but .353 against the Indians.  
Jose Offerman, a .294 hitter, hit .347 against them. As a team, 
Boston hit .278 this season, but .300 against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The dominance extended to the pitching staff. The Indians are  
just 6-for-84, an .071 batting average, against relievers Derek 
Lowe, Rheal Cormier, Rich Garces, Rod Beck, John Wasdin and Tom 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians averaged 6.2 runs per game but only 4.5 against the  
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of year, you have to delete all that stuff,''  
Boston's Darren Lewis said. ``You can break it down and analyze the 
numbers any way you want, but this time of year, anything can 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the Red Sox found out at this time last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we beat them quite a bit last year, too, during the  
regular season,'' Garciaparra said. ``Then we went home early. So 
it's irrelevant.''

	Annan Wants UN Force in E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With East Timor's government structures  
destroyed, the U.N. chief outlined a plan to take control and 
protect the territory with a 9,000-strong peacekeeping force. ``The 
situation in East Timor is critical,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
said in a report outlining his proposals to send in U.N. 
peacekeepers until the territory becomes independent in about two 
to three years. U.N. troops would replace the Australian-led force 
sent last month to rein in rampaging pro-Indonesian militias after 
the vote for independence.

	Japan Co. To Pay for Nuke Damages  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese company promised Tuesday to pay damages  
for the victims of the country's worst nuclear accident, which 
exposed dozens of people to radiation and forced hundreds of 
thousands of others to stay indoors. Government investigators again 
searched the offices of the plant's operator, JCO Co., and the 
plant site 70 miles northeast of Tokyo to look for evidence of 
wrongdoing behind Thursday's disaster, which sent three workers to 
the hospital. The authorities reportedly suspect negligence and 
violation of rules.

	House Approves Foreign Aid Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House narrowly passed a $12.6 billion  
fiscal 2000 foreign aid bill today that the White House has 
threatened to veto on grounds that it shortchanges vital 
international programs. The bill was approved 214-211, all but 
ensuring that a veto would be sustained. The Senate has yet to take 
up the bill. 

</P>
<P>
	Annan Says UN Needs Reform  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today  
the U.N. still has too many administrators and rules, and too 
little money. Member countries, primarily the United States, owed 
the United Nations more than $2 billion, he said. Unpaid dues and 
bureaucratic delays have made it virtually impossible for the U.N. 
to respond quickly to crises like those in Kosovo and East Timor, 
he said.

	UAW Sets Deadline for Ford Talks  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers today in effect set a  
strike deadline of 3:30 p.m. Friday against Ford Motor Co., saying 
it would not extend its contract beyond then -- a sign talks could 
be intensifying. A spokesman for Ford said the union made the 
decision and talks recessed for the day. Negotiations on a new 
contract to cover about 100,000 employees were scheduled to resume 
tomorrow.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal prosecutors say $7 billion from Russia  
was illegally funneled through accounts at the Bank of New York in 
one of the largest money laundering cases in U.S. history. Three 
individuals and three companies were charged with channelling the 
money -- believed to have ties to the Russian mafia -- in the first 
criminal charges to be brought in the case. The Bank of New York, 
the nation's 15th-largest bank, was not named in the indictments.

	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- The Mexican government declared a  
state of emergency Tuesday in four states where the worst flooding

<HEADLINE> East Timorese Line Up for Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Thousands of destitute East Timorese  
lined up patiently under the burning sun today for the largest food 
handout since foreign peacekeepers arrived in the wrecked capital 
of Dili 15 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers distributed 13,000 110-pound bags of rice to families  
-- enough to feed 60,000 people for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds came down from the mountains where they had been hiding  
for weeks, and many more came from a nearby encampment of shacks 
made of plastic tarpaulins and cardboard boxes. They formed a long 
line outside the torched seafront home of Bishop Carlos Belo, East 
Timor's spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of East Timor's 800,000 people lost their homes when  
pro-Indonesian militias, backed by some segments of Indonesia's 
military, went on a bloody rampage following an Aug. 30 vote to 
become independent of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lists of the needy were drafted by the Roman Catholic Church and  
East Timor's main independence group and the bags were handed over 
to women after each registered. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our experience around the world, when you give it to the  
women, the entire family will benefit,'' said Lise Grande, a U.N. 
humanitarian relief coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will help everyone, we really need it,'' said  
Jose de Barilo, 59, in line with his wife. He and his family live 
in a tent not far from Belo's house. Belo, who fled at the height 
of violence in early September, is expected to arrive in East Timor 
as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the wave of killings and arson, thousands of people fled  
into the mountains. Thousands more were sent by planes and ships to 
neighboring West Timor, which remains an Indonesian province. Many 
say they were forced to leave by militiaman and Indonesian 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations planned to start bringing back the refugees  
from West Timor on Friday, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The first airlift likely will involve 100 people at most, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the head of the international peacekeeping force said  
he had written to Indonesian commanders to demand that four of 
their officers be returned to Dili as part of the investigation 
into the slaying of a Dutch journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove declined to name the four officers or  
describe them as suspects. He said they were wanted ``to assist in 
the inquiry into the criminal matters'' related to the death of 
Sander Thoenes and an assault the same day on two other 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoenes, a correspondent for the Financial Times and The  
Christian Science Monitor, was shot in suburban Dili on Sept. 21 -- 
a day after the first peacekeepers arrived -- by men reportedly in 
Indonesian uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, peacekeeper commanders tried to convince both the  
pro-Indonesian militias and rebels who fought for independence to 
hand in their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Mark Kelly, the peacekeepers' chief of staff, said today he  
had asked the local Indonesian army commander to arrange a meeting 
with militia leaders, many of whom have fled to West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said he met Monday with leaders from the Falintil rebel  
group. The two sides agreed that the rebels would keep their 
weapons for the time being but would not be allowed to take them 
outside designated base camps. Later, they would disarm, Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said a child was killed in the  
eastern part of the country and two more were wounded when a hand 
grenade they found exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	The region of East Timor near the border with the west was a  
stronghold for the anti-independence militias, and a helicopter 
overflight by peacekeepers today gave some idea of the destruction 
they wreaked on towns in the area during their rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	From the air, Maliana, a major market town in the central  
highlands 40 miles southwest of the territory's capital, Dili, 
appeared completely destroyed. Not a single person could be seen in 
the town, which once had some 15,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Batugade, most houses were reduced to empty shells  
with blackened timbers sticking out at crazy angles. Farm animals 
roamed freely through fields and rice paddies. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers have reached Batugade and the coastal town of  
Balibo and are gradually working further inland to Maliana. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred yards off Balibo, a badly decomposed body was  
seen floating in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights workers say militiamen and Indonesian soldiers  
executed dozens of men they suspected of supporting the 
independence movement and dumped their bodies at sea.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Utility Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two major Michigan utilities are combining in a  
$2.6 billion deal that will create the state's largest electric and 
gas company. 
</P>
<P>
	DTE Energy Co., parent of Detroit Edison Co., will buy MCN  
Energy Group Inc., parent of Michigan Consolidated Gas Co., for 
$28.50 per share in cash and stock. DTE will also assume about $2 
billion in MCN debt in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, DTE Energy, will remain based in Detroit and  
have more than 3 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is a home run. It creates an energy powerhouse in  
the Midwest,'' said Anthony Earley Jr., DTE president and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Frederick Schultz of Raymond James &AMP; Associates  
said the combination was good for both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes DTE a big regional combination utility. Now they have  
the summer-peaking electric earnings and the winter-peaking gas 
earnings,'' he said Tuesday from his Houston office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Heim, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, Inc. in St.  
Louis, said the arrangement ``seems to make good strategic sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors pushed shares of MCN up $5.87 1/2 to $23.56 1/4, while  
dropping shares of DTE $3.87 1/2 to $33.12 1/2 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have already approved the deal,  
which is subject to approval from shareholders and regulators. The 
utilities together will have about 11,500 employees when the 
transaction is complete, expected in six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	DTE expects to trim its work force by about 500 jobs as it cuts  
$60 million in costs by eliminating overlap, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the job cuts are expected to come through attrition, early  
retirement, voluntary buyouts and decreased hiring, said MCN 
chairman Alfred Glancy III, who will retire when the deal is 
complete but join the DTE board. 
</P>
<P>
	Deregulation is fueling the deal, as well as others in the  
industry, by increasing competition, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other recent utility mergers, Illinois-based Commonwealth  
Edison's parent is seeking a combination with Philadelphia-based 
PECO Energy Co. to create a company with 5 million customers in two 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co. is buying Florida Progress Corp. for  
$5.3 billion, creating the nation's ninth-largest electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
	DTE will be able to market coal, gas and electricity in the  
region and to compete more effectively in the development of new 
power plants and distributed generation, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
	And DTE will keep an eye out for more acquisitions.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's going to be much easier to expand,'' Earley said.  
``We will look for growth opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the transaction is complete, DTE will serve 2.1 million  
electric customers and 1.2 million natural gas customers in 
Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Braves, Astros Ready for series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves relaxed in front on their  
television sets, wondering who they would play today. The Houston 
Astros sat on a runway, wondering if their plane would fly east or 
west? 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 o'clock Monday night, both teams finally got the  
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Central champion Astros, their travel plans in shambles  
because of a wild-card playoff game in Cincinnati, didn't learn 
they would play the Braves in the best-of-5 division series until 
the Reds lost 5-0 to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent the New Yorkers to Arizona, while the Astros turned  
their charter jet eastward and headed toward Atlanta to meet the 
team that has eight straight division titles and baseball's best 
record at 103-59. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I wouldn't want to play a game after flying to Arizona  
or coming here,'' Braves MVP candidate Chipper Jones said. ``That 
takes a toll on your body. It usually takes a day or two to 
regroup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the Braves got to a plane was Javy Lopez's  
remote-control version. 
</P>
<P>
	When rain wiped out a scheduled workout at Turner Field, the  
injured Atlanta catcher broke out his model aircraft, the stadium's 
vast expanse giving him plenty of room for a series of twisting, 
spinning maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (19-9), who will start the opener for Atlanta  
against Shane Reynolds (16-14), spent the night watching videos 
from his recent performances against both Houston and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cincinnati had won the playoff, Atlanta would have met the  
Reds and Houston would have played Arizona in the other division 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer to know,'' Maddux said earlier Monday. ``But I  
would prefer there be no traffic when I come to the park, too. It's 
really not that big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not after what the Braves went through this year. They lost  
cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg before 
opening day, while Lopez and pitchers Odalis Perez and Rudy Seanez 
went down during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a grittier, guttier team,'' Jones said. ``We're not  
going to pop anybody's eyes out. We don't have the firepower of 
some of our other teams. But we do the little things to score 
runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every year about this time, the Braves face questions about  
their lack of postseason success. Despite eight straight 
appearances -- three more than any team in baseball history -- they 
have won just one World Series title in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the dark cloud that always hangs over the Braves,''  
said Brian Jordan, who brought emotion to the clubhouse, not to 
mention a career-high 115 RBIs. ``Hopefully, this is the year we 
get the breaks and finally win another world championship. If not, 
we've still exceeded our expectations this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston clinched its third straight NL Central title on the  
final day of the regular season, finishing one game ahead of 
Cincinnati. The Astros have been quickly eliminated in their last 
two playoff trips, a sweep by Atlanta in 1997 and a 3-1 loss to San 
Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year it was new and maybe a little overwhelming.  
Last year we weren't able to do a lot,'' manager Larry Dierker 
said. ``This year, all we're ready to do is go out and play the 
best baseball we can. If it's 3-0 again, well, we're going to give 
it our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros didn't seem concerned about their late-night travel  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't bother them,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker  
said. ``I don't think anything can happen to this club that hasn't 
already happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Braves, Houston survived a devastating medical report.  
Moises Alou missed the entire season, while Derek Bell and Ken 
Caminiti were plagued by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the underdogs and maybe that's good,'' Reynolds said.  
``Everyone expects them to win, so let them have all the 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros went 1-6 against the Braves during the regular  
season, including a three-game sweep at the Turner Field, site of 
Games 1 and 2. The series shifts to Astrodome on Friday for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Houston's 20-game winners, Jose Lima (21-10), faces  
Kevin Millwood (18-7, 2.68 ERA) in Wednesday's game. Cy Young 
contender Mike Hampton (22-4) follows for the Astros against last 
year's Cy Young winner, Tom Glavine (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit for the Braves' success must go to manager  
Bobby Cox, who businesslike demeanor was criticized in the past, 
but served the team well when one player after another went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby didn't panic,'' Millwood said. ``We just went about our  
business the way we always have.''

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Baron's Relative Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) -- The granddaughter of a Hungarian baron filed  
a lawsuit against that country's government Tuesday, demanding the 
return of family art treasures seized by invading Nazis a 
half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in Budapest, follows three years of  
unproductive negotiations, said the plaintiff, Martha Nierenberg of 
Armonk. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept stalling and stalling and stalling,'' she said in an  
interview. ``I'm 75 years old and as it is with these things, they 
were just waiting for me to give up, to go away, to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called the paintings ``the last prisoners of World War II.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sandor Beer, the Hungarian consul in New York, said he had not  
seen the suit and had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg is the granddaughter of Baron Maurice Herzog,  
who amassed a 2,500-item art collection between the world wars, 
including paintings attributed to El Greco, Velazquez and Courbet. 
The collection has been appraised at more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg said she remembered many visits during her  
childhood to the baron's home in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	``His house was like a museum,'' she said. ``I was there often  
and I was always a little bit annoyed because I would want to sit 
down on a chair, and I would hear, `Oh, no, you can't sit down on 
that chair, that's 12th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The baron died in 1934, dividing his estate among his three  
children, including Mrs. Nierenberg's mother. But in 1944, under 
the direction of Adolf Eichmann, the best pieces were sent off to 
Germany as Mrs. Nierenberg's Jewish family fled Hungary, the court 
papers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the art was returned to Hungary after the war. But  
because Mrs. Nierenberg's mother was in the United States by then, 
the pieces that had been left to her were sent to the major 
government museums in Budapest under a ``safekeeping'' law. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nierenberg's lawyer, Glen Young, said the Hungarian law was  
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``She owns the paintings. They were never nationalized by the  
government, never taken or appropriated,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Settlement Expected in NJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- A judge dismissed the jury in a  
class-action lawsuit against one of the makers of the fen-phen diet 
drug combination, raising expections of a possible out-of-court 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	In sending jurors home Monday, Superior Court Judge Marina  
Corodemus said she would hear the case without a jury starting Oct. 
12 if a settlement is not reached before then, plaintiffs' attorney 
Steven Sheller said. The jury had been hearing testimony 
intermittently since Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheller said he thought the case would be settled. Officials  
with American Home Products, the drug company, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The case pits the Madison-based company against about 94,000 New  
Jersey residents who used the diet pill combination, which was 
taken off the market two years ago after being linked to serious 
heart and lung damage in users. American Home Products sold the 
``fen'' half of the combination under the brand name Pondimin, and 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs did not develop heart or lung damage, but the  
want American Home Products to cover the cost of future medical 
checkups in case problems develop down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely  
used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it for weight loss in 
combination with another drug, phentermine. The combination became 
known as fen-phen. When taken alone, phentermine never was 
associated with health problems and it remains on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,100 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal  
courts against American Home Products over fenfluramine. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has proposed a national settlement in which it would  
pay $1.2 billion for future medical examinations for healthy users 
of the drug, and an additional $2.8 billion to settle individual 
suits from people who claim the drug has harmed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorneys claim the company hid information from  
doctors, patients and regulators about possible links to heart 
valve disease and an often fatal lung condition called primary 
pulmonary hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The company denies hiding information, and says it acted  
properly in marketing the drugs.

<HEADLINE> Bengals and Browns Both 0-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Playing the Cleveland Browns doesn't have  
quite the feel of years past for the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the winless Bengals and a coach trying to keep his job,  
every game is big. The Bengals and Browns both have 0-4 records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think every week is a big week, whether it's the Browns or  
anybody else,'' Bengals coach Bruce Coslet said. ``Consider the 
state of the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go back through the history of the rivalry, it isn't  
that. It may be some day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet should know. He was a tight end for Cincinnati during the  
1970s under coach Paul Brown, who started and built the Bengals 
after Art Modell, owner of the old Browns, had fired him. Brown 
died in 1991, Modell's team now is the Baltimore Ravens and the new 
Browns are an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bengals, coming off their fourth 3-13 season of the  
1990s, lack the luxury to take anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We mentally can't slack on anybody,'' offensive lineman Brian  
DeMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeMarco is looking forward to the game at Cleveland, near his  
hometown of Lorain. He recalled having bought 125 tickets for 
family and friends one season when he played for the Jacksonville 
Jaguars in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't do that again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	DeMarco, signed for his ability to block for running plays,  
wants to see the Bengals run the ball more. But Cincinnati is 
coming off three consecutive big losses when it had to resort to 
passing in attempts to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals players share the blame for the skid, DeMarco said. He  
had no simple answers for how to correct the slide, other than to 
suggest that each player needs to perform better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's got to pick it up,'' he said. ``We've got to look  
in the mirror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals need a vocal leader, running back Corey Dillon said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The team's looking for leadership,'' said Dillon, who  
expressed frustration that he isn't being given more chances to run 
the ball. ``I try to lead by example. I'm doing all I can.''

<HEADLINE> At 90, McWorker Still Frying Fries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYNN, Mass. (AP) -- At the busy McDonald's, Hazel Howard is in  
charge of the fries, handling them with pride and unwavering 
attention as both grease and orders fly about the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	A job any kid can handle? Hazel Howard is 90.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love it,'' said the grandmother of 12, great-grandmother of  
14 and great-great-grandmother of one. ``I don't have a hobby, and 
if you don't have a hobby you've got to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, who raised four children on her own in this blue-collar  
city north of Boston, has never had a problem keeping busy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since retiring from an office job with a fuel company at age 65,  
she has worked at hotels, country clubs, catering firms and 
restaurants. She began working under the Golden Arches in 1986, and 
has since done everything from baking biscuits to flipping burgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is 100 percent reliable,'' said Howard's boss, Steve Rima.  
``She's just someone you can count on to do a great job every 
single day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard makes the 10-minute drive from her home to work the  
lunchtime shift four days a week, operating the fryer with speed 
and dexterity and handling 200 to 300 pounds of potatoes a day, 
Rima said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the tougher positions,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Rima threw a surprise birthday party for his star  
employee -- who turned 90 a day earlier -- interrupting her fry 
routine with about half a dozen relatives, cake and a 
restaurant-wide rendition of ``Happy Birthday to You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's eating this up,'' said Carol Hutchins, 55, the youngest  
of Howard's four children. ``She deserves it. She's worked hard all 
her life. She's a very special lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, whose coworkers include a 15-year-old, is the oldest  
McDonald's employee in New England and possibly the entire country, 
Rima said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard's own reason for avoiding true retirement?  
</P>
<P>
	``I've enjoyed all my jobs, and all the people I've worked with  
are great,'' she said. ``And I just like to keep busy, I guess.''

<HEADLINE> Votes Scarce for Nuke Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top Democrat on foreign affairs  
issues said he told President Clinton today the votes aren't there 
to ratify an international ban on nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate White House reaction was that Clinton would  
continue to fight. ``The vote's still scheduled for Tuesday and the 
president is going to continue to make the case,'' National 
Security Council spokesman David Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said that, while all 45 Senate  
Democrats are prepared to support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
next Tuesday when a vote is scheduled, any Republican support that 
might have existed appears to be disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have evaporated into the ether'' on the treaty, he  
said. At least 22 Republican senators would have to join the 45 
Democrats for the pact to be ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said his instinct was that Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., would withdraw the treaty from the Senate calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he would consider that.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they would indicate some willingness to let the next  
administration and the next Congress consider this and vote on it, 
we'd entertain that,'' Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders were meeting to consider next steps.  
</P>
<P>
	A week from today the Senate is scheduled to vote on the treaty,  
a troubled Clinton administration initiative signed by 154 nations 
but ratified by only two of the seven acknowledged nuclear powers, 
Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Armed Services Committee opened three days of  
hearings today on the treaty. The first session, a closed one, 
explored a central question: Can the United States maintain the 
integrity of its nuclear arsenal without occasional testing? 
</P>
<P>
	``If there were some feeling of weakness about that stockpile,  
it could induce a leader of another nation or some rogue element or 
some terrorist to challenge the United States,'' said the committee 
chairman, Sen. John Warner, R-Va. ``There can be no doubt about the 
credibility of that stockpile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton invited Warner and other senators to dinner at  
the White House tonight for some face-to-face lobbying, and plans 
what aides describe as an all-out push to persuade about 15 
Republicans to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote's next Tuesday, and we're going to work as hard as we  
can between now and next Tuesday,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Clinton acknowledges he doesn't have the votes right now to  
win ratification, but told reporters on Monday, ``I hope we can get 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By most counts, the administration is 15 votes or more short of  
the 67 needed to ratify a treaty. Democrats blame Senate Republican 
leaders for rushing to a vote after sitting on the treaty for two 
years, not giving them enough time to marshal public support. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you ask people what's the most important thing they worry  
about, the test ban treaty is not on the top of the list,'' said 
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. However, a July poll he 
conducted for the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a pro-test 
ban advocacy group, suggested 82 percent of the American public 
supported such a treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate critics say the treaty, which would ban all nuclear  
testing and set up a seismic monitoring network to gauge 
compliance, is seriously flawed -- and unverifiable because there 
are ways to muffle atomic blasts. They contend it would not prevent 
U.S. enemies or terrorist elements from developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign governments will decide whether to develop nuclear  
weapons based on a calculus of national interests, not on whether 
the CTBT has been ratified by the U.S. Senate,'' said Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, only the United States has used nuclear weapons -- the  
two atomic bombs against Japan that ended World War II in August 
1945. But putting the nuclear genie back into the bottle has proven 
virtually impossible.	   Treaty supporters say it is crucial to keep nuclear weapons from 
proliferating further. They say it would keep large countries with 
advanced nuclear weapons already in their arsenals, including 
Russia and China, from manufacturing even more threatening weapons, 
and make it easier to rein in smaller nuclear powers, like India 
and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	It would also lock in U.S. superiority achieved through more  
than 1,000 nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since we don't need nuclear tests, it is strongly in our  
interest to achieve agreement that can help prevent other countries 
like India, Pakistan, Russia, China, Iran and others from testing 
and deploying nuclear weapons,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As to whether U.S. stockpiles could be kept current, Clinton  
said, ``We are spending $4.5 billion a year to make sure ... we can 
maintain the integrity of our stockpile.'' The United States has 
not conducted a nuclear test since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a staunch test-ban foe who refused to  
hold hearings on the treaty for two years, announced he would hold 
one Thursday -- with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as the 
leadoff witness to ``make her case for the treaty.''

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Halts Sterile Seeds Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- In a move praised by farmers, agribusiness  
giant Monsanto Co. pledged not to market genetically engineered 
crops that produce sterile seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Such products are opposed by farmers and others because they  
make a seed good for only one planting, forcing growers to buy more 
each year. There also is concern that pollen from such crops could 
render plants in neighboring fields sterile. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision is a positive step, it does show that Monsanto  
is trying to remake its image as a company listening to what 
consumers want,'' Jane Rissler of the Union of Concerned Scientists 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agribusinesses already make genetically altered seeds resistant  
to insects and herbicides. But to maintain a market for their 
product, scientists have designed some of these crops in such a way 
that farmers would have to buy new seeds every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops that are engineered to produce infertile seeds are  
nicknamed ``terminator'' technology by critics, a reference to the 
robotic killer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terminator technology has become synonymous with corporate  
greed, and even Monsanto couldn't put a positive spin on it,'' said 
Hope Shand, research director at Rural Advancement Foundation 
International, an advocacy group for farmers in Pittsboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of mounting opposition, Monsanto chairman Robert B.  
Shapiro said he opposes the practice of mnipulating genes to make a 
seed good for only one planting cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments were contained in a letter sent to Gordon Conway,  
president of the Rockefeller Foundation. The foundation says 
gene-altered crops can help reduce world hunger but opposes the 
idea of sterile seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway called Monsanto's decision a first step in making ``the  
fruits of plant biotechnology'' available to poor farmers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The terminator technology was developed by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture and Scott, Miss.-based Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co., the 
world's largest cotton seed company. 
</P>
<P>
	It was patented in 1998, two months before Monsanto offered to  
buy Delta. Monsanto's bid is awaiting antitrust review by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said it will continue trying to commercialize the seed  
sterilization technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system offers valuable uses for breeding and scientific  
purposes, as well as beneficial environmental qualities,'' said 
Harry Collins, Delta vice president of technology transfer. He said 
the technology has been misrepresented by opponents.

<HEADLINE> Rider a No-Show for Hawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Isaiah Rider claims to have matured during six  
mercurial years in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned from my mistakes and I've paid for my mistakes,''  
Rider said a couple of months ago at his first news conference with 
the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to pay up again.  
</P>
<P>
	Rider added to his extensive resume of malfeasance when he  
failed to show up for the first workout of training camp today. He 
also missed the Hawks' mandatory media gathering Monday, plus a 
team dinner and team meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left a message this morning on his cell phone,'' Hawks  
general manager Pete Babcock said today at the camp in Chattanooga, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The message said, ``I hoped that he was OK, that if he needed  
any help to give us a call, we'd be happy to help, we're looking 
forward to having him in camp,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock said he knew he was taking a serious risk when he traded  
model citizen Steve Smith to Portland as part of a four-player deal 
that included Rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected there to be some rocky moments,'' he said, adding,  
``We didn't want to start that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock spent the weekend trying to track down Rider, who lives  
in Oakland, Calif. Finally, about 2 p.m. Monday, someone from agent 
Arn Tellem's office called to say Rider had missed a couple of 
flights and would attempt to catch one in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went into this with our eyes wide open,'' Babcock said  
Monday. ``He has a track record of these sort of things happening. 
We hope by the end of the season they will happen less frequently 
or not at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider will be fined, but Babcock wouldn't reveal the amount.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's trying to get here,'' forward Alan Henderson  
said at Monday's media session. ``He's a talented player and I look 
forward to playing with him. I'm sure he's coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting swept by the New York Knicks in the second round  
of the playoffs, the Hawks underwent a major shakeup during the 
offseason. They could have as many as seven new players on the 
12-man roster, which made Rider's absence even more disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that worries me is we need to work on our chemistry  
and come together as a team,'' guard Bimbo Coles, another new 
player, said. ``We need everyone here, and he's a big part of our 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has averaged 18 points during his six-year career, showing  
the ability to dominate at the offensive end and thrive in an 
up-tempo offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks decided he was the type of player they needed to  
improve their speed, quickness and creativity after ranking as the 
second-worst offensive team in the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Rider's background provided serious cause for  
concern. He showed up late for his first pro practice with 
Minnesota in 1993 and has run afoul of either the law or the NBA 
every year since. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has feuded with coaches. He has missed flights and  
practices. He has been suspended by the league and convicted in 
court of various offenses, including marijuana possession, assault 
and illegal possession of cellular phones. He spent four days in 
jail for probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unacceptable, but I'm not making a bigger issue or a  
smaller issue out of it than I would with any other player,'' 
Babcock said. ``He'll suffer the consequences for his actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tellem's office said Monday the agent was traveling and  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens talked optimistically  
about his relationship with Rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I concern myself with what happens from today on,'' Wilkens  
said. ``I'm not going to get caught up in last year or the year 
before. We had a talk and I told him what I expect and the 
parameters here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Wilkens learned that Rider already had run  
afoul of those parameters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was acquired from the Blazers along with shooting guard  
Jim Jackson, who did show up for the media gathering and plans to 
compete with his wayward teammate for a starting role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the circumstances,'' Jackson said. ``That's  
something J.R. (Rider's nickname) and management will have to work 
out. I'm here and I'm ready to play.''

<HEADLINE> Mattel Debt Rating May Be Downgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Standard &AMP; Poor's said Tuesday it is  
considering lowering the debt rating of Mattel Inc. following the 
toy company's surprise warning that its earnings will fall sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rating is lowered by the major business information  
service, investors will view Mattel bonds as riskier and will 
demand higher interest rates for lending the company money, 
increasing Mattel's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel, the world's largest toymaker, announced on Monday that  
it expects its software subsidiary, The Learning Company, to lose 
$50 million to $100 million. That would push Mattel earnings per 
share into the 30 cent to 40 cent range in the third quarter. Wall 
Street analysts had expected 67 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel blamed the loss on high product returns, the write-off of  
bad debt and other difficulties at the software business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Learning Company wasn't Mattel's only problem, S&AMP;P said in a  
news release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Additionally, Mattel's profitability has been lackluster in  
the first half of 1999, partly due to a 2 percent sales decline in 
Barbie products, the company's largest line,'' the release said. 
``... Standard &AMP; Poor's will evaluate Mattel's business strategies 
and operating outlook in reassessing the ratings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rating agency placed Mattel on its ``Credit Watch'' with a  
negative assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel now has an A-minus rating on its longterm bonds. S&AMP;P's  
top rating is AAA, and a single-A rating is its third-highest 
letter grade. S&AMP;P uses plus and minus signs to denote standing 
within each grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The next lowest grade would be BBB-plus. The triple-B rating is  
the lowest ``investment grade.'' Anything at double-B or lower is 
considered speculative or ``junk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel stock rebounded on Tuesday after sinking on Monday to its  
lowest level since 1993. Mattel shares gained 87 1/2 cents to close at 
$12.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel acquired The Learning Company in May for $3.5 billion in  
stock as part of a campaign to expand into electronic and 
interactive toys.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Coach Promises Not To Curse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- It's either wash out his own mouth with soap or  
fine himself. One way or another, Baltimore Ravens coach Brian 
Billick plans to stop using foul language on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick was scolded by his mother, wife and daughter following  
the Baltimore Ravens' 19-13 overtime victory over the Atlanta 
Falcons on Sunday. The television cameras showed Billick yelling at 
his players, and apparently it wasn't too difficult to read his 
lips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a short-lived win for me. As soon as I got from the  
lockerroom to the bus, I called my mother as I normally do. I got a 
15-minute butt-chewing for my foul language on the sidelines,'' 
Billick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I then go home to the refuge I go to and had my wife ream me  
for a good half-hour, followed by my 10-year-old daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Billick, whose career as an NFL head coach is barely a month  
old, has installed a new code of conduct -- for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Henceforth, I'm counting on you guys to be the guardians of  
the faith here,'' he said to the media. He pledged to fine himself 
$100 if he's caught using a certain obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we'll see if I clean that up and find some other euphemisms  
to convey the same point,'' Billick said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said all money he fined himself would be given to charity.

<HEADLINE> Court Split on Contribution Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-three years after helping reshape the  
political landscape by approving limits on campaign contributions, 
the Supreme Court appeared deeply split Tuesday over the wisdom and 
constitutionality of continuing such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Through rapid-fire questions and comments to lawyers, the  
justices debated the virtues and vices of limiting political 
spending, a form of speech, to deter corruption. Congress will take 
up a similar debate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	While one justice said he assumed big contributors ``get  
something extraordinary in return,'' another extolled a wealthy 
person's right ``to participate in the democratic process as fully 
as he is able.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With members of Congress among the courtroom crowd, the court  
probed the constitutionality of Missouri's contribution limits in 
state races. The justices' eventual decision, expected by late 
June, likely will affect limits imposed for federal elections and 
races in two-thirds of the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote could be very close. Justices David H. Souter, Ruth  
Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul Stevens seemed most 
sympathetic to allowing limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia  
seemed least sympathetic. In previous writings, Justice Clarence 
Thomas supported overturning the court's 1976 decision to uphold 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, as in many of the court's most divisive cases,  
could hinge on the votes of Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and 
Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor voiced some doubts about Missouri's purpose -- fighting  
corruption or the perception of corruption. If someone makes a 
donation in the hope a candidate, if elected, ``will pay attention 
to me, does that give rise to enough of a negative picture to 
justify state regulation?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon answered no, but Souter  
suggested that large contributions always raise the possibility of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people assume -- I do, certainly -- that someone making an  
extraordinarily large contribution is going to get something 
extraordinary in return,'' Souter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer said that if a rich man contributed $15 million, ``the  
public might think he owns that candidate.'' But Scalia countered 
by suggesting a wealthy person has a right to contribute ``as fully 
as he is able.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens asked whether it was ``reasonable for the people of  
Missouri to think everyone should have the same access (to public 
officials) and seek to avoid ``an appearance of unequal treatment 
that borders on corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon was joined by Solicitor General Seth Waxman, arguing for  
the Clinton administration, in urging the justices to reinstate 
Missouri's limits. The limits were struck down as violations of the 
free-speech rights of candidates and contributors alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a contribution is speech, it's hard to say speech is a  
subversion of the political process,'' Kennedy told Waxman. But the 
government lawyer responded, ``The potential for corruption comes 
from the nonspeech element of the large contribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its 1976 decision, called Buckley vs. Valeo, the Supreme  
Court said free-speech rights trump any attempt to limit an 
individual candidate's spending. But that ruling drew a distinction 
between spending, which cannot be capped, and contributions, for 
which it upheld a $1,000 limit on individual contributions in 
federal elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1976 ruling focused on a federal law enacted after the  
Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. The Missouri limits -- also 
$1,000 before being adjusted to $1,075 -- were not imposed until 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that inflation had eroded the  
limits' fairness, and Missouri had not proved that larger donations 
corrupt elections. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis lawyer D. Bruce La Pierre argued that the appeals  
court was right. ``The government should not limit the voices of 
some to amplify the voices of others,'' he said. ``We can try 
trusting the American public'' to decide when political candidates 
are taking too much money from any one contributor. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nixon warned the court that ending contribution limits would  
lead most Americans ``to believe that their government is literally 
for sale.'' He added: ``The system has been vibrant and alive 
across the country with these limits in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among members of Congress on hand to listen to the debate were  
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., supporters of 
federal campaign-finance changes. Also present was Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., who supports increasing federal contribution 
limits to $3,000 when campaign-finance legislation is considered 
next week.

<HEADLINE> Bird Seeds Made From Hemp Impounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Canadian farmer Jean Laprise says his birdseed is  
99.9986 percent pure. That's apparently not pure enough for the 
U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 20 tons of his seed made in part from industrialized hemp  
has been impounded at a Detroit warehouse after U.S. authorities 
discovered traces of THC, the chemical that gets marijuana smokers 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Customs Service seized the seed Aug. 9. Spokesman Dean  
Boyd said agents were acting on the advice of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant.  
While smokers can get a high off the 4 percent to 20 percent of a 
marijuana leaf that has THC, there's only 1 percent of the stuff in 
industrial hemp. 
</P>
<P>
	And Laprise's sterilized birdseed is about 0.0014 percent hemp.  
</P>
<P>
	``It boils down to how many zeros do they want. Is it zero, zero  
point zero, or zero with 10 zeros behind that?'' Laprise said 
Monday. ``It's ridiculous. There are no psychoactive ingredients in 
birdseed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seizure was the first for his company, Kenex Ltd., in its  
first year of selling commercially. He said the Customs Service 
also ordered him to recall 17 loads of earlier exports to the 
United States, including hemp oil, nuts, horse bedding and animal 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall includes 45 boxes of hemp-seed granola bars made by  
Nutiva, a customer in Sebastopol, Calif. The recall and its effects 
have already forced one layoff at Nutiva, said company president 
John Roulac. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the largest distributors in the U.S. was planning to  
pick up our bar, and they backed out after they heard the 
government was threatening action against us,'' Roulac said. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects have even threatened everyday consumers.  
</P>
<P>
	At Coup Restaurant in New York, chef Kevin Roth has had to  
scramble to keep his signature dish -- ``hemp seed and poppy crusted 
tuna'' -- on his menu. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more impurities in a cheeseburger from McDonald's,''  
he complained.

<HEADLINE> 10-Game Suspension for Ducks' Salei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anaheim Mighty Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei was  
suspended for 10 games by the NHL on Tuesday for his hit on Dallas' 
Mike Modano last week. Two other Anaheim players were suspended for 
different actions in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
	Salei cross-checked Modano from behind into the boards during  
the second period of Saturday's game. Modano sustained injuries to 
his head, face and neck after his head hit the boards, and is out 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have all the respect in the world for him,'' Salei said.  
``It is just a bad accident. It's the result (not the incident 
itself) why I'm being punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also suspended were Mighty Ducks defenseman Pascal Trepanier,  
for five games, and forward Jim McKenzie, for four. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a dangerous act by Mr. Salei against an opponent who  
was in a vulnerable position and unable to defend himself,'' said 
Colin Campbell, NHL executive vice president and director of hockey 
operations. ``Everyone connected with hockey knows that a hit or a 
push from behind on a player is an extremely dangerous play and can 
result in serious injury. We were fortunate that Mr. Modano was not 
more severely injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three suspensions began Tuesday against the Phoenix Coyotes.  
Because league rules prohibit teams from replacing suspended 
players on the 23-man active roster, all 20 of the remaining 
players on the Mighty Ducks' roster were in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Salei will forfeit $109,756 in salary and will be eligible to  
return on Oct. 29 against the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Trepanier was suspended for hitting Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk  
with an elbow to the head midway through the third period. 
Trepanier is eligible to return Oct. 16 at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our stance against hits to the head remains very much in  
place,'' Campbell said. ``Such behavior will not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie was suspended for initiating an altercation with Stars  
defenseman Darryl Sydor, and persisting although Sydor offered no 
resistance and was defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk returned to play against the Detroit Red Wings on  
Tuesday night, but Sydor remained out indefinitely with a fractured 
eye socket. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie, who will be eligible to return Oct. 15 at Tampa Bay,  
said Sydor started the incident by throwing an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw the tape,'' McKenzie said. ``Did I start the fight?  
The tough part is the league handles the decision and that's all 
there is to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trepanier forfeits almost $10,000 in salary, while McKenzie  
loses close to $13,000. The money goes to the Players' Emergency 
Assistance Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest suspension for an on-ice infraction was 21 games  
given to Washington's Dale Hunter for a late hit on a celebrating 
Pierre Turgeon after Turgeon scored against the Capitals during the 
1993 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lysiak of the Chicago Blackhawks was suspended 20 games in  
1983 for intentionally tripping an official. Three others have 
received 15-game suspensions.

<HEADLINE> Bush Chides GOP on Social Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush today criticized his own party's record on social issues, as 
he proposed mandatory state testing of students to ensure that 
schools are performing up to standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding on his education agenda, Bush tied federal education  
money to student testing. He proposed requiring all states to 
develop and administer annual tests for students in grades three to 
eight. He also would require the states to participate in the 
National Assessment of Educational Progress, a federal program that 
tests a random sampling of students every two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have long been critical of any expanded federal role  
in education, particularly mandatory testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the Manhattan Institute, a conservative thinktank,  
Bush noted that ``education reform is gaining a critical mass of 
results. In the process, conservatism has become the creed of hope, 
the creed of aggressive, persistent reform, the creed of social 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that was a change for the GOP.  
</P>
<P>
	``Too often on social issues my party has painted an image of  
America slouching toward Gomorrah. ... Too often my party has 
focused on the national economy to the exclusion of all else. ... 
Too often my party has confused the need for limited government 
with the disdain for government itself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in two weeks that Bush has stung his own  
party with criticism. The Texas governor drew the ire of 
congressional Republicans last week when he criticized their plans 
to squeeze money from a program for the working poor to meet budget 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the nation needs to rebuild its approach to education  
with ``pressure from above and competition from below.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, he proposed a tenfold increase in the size of  
tax-free savings accounts that parents can establish for 
educational expenses. The current maximum annual contribution would 
rise from $500 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bush called for a $500 million Achievement and  
Education Fund to reward improving school systems, and a $3 billion 
Charter School Homestead Fund to provide loan guarantees to help 
start or improve charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush singled out the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  
1965 as a program that needs revisions. The $13.9 billion program, 
which is up for reauthorization in Congress, provides grants for 
elementary and secondary programs under 60 categories. 
</P>
<P>
	He would streamline them into five general categories so states  
can tailor programs to their unique needs. Under the plan, money 
could be spent to improve the achievement of disadvantaged 
children; promote fluency in English; train and recruit teachers; 
encourage student character and school safety; and promote 
innovation and informed parental choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his plan, federal money could be used to fund state  
voucher programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Voucher programs are strongly opposed by teacher unions and  
Democratic candidates such as Vice President Al Gore. Bill Bradley, 
Gore's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, has voted 
for voucher experiments but doesn't believe they are the solution 
to fundamental educational problems. Most of the GOP candidates 
favor voucher systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was endorsed today by the American Federation of Teachers,  
the nation's second largest teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed national student testing, but  
Republicans in Congress used their majority to block the 
legislation. Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor views 
the NAEP test merely as an ``audit'' that would verify the state 
test results. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said states whose schools show no improvement after five  
years, as measured by the tests, would lose 5 percent of the 
administrative portion of their ESEA grants. States that improve 
would be eligible for money from the Achievement and Education 
Fund, which would be bolstered with $500 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Test results would be distributed over the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Without testing, reform is a journey without a compass,'' Bush  
said in the second three planned education speeches. ``Without 
testing, teachers and administrators cannot adjust their methods to 
meet high goals. ...Without testing, parents are left in the 
dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also wants to increase the number of charter schools --  
privately run schools that receive public money -- to give parents 
another education option. His $3 billion Homestead program would 
provide seed money for up to 2,000 such schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``As president, I want to fan the spark of charter schools into  
a flame,'' Bush said. ``If charters are done properly -- free to 
hire their own teachers, adopt their own curriculum, set their own 
operating rules and high standards -- they will change the face of 
American education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed increasing the federal allowance for  
education savings from $500 per year to $5,000. Under a 1997 law, 
parents can make contributions to the accounts as if they were 
paying into an IRA. The money can be withdrawn tax-free for college 
expenses. Eligibility for the program starts to phase out for 
single taxpayers earning $95,000 and couples earning $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush would let parents spend the money for kindergarten through  
college. His campaign projects that the expansion would cost the 
Treasury $92 million in revenue in the first year and more than $1 
billion by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Jana Novotna Loses Her Final Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) -- Jana Novotna, the 1998 Wimbledon  
champion, ended her 12-year career Tuesday, losing her final match 
on the tour to Silvia Farina 6-3, 6-4 at the Porsche Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna has dropped to No. 18, her lowest world ranking in 10  
years. She was No. 2 in the world in 1997 and after winning 
Wimbledon last year. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sidelined for a long time after spraining an ankle and  
partially tearing ligaments in June. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing in the third round of the U.S. Open, Novotna said  
she would quit at the end of the year. But a first-round loss to 
Magdalena Maleeva in Luxembourg two weeks ago persuaded Novotna to 
play only one more tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna won 24 titles on the WTA Tour after turning pro in 1987.  
But she won only one title this year, beating Venus Williams in 
February at Hanover, Germany. She also won 73 doubles titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna was honored at the end of her match and received a  
standing ovation as she waved to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matches, Anke Huber of Germany rallied from 1-5 and  
15-40 down in the second set to beat seventh-seeded Julie 
Halard-Decugis of France 4-6, 7-5, 6-1, and Jennifer Capriati 
defeated Irina Spirlea 6-4, 6-1.

<HEADLINE> Double-Murder Conviction Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- In a case that caused a sensation in  
Asia, an appeals court has overturned a woman's conviction in a 
love triangle murder case, saying her rights were violated when she 
was questioned for nine hours without a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Li-Yun ``Lisa'' Peng, a 49-year-old Taiwanese, was found guilty  
in 1996 of murdering her millionaire husband's Chinese mistress and 
the woman's baby. Media from China, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia 
had reported every detail from the case's revelations of wealth, 
marital betrayal and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled Thursday that Mrs.  
Peng was illegally coerced into incriminating herself. The justices 
were critical of her long interrogation without counsel and of 
detectives' use of Mrs. Peng's husband, electronics tycoon Tseng 
``Jim'' Peng, to aid the questioning. Her lawyer had suggested the 
husband was the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the body of 25-year-old Ranbing ``Jennifer'' Ji was  
found stabbed 18 times. Her and Peng's 5-month-old son, Kevin, was 
suffocated with a T-shirt stuffed in his mouth. The bodies were 
found in a Mission Viejo apartment where Peng had installed the 
woman, who was from mainland China, as his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Peng, 56, agreed to help Orange County authorities by hunting  
through his wife's closet and her financial records for clues, the 
justices said. Then, after Mrs. Peng had been interrogated for many 
hours, authorities sent the husband in to question her in Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Peng burst into tears and told him she had bitten the  
mistress in a confrontation hours before her death. Authorities 
matched her DNA to a bite mark on the victim's arm and used her 
statement, translated from Chinese, against her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without  
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said the husband should not have been allowed to  
question her and the evidence should not have been used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even an innocent person would make some kind of statement  
potentially incriminating after nine hours of threats, intimidation 
and bullying by law enforcement officers in the bowels of a county 
jail, and then being confronted with the questions of the victim's 
paramour,'' Presiding Justice David Sills wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Sheriff Tim Simon, who disputed the ruling, said he  
and prosecutors will review it before deciding whether to appeal or 
proceed toward retrial. For the time being, Mrs. Peng remains in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pengs owned Ranger communications, a company that makes CB  
radios in several Asian countries. They had homes in Orange County 
and Taiwan, and Peng claimed a net worth of $200 million.

<HEADLINE> 19 Die in Mexico Floods, Many Flee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- The Mexican government declared a  
state of emergency Tuesday in four states where the worst flooding 
in 40 years has killed at least 19 people and forced the evacuation 
of more than 100,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding has caused seven rivers to overflow. In the Gulf  
coast state of Tabasco, residents were alarmed by reports of 
crocodiles up to 8 feet long roaming the flooded streets of the 
capital, Villahermosa. Local officials said Tuesday that police 
shot one of the creatures as it moved toward a populated 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Warning that water levels would rise further, state authorities  
urged people to evacuate from low-lying communities along the 
Grijalva, Usumacinta and Carrizal rivers in Tabasco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot wait for the situation to worsen,'' Tabasco Civil  
Protection chief Sergio Jimenez Urgell said Tuesday in a radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Tabasco, officials declared a state of emergency in the  
Pacific states of Michoacan and Jalisco, and the central state of 
Puebla. Local officials said some people were trapped on rooftops 
by floodwaters in Puebla. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 55,000 people have been evacuated in Tabasco state,  
including more than 34,000 in Villahermosa, where the Grijalva and 
Carrizal rivers have flooded due to nearly a week of rain. Another 
50,000 were evacuated in the central state of Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to four flood-related deaths reported in Tabasco, at  
least four people have died in neighboring Veracruz state. In the 
southernmost state of Chiapas, two elderly men drowned while trying 
to cross a flooded river on horseback while drunk, officials said. 
And in Puebla state, nine had died, the state Notimex news agency 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The army deployed troops to help refugees reach shelters.  
Tabasco schools were closed indefinitely in more than 140 
communities along the Grijalva and Usumacinta rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Though rains were weakening Tuesday, the National Water  
Commission maintained a red alert and warned that water releases 
from area dams could cause the state's rivers to rise by an 
additional foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have a catastrophic situation,'' commission spokesman  
Gilberto Segovia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The southeastern Gulf Coast states were being inundated by the  
season's 11th tropical depression, which was centered about 85 
miles east-northeast of the port city of Veracruz, according to the 
U.S. National Weather Service in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to drift northwest toward land and dump  
between 10 inches and 15 inches of rain over southeastern Mexico. 
The weather center warned of the potential for flash floods and 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
	To the northwest, in the central state of Hidalgo, heavy rain  
forced authorities to release water from the La Esperanza dam 
Tuesday, causing the Tulancingo and San Lorenzo rivers to overflow 
and sending thousands of people to emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters, civil protection authorities and the Red Cross  
estimated that at least 3,500 Hidalgo homes were flooded, the 
government news agency Notimex said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Central America, meanwhile, several weeks of flooding and  
torrential rains have killed more than 50 people across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In Guatemala, 13 people have died and the homes and plantations  
of some 6,000 people have been destroyed, officials said. Police 
estimated the storms have killed at least 15 people in Nicaragua, 
21 in Honduras, 11 in El Salvador, six in Costa Rica and 15 in 
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Kerry Collins To Start for Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Kent Graham is going to miss the  
New York Giants' game against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday 
because of a concussion, and Kerry Collins will start at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, who started the first four games, was injured in last  
Sunday's 16-15 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw three interceptions against Philadelphia, one returned  
for a touchdown, and his status as the starter was in question. 
Giants coach Jim Fassel said he would evaluate Graham's performance 
and would announce his starter Wednesday. The injury made the 
decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was examined Monday by neurologist Peter Tsairis of the  
Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``All Giants are given neurological evaluations in the preseason  
and this information is used to determine any change in their 
neurological status,'' Dr. Russell Warren, the team's orthopedic 
surgeon said. ``A battery of tests on Kent on Monday showed some 
significant alteration. At this point he is still symptomatic and 
will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. My recommendations to the 
Giants is that Kent not play this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a free agent who signed for nearly $17 million in the  
offseason despite a troubled past, was 6-of-12 for 86 yards and led 
the Giants on the game-winning field goal drive after replacing 
Graham in the third quarter Sunday. However, the drive included a 
fumble by Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry will start. After listening to the doctors, obviously  
the mpost improtant thing is not to put Kent at greater risk,'' 
Fassel said. ``The doctors told me because of the concussion Kent 
suffered Sunday, he will be more susceptible to concussions this 
week. If Kent were to sustain another concussion, we would be 
looking at a longer period of inactivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants offense has struggled since the start of the season,  
although Graham has not been solely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the injury, Graham threw three horrible interceptions on  
plays he forced passes into coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said it was almost as if Graham (15-of-29 for 171 yards)  
predetermined where he was going to throw the ball and didn't 
bother making any reads on the plays. Two Eagles literally battled 
for the ball on the third pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that last one, he forced it right into the teeth of the  
defense, I said I have to take him out of the ballgame,'' Fassel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since becoming the Giants coach, Fassel has changed quarterbacks  
in each of his first two seasons. Danny Kanell took over for an 
injured Dave Brown (pectoral) in 1997 and led the Giants to the NFC 
East title, posting a 7-2-1 record as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won five of six games at the end of last season after  
Graham replaced Kanell as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in my mind that I am aware when I made  
the quarterback switch the team has taken off,'' Fassel said. ``... 
You weigh all those factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft, led New York  
on an 11-play, 67-yard march that resulted in Brad Daluiso's 
game-winning 23-yard field goal with 7:43 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about Collins is: Is he ready?  
</P>
<P>
	This is his first year in Fassel's offense and he hasn't gotten  
many reps since training camp ended. He also struggled mightily 
last season in Carolina and New Orleans in a season marred by a 
drunken driving arrest in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel isn't sure whether Collins is ready, although he said he  
has made a lot of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am going to make any moves I want to make sure that guy  
is ready to play and to improve the play,'' Fassel said. ``I don't 
want to go backwards. I want immediate better play from the 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not an easy situation,'' Collins said. ``I think we both  
realize things like yesterday happen and it doesn't necessarily 
mean that permanent change is going to come.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Acquires Triple Crown Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, NBC television has programmed NBA  
playoff games opposite thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown series. 
Now those games will serve as a lead-in for the Kentucky Derby, 
Preakness and Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The network reached a five-year agreement to televise the races  
beginning in 2001. Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said the 
NBA lead-in would increase ratings for the races by 15 to 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the NBA has posed a problem for thoroughbred  
racing,'' said Thomas Meeker, president of Triple Crown 
Productions. ``Not having that competition will enhance our ability 
to attract new viewers to our sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said a second-round NBA playoff game would precede  
coverage of the Derby, and it's likely there would be games shown 
before both the Preakness and Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations for the Triple Crown package, which cost NBC a  
reported $51.5 million, were completed in less than eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal adds the spring 3-year-old series to the Breeders' Cup,  
which has been an NBC property since its inception. ``It offers all 
kinds of packaging possibilities,'' Ebersol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC also was committed to coverage of the prep  
races that lead up to the Derby, either on its cable channels or 
other cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are thrilled to be joining the NBC Sports family,'' Meeker  
said. ``We have always been extremely impressed by the passion with 
which NBC approaches all of its properties and how it has telecast 
the Olympics, the NBA and the Ryder Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, which has televised the Derby since 1975 and covered all  
three races since 1987, has one more year remaining on its contract 
for the series. It reportedly bid $35 million to retain the 
contract. CBS, which provided the first national telecast of the 
Derby in 1952 and added the Preakness and Belmont in 1960, offered 
a reported $28 million.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell: N. Ireland Talks In Peril </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's peace process is under  
great stress because of stubborn disagreements between two key 
parties, and may collapse, American mediator George Mitchell said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The review I am engaged upon will be concluded in the near  
future. I have not set a specific time, but I do not intend this to 
be an open-ended process,'' Mitchell said in a speech to a banking 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, a former U.S. senator, chaired the negotiations that  
produced the Good Friday 1998 agreement on forming a new 
Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	That government has not been formed because the Ulster  
Unionists, the province's major Protestant party, are demanding 
that the Irish Republican Army begin to disarm before its allied 
Sinn Fein party can take part in the government. The IRA has 
refused to start surrendering its weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The British and Irish governments asked Mitchell to return to  
Northern Ireland to seek a way out of the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is beyond dispute that the peace process is under  
stress,'' Mitchell said in his speech. ``The outcome is not 
assured. I hope that there will be full implementation of the 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``There is no credible alternative to the Good Friday  
Agreement. If it is not implemented, I think the people in Northern 
Ireland face a highly uncertain future.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Chides GOP on Social Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edging away from an unpopular Congress, George  
W. Bush said Tuesday fellow Republicans are too often dour, 
pessimistic and focused on economics ``to the exclusion of all 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, my party has confused the need for limited  
government with a disdain for government itself,'' the GOP 
presidential front-runner told New York conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second time in a week the Texas governor has  
declared his independence from the congressional wing of the party, 
suggesting that he feels comfortable challenging elements of the 
GOP establishment -- a contrast to the 1996 presidential nominee, 
Bob Dole, who struggled constantly to keep party leaders satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiling his second education initiative in the Democratic  
bastion of New York also underscored Bush's intention to pursue a 
general election strategy that courts voters outside the GOP base. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to a conservative thinktank, Bush said:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of  
America slouching toward Gomorrah.'' He borrowed the line from the 
title of a book by conservative Robert Bork. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Too often, my party has focused on the national economy, to  
the exclusion of all else -- speaking a sterile language of rates 
and numbers, of CBO this and GNP that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Government should be limited, but not to the point that  
Americans get hurt. ``That should be our goal: A limited 
government, respected for doing a few things and doing them well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, he said Republicans have a good point: There are  
too many broken homes and lives; a vigorous economy should be 
sought and small government is good government. 
</P>
<P>
	But he weighed in with a flip side -- a rosier view -- by saying  
welfare, education and crime problems are being combatted with 
compassion by Republican reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Problems that seemed inevitable proved to be reversible,''  
Bush said. ``They gave way to an optimistic, governing 
conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers and aides say Bush is fleshing out his ``compassionate  
conservative'' philosophy with examples that show his desire to 
blend conservative principles with more moderate rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, it's a matter of tone.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a continuation of his highlighting the differences  
between conservatism with a frown and conservatism with a smile,'' 
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats called Bush's remarks a ploy to mask his true  
conservative leanings. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush is just offering new rhetorical wrapping paper on  
the same Republican package of wrong ideas for America,'' 
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said. 
</P>
<P>
	To some Democratic and Republican operatives, the strategy is  
reminiscent of Clinton's 1996 effort to distance himself from both 
his own party and the GOP majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers said, however, that the governor's goal is less  
Machiavellian. He simply wants to rise above the partisan 
leadership style of congressional leaders and discuss social issues 
in a positive light -- rather than in a way that seems to condemn 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	One Bush adviser used this example: Welfare reformers need to  
find fault with men who haven't paid child support, not single 
mothers who are trying to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show that many Americans find Republicans in Congress are  
too strident and give them lower approval ratings than President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what he's doing is laying out a vision of where he  
wants to take the Republican Party and it is frankly a very 
different direction from where it has been the last five years,'' 
said Ralph Reed, a GOP consultant who advises the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bush criticized the Republican Congress for plans to  
trim tax credits to the working poor. He slipped his latest 
assessment of the GOP establishment in an education address Tuesday 
that separated himself from the views of many conservatives by 
calling for federally mandated state testing of students. 
</P>
<P>
	States, he said, should be required to participate in the  
National Assessment Educational Program, which tests randomly 
selected students every two to four years. Participation is now 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed expanding the tax-free, interest-bearing  
education savings account program. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's distancing himself from Congress has irked some  
GOP lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting stuff done here. Real stuff. Compassionate  
conservative stuff,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, he's out campaigning and we right  
now are in the position of governing,'' Rep. David Dreier, 
R-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many GOP lawmakers, perhaps recognizing Bush's general election  
strategy, brushed off the criticism. ``Sometimes I take shots at 
Congress, too, and Washington as a whole,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said.

<HEADLINE> Charges in Money-Laundering Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal prosecutors say $7 billion from Russia  
was illegally funneled through accounts at the Bank of New York in 
one of the largest money laundering cases in U.S. history, 
according to a criminal indictment unsealed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three individuals and three companies were charged with  
channelling the money -- believed to have ties to the Russian mafia 
-- in the first criminal charges to be brought in the case. The 
charges were contained in a three-count indictment filed under seal 
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Berlin, 44, Lucy Edwards, 41, -- a former vice president at  
the Bank of New York -- and Aleksey Volkov, 34, as well as Benex 
International Co. Inc., Becs International L.L.C. and Torfinex 
Corp. were named as defendants. The Bank of New York, the nation's 
15th-largest bank, was not named in the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement that ``the  
ongoing investigation is very intense and broad, and it is likely 
to go on for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many questions about the various sources of the monies flowing  
through the accounts at the Bank of New York remain to be 
answered,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Schiliro, an FBI assistant director in charge of the New  
York office, said the FBI is primarily focused on determining the 
origin of the funds and tracing the path of transactions through 
accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``As this investigation has progressed, cooperation from the  
Russian authorities has been forthcoming and has been helpful,'' he 
said. ``Unsealing this indictment will serve to facilitate the 
mutual flow of information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Kingham, a lawyer for Berlin and Edwards, said the couple  
-- naturalized U.S. citizens who live in London -- will ``appear in 
whatever court they're required to appear in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, he said, ``We cannot comment on the indictment except  
to state that we will respond at the appropriate time in the 
appropriate forum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could not comment on whether the couple will fight  
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	It could not immediately be determined who represents Volkov;  
prosecutors believe he is not in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators have been working for several months in  
attempt to unravel the Bank of New York case. Russian businesses 
and individuals -- including organized crime groups -- are suspected 
of illegally laundering the $7 billion through accounts at the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is the process of moving criminal gains through  
a series of bank accounts to make them look like legitimate 
business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that the defendants conspired from 1996  
to August 1999 to illegally transmit funds and receive deposits 
through the Benex and Becs accounts at the Bank of New York. 
Torfinex allegedly handled the transfer of moneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin, a Russian emigrant, is the president of both Benex and  
Becs and was married to Edwards, who was a vice president in the 
Eastern European Division at the Bank of New York and was also an 
officer of Benex and Becs, prosecutors said. Volkov is the 
president of Torfinex. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were charged because they allegedly engaged in an  
illegal banking operation by receiving deposits without obtaining 
authorization from any federal or state banking agency, according 
to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also seeks criminal forfeiture of various bank  
and brokerage accounts, including the Benex and Becs accounts as 
well as accounts held by Torfinex at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleged that the defendants continued to send  
money illegally through the Benex and Becs accounts even after 
Torfinex was ordered by the New York State Department of Banking in 
October 1997 to stop transmitting money. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all the charges against them, Berlin and Volkov  
could face up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $175,000 or twice 
the gain or loss resulting from the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of the conspiracy charge against her, Edwards would  
face a maximum prison term of five years and a maximum fine of 
$250,000 or twice the gain or loss resulting from the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was dismissed last month for gross misconduct, violation  
of the bank's internal policies, falsification of bank records and 
failure to cooperate with the bank's investigation. She has 
previously denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the corporate defendants could face maximum fines  
of $1.5 million or twice the gain or loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Those accounts collectively hold about $6.2 million and were  
seized when warrants were issued in August 1999.

<HEADLINE> Man Must Stay Away From Ashley Judd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- A Kentucky man who got into Ashley Judd's  
house by posing as a police officer has been ordered to stay away 
from the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this order is entered, you are to have no contact, you  
are not to follow, stalk or harass Miss Judd again,'' Judge Jeffrey 
Bivins told Guy Dukes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dukes, who was charged with trespassing and impersonating a  
police officer, was ordered to come no closer than 100 feet to Ms. 
Judd and her residence. Dukes apologized for his actions and said 
``it won't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Judd, 31, called 911 Sept. 27 after discovering Dukes in her  
rural home. He left at her request and did not touch her, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Judd's boyfriend, race car driver Dario Franchitti, followed  
Dukes by car into Franklin, where police cornered the suspect in a 
parking lot and arrested him.

<HEADLINE> Colon Cancer Follow-Ups Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many older Americans who test positive in  
colon cancer screenings are not getting the proper follow-up 
procedures, a study shows -- a potentially deadly situation when 
dealing with the nation's second leading cancer killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to obtain proper follow-up testing could delay discovery  
of the disease and ``the later you find it, the more difficult it 
is to cure,'' warned one of the researchers, Dr. Jon D. Lurie of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River 
Junction, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  
Atlanta estimates 129,400 people will be diagnosed with colorectal 
cancer this year and 56,600 will die. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Physicians recommends that patients  
whose initial colon cancer screening -- a fecal occult (meaning 
hidden) blood test -- comes up positive should then undergo two 
follow-up tests: A colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, in 
which instruments are inserted into the colon to check for cancer, 
plus a barium enema X-ray examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lurie and co-worker Dr. H. Gilbert Welch studied the records of  
24,246 people aged 65 and over who underwent the initial screening 
between Jan. 1 and April 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 2,245 who went for follow-up testing, only 34 percent  
received both of the recommended procedures, the researchers report 
in the Oct. 6 edition of the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute. Another 34 percent got just one of the tests, and the 
remaining 32 percent received other gastrointestinal exams. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 774 who got both recommended follow-up tests, 241 were  
diagnosed with colon polyps and 32 had colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In clinical trials, when patients testing positive got proper  
follow-up tests and treatment, deaths from colon cancer were 
reduced by 15 percent to 35 percent, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, a great deal of work remains to be done to educate  
the public about the impact of colorectal cancer and the value of 
screening,'' Dr. John H. Bond of the VA Medical Center in 
Minneapolis wrote in an editorial in the same edition of the 
Journal. ``Primary care clinicians need to learn more about how to 
screen their patients according to current guideline 
recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When patients are properly informed, they are willing to go  
forward with follow-up testing at a high rate, Dr. Matthew McKenna 
of the CDC added in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal occult blood test checks for blood in the stool, which  
can be an early indication of colon polyps or colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to detecting cancer at an early stage, McKenna said,  
the follow-up tests can also lead to treatment that prevents it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean actually prevent cancer,'' he said, ``not just prevent  
colon cancer mortality. Because what you can do is, these big 
polyps may be benign at some point, but can convert into cancer. 
They can bleed too and cause this test to be positive. So if you do 
go in and remove those polyps, you've prevented the person from 
having cancer altogether.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, ``In the earliest stage, cancers ... have  
a well above 90 percent cure rate if found at that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lurie and Welch could not determine why only about one-third of  
the people they studied who went for follow-up tests got both of 
the recommended procedures. They speculated that physicians may 
have been hesitant to recommend invasive follow-up testing or that 
some patients might have resisted the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colonoscopy is certainly a somewhat invasive test. It's not  
terrible by any means, but people might be reluctant to undergo 
that testing,'' Lurie said. In a colonoscopy, a lighted instrument 
is inserted into the rectum to look for signs of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients might have real choices to make. They certainly get a  
benefit from colorectal cancer screening,'' Lurie said. ``But there 
is some cost to it -- and I don't just mean dollar cost -- of going 
through a colonoscopy procedure that patients might weigh very 
differently and maybe make a different decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of their study, there was also the dollar cost to  
consider since Medicare did not reimburse for colorectal screening 
then. It started doing so on Jan. 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The fecal occult blood test involves smearing samples of stool  
from three separate bowel movements on cards, which are then sent 
to a lab to be tested for the presence of blood.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Teen Admits Hacking Into AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teen-age hacker admitted in court  
Tuesday that he broke into America Online's internal computers from 
his bedroom and altered programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Satiro, 19, pleaded guilty in Westchester County Court to  
first-degree computer tampering. He could be sentenced to up to 15 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, police showed up at Satiro's home and took him and his  
computer into custody after AOL detected the intrusion, traced it 
to Satiro and notified the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal complaint said damage Satiro did to AOL would cost  
more than $50,000 to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Satiro had once worked as a volunteer at AOL technical support  
and ``combined his AOL knowledge with other information that he had 
gathered from other hackers,'' the district attorney's office said 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Policy Holders Get $456M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- The $456 million jury verdict in a lawsuit  
accusing State Farm of using second-rate parts for automobile 
repairs could lead to higher premiums if the ruling stands on 
appeal, industry experts warn. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information  
Institute, a nonprofit industry communications group, said premiums 
and repair bills could soar if insurers are forced to use 
factory-authorized parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers save about $800 million a year in reduced premiums due  
to the use of less-expensive repair parts, according to industry 
estimates presented at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are basically two winners: the automakers and the  
attorneys who brought this suit,'' Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	A trade group called Monday's verdict the largest ever against  
an insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit representing 4.7 million State Farm  
policyholders accused the nation's largest auto insurer of breach 
of contract for failing to restore vehicles to pre-accident 
condition by using ``aftermarket'' repair parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend such parts -- sheet-metal and plastic trim parts  
modeled on originals but made without access to factory 
specifications -- do not provide the same level of fit, finish, 
corrosion resistance and, in some cases, safety, as parts made for 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm spokesman Bill Sirola said the company has no  
immediate plans to change its policies, but said a review is likely 
if the verdict stands on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs are seeking an additional $4 billion on their claim  
that State Farm deliberately deceived customers about the parts' 
quality. A judge's decision on the fraud complaint is expected by 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's award on the breach-of-contract claim amounts to  
about $100 for each of the 4.7 million policyholders included in 
the lawsuit. Appeals are expected to hold up distribution of the 
award for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to provide a lot of uncertainty in the industry,  
but unless there's an outright injunction, we think these parts 
will continue to be used,'' said Mark Johnson, an analyst who 
watches the aftermarket-parts industry for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Aftermarket parts are involved in one-fifth of State Farm's  
auto-body repairs, and 15 percent of repairs covered by all 
insurers, according to estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	A Consumer Reports study presented at trial found that  
aftermarket parts often take longer to install and perform poorly 
compared to original equipment parts. The organization urged the 
Federal Trade Commission to set consumer consent and safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also saw dozens of memos from State Farm executives in  
which they raised questions about the quality of the parts, even as 
they were promoting them as high-quality, low-cost alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Thomas Hatley said the memos were the most  
compelling evidence in six weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their own documents said there was a problem with the parts,''  
he said. ``We fairly quickly came to a conclusion that the parts 
were not of like kind and quality.''

<HEADLINE> Houston Makes Highest Sports Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Houston made the NFL an offer for its 32nd team  
that might be too big to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob McNair bid $700 million for an expansion franchise Tuesday,  
which would be the highest price ever for a sports team in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With a $310 million stadium included, the deal would be worth  
more than $1 billion -- a first for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's expansion committee met with McNair on Tuesday  
evening and also heard Michael Ovitz make another pitch for giving 
Los Angeles the 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a recommendation tomorrow (Wednesday) by  
the committee,'' NFL spokesman Joe Browne said after that group, 
with 12 of its 14 members present, held a three-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no straw vote by the committee and no recommendation  
was formed, Browne said. But he added that the group was to meet 
again today and could be expected to make its recommendation 
afterward to the full ownership, which was scheduled to meet later 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens after that as far as the 17 other clubs, I'm not  
sure,'' Brown said, referring to the teams that aren't represented 
on the expansion committee. ``Anything can happen right up until 
the meeting starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's recommendation would have to be approved by 24  
of the 31 owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston has been without a team since the Oilers moved to  
Tennessee after the 1996 season. Los Angeles lost the Raiders to 
Oakland and the Rams to St. Louis after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said he was cautiously optimistic and that he believed  
the committee's recommendation would have a major influence on the 
vote by the full ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they (the committee members) will have a lot of  
input,'' he said in the lobby outside the meeting room. ``They have 
done the homework. When they make a decision for one city, I think 
it will carry a lot of weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made an outstanding business proposal, and these are  
good business people who know a good proposal. From what I know 
about the other proposals, I don't think they compare to ours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main issue is that Houston's ready to go.''  
</P>
<P>
	Houston's plan is for a retractable-roof stadium, with $195  
million of public funds going into the project. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair's $700 million franchise bid is some $50 million higher  
than the new franchise was expected to be worth. Ovitz, who most 
recently proposed building a stadium at Hollywood Park in 
Inglewood, Calif., and another group seeking a team for the Los 
Angeles Coliseum apparently did not make an offer anywhere close to 
the one Houston put on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike McNair, Ovitz did not make himself available to answer  
questions after addressing the committee. An Associated Press call 
to Ovitz was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his backers hold an option on a parcel of land at  
Hollywood Park. But he obtained the option just last week, so any 
plan for that site would have to be in the very early stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, one of the Coliseum backers, also was in Atlanta but  
did not speak to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, who came to town with a new bid, said before the  
expansion committee meeting that he spoke at length with NFL 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue and expected to be invited to address 
the committee. He did not, so the invitation apparently never came. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski would not disclose the amount of the offer made by his  
group, which includes billionaire Eli Broad. Roski did say that he 
believed any plan to build a stadium at Hollywood Park faced a 
number of challenges, including lacking easy access to freeways, 
that the Coliseum proposal did not face. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said in Los  
Angeles that the Coliseum group never received a clear idea of what 
the NFL wanted in LA. 
</P>
<P>
	The league owners voted 29-2 last March to give Los Angeles a  
team conditional on the NFL's receiving a suitable stadium and 
financing proposal by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The league shortly afterward narrowed the choice down to the  
Coliseum, eliminating a bid by Ovitz, who proposed building a 
stadium in suburban Carson. But the negations with the Coliseum 
stalled last summer after the NFL's request requested -- and did not 
receive -- the promise of $150 million in public funds to go toward 
the Coliseum project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL failed to place a person in Los Angeles to make this  
deal, a point person,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ```They have never done 
that. They committed to setting a franchise fee and never did it. 
They said they were going to do it, they never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``The larger issue is, it's hard to get the league to play by  
one set of rules. It's hard to know what those rules are. It's like 
they're making up the rules as they go along. And they failed to 
keep their word with respect to the (Sept. 15) deadline.''

<HEADLINE> Antismoking Group Sues Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An antismoking group sued three tobacco  
companies on Tuesday, asking that the federal court require them to 
establish a $330 million fund to help prevent smoking-related 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco Control Coalition Inc. accused Philip Morris, Rothmans  
and WD&AMP;HO Wills, Australia's three largest tobacco companies, in 
the suit of misleading or deceptive conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition also wants health and medical groups to be  
reimbursed for money spent on tobacco control. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies already face a separate class action by  
Australians who have contracted smoking-related diseases over the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new case, a brief outline of which was filed Tuesday,  
relates to people who may suffer loss or damage in the future even 
if they do not yet smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Court judge Justice Murray Wilcox ordered the coalition  
to prepare a statement detailing its case by Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Brendan Brady, corporate and regulatory affairs director of  
British American Tobacco Australasia, the trading company which 
owns both Wills and Rothmans in Australia, said he believed the 
judge would throw out the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect it to fall down at the first hurdle,'' Brady  
said. ``Our initial reaction is one of surprise really at the 
bizarre nature of the suit. It really is a quite unique and novel 
approach to try to have a fund set up for people who do not yet 
smoke and for people who smoke who may or may not get ill.''

<HEADLINE> Astros 6, Braves 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Daryle Ward, who started the season in Triple-A,  
is making a big impact in October for the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's leadoff homer against Greg Maddux in the sixth inning  
sent the Astros on their way to a 6-1 victory Tuesday over the 
Atlanta Braves in Game 1 of the NL division series. 
</P>
<P>
	The win provided hope that Houston will end its history of  
playoff failures, and was a troubling start for a team with its own 
postseason struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros sealed the victory in the ninth with four runs  
against reliever Mike Remlinger. Carl Everett had a sacrifice fly 
before Ken Caminiti haunted the Braves again with a three-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing for San Diego, Caminiti hit a 10th-inning homer against  
Kerry Ligtenberg to win the first game of the 1998 NL championship 
series. The Padres went on to a 4-2 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The East champion Braves, making their eighth straight  
postseason appearance, lost only their second division series game 
since the format was instituted in 1995. Before Tuesday, they were 
12-1 overall, including 10 straight victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, which clinched its third straight Central title on the  
final day of the season, has never won in five playoff series, 
including a 3-0 sweep by the Braves in 1997. The Astros won't get 
swept this year, seizing the home-field advantage in the best-of-5 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the home field was not much of an advantage to the  
Braves, who led the majors with 103 wins but drew the smallest 
crowd in Atlanta's 44-game postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnout of 39,119 was nearly 11,000 short of capacity at  
Turner Field and easily eclipsed the previous low of 42,117 for 
Game 1 of the 1998 NL championship series. In the right-field upper 
deck, only a few dozen people occupied seven sections of blue 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, the son of former major leaguer Gary Ward, was recalled  
from the minors for the second time on July 20. He took over for 
the slumping Derek Bell and doubled in the first three runs Sunday 
of a 9-4 victory over Los Angeles, securing the division title. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he came through again, hitting the first pitch of  
the sixth into the right-field seats against Maddux to break a 1-1 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves managed only seven hits against starter Shane  
Reynolds, who went six innings, and three relievers. Houston 
pitched around MVP candidate Chipper Jones, walking him twice on 
four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros went ahead in the second. Everett led off with a bunt  
single, Caminiti walked and Tony Eusebio drove in the run with a 
line drive up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maddux escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam by pitching out  
on an attempted squeeze bunt by Shane Reynolds. Caminiti, breaking 
from third, was tagged by Chipper Jones just short of home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros loaded the bases again with one out in the fifth, but  
Caminiti grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves tied it in their half of the inning, Gerald Williams  
driving home Jose Hernandez with a two-out single to center. The 
Braves then loaded the bases, but Ryan Klesko struck out swinging 
on a 90 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	On the very next pitch, Ward homered into the first row of the  
right-field seats to open the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros didn't leave for Atlanta until late Monday night,  
waiting at the Houston airport for the outcome of a wild-card 
playoff in Cincinnati. When the New York Mets beat the Reds 5-0, 
the chartered jet flew east. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston was a clear underdog against the powerful Braves, having  
lost six of seven meeting during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta clinched its division with a week to go, winning 11 of  
its last 13 games. After a 12-game winning streak in September, 
Houston lost nine of its last 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux was 19-9 during the regular season and had the same  
record lifetime against the Astros with a 2.30 ERA. But he also 
surrendered a career-high 258 hits, a trend that continued in the 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux slipped to 9-9 lifetime in postseason play. He had been  
4-0 in the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston had 10 hits in seven innings against Maddux, but  
stranded eight runners. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Braves are the first NL team to claim 10 division  
titles. Oakland has captured 10 division flags in the AL. ... Ernie 
Johnson, who retired after nearly four decades as a Braves 
broadcaster, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... The pitchers 
for Game 2: Atlanta's Kevin Millwood (18-7) against Houston's Jose 
Lima (21-10). ... In the last three division series, Braves 
pitchers had a 1.30 ERA ... The Braves scored a franchise-record 
840 runs, eclipsing the mark of 826 set the previous season. ... 
Houston's Larry Dierker is only the fourth manager in baseball 
history to lead his team to first-place finishes in each of his 
first three seasons. The others: Detroit's Hughie Jennings 
(1907-09), Ralph Houk of the New York Yankees (1961-63) and Jim 
Frey with Kansas City (1980, second half of '81) and Cubs.

	RUSTIC, Colo. (AP) -- Four fresh dog teams failed to find any  
sign Tuesday of a 3-year-old boy who disappeared while hiking with 
family and friends in rugged 9,000-foot-high mountains over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams planned to expand the search for Jaryd Atadero on  
Wednesday with up to 60 people involved.

	Jaryd disappeared Saturday afternoon in terrain so rocky the  
search dogs have to wear pads to protect their feet. It was a few 
minutes before anyone noticed the boy was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaryd is a very strong, mobile kid,'' said his father, Allyn

<HEADLINE> Fuel Efficiency Falls, Thanks to SUV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popularity of gas-guzzling sport utility  
vehicles has pushed down the average overall automobile fuel 
economy to its lowest level in nearly 20 years, the Environmental 
Protection Agency says. 
</P>
<P>
	An EPA report said 1999 model cars and light trucks, including  
SUVs, averaged 23.8 miles per gallon in government tests, compared 
with 25.9 mpg in 1987-88, when fuel economy fleetwide reached its 
peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel economy for motor vehicles ``has been consistently falling  
since the late 1980s'' because of the growing number of light 
trucks, and for 1999 models, it declined to about where it was in 
1980, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks, which include most SUVs, minivans and pickups, are  
subject to less stringent fleetwide fuel economy government 
requirements than passenger sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes amid a growing controversy over whether the  
government should raise its fuel economy requirements for new cars 
and, particularly, for light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of eight major environmental groups released a letter  
Tuesday to President Clinton, questioning why he plans to sign a 
$50 billion transportation spending bill that specifically bars 
changes in federal fuel economy requirements, or even studying such 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban ``is the clearest example of a rider (on a spending  
bill) that strangles a program that promotes energy efficiency,'' 
the environmentalists complained. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, who spoke on condition of not being  
further identified, said Clinton will sign the bill, which Congress 
completed late Monday, because ``we don't have anywhere near the 
votes'' to sustain a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, 40 senators voted for a nonbinding resolution  
calling for a study on how best to improve the fuel economy 
standards, but the official said many of those senators would not 
support a veto of a bill that provides billions of dollars in 
highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter to Clinton was sent by leaders of the Sierra Club,  
U.S.PIRG, National Environmental Trust, Environmental Defense Fund, 
National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, 
Union of Concerned Scientists, and Physicians for Social 
Responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists also complained that the EPA should have  
released its report sooner so it could have been used in 
congressional debate. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA spokesman David Cohen said the report, put on the EPA's Web  
site last Friday but not otherwise publicized, was made public as 
soon as it was completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report shows the impact of the popularity of SUVs on overall  
fuel economy of new vehicle fleets. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the average fuel economy for new 1999 passenger cars was  
28.1 mpg, but the average for light trucks, including SUVs and 
minivans, was 20.3 mpg. As a result, overall fuel economy for 
passenger vehicles was 23.8 mpg, the lowest since 1980 and 
six-tenths of a mile per gallon lower than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased market share of light trucks, which now account  
for 46 percent of all new vehicles sold, ``is the primary reason 
for the decline in fuel economy,'' said the EPA report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Bergquist of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers,  
said the decline in fleetwide fuel economy is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gas is cheap and the economy is good,'' she said. ``So while  
consumers care about fuel economy, other things become more 
important such as utility, cargo space, passenger space and vehicle 
comfort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government requires new passenger cars to meet a 27.5 mpg  
fleet average, and new light trucks a 20.5 mpg fleet average. 
Manufacturers face fines if the fleet average is not met unless 
they have credits from past years when they exceeded the standard.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Gov Aide Got Help From Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Records show that a court official fixed  
a speeding ticket for the governor's top aide -- another revelation 
in a scandal that has led to the resignation of Alabama's state 
police director and the suspension of three aides. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's press secretary, Carrie Kurlander, played it down  
Tuesday, saying ``judges dismiss tickets all the time after hearing 
circumstances of the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But records show the speeding ticket that a trooper gave Paul  
Hamrick, Gov. Don Siegelman's chief of staff, never made it to a 
judge. The ticket would have cost Hamrick $128, but Fred Posey, the 
circuit court clerk in Autauga County for more than 50 years, 
agreed to drop it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing you can do about it,'' Posey said. ``That's  
the system and that's the way it has always been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman suspended three other aides in his office and forced  
the public safety director to resign after The Associated Press 
last week reported a pattern of ticket-fixing in Alabama. The 
governor has ordered several agencies to investigate and has asked 
legislative leaders and court officials to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Records show Hamrick was stopped in his BMW in 1998 and charged  
with traveling 78 mph in a 55 mph zone. Hamrick had been 
Siegelman's chief of staff when Siegelman was lieutenant governor 
and at the time was involved in Siegleman's successful campaign for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kurlander said Hamrick's ticket would be reviewed by the  
governor's chief legal adviser, along with the other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ticket is not evidence of anything improper,'' she said.  
``It doesn't mean there was any wrongdoing.''

<HEADLINE> Gordon on Boston Postseason Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Boston closer Tom Gordon's sidetracked season  
took a positive turn when he was put on the postseason roster 
despite missing 3 1/2 months with an injured elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox manager Jimy Williams confirmed it Tuesday although the  
official announcement of rosters for the best-of-5 division series 
against the Cleveland Indians was expected Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also indicated that infielders Lou Merloni and Donnie  
Sadler, who both spent most of the season in the minors, were on 
the roster which includes 11 pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The series begins Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's major league record streak of 54 successful  
regular-season save opportunities ended June 5 in a 6-5 loss to 
Atlanta. He also blew a save opportunity in his next appearance, 
June 11 against the New York Mets. After the game, he returned to 
Boston for an MRI and three days later was placed on the disabled 
list with a right elbow strain. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams sidestepped a question about what role Gordon would  
play, then discussed it when he heard Gordon told reporters he was 
on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is on our roster,'' Williams said. ``I didn't think he'd  
make it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon made three minor league rehabilitation appearances and  
returned to action with Boston last Wednesday when he gave up two 
runs in one inning as the Chicago White Sox handed him a 4-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched twice more -- allowing two runs in 1 2-3 innings  
against Baltimore last Friday and pitching a perfect inning against 
the Orioles last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw good on that road trip those last few games,''  
Williams said. ``We'll use him in any part of the game that we 
think is the right spot to use him to help us win that game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it would be smart to bring him in in the middle  
of an inning,'' he added. ``He has thrown the ball very well, 
especially the last couple of times out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, his first full season as Boston's closer, Gordon was  
7-4 with a 2.72 ERA and an AL-best 46 saves. He blew just one 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he had 11 saves, an 0-2 record and a 5.60 ERA in 21  
appearances. In 1998 and 1999, he was 2-0 against the Indians with 
six saves and a 1.17 ERA in 7 2-3 innings during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But in last year's division series against Cleveland, he blew a  
save opportunity as Boston lost the decisive fourth game 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	In his absence, Tim Wakefield, Derek Lowe and Rod Beck took  
turns in the closer's role. Wakefield and Lowe each had 15 saves 
and Beck had three in 12 appearances after being obtained from the 
Chicago Cubs on Aug. 31.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, MIT Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology and the Microsoft Corp. are collaborating on a 
five-year, $25 million project to develop more sophisticated 
technology to improve higher education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Project I-Campus'' will be based at MIT and involve MIT  
faculty and students and Microsoft researchers. Microsoft is 
funding the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft views education as one of the great frontiers where  
information-based services and advanced technology can improve 
people's lives,'' Rick Rashid, vice president of Microsoft 
Research, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some academic officials question, however, whether having one  
giant corporation and one leading university develop these 
technologies alone is in the best interests of the rest of the 
higher-education community. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Newton, chairman of the electrical engineering and  
computer sciences department at the University of California at 
Berkeley, said it was good that Microsoft was investing in the 
topic. ``But any restrictions on the use of this technology would 
be unfortunate,'' he told The New York Times. ``Ultimately, this is 
the sort of stuff that shouldn't be in the hands of one company or 
one university.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal provides Microsoft with the first option to patent  
innovations arising from research done jointly by MIT and 
Microsoft. Rights for research done entirely at MIT but financed by 
Microsoft will belong to the university, but Microsoft will have 
the right to license it without paying royalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will begin by researching how information  
technology can improve three MIT programs, including a graduate 
level engineering course taught simultaneously in Singapore and at 
MIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The course, taught to 45 students at MIT, is broadcast over the  
Internet to 30 students at the National University of Singapore. 
The goal is increased participation from the students in Singapore 
through things like joint projects and tutoring sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The project also is expected to focus on developing tools to aid  
student learning from a distance, Web-based virtual museums and 
``global classrooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates pledged last month to donate $1  
billion for college scholarships for minority students. The ``Gates 
Millennium Scholars Program,'' supported by the world's richest man 
-- a Harvard dropout -- and his wife, Melinda, will provide 1,000 
scholarships a year for 20 years to Asian-American, black, Hispanic 
and American Indian students.

<HEADLINE> Web Privacy Protection Big Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies are producing new software and new  
technologies at an unprecedented rate to protect the privacy of 
consumers on the Internet, but profits remain elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	These new tools help people online preserve their anonymity,  
keep credit-card numbers safe and warn them about Web sites that 
may sell their personal secrets to others. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell Inc., the $1 billion computer networking giant, planned  
to introduce its latest Web privacy tool, called ``Digital Me,'' at 
an Internet trade show in New York today. 
</P>
<P>
	A Novell executive, Mike Sheridan, told Congress this year that  
the technology will let consumers cloak themselves behind different 
profiles to control what information Internet sites collect. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Enonymous Inc. released its clever, free software  
program, which warns consumers about each Web site's privacy 
promises whenever they're asked to surrender their name, e-mail 
address and other personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a small Internet startup based in San Diego, said  
it reviewed and rated the privacy guarantees of the 10,000 most 
popular Web sites, including those by Amazon.com Inc., America 
Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The tool means consumers won't need 
to study the fine print on promises, which can be hard to find and 
filled with legal jargon. 
</P>
<P>
	``For consumers who don't want to go through and read a privacy  
statement, this is a really great thing for them,'' said Michelle 
Slack, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a New York research 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The software displays warnings for those sites with weak  
guarantees. Enonymous promised to update its ratings regularly and 
review new policies at Web sites other than the top 10,000 where 
its customers spend time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be adversarial with Web sites,'' said David  
Taylor, the company's chief executive officer. ``We want them to 
realize it's good for business to have a good privacy policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and federal regulators have so far resisted calls for  
new national privacy laws protecting Internet users. They say these 
new products -- with names like Anonymizer, Privacy Bank, Freedom 
and Privaseek's Persona -- are laudable responses to consumer fears 
about shopping on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey this year by the Pew Research Center for the People and  
the Press found that 54 percent of people expressed some anxiety 
about computers and technology being used to invade their privacy. 
Women and the elderly worried most. 
</P>
<P>
	But profits, or the lack thereof, remain the main hurdle for  
companies selling privacy products. Many Web sites earn money 
selling targeted advertising or information about its customers 
from lists of visitors -- the same behaviors that privacy tools try 
to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's astonishingly difficult to make money out of privacy,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
advocate. He cited ``an enormous economic incentive to extract 
information rather than protect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't want to pay for privacy,'' Catlett said. ``It's  
like paying for clean air or clean drinking water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were making money, something would probably be  
wrong,'' joked Marc Rotenberg of the Washington-based Electronic 
Privacy Information Center. ``It will be interesting to see how 
these firms focusing on privacy are making it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enonymous said it plans to earn money acting as an  
``infomediary,'' a growing category of companies that shield the 
identities of their customers but pass to marketing companies and 
Web sites the demographic information its customers choose to 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies can then relay ads and information to specific  
types of consumers -- based on age, gender or interests -- without 
knowing their real-world identities because Enonymous acts as a 
trusted go-between. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at privacy specifically, nobody's made any money  
yet,'' allowed Abner Germanow, an Internet analyst for 
International Data Corp. ``Nobody's made tens of millions or 
hundreds of millions. But if you look at how Enonymous is planning 
on making its money, there are lots of very profitable companies 
that do similar things.''

<HEADLINE> Annan Wants UN Force in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With East Timor's government structures  
destroyed, the U.N. chief outlined a plan on Tuesday for the United 
Nations to take control and protect the territory with a 
9,000-strong peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. troops would replace the Australian-led force sent to East  
Timor last month to rein in pro-Indonesian militias who went on a 
looting, burning and killing campaign after the territory's vote 
for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation in East Timor is critical,'' Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan said in a report outlining his proposals to place U.N. 
peacekeepers in East Timor until it becomes independent in about 
two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council for Timorese Resistance, a pro-independence  
umbrella organization, will be ``a key player'' in the U.N. 
administration, said Bernard Miyet, head of U.N. peackeeping. The 
council is headed by Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, likely to be 
East Timor's first president. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations is to assume civilian and military control of  
East Timor after Indonesia's parliament ratified the results of the 
independence referendum in late October or early November, 
according to the May 5 agreement between Indonesia and Portugal 
that paved the way for the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	But because of the precarious humanitarian situation in the  
province, Annan said, the U.N. civilian authority must immediately 
take charge of infrastructure, including water, electricity, 
hospitals, courts and some public offices. 
</P>
<P>
	He recommended the urgent deployment of 460 U.N. civilian  
police, and asked the Security Council to deploy a total of 1,640 
U.N. police, 8,950 peacekeepers and 200 military observers. The 
council is expected to consider the report on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, Annan's proposal for East Timor is similar to his  
plan for Kosovo after NATO ended its bombing campaign and Yugoslav 
forces withdrew from the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Kosovo, the United Nations will take over East Timor's  
defunct court and law enforcement systems, a chief administrator 
will have authority to make and change laws, and deputy 
administrators will govern the territory -- resettling refugees and 
rebuilding their torched homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Kosovo, there will be more need for international  
experts to run those public sectors, Miyet said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, ethnic Albanians ran a parallel administration to  
that of the Serbs in education, health and other areas, and were 
able to resurrect it under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not the case in East Timor,'' Miyet said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the U.N. Transitional Administration in East  
Timor, known as UNTAET, will need to involve as many East Timorese 
as possible so as to prepare them eventually to run the territory 
independently, Miyet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the U.N. effort could cost hundreds of millions of  
dollars, the bulk of which would go toward the peacekeeping 
operation, said Joseph Connor, the undersecretary-general for 
management. But no firm figures were available yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyet said he was optimistic that member states would contribute  
troops, and that the council would approve the size of the force. 
He didn't rule out that some members of the Australian-led force -- 
mainly Asian countries -- could remain in East Timor under U.N. 
control.

<HEADLINE> Data Show Smoke Reduces Rainfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Satellite data have provided the first  
evidence that smoke from forest fires reduces rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen evidence of decreased precipitation in clouds  
contaminated by smoke, but it wasn't until now that we had direct 
evidence showing that smoke actually suppresses precipitation 
completely from certain clouds,'' said Daniel Rosenfeld, who 
reports the finding in a paper scheduled for the Oct. 15 edition of 
Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld studied the area of Kalimantan, Indonesia, during a  
satellite overpass on March 1, 1998. The southeastern portion of 
the island was engulfed in smoke, while the northwestern portion 
was relatively smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft's radar detected precipitation in smoke-free  
clouds, but almost none in the smoke-plagued clouds, showing the 
impact of smoke from fires on precipitation over the rainforest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenfeld, a satellite scientist at the Institute of Earth  
Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, did the research as part 
of NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission project. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain is formed in one of two processes, a cold form in which  
moisture condenses on ice crystals, and a warm form -- common in the 
tropics -- in which raindrops grow by colliding and combining with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows that the ``warm rain'' processes are practically  
shut off when the clouds are polluted with heavy smoke from forest 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	In these clouds, scientists found, the cloud tops must grow  
considerably above the freezing level of 16,000 feet in order for 
them to start producing rain by the alternative mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists study how changes in global precipitation affect  
human activities, such as crop production, and the global rainfall 
weather pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to note that this is not a unique case,''  
Rosenfeld said in a statement. ``We observed and documented several 
other cases that showed similar behavior. In some instances, even 
less severe smoke concentration was found to have comparable 
impacts on clouds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies of urban air pollution have shown that pollution  
in Manila, Philippines, has an effect similar to forest fires, 
according to Rosenfeld.

<HEADLINE> Gold Rallies; Cocoa Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures prices surged higher in trading Tuesday on the New  
York Commodity Exchange, at one point hitting a two-year high of 
$339 a troy ounce before falling back on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cocoa futures prices fell, coffee futures  
prices gained and crude oil futures slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices surged at the start of trading on the COMEX as the  
market reacted to reports of a large gold transaction during 
overnight trading, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Also influencing the market were reports a number of hedge  
funds, which have been trading gold on ideas prices will remain 
low, were trying to limit their losses now that gold prices are 
rising, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's huge early gains were already being trimmed when the  
Federal Reserve Bank announced it was leaving interest rates 
unchanged, which added to the price retreat. There was some belief 
in the market that the Fed would hike rates, causing the stock 
market to tumble and send investors fleeing to gold, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold market continues to react to last week's announcement  
by the central banks of several European countries that they will 
limit their gold sales to 2,000 metric tons over the next five 
years and freeze their gold lending levels during the same period, 
according to analyst Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by the European banks created the perception in  
the market that gold supplies have tightened, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Australian National Bank announced it has no  
plans to sell gold for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for December delivery settled $8 higher at $326 a troy  
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures prices tumbled on the New York Coffee, Sugar and  
Cocoa Exchange as the market reacted to indications cocoa 
production will outpace demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's top two  
producing nations, are harvesting their main crops, which are 
reported to be large, according to analysts. Indonesia, the third 
largest producer, also is reported to have a large cocoa crop. This 
is coming at a time when European processors are reporting 
lackluster demand from major importing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	December cocoa was $36 lower at $975 per metric ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose on concern about the condition of Brazil's  
2000-2001 coffee crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Several coffee cooperatives in Brazil are reporting crop losses  
of up to 25 percent. Local experts are reporting there has not been 
enough rain to keep the coffee trees in shape to produce an 
expected 40 million bag crop, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	An agronomist with one Brazilian coffee cooperative, Pocos de  
Caldas, is estimating Brazilian coffee output will total 30 million 
to 36 million bags, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee was 2.20 cents higher at 85.05 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices were lower for the third consecutive  
trading session on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The move lower was in reaction to concerns that an American  
Petroleum Institute inventory report will show steady or increased 
crude oil stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	API data released after the close of trading show crude stocks  
increased 1 million barrels last week. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was concern in the market about a planned November  
meeting of the oil ministers of Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, 
analysts said. They are expected to discuss whether to maintain 
current production levels past March. 
</P>
<P>
	November light sweet crude was 31 cents lower at $23.45 a  
barrel; November heating oil was .95 cent lower at 59.61 cents a 
gallon; November unleaded gasoline was .36 cent lower at 66.69 a 
gallon; November natural gas was .039 cent lower at $2.586 per 
1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Jim Brown Sentenced to Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NFL great Jim Brown was sentenced Tuesday to  
three years of probation and ordered to take domestic violence 
counseling for smashing his wife's car with a shovel during an 
argument that led her to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also must pay $1,500 to a battered women's shelter and  
another $200 to a domestic violence fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old Hall of Famer, who was not in court, was told to  
appear Oct. 20 with proof that he had joined a counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's lawyer told Municipal Court Judge Dale Fischer that his  
client opposed any sentencing that included domestic violence 
conditions. He noted that a jury found Brown guilty only of 
misdemeanor vandalism on Sept. 10, acquitting him of a charge that 
he made a terrorist threat against his wife, Monique. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfair to put any conditions of domestic violence on a  
man who's been actually found not guilty of domestic violence,'' 
lawyer William Graysen said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he believed the court was making an example of Brown,  
Graysen said, ``It would appear so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor disputed that view.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're simply trying to hold him, like any other ordinary  
citizen, accountable,'' Deputy City Attorney Grace Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was not in Hollywood Municipal Court because he had been  
visiting a daughter in Atlanta and missed the plane home, his 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge placed Brown on 36 months' probation, ordering him to  
enroll in and complete a ``batterer's counseling program'' and to 
complete either 40 days of work with the Hollywood Beautification 
Team, or 400 hours of other court-approved community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also must pay a $100 fine, $1,500 to a battered women's  
shelter and $200 to a domestic violence fund. His driver's license 
was suspended for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the judge imposed a three-year protective order,  
similar to one that was in place for the trial. It bars Brown from 
annoying, harassing, threatening or committing violence against 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	If she wishes, Mrs. Brown may request further conditions for the  
protective order to keep Brown away and bar him from possessing 
weapons, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cleveland Browns running back has a long history of  
arrests for alleged attacks on women but never has been convicted. 
He was prosecuted for making a terrorist threat against his 
25-year-old wife even though she recanted her accusations to police 
that he had threatened to snap her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified that she made her initial remarks following a June  
15 fight at the couple's Hollywood Hills home to get attention, 
because she believed her husband was having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	In court, the prosecutor argued that under California law a  
crime is domestic violence if it is committed against someone 
defined as being in a domestic relationship with the defendant, 
such as a wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Graysen countered that the law is not intended to include crimes  
of property damage that did not involve violence or threats against 
an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown testified that she was not frightened or threatened,  
Graysen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee disagreed, contending Mrs. Brown was so frightened ``she had  
to run as far away as she could, to a complete stranger, to call 
911 for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In asking for leniency, Graysen said Brown admitted he smashed  
the car windows with a shovel, and he quickly had the damage 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that that was a very, very moderate offense and  
should receive a very moderate sentence,'' Graysen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, however, called it ``an extremely serious form of  
vandalism'' and noted that Brown struck the car three times with 
``tremendous force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems obvious to me that Mr. Brown needs counseling'' to  
control his anger, she said.

<HEADLINE> WWII Laborers Seek Remuneration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of negotiations, German companies  
are coming to the table with an offer on how much compensation 
they're willing to pay Nazi-era slave laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	And in advance of the two-day talks starting today, survivors  
launched a newspaper ad campaign and held a news conference to push 
for what they call a quick and just compensation settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said the ad campaign will continue through the talks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The corporations who exploited us and who, in genocidal  
partnership with the SS, murdered our friends and relatives have 
grown rich. ... They are worth countless billions,'' Rudy Kennedy, 
a Holocaust survivor from London, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy spoke at a news conference in advance of today's  
reopening of negotiations in Washington to determine compensation 
for as many as 2.4 million people forced into labor to aid 
Germany's Nazi war machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were treated like animals,'' said an ad about Ford Motor  
Co. and its wartime German subsidiary, Ford Werke AG, displayed at 
the news conference. It had not yet run in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer (haggled) over the purchase price of 150 female  
prisoners on whom to test a sleeping medication,'' said an ad on 
the pharmaceutical company that ran in Tuesday's New York Times. 
``Bayer found $80 per woman too high a price. They ultimately 
bought them for less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges are not new, but their presentation in full-page ads  
came as survivors and their attorneys attacked a reported 
compensation offer from 16 German companies as ``a disgrace,'' ``an 
insult'' and ``peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney in the negotiations threatened to walk out of the  
talks if industry's offer today is too low. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't step up to the plate and start negotiating ...  
with real money that is representative of their ability to pay, we 
are going to walk away from these meetings,'' said attorney Mel 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss said that in months of negotiations, the German companies  
have never given a specific figure of how much they would pay. 
Instead, he said, survivors have relied on newspaper reports and 
rumors for an idea of what might be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss quoted such a report Tuesday in The Washington Post that  
said compensation of $3.8 billion, or $200 per forced labor 
survivor, is being contemplated. He called that offer a ``paltry 
amount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in Boston, Wolfgang Gibowski, spokesman for the  
German business initiative, said the $3.8 billion figure was wrong 
but would not divulge the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, at the Washington new conference, Weiss also declined  
to say how much survivors are demanding but said it was ``far in 
excess'' of the $20 billion reported elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, leading politicians in Germany pressured German  
businesses to reach an agreement quickly. The German government's 
envoy to the talks, Otto Lambsdorff, pointing to the ad campaign, 
also warned that failure of the talks could damage relations with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said this week that he would be bringing a final  
offer to the table during the talks starting today at the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Reinert, a spokesman at Bayer headquarters in Leverkusen,  
Germany, said Bayer was absorbed during the Nazi era into the IG 
Farben pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer rejects legal responsibility for whatever may have  
happened under the Nazi dictatorship and at IG Farben,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Bayer is aware of a humanitarian responsibility and  
therefore is taking part in negotiations aimed at creating a 
foundation for the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Dearborn, Mich., a Ford spokesman said the company is doing  
research to learn what happened at Ford operations after they were 
placed under government control during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford is part of the global community and is dedicated to  
supporting humanitarian initiatives because it's the right thing to 
do,'' said Jim Vella, Ford global news director.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, CAW Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers said it reached a  
tentative contract agreement with DaimlerChrysler AG late Tuesday, 
less than two hours before 13,800 union workers were set to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said at a news conference in Toronto  
that the deal was modeled on an agreement the CAW rank-and-file 
ratified last week with Ford Motor Co. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent deal,'' Hargrove said. ``I have absolutely  
no disappointment at all. After bargaining a long while, I know you 
don't get everything you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for DaimlerChrysler spokesmen at the Toronto  
hotel where negotiations were held were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides had appeared to be at a standstill hours earlier  
over four disputes involving union organizing and future work. The 
union had set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the union did not make any progress in its effort  
to force DaimlerChrysler to pressure a supplier, Magna 
International Inc., to recognize the union in Magna's Integram 
plant near Windsor, Ontario, which makes minivan seats for 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're walking away empty handed on the Magna issue,'' Hargrove  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We settled the issues of DaimlerChrysler. We didn't feel at  
that point we could justify taking down the DaimlerChrysler 
operation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove also had said that the union could strike over disputes  
at DaimlerChrysler plants in Windsor and Ajax, Ontario, where work 
has not been assigned. He said the CAW had reached agreements 
there, including saving more than 70 jobs at the Ajax plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said DaimlerChrysler is committed to new investment  
worth $400 million at the truck plant in Windsor, which has 2,000 
workers. He said he expects more workers to be hired there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plant is now positioned for the new products of the  
future. The jobs of the workers are now secure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler also agreed to take a neutral stand in CAW  
organizing efforts at the company's Freightliner heavy truck plant 
in St. Thomas, Ontario, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agreement between CAW and Ford, workers received a 3  
percent wage increase in each year of a three-year package, a 
$1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, a lucrative retirement package and 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the agreement with DaimlerChrysler also includes a  
$1,200 (Canadian) Christmas bonus and $800 tuition fees for 
dependents. He said that under the agreement 2,300 workers are 
eligible to retire immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW will now move on to negotiations with General Motors of  
Canada Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Principal Items in Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Principal items in the $288.8 billion defense authorization bill  
signed Tuesday by President Clinton: 

</P>
<P>
	--Provides 4.8 percent across-the-board basic military pay raises  
in January, rather than 4.4 percent as Clinton requested; and 
future pay raises each year through 2006 that would be 0.5 
percentage points higher than private-sector wages. It is the 
largest military pay raise in nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gives additional targeted salary increases of up to 5.5 percent  
for mid-career officers. The 150 highest-ranking generals and 
admirals would get even higher pay raises, up to $125,900 a year 
from the current top pay of $110,700. 
</P>
<P>
	--Revamps military pension plans, allowing service members to  
retire after 20 years of basic service at 50 percent of basic pay, 
up from the current 40 percent. Or the retiree could stay with the 
40 percent -- and get a $30,000 cash bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	--Consolidates the Energy Department's nuclear weapons program  
into a National Nuclear Security Administration and tightens 
security at government nuclear weapons laboratories. The 
reorganization follows reports of Chinese espionage at the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Authorizes $8.3 billion more than requested by the president on  
defense programs in fiscal year 2000, mostly to increase military 
readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provides $4.2 billion for anti-missile programs. That includes  
$867 million for the national missile defense program, $31 million 
more than Clinton requested. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requires the Pentagon to remove the remaining U.S. forces from  
Haiti by May 31, 2000. The administration announced last month that 
it would withdraw 450 full-time U.S. troops from Haiti by early 
next year, replacing them with rotating units made up largely of 
reservists. 
</P>
<P>
	--Requires the president to notify Congress of any potential  
violations of export control laws by U.S. companies that launch 
satellites from China; requires annual reports to Congress on the 
transfer of any U.S. military technology to China, Russia or 
terrorist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expands the size of Arlington National Cemetery by 44 acres by  
2025.

<HEADLINE> Americans' Use of MSAs Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More Americans are trying the experimental  
tax-free medical savings accounts that Republican lawmakers are 
pushing to make more widely available, but the growth in popularity 
is slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service says 11,727 of the accounts -- known  
as MSAs -- were opened between Jan. 1 and June 30, based on a tally 
of forms that new account holders must complete. The IRS also says 
809 more taxpayers reported contributions to MSAs on their 1998 tax 
returns than on 1997 returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The MSA count for 1998 included tax returns received by April  
15, and those expected to come in late. In total, the IRS projected 
that 42,477 taxpayers would report MSA contributions on their 1998 
returns. That compares with 41,668 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	MSAs let people set aside money, tax free, to pay routine  
medical bills and the premium for a high-deductible insurance 
policy -- cheaper than a regular health plan -- to protect them in 
the event of expensive illness. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Republican leaders are planning to bring legislation  
to the House floor that would open MSAs to all Americans, as part 
of a package of health care tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of Americans who previously had no health insurance  
at all are now covered because of MSAs and that is our top 
priority,'' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, 
R-Texas, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the taxpayers reporting MSA contributions on 1998 returns,  
the IRS said 24 percent, or 10,106, did not have health insurance 
before opening the accounts. Among the new 1999 account holders, 38 
percent, or 4,468, were previously uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, MSAs are available only to the self-employed or  
companies with fewer than 50 workers that want to offer them as an 
employee benefit, under a congressional pilot project that began in 
1997 and runs through 2000. Lawmakers limited that project to 
750,000 people, but participation has not come close to that. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS must report each October on the MSA experiment's  
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a separate Medicare test of MSAs for senior citizens  
was supposed to start this year, no insurance company has yet 
offered the companion coverage necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	That has led critics to call MSAs a bust. Among them,  
congressional Democrats and Clinton administration officials say 
the accounts provide less financial protection than traditional 
health insurance when people get sick, even as employers pay 
unnecessary contributions to the MSAs of the healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lousy deal. It's like Edsels and Humvees,'' said Rep.  
Pete Stark, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Republicans say easing restrictions on access to MSAs  
and the amount of tax-free contributions allowed will help them 
catch on with insurance companies and consumers.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Stomps on Presidents Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	On his flight home from the Ryder Cup, Davis Love III read every  
word in every story in the Boston newspapers about the great 
American comeback. He flew to Florida the next morning and read 
them all over again. 
</P>
<P>
	Not a day passed at the Buick Challenge that Love didn't have  
occasion to talk about the Ryder Cup, whether he was on the range 
or inside the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't get enough of it,'' he gushed.  
</P>
<P>
	But all it takes is one question for that boyish glee to be  
replaced with a furrowed brow. A guy who could spin yarns about the 
thrill of winning the Ryder Cup suddenly hit a snag as he 
contemplated what lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	What does this do to the Presidents Cup?  
</P>
<P>
	Love stared at the ground, puffed his cheeks and let the air out  
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whew,'' he finally said. ``I have to be careful here.''  
</P>
<P>
	Love walks a fine line because he is a member of the PGA Tour  
policy board, and the Presidents Cup is a PGA Tour creation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there was no denying what took place at The Country Club.  
The excitement, the passion and the pressure -- yes, even the 
boorish behavior by the Boston gallery -- exposed the Ryder Cup as 
the greatest spectacle in golf, one of the greatest events in all 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	And it may have exposed the Presidents Cup as, well, an  
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great event,'' Love said. ``But it's not as exciting as  
the Ryder Cup. You can see that in the players, and you can see 
that in the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some might argue you can see it in the results, too. Just 10  
months ago, an uninspired American team trudged down to Australia 
and got hammered like never before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in December, there were some guys on the team -- and I'm  
on that list, too -- that maybe weren't there 100 percent,'' said 
Justin Leonard, who was 0-3-1 at Royal Melbourne and didn't make 
any 45-foot putts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to play well and we wanted to win,'' he said. ``But  
there wasn't the excitement as a team that we had for the Ryder Cup 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, did the Ryder Cup hurt the Presidents Cup?  
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, yes,'' Leonard replied.  
</P>
<P>
	To what degree remains to be seen. The Presidents Cup will never  
become a real clash as long as it pits Team USA against Team 
Florida (nine International players have homes in Florida). Of 
course, that could actually be to its credit if the Ryder Cup turns 
into the Retaliation Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Presidents Cup is a happier contest. That's undeniable,''  
said Peter Thomson, who returns as the International captain next 
year. ``There are no threats, no ugliness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the gallery was exemplary at Royal Melbourne. They were  
knowledgeable and respectful. They cheered long and loud for the 
home team, but also applauded the few great shots produced by the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it was they were beating us so badly,'' Leonard said.  
``There was probably some pity in their applause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are compelling issues involving the 2000 Presidents Cup at  
the Robert Trent Jones Club in Virginia. Can the Americans remain 
undefeated on home soil? Can they win back the one professional cup 
they no longer have? 
</P>
<P>
	Can they keep Greg Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els &AMP; Co. from  
worldwide bragging rights? 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a view that the International team could be the equal  
of the U.S. team -- and much, much better than the European team,'' 
Thomson said. ``I know everyone in the International lineup is very 
keen to make a point that we've been overlooked as a third force in 
the world of golf. This team may lay claim to being top dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happens after next year is the real dilemma.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Presidents Cup moves to South Africa, another  
long trip after another long season. And for what? As Lanny Wadkins 
noted about the previous Presidents Cup, the Americans flew halfway 
around the world to play a bunch of guys from Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods and David Duval will be playing on their sixth team.  
It could be the 11th straight team for Love. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are guys on our team who don't want to go to South  
Africa in 2002,'' Love said. ``Before they announce another 
captain, we need to say, 'Look. We need to expand this to get 
another team involved.' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to figure out something that makes everybody excited  
about it,'' he said. ``Because there are five or six guys who 
didn't want to go last time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There may be twice as many who don't want to go in 2002 because  
they are emotionally exhausted. If not, it's only because they 
aren't wasting any emotion on one of the cups. 
</P>
<P>
	Care to guess which one?

<HEADLINE> CDC Allots $32 Million for HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
awarded $32 million to more than 100 organizations Tuesday in an 
effort to expand HIV prevention efforts in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came a day after the CDC awarded $7 million to  
seven states to reduce the rate of HIV in prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say one in 50 black men and one in 160 black women  
are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Hispanics also 
have been disproportionately impacted -- Hispanics make up 11.5 
percent of the national population but account for 20 percent of 
new HIV infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to black community organizations,  
organizations for minority gay men and black religious groups.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 7, Blackhawks 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Owen Nolan and Jeff Friesen each scored  
a hat trick, and Nolan added three assists as the San Jose Sharks 
defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 7-1 Monday night in a game marred 
by a major third-period brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Mark Janssens instigated the brawl when he charged  
into Sharks goalie Steve Shields with 1:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
	All 12 players on the ice and one from the bench got involved  
and a total of 84 penalty minutes were assessed, including game 
misconducts to Janssens and Bob Probert of Chicago, and San Jose's 
Shields, Alex Korolyuk, Patrick Marleau and Brantt Myhres. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks are 2-0 for the first time in their nine-year  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Daze scored for the Blackhawks, who were playing their  
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan got his 10th career hat trick and his six points set a San  
Jose record. Friesen recorded his second career hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks also set a franchise record with four power-play  
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Damphousse had four assists and Gary Suter, who missed  
all but one game last season due to an elbow injury, added two 
assists for the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	Daze picked up a loose puck in front of the net and slipped it  
through Shields' legs with 17:28 left in the first period to give 
the Blackhawks the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan scored his first two goals during a 1:06 span in the first  
period. 
</P>
<P>
	With San Jose skating with a two-man advantage, Suter passed the  
puck from the blue line to Nolan on the left side. Nolan's shot 
slipped past goalie Jocelyn Thibault to the stick side at 6:12. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over a minute later, Damphousse made a perfect pass from  
the right corner to Nolan, who beat Thibault from the far side of 
the crease. 
</P>
<P>
	Friesen, who has led the Sharks in scoring the last two years,  
got his first goal of the season with 45 seconds remaining in the 
first period. Nolan's shot glanced off a defenseman's skate and 
Friesen tapped the puck into an open net. Friesen scored two more 
goals in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan completed his hat trick midway through the second period.  
He took a shot that bounced off Thibault's chest into the air. 
Chicago defenseman Bryan McCabe tried to hand save it, but instead 
knocked it past Thibault. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephane Matteau scored San Jose's fifth goal at 10:52 of the  
third period after taking a pass from Brad Stuart along the left 
side.

<HEADLINE> Hachette Plans To Buy All of George </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hachette Filipacchi Magazines is in discussions  
to buy the Kennedy family's stake in George magazine, the political 
and lifestyle publication founded by John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``No final agreement has been reached as yet but hopefully an  
agreement will be completed relatively soon,'' company spokesman 
Keith Estabrook said Monday. He declined to provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette Filipacchi and the Kennedy family each own half of the  
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Monday in The New York Times, the  
president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, 
Jack Kliger, said Hachette planned to purchase the Kennedy family's 
stake in George over the next two weeks and invest $10 million in 
the magazine over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Estabrook said Kliger was unavailable for comment. Calls to the  
Kennedy family were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been concerns after Kennedy's death in a July 16  
airplane crash about whether the four-year-old magazine could 
survive without him. In addition to being its founder, Kennedy was 
the editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette publishes 28 consumer magazines including Car and  
Driver, Elle, Mirabella, Premiere and Woman's Day.

<HEADLINE> Mets Face Big Unit in Series Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks and New York opened  
their division series Tuesday night at an unusually late hour -- 
11:10 p.m. EDT -- with the Mets trying to regroup less than 24 hours 
after their emotional wild-card playoff victory in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Johnson (17-9) was on the mound for Arizona, trying to end  
his five-game losing streak in the playoffs. The slump was tied 
with Joe Bush (1914-23) and Doyle Alexander (1973-87) as the 
longest postseason skid in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	His lackluster 2-5 postseason record did not reflect how well he  
has pitched. His ERA in the postseason was a respectable 3.10. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 36, Johnson is coming off what he has called his best  
season, when he struck out 364, fourth-most in baseball history, 
and led the National League in ERA at 2.48. 
</P>
<P>
	Masato Yoshii, New York's best pitcher in the two months, got  
the start. Yoshii (12-8) was 5-0 in his last eight starts with a 
1.61 earned run average over that span. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets-Diamondbacks matchup was the third playoff game of the  
day in the majors. The start time at Bank One Ballpark was about an 
hour later than normal for night games, and was designed to let all 
postseason games be televised without conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Yoshii had faced each other once before. On May 30  
in New York, the Diamondbacks shelled Yoshii for seven runs in 2 
2-3 innings. Johnson, meanwhile, struck out 10 in eight innings in 
Arizona's 10-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets didn't arrive in Phoenix until nearly 2 a.m. after  
their 5-0 victory in Cincinnati. They advanced to the playoffs for 
the first time since 1988 despite a seven-game losing streak that 
left them on the brink of elimination with just five games to play. 
New York won four of five to force the playoff with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona spent $118.9 million on free agents, including Johnson,  
in the off-season and won the NL West title to become the first 
team to reach the playoffs in just its second season.

<HEADLINE> Bush Declines N.H. Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush has turned down an  
invitation to participate in a nationally televised Republican 
presidential forum later this month, citing a conflict with an 
event in Texas honoring his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the organizers understand that while the debate may be  
important, it's not nearly as important as me being with my wife on 
that day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's wife, Laura, is being honored at Southern Methodist  
University on Oct. 28, the same day as the Republican presidential 
forum at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign said Bush does not plan to participate in any  
debates before January. Bush has agreed to two debates in the new 
year -- a forum in Iowa sponsored by the Des Moines Register and one 
Jan. 26 in Manchester sponsored by CNN and WMUR-TV, according to 
the campaign and WMUR. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN and WMUR are the sponsors of the Oct. 28 forum and one the  
night before for Democratic candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	WMUR spokeswoman Julie Campasano said Tuesday that the Oct. 28  
GOP forum will go on without Bush. She said all the other 
Republican candidates have accepted invitations except Pat 
Buchanan, who is considering leaving the GOP and has not replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Two earlier debates were torpedoed after Bush declined to  
participate and the rest of the field saw no point in debating 
without the front-runner. One was in conjunction with the Ames, 
Iowa, straw poll in August. Another was originally planned for this 
weekend at the Florida Republican convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunshine State GOP, under reported pressure from Bush and  
his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, dropped the straw vote and 
decided instead on a debate Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Texas governor said he would not participate in  
that debate either, ending the proposed joint appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to debate next year when people are beginning to pay  
attention to the presidential race,'' said Bush campaign 
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still in the process of establishing Governor Bush as a  
presidential contender, laying out his ideas, his proposals and his 
vision of the future of America,'' she said. ``We have a game plan 
for this campaign and we are in the process of executing it.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Tobacco Lawyer S1/8reads essage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Some 35 million pages of documents gathered during  
a legal battle against tobacco companies in the United States could 
help similar cases across the world, an attorney who fought the 
tobacco industry and is now working for the World Health 
Organization said today. day. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Walburn helped the state of Minnesota reach a $6.6  
billion settlement with the tobacco industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	She is now advising groups in a number of countries on the  
content of the documents and suggesting how they could make use of 
them in their own litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been struck by how similar the tobacco industry  
arrangements are in a number of countries and the level of interest 
in the documents and in litigation,'' said Walburn, who is taking a 
year's leave from her law firm to work with the health 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal team in the Minnesota case forced tobacco companies to  
release the documents. The settlement included a clause making them 
available to the public, and many are now on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents, the attorneys claim they found evidence  
that tobacco companies had known for decades that nicotine was 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
	Cases against tobacco companies are currently going through the  
courts in about a dozen countries, including Australia, Canada, 
India, Britain, Ireland, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization is working with governments to  
create an international treaty on tobacco control. 
</P>
<P>
	Walburn said litigation is still an important part of the fight  
against the tobacco industry, even though it is slow and costly and 
many cases fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to hold the tobacco industry accountable for its  
actions and make this information available around the world for 
people in the public health community to use these documents and 
understand the public better,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Exhumed Body of Sheppard Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The body of Marilyn Sheppard was exhumed  
Tuesday and prosecutors performed tests to try to prove the guilt 
of her husband in the murder case that inspired the ``The 
Fugitive'' film and TV series. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do is get to the truth,'' said Cuyahoga County  
Prosecutor William Mason said. ``I don't think today's tests are 
definitively going to give us the killer but it's going to give us 
some answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had Mrs. Sheppard's body exhumed from a crypt in a  
suburban Cleveland cemetery to obtain new DNA samples as they 
defend the state in a wrongful imprisonment suit brought by the 
couple's son, Sam Reese Sheppard. The fetus she was carrying when 
she died also was exhumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard claims his father, Dr. Sam Sheppard, was unfairly  
convicted of killing his mother, who was beaten to death in 1954 in 
the bedroom of the family home on Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator said Tuesday's tests showed Mrs. Shepard did not  
bite her attacker 45 years ago. The possibility of bite marks on 
the killer was part of the defense testimony in the retrial 
Sheppard, who spent 10 years in prison for the slaying before being 
acquitted in 1966. Sheppard had no bite wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowell Levine, forensic dentist with the New York State Police,  
would not go into detail about the evidence about the biting, but 
said, ``It just didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard attorney Terry Gilbert said it was premature to discuss  
the findings on the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing also showed that the injuries to Mrs. Sheppard's  
face were much more extensive than expected, Mason said. The bones 
below her eye and around the mouth were detached from her face. 
</P>
<P>
	Forensic scientists for prosecutors and the Sheppard legal team  
were conducting tests of Mrs. Sheppard's mummified remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports on the scientists' findings will take two months.  
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard was present when his mother's casket was  
opened at Knollwood Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen people, wearing masks, protective headgear and  
slippers to avoid contaminating the remains, also were in the room 
but Sheppard was then allowed a few moments with only an undertaker 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	``The viewing was difficult,'' he said. ``I needed to witness  
that because I learned long ago that in terms of her murder my 
imagination is worse than the real thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard's remains are to be reinterred on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The fetus had been removed from Mrs. Sheppard's body shortly  
after her death and contained in a preservative solution in a glass 
jar. 
</P>
<P>
	Forensic scientists learned for the first time Tuesday that the  
fetus had been autopsied, which Gilbert said raised questions about 
whether the coroner's office around the time of the slaying had 
concealed evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard said he doesn't believe any evidence will be gained  
that will implicate his father. ``This is an exercise in 
futility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Sheppard and his lawyers contend DNA and other  
evidence point to a family window-washer, Richard Eberling, as the 
killer. Eberling died last year in prison, where he was serving a 
life sentence for an unrelated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mason believes the doctor was the killer and the DNA  
evidence collected by the Sheppard team is contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sheppard, who died in 1970, always claimed a bushy-haired  
intruder killed his wife and then knocked him unconscious when he 
ran to her aid.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Hit by Foul Ball in Dugout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer  
sustained cuts to the left jaw and ear when he was hit by a foul 
ball, and missed a few minutes of Tuesday night's playoff opener 
against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer was assisted out of the dugout after being struck by  
Chuck Knoblauch's foul in the fifth inning. The 68-year-old Zimmer 
returned with an icepack on his jaw while the Yankees were still 
batting, and joked with Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch lined a 2-1 pitch into the first-base dugout, and it  
struck Zimmer, who usually sits on the bench next to manager Joe 
Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was stopped for several minutes and, after Zimmer was  
helped off the floor, he was assisted back to the clubhouse by 
pitcher Andy Pettitte and assistant trainer Steve Donohue. 
Knoblauch crouched in the batter's box with a concerned look. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer managed the Yankees to a 21-15 record earlier this year  
while Torre recovered from prostate cancer surgery. Zimmer had 
talked of retirement during that time, hobbled by a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer twice had seasons ended by beanings, in 1953 at St. Paul  
and 1956 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in his 51st season in professional baseball. Zimmer, who  
coached for the Yankees in 1983 and 1986, rejoined the club as the 
bench coach in 1996, shortly after Torre was hired.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Williams Pays Off Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bernie Williams showed the New York Yankees why  
he was worth all that money. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams homered, doubled and drove in six runs Tuesday night to  
lead the New York Yankees to a 8-0 victory over the Texas Rangers 
in the first game of their best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams spent much of this season trying to live up to the  
$87.5 million, seven-year contract he signed in the offseason. He 
batted .342 with 202 hits, 115 RBIs, 116 runs and 100 walks -- all 
career highs -- and hit 25 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the only month that matters for the Yankees is October, and  
once again Williams stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard the lineup, something in me woke up,'' Williams  
said. ``It was time to play. This is the postseason. It's not the 
regular season anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams started his spectacular game with his glove, not his  
bat. With runners on first and second in the third inning, Juan 
Gonzalez hit a looping liner that Williams tracked down in 
right-center and made a sliding catch on to preserve a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I had a shot at it,'' Williams said. ``But at  
the last minute, the ball just stayed up a little bit longer than I 
anticipated. It gave me a chance to make a dive and I was fortunate 
enough to make the catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams then delivered at the plate. After being retired his  
first two at-bats, Williams came up with two on and two outs in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	He fell behind 0-2 to Aaron Sele before working the count full,  
fouling off a pitch and then launching a two-run double off the 
wall in center field to make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a pitch up when I didn't want to,'' Sele said. ``He took  
advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams put the game away in the sixth. With runners on first  
and second and two outs, Williams hit a homer to right field off 
Mike Venafro to make it 7-0. It was Williams' 10th career 
postseason homer in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``From his first at-bat to that last at-bat you saw a different  
player,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``That's what happens with 
Bernie. You never know when that this is going to get a hold of him 
and it's going to become something he can't get out of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also helped Torre out in the dugout. Torre was visibly  
shaken after bench coach Don Zimmer was hit in the jaw with a foul 
ball in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was the one who calmed him down.  
</P>
<P>
	``He definitely looked a little bit upset about the whole  
situation,'' Williams said. ``I came to his side and told him if he 
was all right, just to stay with us in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams biggest strength is at the plate. He capped his  
night off with an RBI single in the eighth off Jeff Fassero to give 
him 35 playoff RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight's an example of the type of team we have,'' Darryl  
Strawberry said. ``You don't look to any one person. Tonight it was 
Bernie. Next time it could be anyone else.''

	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- High school teacher Mary Ellen Parker put

Floyd, after all, had taught them all about the value of things. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was the first day Edgecombe County's 8,000 students had

120 residents displaced by the storm, the teacher was pleased with 
how the first day of classes went. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was better than I had hoped,'' she said after listening to  
her students share stories about the worst flooding in state 
history. ``I think they were glad for a change of pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's flooding was blamed for at least 48 deaths and is  
expected to surpass Hurricane Fran's $6 billion damage total in 
1996 as the state's costliest natural disaster. Floyd also spread 
damage northward along the East Coast into New England. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to insurance and local money, North Carolina will  
need a total of more than $5 billion in federal funds to recover 
from Floyd, Gov. Jim Hunt said today. Hunt already has requested $1 
billion, and he was headed to Washington today to seek $2.2 billion 
in emergency funds that will include aid for homeowners and 
farmers. Eventually, he said, the state will need an additional 
$2.1 billion for long-term recovery and planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``These (emergency) funds are essential to our families and our  
future,'' Hunt said at a news conference. ``But I want to emphasize 
it's only part of what we have to have over the long haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aerial spraying began this week over 21 North Carolina counties  
to fight the state's next headache: an exploding mosquito 
population. State officials said the mosquitoes didn't pose a 
significant public health threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Edgecombe County's 14 schools did not reopen at all; they  
were destroyed by floodwaters. Their 550 students will attend 
classes in trailers at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses are reopening one by one, and the Tar and Neuse  
rivers are expected to drop below flood stage this week for the 
first time since the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	In Parker's class, students took turns saying one word that  
described how they felt the last two weeks. ``Wet,'' ``lucky,'' 
``sad,'' ``relieved'' and ``blessed'' were some of the responses. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm drove more than 10,000 people into shelters, destroyed  
3,680 homes and damaged more than 12,000 others. The American Red 
Cross said 610 people remain in five shelters, including Tarboro 
High. 
</P>
<P>
	The homeless still living at the high school loitered outside as  
volunteers cooked meals at a mobile kitchen in a field and rows of 
portable toilets lined the edge of the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Students also filled out surveys asking which supplies or books  
they needed as replacements for ones destroyed or lost in the 
flooding. Most agreed they were ready to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like vacation, but this wasn't a vacation,'' said sophomore  
Jewel Gray as she started her Spanish homework after school. 
</P>
<P>
	A few students said they would rather be at home to help their  
families. ``I lost everything,'' said Jeff Squires, a senior. ``I 
don't see why we're here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the south in Duplin County, yellow ribbons and hugs greeted  
students and parents at Wallace Elementary School. Extra counselors 
from nearby Cumberland County were on hand to help students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're planning to ease back into academics slowly,'' said  
school principal Susan Wooten. ``Right now we just want them to 
regain feelings of comfort and security.''

<HEADLINE> Braves, Astros Ready for Series  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves relaxed in front on their  
television sets, wondering who they would play today. The Houston 
Astros sat on a runway, wondering if their plane would fly east or 
west? 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 o'clock Monday night, both teams finally got the  
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Central champion Astros, their travel plans in shambles  
because of a wild-card playoff game in Cincinnati, didn't learn 
they would play the Braves in the best-of-5 division series until 
the Reds lost 5-0 to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent the New Yorkers to Arizona, while the Astros turned  
their charter jet eastward and headed toward Atlanta to meet the 
team that has eight straight division titles and baseball's best 
record at 103-59. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I wouldn't want to play a game after flying to Arizona  
or coming here,'' Braves MVP candidate Chipper Jones said. ``That 
takes a toll on your body. It usually takes a day or two to 
regroup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the Braves got to a plane was Javy Lopez's  
remote-control version. 
</P>
<P>
	When rain wiped out a scheduled workout at Turner Field, the  
injured Atlanta catcher broke out his model aircraft, the stadium's 
vast expanse giving him plenty of room for a series of twisting, 
spinning maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (19-9), who will start the opener for Atlanta  
against Shane Reynolds (16-14), spent the night watching videos 
from his recent performances against both Houston and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cincinnati had won the playoff, Atlanta would have met the  
Reds and Houston would have played Arizona in the other division 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer to know,'' Maddux said earlier Monday. ``But I  
would prefer there be no traffic when I come to the park, too. It's 
really not that big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not after what the Braves went through this year. They lost  
cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg before 
opening day, while Lopez and pitchers Odalis Perez and Rudy Seanez 
went down during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a grittier, guttier team,'' Jones said. ``We're not  
going to pop anybody's eyes out. We don't have the firepower of 
some of our other teams. But we do the little things to score 
runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every year about this time, the Braves face questions about  
their lack of postseason success. Despite eight straight 
appearances -- three more than any team in baseball history -- they 
have won just one World Series title in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the dark cloud that always hangs over the Braves,''  
said Brian Jordan, who brought emotion to the clubhouse, not to 
mention a career-high 115 RBIs. ``Hopefully, this is the year we 
get the breaks and finally win another world championship. If not, 
we've still exceeded our expectations this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston clinched its third straight NL Central title on the  
final day of the regular season, finishing one game ahead of 
Cincinnati. The Astros have been quickly eliminated in their last 
two playoff trips, a sweep by Atlanta in 1997 and a 3-1 loss to San 
Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year it was new and maybe a little overwhelming.  
Last year we weren't able to do a lot,'' manager Larry Dierker 
said. ``This year, all we're ready to do is go out and play the 
best baseball we can. If it's 3-0 again, well, we're going to give 
it our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros didn't seem concerned about their late-night travel  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't bother them,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker  
said. ``I don't think anything can happen to this club that hasn't 
already happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Braves, Houston survived a devastating medical report.  
Moises Alou missed the entire season, while Derek Bell and Ken 
Caminiti were plagued by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the underdogs and maybe that's good,'' Reynolds said.  
``Everyone expects them to win, so let them have all the 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros went 1-6 against the Braves during the regular  
season, including a three-game sweep at the Turner Field, site of 
Games 1 and 2. The series shifts to Astrodome on Friday for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Houston's 20-game winners, Jose Lima (21-10), faces  
Kevin Millwood (18-7, 2.68 ERA) in Wednesday's game. Cy Young 
contender Mike Hampton (22-4) follows for the Astros against last 
year's Cy Young winner, Tom Glavine (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit for the Braves' success must go to manager  
Bobby Cox, who businesslike demeanor was criticized in the past, 
but served the team well when one player after another went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby didn't panic,'' Millwood said. ``We just went about our  
business the way we always have.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Forbes Plan Millions on Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bracing for an air war with presidential rival  
Steve Forbes, George W. Bush plans to spend up to $20 million on an 
issue-driven ad campaign in the early Republican primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is expected to spend at least as much to draw a ``sharp  
contrast'' between himself and Bush -- the two-term Texas governor 
and GOP front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Top advisers with both campaigns outlined the ad strategies  
Monday, revealing plans to spend more money on television ads than 
their GOP rivals will manage to raise altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	The brewing ad war reflects the huge money gap separating Bush  
and Forbes from the rest of the eight-person GOP field. It also 
signals Bush's plans to win the nomination and invest his 
record-shattering fund-raising warchest in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to spend (campaign money) in a way that will help me  
get the nomination and then, should I be the nominee, I'm not going 
to let happen to me what happened to Bob Dole and get defined 
between the primary season and the convention,'' Bush said in a 
recent interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole won the 1996 Republican nomination, but his campaign was  
broke and unable to respond to negative ads run by Democrats. 
``First thing is first -- win the nomination,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the Bush team is testing 13 to 15 potential ads in  
focus groups. Most of them feature a mixture of campaign trail 
footage and the candidate looking directly into the camera, talking 
about issues such as taxes, education, defense policy and using 
charities to help people move from welfare to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial ads will begin airing in three to six weeks in Iowa  
and New Hampshire, then will begin showing up in other key states 
as their primaries draw closer. With his budget divided into 
stages, Bush plans to spend between $15 million and $20 million on 
the first batch of election contests -- between Iowa's caucuses and 
March 7, when more than a dozen primaries will be held on a single 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of his primary budget was not revealed by advisers.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' campaign entered the ad fray first, announcing in June  
that the wealthy conservative would air $10 million worth of ads 
over the summer. However, he spent only $4.2 million, campaign 
officials said, attributing the difference to a 
weaker-than-expected field of conservative candidates. Like the 
rest of the GOP candidates, despite all his money, Forbes still 
trails far behind Bush in polling. 
</P>
<P>
	His summer ads focused on issues, not Bush. That will change,  
according to Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that any issue advocacy we do would show the sharp  
contrast between Steve Forbes' conservative platform and George 
Bush's moderate mush,'' Dal Col said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker replied, ``I'm sure the American  
people hope that 'sharp contrast' is not just a nice way of saying 
'negative ads.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush team, armed with research of Forbes' 1996 failed  
presidential bid to defeat Dole, is prepared to label him a 
negative campaigner. They hope voters make Forbes pay the price for 
criticizing Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor has raised more than $56 million, more than  
seven times as much as his nearest rival. Forbes is dipping into 
his personal fortune to pay for most of his campaign. Unlike their 
GOP rivals, Bush and Forbes have rejected federal matching funds 
for their campaigns and do not have to abide by strict spending 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with a fraction of the Bush and Forbes bankrolls, rivals  
such as Elizabeth Dole and Sen. John McCain of Arizona hope voters' 
reject both big-money candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, wife of the 1996 nominee, does not plan to hit the air  
before mid-December and will start in Iowa, with ads soon to follow 
in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are positioning ourselves to be the principle alternative  
to George W. Bush. It's not clear whether we'll do differentiation 
or issue-definition in our ads, but one thing she's committed to is 
not running a negative campaign,'' said Dole campaign spokeswoman 
Kathleen Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad budget, she said, will depend on Dole's fund-raising  
success closing out the year. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's team has considered buying ads late this year to focus  
on his war hero biography.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Stottlemyre Starts Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre figures he's lucky to be  
pitching anywhere, let alone Wednesday night's Game 2 of the 
divisional playoffs against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months ago, when he tore 70 percent of his rotator cuff, he  
thought he might never pitch again. For the emotional, sometimes 
hot-headed right-hander, this playoff run with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks means more than all the others he's had. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I've been in the postseason before, each time to  
me is more exciting and I appreciate it more,'' Stottlemyre said. 
``I've been lucky. After going through this summer, not knowing if 
I was ever going to pitch again, this is extra special. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no guarantees physically for me in the future, and  
there's no guarantees that the club will jell like this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre refused to undergo surgery after the May 17 injury  
at San Francisco because he knew it meant he'd be through for the 
season. He sensed the team was headed for a great year, and he 
wanted to be a part of it. Besides, at age 34, he knew it could be 
two years or more before he returned to pitching, if he ever 
returned at all. 
</P>
<P>
	So he did something no pitcher had ever done, come back from a  
torn rotator cuff without surgery. Instead, Stottlemyre went 
through extensive rehabilitation to strengthen his entire upper 
body, especially in the area around the injury. The rotator cuff is 
still torn, but the theory is that everything else is so strong it 
makes up for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got better stuff now than he did before he got hurt,''  
catcher Kelly Stinnett said. ``The last couple of times I caught 
him, he had an exceptional slider. His curve ball has always been 
good, but now he's got a little more movement on his fastball, and 
he's got a mile an hour or two faster on his fastball. It's amazing 
what happens when you get in the weight room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre has had mixed results since his return Aug. 20. He's  
gone 2-2, and blames most of his problems on location of pitches as 
he went through what amounted to spring training to get back into 
form. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he said, he feels no pain, even though doctors have told  
him the arm could go on any pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	What concerns him more is whether he can corral his trademark  
intensity, which tends to increase tremendously during the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I've gotten in trouble in the past,'' Stottlemyre  
said. ``The only way I have a chance to help the club and be 
successful is to be able to control the intensity and have the 
thought process that I'm going to take it one pitch at a time and 
dump all the intensity into one pitch. With the intensity and 
emotions of a playoff atmosphere, you can go crazy. I've been 
there. I've been crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre (6-3 overall) is honored that manager Buck Showalter  
chose him to start Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the seventh season Stottlemyre has pitched in the  
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	He has lived through the good and bad. He was shelled for six  
runs in two innings pitching for Toronto against Philadelphia in 
the 1993 World Series. He surrendered two runs on six hits in eight 
strong innings for Texas in Game 1 against the New York Yankees in 
last year's AL divisional playoffs. Overall, the older he's gotten, 
the better he's done. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was younger in those situations, I didn't react the  
right way,'' Stottlemyre said. ``My thinking wasn't the right type 
of thinking. My intensity was completely out of control, but those 
experiences have helped me have better times.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bombing Suspect Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A man wanted in a series of bombings last year  
in Northern California -- including a blast at a police chief's 
house -- was arrested Tuesday at his suburban San Diego home, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Blach, 53, was wanted on a warrant on 11 charges,  
including attempted murder, using a destructive device to murder 
and a using destructive device to terrorize. He was being held 
without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from bombings last year in Fremont, about 30  
miles southeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Blach was arrested as he walked out of his home in the upscale  
Rancho Penasquitos neighborhood. Police confiscated a two loaded 
weapons -- a semiautomatic handgun and a rifle -- and a bulletproof 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Blach has been a suspect since four bombings  
and two attempted bombings in the peaceful, scenic city of Fremont, 
including an explosion at Fremont Police Chief Craig Steckler's 
home. The blast ripped a 10-foot-wide hole in the roof and set the 
front porch on fire. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	That same afternoon, Steckler's predecessor, Councilman Bob  
Wasserman, found an explosive in a brown paper bag on the walkway 
leading to his front door. It was safely disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The other explosives were three pipe bombs planted in newly  
constructed homes in the upscale Mission Heights neighborhood; two 
exploded and the other did not. A fourth bomb went off in backpack 
hanging on a water tank above the same neighborhood. The tank was 
not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Blach lived in the neighborhood, within a mile of where the  
bombs were planted, authorities said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today in volatile trading after the  
Federal Reserve decided against raising interest rates again but 
left open the possibility of a third rate hike later this year. The 
Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.64 lower at 10,400.59, having 
swung from a 106-point gain to a 124-point loss over the final two 
hours. Most broader stock indexes also turned lower in the 
afternoon, cresting just as the Fed was set to announce the outcome 
of its latest meeting on inflation and interest rate strategy. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 3.25 to 1,301.35, but the Nasdaq 
composite index rose 3.70 to 2,800.16 thanks to a strong showing by 
certain technology stocks.

	Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, faced with a booming  
economy but no signs of inflation, decided today not to raise 
interest rates but left open the possibility of a third rate 
increase later this year. The Fed policy-makers moved their policy 
directive, which signals the future course of interest rates, from 
neutral to one tilting toward a rate increase. By leaving interest 
rates unchanged, the federal funds rate, the interest that banks 
charge each other on overnight loans, continues to stand at 5.25 
percent.

	Ferguson Sworn In As Fed Vice Chairman

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roger W. Ferguson, a Harvard-trained economist

oath to Ferguson, 47, who was nominated by President Clinton to 
fill a vacancy created by the departure of Alice Rivlin in July. In 
making that announcement this summer, Clinton said Ferguson would 
be the first African American to hold the post of vice chairman.

three companies alleging the illegal transmission of $7 billion 
through accounts at the bank. The charges were contained in a 
three-count indictment filed under seal in U.S. District Court in 
Manhattan on Sept. 16. The indictment unsealed today named as 
defendants Peter Berlin, Lucy Edwards and Aleksey Volkov as well as 
Benex International Co. Inc., Becs International L.L.C. and 
Torfinex Corp. The charges were the first to result from an 
investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan into what has 
been described as potentially one of the largest cases of 
money-laundering ever uncovered in the United States.

	Leading Economic Indicators Fall  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future economic activity declined  
in August following three straight monthly gains, a sign that 
rising interest rates are starting to have an effect on the 
economy, the Conference Board reported today. The Index of Leading 
Economic Indicators fell 0.1 percent in August, but the drop was 
slightly less than the 0.2 percent decline economic analysts had 
forecast. The index, designed to forecast economic activity three 
to six months in the future, had risen 0.3 percent in each of 
previous three months after falling 0.1 percent in April. It has 
increased nine times in the past 11 months.

	MCI WorldCom Wins Sprint Bid War  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. has forged the largest  
corporate takeover in history, announcing today a $115 billion 
acquisition of Sprint Corp., the nation's third-largest 
long-distance company. The nation's top telephone regulator 
immediately warned the companies that they ``bear a heavy burden to 
show how consumers would be better off'' as a result of the merger. 
The combined company will be called WorldCom, and will control 30 
percent of the U.S. long-distance market, offer wireless phone and 
paging services and an Internet network. WorldCom also will be a 
stronger competitor to AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest 
long-distance and cable TV company. William E. Kennard, chairman of 
the Federal Communications Commission, said MCI WorldCom and Sprint 
will have to make a strong case for approval of the deal. MCI 
WorldCom shares were at 67 15/16, down 3 11/16. Sprint was at 58 7/8, 
down 2. 

</P>
<P>
	BellSouth Seen Facing Challenges  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After losing the bidding war for Sprint,  
BellSouth Corp. -- the only regional Baby Bell phone company yet to 
be involved in a major merger -- needs to make a deal soon or risk 
being dominated by the giant firms taking over the 
telecommunications industry, analysts said today. Still, the 
Atlanta-based company's entry into the fight for Sprint -- won by 
MCI WorldCom -- indicates that BellSouth is no longer content to sit 
back watch other telecom companies grow. ``BellSouth making an 
offer shows a difference in direction,'' said analyst David Burks 
of J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons. BellSouth officials would not 
speculate on any other potential merger targets. BellSouth shares

	CBS Plans Majority Web Co. Stake  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is teaming with a small Internet  
company to create a Web site that will lure users with daily cash 
prizes and also combine the TV network's varied Web offerings, from 
business and investing news, to sports and entertainment. CBS said 
it will pay $30 million in cash for a majority of CTC Bulldog Inc., 
an Irvington, N.Y. venture formed earlier this year. The deal 
represents CBS's first majority stake in a Web site. The companies' 
new site, iWon.com, was launched today. Its most prominent feature 
is an ongoing cash sweepstakes that will give away $10,000 a day, 
$1 million every month and $10 million on tax day, April 15.

	America Online Launches Version 5.0  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. introduced its latest  
software today, eyeing a future where wireless phones and hand-held 
organizers are as popular as computers for reaching the Internet. 
The AOL 5.0 software will let users adapt such features as a new 
interactive calendar to portable devices, which are starting to hit 
the market for Net use. Steve Case, chairman and chief executive 
officer of AOL, said he wants to move away from tying AOL to any 
one device such as the computer. ``You stop thinking about AOL as a 
screen-based, PC-based, telephone-based service and start thinking 
of it as a set of capabilities imbedded throughout your life,'' he 
said in an interview.

	Impact of State Farm Case Weighed  
</P>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- The $456 million jury verdict in a lawsuit  
accusing State Farm of using second-rate parts for automobile 
repairs could lead to higher premiums if the ruling stands on 
appeal, industry experts warn. Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the 
Insurance Information Institute, a nonprofit industry 
communications group, said premiums and repair bills could soar if 
insurers are forced to use factory-authorized parts. Consumers save 
about $800 million a year in reduced premiums through the use of 
less-expensive repair parts, according to industry estimates 
presented at trial.

	Bank of Mexico Calm About Peso

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Bank of Mexico is ``not concerned'' about  
the current strength of the peso, central bank Governor Guillermo 
Ortiz said today. He told a group of executives from the American 
Chamber of Commerce Mexico that based on Mexico's continued growth 
in exports, ``it is difficult to argue that the peso is 
overvalued.'' The peso has appreciated by about 5 percent since the 
beginning of the year and has been trading at about 9.4 pesos to $1 
for several weeks.

<HEADLINE> Pele's Son Is Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The son of Brazilian soccer legend Pele  
was convicted of murder early Wednesday for taking part in a street 
car race which resulted in the death of a passing motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
	Edson Cholbi do Nascimento, 29, was sentenced to six years in  
``semi-open'' prison, which means he must sleep in the prison but 
may leave during the day to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Nascimento and Marcilio Marcilio Jose Marinho de Melo, 25, -- who  
was also convicted and sentenced to 6 years in semi-open prison -- 
were accused of racing their cars in Santos, a port town 48 miles 
southeast of Sao Paulo, when they struck and killed 50-year-old 
retiree Pedro Simoes Neto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Melo's car was the one that hit Neto, Nascimento was  
found guilty for taking part in the race which occurred in Oct. 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair will be free while they appeal the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Octavio Borba de Vasconcellos began to present his  
case before a jury at 8 a.m. Tuesday and, expect for breaks for 
lunch and dinner ran straight through to 1:00 a.m. Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Report: DaimlerChrysler Mulls Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler is considering whether to relocate  
its headquarters from Germany to the United States, a magazine 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	A DaimlerChrysler spokesman called the report ``speculation''  
and refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the automaker climbed on the Frankfurt stock exchange  
on news of the report in Stern weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler chairman Juergen Schrempp is under pressure  
because the company's share price has weakened since Daimler-Benz's 
merger with Chrysler Corp. last year, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said U.S. investors are less interested in DaimlerChrysler  
shares because -- unlike the former Chrysler shares -- they are not 
included in the major U.S. stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempp is having the company study plans to move its  
headquarters to the United States and create a holding company in 
Zurich, Switzerland, as its European base, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company announced the early retirement of  
Chrysler division president Thomas Stallkamp in a board shakeup 
seen as a move by Schrempp to consolidate his control. 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp, a 19-year Chrysler veteran, was credited with helping  
Chrysler shed billions in costs and was expected to help the German 
side do the same.

<HEADLINE> Coelho Lawyer Admits Loan is Unpaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lawyer for Tony Coelho has reversed  
himself, acknowledging that Vice President Al Gore's campaign 
chairman has not fully repaid a $300,000 personal loan cited in a 
highly critical State Department report. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department investigators have said taxpayers may be liable  
for any unpaid balance on the personal loan Coelho took out while 
commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at the ``Expo98'' fair 
in Lisbon, Portugal. The loan was issued by a Portuguese bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Brand, Coelho's lawyer, said Monday his client still  
owes about $100,000 but the debt is ``in the process of being paid 
off.'' Brand did not say when the loan would be fully repaid. On 
Saturday, Brand said the entire loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a United States government transaction,'' he said.  
``There's no liability on the part of any government agency to pay 
a personal loan. There never was an exposure to the United States. 
I don't know how there could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the State Department inspector general, in a report on the  
1998 fair, criticized Coelho's loan -- obtained from a Portuguese 
bank so the private Luso-American Wave Foundation could construct a 
memorial wall in the shape of a wave near the site of the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculpture is still there, as a memorial to Portuguese  
emigrants to the United States. Coelho announced the formation of 
the Luso-American Wave Foundation on April 22, 1998, a month before 
the fair opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's report, which surfaced this past  
weekend, said, ``Obligations of a private foundation were recorded 
on the U.S. pavilion's financial records, and most staff wore 
buttons promoting this foundation during working hours although 
this organization was not officially connected to the pavilion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the United States Information Agency, whose  
operations are now part of the State Department, ``may be 
responsible for the repayment'' if the foundation ``does not raise 
sufficient funds to pay it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Public Integrity, which released the inspector  
general's report and expanded on its findings, said Monday it has 
learned that Coelho used government employees and resources to 
raise money to repay the personal loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The report criticized Coelho for intermingling his activities as  
the commissioner general for the fair with activities and 
obligations of the private foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The center reported that the Luso-American Wave Foundation was  
no more than a toll-free telephone number and a mailing address 
within the offices of a Washington lobbying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation has not been granted tax-exempt status by the  
Internal Revenue Service, and its certificate and articles of 
incorporation were revoked on September 7, 1999, by the government 
of the District of Columbia ``for having failed and/or refused to 
file'' any of the reports required by law, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho did not report the loan as a liability on a federal  
financial disclosure form he filed on June 11, 1998, the center 
added.

<HEADLINE> NFL Near Expansion Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL decision on where its 32nd team is going  
to play appeared closer Tuesday night after Houston's Robert McNair 
and Los Angeles' Michael Ovitz spoke to the expansion committee 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there will be a recommendation tomorrow by the  
committee,'' NFL spokesman Joe Browne said after that group, with 
12 of its 14 members present, met for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no straw vote and no recommendation was formed, Browne  
said. But he added that the committee was to meet again Wednesday 
morning and would be expected to make its recommendation afterward 
to the full ownership, which has a session beginning at 9 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens after that as far as the 17 clubs, I'm not  
sure,'' Brown said, referring to the 17 teams that aren't 
represented on the expansion committee. ``Anything can happen right 
up until the meeting starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's recommendation would have to be approved by 24  
of the 31 owners. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair would pay a reported $700 million for the expansion  
franchise in a deal that would be the largest ever for a sports 
team in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was cautiously optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about our chances,'' McNair said in a lobby  
outside the meeting room. ``Of course, I've felt good about our 
chances all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made an outstanding business proposal, and these are  
good business people who know a good proposal. From what I know 
about the other proposals, I don't think they compare to ours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main issue is that Houston's ready to go.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike McNair, Ovitz did not make himself available to answer  
questions after addressing the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood deal maker and his backers hold an option on a  
parcel of land at Hollywood Park and have proposed building a 
stadium there, an idea that has been raised by other businessmen in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Any plans Ovitz has at Hollywood Park almost certainly would be  
in the very early stages. He only received the option on the race 
track property last week after Marvin Davis, who held the option, 
dropped out of the bidding for an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski, who represents the group trying to bring an NFL team  
to the Los Angeles Coliseum, also came to Atlanta. He was not asked 
to address the expansion committee, however, although he did speak 
at length with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue.

<HEADLINE> Author Pays $42K for Oprah Lunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Science fiction author James L. Halperin wanted  
lunch with Oprah Winfrey -- and the attendant publicity -- so much 
that he paid $42,100 for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Halperin submitted the winning bid during an online auction  
Saturday to raise money for disaster victims through Oprah's Angel 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Halperin topped 84 other bidders. He also paid $10,100 for a  
pair of backstage passes to Ms. Winfrey's TV show and $6,550 more 
to attend a yoga class with the talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every novelist wants to meet Oprah,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Through a feature on her show called Oprah's Book Club, Ms.  
Winfrey every month recommends books to her audience, and Halperin 
hopes he can convince her to read one of his books, either ``The 
First Immortal'' or ``The Truth Machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A date for the lunch has not been set.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Ms. Winfrey is being courted by the Reform Party to  
run for president in 2000. Some party members from Minnesota have 
created a Web site to draft Ms. Winfrey for the 2000 presidential 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is Jesse Ventura times 100,'' said Paul Larsen, chairman of  
the draft committee and a party leader from suburban Minneapolis. 
``She's got a thousand times as much money, 100 times the name 
recognition. She has a sterling reputation for honesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman said Ms. Winfrey isn't interested in the job.

<HEADLINE> Bush Aims To Change Local Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government should give states  
greater flexibility in spending grant money for elementary and 
secondary education, but not without accountability through student 
testing, Texas Gov. George W. Bush says. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second major address on education, the Republican  
presidential candidate also was calling today for a tenfold 
increase in education savings account contributions, from $500 to 
$5,000 annually; a $500 million Achievement and Education Fund to 
reward improving school systems; and a $3 billion Charter School 
Homestead Fund to provide loan guarantees to help start or improve 
charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal: To improve education across the country with  
``pressure from above and competition from below.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I am proposing today is a fresh start for the federal  
role in education,'' Bush said in remarks prepared for delivery at 
a Manhattan Institute luncheon in New York. ``A pact of principle. 
Freedom in exchange for achievement. Latitude in return for 
results. Local control with a national goal: excellence for every 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Bush began rolling out his tough-love approach to  
education, telling an audience in Los Angeles that money for Title 
I -- the main federal program for poor and disadvantaged children -- 
should be confiscated from the worst-performing schools and given 
to parents for private schooling, tutoring ``or whatever offers 
hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second of three planned speeches, Bush expanded on ways  
to let states use federal education dollars more freely while also 
demanding results. He also envisions offering parents alternatives 
through private- or charter-school education. 
</P>
<P>
	One target of the Bush program is the Elementary and Secondary  
Education Act of 1965. The $13.9 billion program currently provides 
grants for elementary and secondary programs under 60 categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush wants to streamline them into five general categories so  
states can tailor programs to their unique needs. Under the plan, 
money could be spent to improve the achievement of disadvantaged 
children; promote fluency in English; train and recruit teachers; 
encourage student character and school safety; and promote 
innovation and informed parental choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposals to use federal money for state voucher programs --  
strongly opposed by teacher unions and Democratic candidates such 
as Vice President Al Gore -- would be allowed. Bill Bradley, Gore's 
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, has voted for 
voucher experiments but doesn't believe they are the solution to 
fundamental educational problems. Most of the GOP candidates favor 
voucher systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Bush would demand that states design and administer  
annual tests to every child in Grades 3-8. His program would also 
require states to participate in the National Assessment of 
Educational Progress, a standardized national math and science test 
conducted on a statistical sample of students. 
</P>
<P>
	States that are not improving after five years would lose 5  
percent of the administrative portion of their ESEA grants. States 
that improve would be eligible for money from the Achievement and 
Education Fund, which would be bolstered with $500 million over 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Test results would be distributed over the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Without testing, reform is a journey without a compass,'' Bush  
said. ``Without testing, teachers and administrators cannot adjust 
their methods to meet high goals. ...Without testing, parents are 
left in the dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also wants to increase the number of charter schools --  
privately run schools that receive public money -- to give parents 
another education option. His $3 billion Homestead program would 
provide seed money for up to 2,000 such schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``As president, I want to fan the spark of charter schools into  
a flame,'' Bush said. ``If charters are done properly -- free to 
hire their own teachers, adopt their own curriculum, set their own 
operating rules and high standards -- they will change the face of 
American education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Bush is proposing to increase the federal allowance for  
education savings from $500 per year to $5,000. Under a 1997 law, 
parents can make contributions to the accounts as if they were 
paying into an IRA. The money can be withdrawn tax-free for college 
expenses. Eligibility for the program starts to phase out for 
single taxpayers earning $95,000 and couples earning $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush would let parents spend the money for kindergarten through  
college. His campaign projects that the expansion would cost the 
Treasury $92 million in revenue in the first year and more than $1 
billion by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Dead Mom Left in Chair for 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, Ind. (AP) -- A man upset over the prospect of  
arranging his mother's funeral instead left her body in the chair 
where she died for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives in Kentucky asked police to check on Myrtle Petrie,  
saying they had not heard from her in years. Last week, when police 
stopped by her house, they found the elderly woman's bones in the 
chair covered with bedding. 
</P>
<P>
	``The son stated when his father passed away, what they had to  
go through at that time was very upsetting, and he didn't want to 
go through that again,'' said Paul Cesar, the deputy Harrison 
County coroner. The father had died in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not release the son's name but said he  
appeared to be about 50. 
</P>
<P>
	The son was placed in the custody of adult welfare officials,  
and he was admitted for a mental health assessment, said Capt. 
Richard Bauman, a detective with the Harrison County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't really want to let her go, and didn't know what to  
do,'' Bauman said. ``As time went on ... he was afraid he would get 
in trouble for not reporting the death immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son told police his mother died in February 1994. She would  
have been 75 when she died. Autopsy results were pending.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Fall Short on Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force alone among the military  
services failed to recruit and retain enough members this year to 
keep its active-duty ranks filled to the level required by 
Congress, the Pentagon said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force, which for years had so little trouble filling its  
ranks that it did not advertise on television, fell 2.8 percent 
short of its ``end strength,'' which Congress set at 370,882 for 
the budget year ended Sept. 30. Its actual number was 360,574. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army stood at 99.8 percent of its authorized level, the Navy  
at 100 percent and the Marine Corps at 100.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Among reserve forces, only the Army National Guard and Marine  
Reserve met 100 percent of their force goals. The Army Reserve, Air 
National Guard, Air Force Reserve and Navy Reserve fell slightly 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal 2000 defense budget that President Clinton was  
signing today in a Pentagon ceremony attempts to address the 
problem of maintaining adequate force levels by providing a 4.8 
percent pay raise and adjusting pay scales next summer to put more 
emphasis on rewarding performance rather than longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said today in advance of the bill signing  
ceremony that they believe these adjustments will enable the 
active-duty services to retain more people. They also say the 
services are looking for more effective means of recruiting young 
people, including making more use of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has seen increasing numbers of pilots leave the  
service for the commercial airline industry, in part because of 
dissatisfaction with deploying abroad for long periods and at 
irregular intervals. The Air Force is trying to change this by 
establishing a set of expeditionary air units that, starting this 
month, will rotate on certain overseas flying commitments such as 
enforcing no-flights zones over Iraq. The intention is to give air 
crews a more predictable and fixed overseas duty schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The active-duty military has 1.4 million members. The biggest of  
the services is the Army at 480,000, and the smallest is the Marine 
Corps at 172,500. The Navy has 372,700 members.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $289B Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $289 billion  
defense bill Tuesday that includes a pay raise and other incentives 
the Pentagon hopes will attract more recruits and keep today's 
troops in uniform longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe you the tools you need to do the job and the quality of  
life you and your families deserve,'' Clinton told a couple hundred 
service members at a brief ceremony on the steps of the Pentagon 
overlooking the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the pay package, including a 4.8 percent  
across-the-board raise effective Jan. 1 and a change in pay scales 
effective next July, represents the biggest increase in 
compensation in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excellence of our military is the direct product of the  
excellence of our men and women in uniform,'' he said. ``This bill 
invests in that excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined in the ceremony by Defense Secretary William  
Cohen and the uniformed service chiefs and civilian service 
secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill says that the dedication and sacrifices of our  
soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, frequently deployed far from 
home and family in defense of our security interests around the 
world, are understood and appreciated,'' said Army Gen. Henry H. 
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which authorizes an $18 billion increase in the  
defense budget over fiscal 1999, which ended Sept. 30, also directs 
a reorganization of the Energy Department to create a largely 
independent nuclear weapons agency within the department. The 
reorganization was prompted by controversy over allegations of lax 
security and Chinese espionage involving the nuclear weapons labs 
under the Energy Department's control. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent pay raise is the highest since a 14.3 percent  
boost in 1981 during the Reagan administration's military buildup. 
The Clinton administration had proposed a 4.4 percent increase for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the Air Force ended the 1999  
fiscal year with a manpower shortage of about 10,000 -- a 
combination of too few recruits and too many people -- particularly 
pilots -- leaving the service for commercial aviation jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, Navy and Marine Corps reached troop strength levels  
set by Congress, although only the Marines -- the smallest of the 
major services with 172,500 people -- met their goals in both 
recruiting and retention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force, which for years didn't need to bother with TV  
advertising, fell short in both recruiting and retention, whereas 
the Army overcame a recruiting shortfall by exceeding its retention 
goal. The Navy, which was nearly 7,000 recruits short in 1998, met 
its goal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among reserve forces, only the Army National Guard and Marine  
Reserve met their force goals. The Army Reserve, Air National 
Guard, Air Force Reserve and Navy Reserve fell slightly short. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal 2000 defense budget attempts to address the problem  
of maintaining adequate force levels by providing a combination of 
financial incentives. In addition to the pay raise, the Pentagon 
also is authorized to adjust pay scales next summer to put more 
emphasis on rewarding performance than longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Congress authorized the Pentagon to make a major change in  
its retirement pay system. Service members will be allowed to 
retire after 20 years of service at 50 percent of basic pay, up 
from the current 40 percent. Or, a service member could take a 
one-time $30,000 cash bonus after 15 years of service, stay another 
five years and then get the 40 percent retirement pay instead of 50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials said in advance of the bill-signing ceremony  
that they believe these adjustments will enable active-duty 
services to retain more people. They also say the services are 
looking for more effective means of recruiting young people, 
including making more use of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has had an acute problem with pilots leaving for  
commercial aviation, in part because of dissatisfaction with 
deploying abroad for long periods at irregular intervals. In 
response, the Air Force is trying to give air crews more 
predictable and fixed overseas duty schedules.

	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar was marginally lower against the  
yen Wednesday morning after the U.S. Federal Reserve warned of 
further interest rate increases. Prices on Tokyo's benchmark stock 
index rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.59 yen, down 0.01 yen from its level of  
106.60 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo but above its level of 106.41 yen 
late Tuesday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Nikkei-225 Stock Average rose 56.35 points, or  
0.32 percent, to 17,840.50 at the end of the morning session. The 
average closed up 20.44 points, or 0.12 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	While keeping rates unchanged Tuesday, the U.S. central bank  
switched its policy directive from neutral to one leaning toward 
increased rates. It warned that it would remain ``especially 
alert'' to any inflation threats coming from tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Fed's unexpected decision to adopt a tightening bias  
is putting some downward pressure on the dollar,'' said Takeo 
Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust and 
Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 114.84 yen in midday  
trading, up 0.94 yen from its level of 113.90 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices were mixed at midday after the market trimmed  
early gains made on hopes for further economic stimulus measures by 
Japan's new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reshuffled his Cabinet on Tuesday  
and kicked off a three-party coalition government, retaining 
economic ministers who have played a key role in bringing the 
economy to the verge of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Shizuka Kamei, the policy chief of the ruling party, said he  
expects the government's new economic stimulus package to include 
around 13 trillion yen (dlrs 123 billion) in total spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
closed 0.64 point lower at 10,400.59 Tuesday, having swung from a

<HEADLINE> U-Haul Founder Commits Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Leonard S. Shoen, who revolutionized the  
do-it-yourself moving industry by founding U-Haul International 
Inc., apparently committed suicide by driving his car into a power 
pole. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clark County coroner's office ruled Tuesday that Schoen died  
from blunt force trauma and that his death was a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason for the accident,'' Metro Police Detective  
Rick Hart said. ``Nobody else was around. ``They determined that it 
looked like suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday's Shoen's car left the road for no apparent reason and  
struck a wooden power pole, police said. Hart said the accident is 
still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoen founded U-Haul in 1945 and built it into the most  
recognized self-moving company in the nation with its signature 
orange and white trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Shoen's sons -- Joe and Mark -- forced their father into  
retirement and pushed for control of the parent company, Reno-based 
Amerco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The move triggered a bitter family feud that ended in a $1.5  
billion jury award the company had to pay Leonard Shoen and other 
``outsiders.'' A judge later reduced the award to $461 million, and 
the company then sought bankruptcy protection from the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the shakeup at U-Haul, Shoen lived in Las Vegas, where he  
owned the World Trade Center hotel since 1996. He withdrew his 
application with the Nevada Gaming Commission for a gaming license 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	At the age of 29, after serving in the Navy during World War II,  
Shoen came up with the idea to provide do-it-yourself one-way 
moving trailers on a nationwide basis. 
</P>
<P>
	With an initial investment of $5,000, he and his then-wife Anna  
Mary Carty started the company at the Carty Ranch in Ridgefield, 
Wash., where they built the first U-Haul trailers in a milk house 
in 1945. The company is now based in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	His concept for U-Haul was developed out of a need to provide  
inexpensive means of moving a post-World War II American population 
that had become migratory, especially to the Western United States, 
according to the company's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The original U-Haul trailers were painted bright orange and  
rented for $2 a day. By 1949 it was possible to rent U-Haul 
trailers one way from city to city throughout most of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the company has 14,000 independent dealers and 1,100  
company-owned moving centers. It is the leading company in the 
truck and trailer rental industry and the second-largest 
self-storage facility operator. U-Haul also is the world's largest 
installer of permanent hitches.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Verdict Angers Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- The insurance industry fears a swarm of  
lawsuits in the wake of an Illinois jury's $456 million verdict 
over State Farm's use of questionable auto parts -- and industry 
leaders are looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance groups called Tuesday for support of a bill under  
consideration in the U.S. Senate that would force plaintiffs to 
file most national class-action lawsuits in federal court. 
Proponents say such a law would help limit the influence -- which 
some find excessive -- of state juries in the affairs of regulators 
and legislatures nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In the State Farm case, they say, the jury's finding that State  
Farm breached its contract with policyholders by using auto-body 
repair parts of questionable quality intrudes on the policy 
decisions of regulators and legislators who approve of the parts' 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here we have a judge and jury in Illinois essentially making  
policy for the entire United States. This is the kind of case that 
belongs in the federal court,'' said J.V. Schwan, counsel for the 
Civil Justice Reform Campaign of Citizens for a Sound Economy, 
which seeks less government involvement in business. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's particularly objectionable in this case is that this is  
a practice that state insurance regulators have examined time and 
again and have permitted to be followed,'' said Ann Spragens, 
general counsel and senior vice president for the Alliance of 
American Insurers, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected State Farm's argument  
that certification of the national class violated the company's 
due-process rights by allowing Illinois law to be used to judge 
claims from states whose laws allow use of aftermarket parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering a bill that would grant federal courts  
jurisdiction in cases where any member of a proposed class resides 
in a different state than any defendant. The House approved the 
bill Sept. 23. It is currently awaiting action in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, the legislation would require that large cases such  
as State Farm's be filed in federal court, preventing trial lawyers 
from filing in courts they believe likely to approve large awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform  
Association, said allowing juries from one state to reach into 
another is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a very, very troubling message to businesses, to  
anybody who is involved in commercial activities throughout the 
country, that they could be adhering to the letter of the law in a 
particular state and then find that they are subject to a 
class-action lawsuit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trish Littleton, a plaintiffs' attorney in the State Farm  
lawsuit, said there is nothing wrong with filing a class-action 
lawsuit in a state court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the State Farm case, she said, Illinois was an appropriate  
forum because the contracts the company was alleged to have 
breached originated at the company's Bloomington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the insurance industry's claim that the jury is making  
national policy is ``blarney,'' but conceded that insurance 
regulators will have to revisit their approval of aftermarket parts 
now that a jury has found consumers were bilked by their use. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's award designated $456 million to compensate the 4.7  
million current and former State Farm policyholders who had 
aftermarket parts included on repair orders since July 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson County Circuit Judge John Speroni is considering a  
separate consumer fraud complaint in which the plaintiffs have 
asked for damages totaling nearly $4 billion. That count accuses 
the company of deliberately deceiving customers about the quality 
of aftermarket parts -- sheet-metal and plastic trim parts that are 
modeled on the originals but made without access to factory 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision is expected by Friday. At least 13 other lawsuits  
naming seven insurance companies are pending in state courts from 
Arizona to Florida.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Hit by Foul Ball in Dugout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Zimmer got hit in the head with a line drive  
and acted like it was all one big joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``One hundred ten thousand ears in this ballpark, and he's got  
to hit my ear,'' Zimmer said with a laugh after Chuck Knoblauch's 
fifth-inning foul ball gave him cuts on the left jaw and ear 
Tuesday during New York's 8-0 win over Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer, the Yankees' bench coach, was assisted out of the  
dugout. The 68-year-old Zimmer returned with an icepack on his jaw 
while the Yankees were still batting, and joked with Knoblauch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This head's been hit so many times, I think as long as I get  
hit in the head, it can't hurt me,'' Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer twice had seasons ended by beanings, in 1953 at St. Paul  
and 1956 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch lined a 2-1 pitch into the first-base dugout, and it  
struck Zimmer, who usually sits on the bench next to manager Joe 
Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I heard that ugly sound, I'm saying to myself, `Why  
didn't I just reach my hand instead of just getting out of the 
way?''' Torre said. ``It was bothering me. Bernie (Williams) saw I 
was dazed a little. He came up to me and said, `Are you with us, 
are you OK? 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Yeah, I'm OK.' It was like he lit a fire.''  
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer tried to joke about the big hands of his boss and friend.  
</P>
<P>
	``With ham hocks you have, how come you let it hit me?'' he  
recalled telling Torre. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was stopped for several minutes and, after Zimmer was  
helped off the floor, he was assisted back to the clubhouse by 
pitcher Andy Pettitte and assistant trainer Steve Donohue. 
Knoblauch crouched in the batter's box with a concerned look. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the ball, but when it hit me, I didn't know what hit  
me,'' Zimmer said. ``Luckily, it didn't hit me full force. I turned 
my head and it must have hit me a glancing blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer managed the Yankees to a 21-15 record earlier this year  
while Torre recovered from prostate cancer surgery. Zimmer had 
talked of retirement during that time, hobbled by a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in his 51st season in professional baseball. Zimmer, who  
coached for the Yankees in 1983 and 1986, rejoined the club as the 
bench coach in 1996, shortly after Torre was hired.

<HEADLINE> Votes Scarce for Nuke Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A landmark treaty pushed by President Clinton  
to ban nuclear testing worldwide appeared doomed Tuesday as 
Republican opposition hardened and a senior Democrat conceded there 
were not enough votes to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., offered to postpone  
a scheduled vote on the treaty next Tuesday -- but only if the 
administration asserted it was seeking the delay. Lott also said he 
would not agree to any plan under which the treaty could be called 
up again before 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to vote on this issue in this Congress, it's  
going to be next Tuesday or Wednesday,'' Lott told reporters 
Tuesday night. The White House continued to proceed as if the 
planned vote would occur. It appeared that neither Republicans nor 
the administration wanted to be blamed for shelving the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, as far as we know, there is a vote  
scheduled for Tuesday and we intend to make every effort to 
succeed,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said. However, he 
said there was a recognition by some senators that a mere week of 
debate was not a lot of time and ``a cause for concern to some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Lott and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle took to the  
Senate floor late Tuesday to say they were trying to work out a 
compromise, but none had jelled yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we can do is continue to discuss the matter,'' Daschle,  
D-S.D., said as Clinton prepared to press for the treaty before a 
group of senators he invited to a White House dinner 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on  
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the 
Republican leadership would ``pull down the vote'' within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has been signed by 154  
nations but ratified by only two of the seven acknowledged nuclear 
powers, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said it looked as if the treaty battle was degenerating  
into an almost straight party-line vote. Assuming all 45 Senate 
Democrats voted for the treaty, the president still would need 22 
Republicans to gain the necessary 67 votes for ratification, and 
GOP support was disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have vanished into the ether,'' Biden said.  
</P>
<P>
	A defeat of the treaty would be a humiliating loss for Clinton,  
who had argued that it was vital for America's national security 
interests and a deterrent to the spread of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for the Senate to reject it would send a terrible  
message,'' the president said at the White House. ``It would say to 
the whole world, `Look, America's not going to test but if you want 
to test, go right ahead. We're not interested in leading the world 
toward nonproliferation anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The already slim prospects for ratification of the treaty  
declined further late Tuesday when Biden said he had told Clinton 
the votes were not there. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton complained that Republicans were rushing consideration  
of the treaty. Further, he said, Republicans were ``under enormous 
pressure'' not to side with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who often agree with the administration on  
international issues, including Sens. Richard Lugar of Indiana, 
John Warner of Virginia and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, all have 
signaled their opposition to the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Many prominent Republicans -- including GOP presidential hopeful  
George W. Bush -- say the treaty is not verifiable and would not 
stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. Further, they 
argue it would harm efforts to maintain the safety and reliability 
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Defense Secretary William Cohen said the scientific and  
military communities believe the current testing system -- using 
computer simulation instead of actual nuclear explosions -- is a 
reliable way of appraising the U.S. weapons stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we can continue to test them in a non-nuclear fashion that  
will satisfy us year by year,'' Cohen said on PBS's ``The News 
Hour.'' ``Now, in addition, I think the questions are, well, how 
can we be sure about the other guys? ...We will have very little 
leverage over those countries who are saying you rejected the 
treaty and, therefore, we can test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States stopped testing in 1992 and has  
no intention of resuming. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House appeared surprised by the swift turn against the  
treaty on Capitol Hill. The president had invited a bipartisan 
group of senators to dinner to lobby for the pact and had defended 
it during two appearances -- once at the White House and again at a 
Pentagon bill-signing ceremony. The White House also offered a 
briefing on the treaty with four experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear  
Dangers, a treaty advocacy group, said the organization still 
wanted to see a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear that the fight for the 67 votes is difficult and  
there has been no movement since Friday,'' Kimball said. ``The 
consequences of delay would be tremendous, but the responsibility 
for that would lie at the feet of those who vote against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Armed Services Committee held a closed-door hearing on  
whether the nation's nuclear stockpiles could be maintained in the 
absence of testing. Participants later said there was lively 
discussion on whether, if the treaty were voted down, pressure 
would increase to resume testing.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Batters Keep Quiet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Of course the Texas Rangers can't hit. It's the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers' big bats were shut down once again by the New York  
Yankees, as Texas lost its seventh straight postseason game, 8-0 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who have been knocked out in October by New York in  
two of the last three years, have scored just one run in their last 
42 playoff innings and are hitting .126 (15-for-119) the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get hits. Plain and simple,'' leadoff man Mark  
McLemore said. ``If we don't hit the ball, we're not going to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this for a team that led the majors in batting for the  
second straight year (.293), was second in runs with 945, had four 
players with more than 100 RBIs, and six with at least 20 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	All those lofty Texas batting numbers once again added up to a  
big zero. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez who shut down  
the Rangers. But it doesn't matter who the pitcher is -- Texas has 
faced six Yankees starters in those seven losses and had equally 
bad results. 
</P>
<P>
	Their aggressive, free-swinging style falls prey to New York  
pitchers, who tantalize them with breaking pitches on the edge of 
the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can hit with the best of them,'' New York's Bernie  
Williams said. ``What happened tonight was the exception rather 
than the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The approach worked again. Hernandez allowed only two hits --  
both to Ivan Rodriguez -- in eight innings. The Rangers drew seven 
walks but weren't patient when they mounted their biggest threat in 
the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez got Juan Gonzalez to chase a slider out of the strike  
zone with runners on first and second. After Rafael Palmeiro walked 
to load the bases, Todd Zeile swung through a high fastball to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really effective against right-handers,'' Palmeiro said.  
``He drops down and gives Juan and Zeile trouble. The left-handers 
have to take advantage of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Palmeiro, who hit .324, with 47 homers and 124  
RBIs during the season, was supposed to bring an end to Texas' 
postseason lumber slumber. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he did not fare any better than the Rangers' holdovers.  
He went 0-for-3, hitting a fly ball to center with two on and two 
outs in the third and lining into a double play to end the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care Yankee Stadium, Yellowstone Park, it doesn't  
matter,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``We can score more 
runs than this by accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But all of the blame for the Rangers' woes shouldn't go to the  
hitting. A little should be reserved for the shoddy fielding that 
led to five of New York's eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Greer lost Ricky Ledee's low liner to left field in the  
lights, turning it into an RBI double in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would change angles if I could do it over so I could keep it  
in front of me and stop the run from scoring,'' Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, Zeile's error on Paul O'Neill's two-out grounder  
to third allowed Ledee to score New York's fourth run. Bernie 
Williams followed with a three-run homer that put another Rangers' 
playoff game out of reach.

<P>
	Konrad, a rookie fullback, went one way. The ball went the  
other. It was one of many big defensive plays by the Bills, who 
dealt the Dolphins a 23-18 loss with a potent mix of man, zone and 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just might be the best defensive effort that I have seen  
from us in my nine years here,'' Jones said. ``To hold the Dolphins 
to one touchdown and some field goals? On Monday night? In Miami?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the individual battles,'' Jones said. ``We had a good  
plan, but we had to execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker John Holecek separated Marino from the football and  
very nearly dislocated the Dolphins quarterback from his senses 
with a jarring hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't block me,'' a surprised Holecek said. ``Marino was  
looking the other way and I saw the ball out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Gabe Northern picked up the ball, broke a tackle and  
ran 59 yards for a touchdown and a 13-6 Buffalo lead with 4:31 left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've scored before, but never in a game of this magnitude,''  
Northern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo limited Miami to one third-down conversion of 14  
attempts and 59 yards rushing on 24 carries. Veteran defensive end 
Bruce Smith fought off double-teams all night and recorded his 
second sack of the year. On another memorable play, Schulz soared 
to tear a pass away from the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Holecek, who led the Bills in tackles last season after  
replacing Chris Spielman, set up kicker Steve Christie for the 
Bills' final points with an interception and 35-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw it right at me,'' said Holecek, who had only 1.5  
career sacks and no interceptions in four-plus seasons. ``I was 
shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills (3-1) were picked apart by Indianapolis quarterback  
Peyton Manning in the season opener and recorded a 17-3 win over 
the hobbled Jets and a 26-0 shutout of the hapless Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	They went into Monday's game wary of Marino, who has passed for  
more yards than any quarterback in history. But there were no 
heroics this time from Marino, who engineered a 38-21 victory over 
the Broncos on the first Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino hadn't seen sacked and had thrown only two interceptions;  
Buffalo spilled him twice and picked him off twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami needed a 93-yard kickoff return late in the game to set up  
its lone touchdown, the first TD allowed by the Bills in 13 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense kept us in the game,'' Doug Flutie said. ``They  
won it for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins turned into cereal killers after last season's  
wild-card playoff victory over the Bills, stomping on a box of 
Flutie Flakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo exacted its revenge on the field. ``I didn't go in and  
stomp on a can of hair spray,'' Bills coach Wade Phillips said in 
reference to Miami coach Jimmy Johnson's carefully crafted coif. 
``But we were excited about winning.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OK's FAA Flight Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flights out of some of the nation's busiest  
airports would be increased as part of a major Federal Aviation 
Administration bill passed Tuesday by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move aimed at improving service to smaller markets and  
making it easier for new entrants to compete, the Senate bill, 
approved by voice, would increase flights out of Chicago's O'Hare, 
New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy and Washington's Reagan National. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a remarkable win for consumers,'' said Sen. John  
McCain, R-Ariz., who has been a strong advocate of increasing 
flights as a means of helping smaller communities hurt by 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA legislation in general would authorize $45 billion over  
four years to fund aviation safety, modernization and competition 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides more than $2 billion a year for the Airport  
Improvement Program, which has been prohibited from making new 
project grants since the new fiscal year began last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a step welcomed by the administration, the bill would seek to  
overhaul the air traffic control system by appointing a chief 
operating officer and creating an oversight committee. The 
administration has been pressing to make the system, swamped by 
rapidly expanding numbers of flights, operate more like a private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the critical challenge facing the FAA,'' said  
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1969 imposed flight ceilings on the Chicago, New  
York and Washington airports to counter congestion and noise 
pollution. A 1,250-mile ``perimeter rule'' was also established for 
Reagan National in 1986 to assure the economic viability of the 
region's two long-haul airports, Dulles and Washington-Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA bill would eliminate the ``high density rule'' for the  
New York airports. The two Illinois senators, Republican Peter 
Fitzgerald and Democrat Richard Durbin, blocked an effort to do 
away with the rule for O'Hare, instead settling for a 30-slot 
increase. One slot is a takeoff or a landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights out of Washington are to increase by 24 slots, with 12  
going beyond the 1,250-mile limit. An amendment by Sen. Charles 
Robb, D-Va., to keep flights at current numbers was defeated, 
61-37. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case new entrants or flights to underserved markets get  
priority for any new flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed its version of the bill by a 316-110 margin  
last June. While similar in many respects, it differs on the level 
of flight increases and includes a provision, opposed by the 
administration, that would wall off the Aviation Trust Fund, 
revenues coming in from airport taxes, so that it could be used 
only for airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Congress was unable to pass an FAA bill because the  
House and Senate couldn't agree on slot allocations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would set up a pilot program to help small  
communities improve air service, authorize $30 million a year to 
purchase precision instrument landing systems, require that cargo 
aircraft be equipped with instruments that warn of impending 
collisions in the air and provide funds to address the problems of 
bird strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin of Illinois inserted language to ban smoking on all  
international flights landing or taking off from the United States, 
and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., won approval of language requiring the 
Transportation Department to make sure airlines put their promises 
to improve service into their legal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would additionally give the FAA authority to fine  
unruly passengers and put new regulations on national park air tour 
overflights. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 82.

<HEADLINE> High School Coach Lied About Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Football players and coaches at Old  
Colony Regional High School always took for granted that their 
assistant football coach was Nick Eddy, an All-American halfback at 
Notre Dame in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the real Nick Eddy called the man who was impersonating  
him, and a ruse that began 20 years ago suddenly fell apart. 
William Nicholas Eddy-McMullen was forced to resign from the 
coaching staff, and he had to own up to living a lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't deny it. I didn't embellish it,'' a weary McMullen  
said of his claims. By coincidence he shares two of the real Nick 
Eddy's names. ``In fact, people were amazed at how modest ... how I 
didn't talk about my past and my exploits and what I'd done, 
etcetera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials, tipped off by Eddy's call and a report by The  
Standard-Times of New Bedford, said they were surprised at why he 
lied. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is he didn't need to because he was successful just  
on his ability as a coach,'' said David Ferreira, Old Colony's 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	The real Nick Eddy, now an insurance executive in Modesto,  
Calif., heard of McMullen's scam through a rumor that he had 
divorced his wife and had a new family in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `My gosh, that's where this all came from,''' said  
Eddy, who called and confirmed the story in a telephone 
conversation with McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eddy, who played seven seasons with the Detroit Lions, said  
he doesn't have any ill will towards McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only real harm, I think that has come out of it, is the  
impression that I was divorced,'' said Eddy, 55, who will soon 
celebrate his 34th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Tuesday, McMullen said his deception started  
about 20 years ago. While broke and looking for a job, the Iowa 
native interviewed at a New Bedford clothing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had played football at Notre Dame under his  
stepfather's last name, Eddy. He added that he had also used his 
middle name, Nick. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticing Notre Dame paraphernalia at the plant manager's office,  
he decided to try to boost his chances of getting hired. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a last minute tidbit, I threw in that I went to Notre  
Dame,'' said McMullen, whose highest degree was actually from high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The lie worked, and McMullen kept up the facade until he moved  
to California in 1979 and temporarily dropped the act. 
</P>
<P>
	He resumed it, however, when he returned to Massachusetts in  
1989, and an old acquaintance introduced him to others as the 
football great. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of snowballed,'' McMullen said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, McMullen was hired at Old Colony as one of several  
assistant football coaches after a chance meeting with head coach 
Kevin Gonsalves. Gonsalves had been impressed by McMullen's 
knowledge of the game -- even without McMullen bringing up his 
fictitious past. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they first learned of McMullen's claims  
when he sent in his resume. Because he used his own social security 
number and passed the state's criminal records check, his past was 
never questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferreira said McMullen was a popular coach and a good motivator.  
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't excuse his lies, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``In our eyes there's something wrong in that he misrepresented  
himself when he's working with young men, trying to teach them 
honesty and proper values,'' Ferreira said. ``That's 
inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMullen said he is embarrassed and sorry about his lies. He  
apologized to the real Nick Eddy over the phone, he said, and plans 
to apologize to Old Colony's players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's going to change the nature of the relationships I  
have with just about everybody I have in this town,'' McMullen 
said. He said when the news broke, he had been working with a 
therapist to figure out how to come clean about the lie to the 
community -- and also his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is out and I've dealt with it,'' he said. ``I'm  
going to go forward and see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Targets Women's Vote in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking the women's vote, Vice President Al Gore  
proposed Tuesday to make life better for working families by 
providing preschool for every child and encouraging employers to 
provide on-site day-care and emergency baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do not understand the fatigue of the American working  
woman, then you don't deserve to be president of the United 
States,'' Gore said to cheers from about 600 mostly female 
supporters at a Manhattan fund-raising luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you elect me president, I will honor your struggle by  
making it easier to be a good worker and a good parent at the same 
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, fighting former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, also said he wanted to further women's 
rights by ensuring equal pay for equal work, keeping abortion legal 
and offering help to those juggling the demands of jobs and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you elect me president, I will make available high-quality  
preschool for every child in every family across the United 
States,'' he said. ``It's the single best investment we can make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to create tax incentives for employers who  
provide on-site day care or help to parents when child-care 
arrangements fall through. He also said he would encourage 
businesses to offer job shares, flexible schedules and 
telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also criticized Republican presidential front-runner George  
W. Bush's proposal to cut federal education funds to 
underperforming public schools and give their students $1,500 each 
to use for tuition at private schools or tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Long saddled with a reputation as a stiff speaker, Gore tried to  
connect with his audience by cracking jokes, telling personal 
stories and sharing the stage with his daughter, Karenna Gore 
Schiff, a Columbia University law student. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, he met upstate with more than 100  
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing him deadlocked with Bradley in New York, a  
crucial early primary state, he sought to rally them for the ``big 
challenge we're going to meet together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a fight on our hands,'' Gore told the crowd huddled  
under a tent to ward off the chill and drizzle outside of a rented 
country house in Pine Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore had met inside with key supporters, including state  
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall 
and state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, for what Rockland County 
Democratic Chairman Paul Adler called ``a skull session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to listen to the guys in the trenches,'' Adler  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released Tuesday by Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion had Gore and Bradley each favored by 41 percent of 
Democratic voters. A similar poll in March had Gore leading 
Bradley, 47 percent to 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming Bradley, a former New York Knicks star, McCall  
and Spitzer used basketball metaphors to promote Gore's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things get tough on the court, you don't want somebody  
who will quit,'' McCall said, referring to Bradley's retirement 
from the Senate in 1996 after the Republican takeover of Congress 
in elections two years earlier. ``Al Gore was there when we needed 
him, when other people walked off the court.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-CIA Officer Appeals Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Former CIA officer Edwin P. Wilson, jailed since  
1983 for illegal arms smuggling to Libya, has filed an appeal 
accusing federal prosecutors of knowingly using a false affidavit 
to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's claims are accompanied by hundreds of secret government  
memos that his lawyers obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's main job for the CIA was setting up front companies  
abroad while posing as a rich American businessman. He lived his 
cover to the hilt and made himself a multimillionaire in the 
process. He was arrested in 1982 after being lured out of Libya by 
a government informant and was sentenced to 52 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Adler said the secret government memos  
detail lengthy efforts to hide the use of the false affidavit and 
prosecutors' failure to release information that would have aided 
Wilson's defense during his 1983 Houston trial on charges of 
selling tons of explosives to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson claims that his dealings with Libya, for which he was  
convicted, were the result of a CIA request that he ingratiate 
himself with the Libyans after he officially retired from the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The affidavit by then-CIA Executive Director Charles Briggs, the  
agency's No. 3 official, said the agency had not asked Wilson 
either directly or indirectly to provide any service to the agency 
after he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-volume appeal filed Sept. 8 includes more than 800 pages  
of exhibits that allegedly show government lawyers knew the crucial 
affidavit was false the night before it was presented in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents show that Wilson in fact had some 80 contacts with  
the CIA from his retirement through 1978 and provided a variety of 
services, including arranging gun sales to a Saudi Arabian security 
agency and the shipment of two desalinization units to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents also show prosecutors then spent nearly eight months  
discussing whether to disclose that fact to the court and Wilson's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence was enough to prompt an unusual courtroom admission  
earlier in March from Justice Department attorney Arlene Reidy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of documents already that I think show that  
there was a clear problem with the affidavit's accuracy and that 
the individuals involved were well aware of that problem,'' Ms. 
Reidy told U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes, according to a 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA's general counsel, Stanley Sporkin, said Tuesday there  
was no intention to cover up. Rather, he said, officials had a 
difference in philosophies about how to handle the information 
about Wilson's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be wrong to think this was in bad faith,'' Sporkin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has until mid-January to respond to the  
appeal. If Wilson's conviction was overturned, he could be retried. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret documents were obtained by Wilson's defense under the  
Freedom of Information Act and through court discovery. They were 
resealed by Hughes on Sept. 23, but The Associated Press had 
obtained copies before the order was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from federal prison in Allenwood, Pa., Wilson said the  
alleged conspiracy against him was motivated by ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	``A few greedy people in the government saw an opportunity to  
make a name for themselves,'' Wilson said. ``The longer I was in 
prison, the more they had to cover it up and it keeps going 
higher.''

<HEADLINE> Senators 2, Rangers 1 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Backup goaltender Patrick Lalime made 37 saves  
and Marian Hossa scored twice as the Ottawa Senators beat the 
punchless New York Rangers 2-1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lalime, filling in for the injured Ron Tugnutt, allowed only a  
power-play goal by Kevin Stevens at 11:14 of the third period. 
Lalime made two key stops after Stevens' goal, one on a breakaway 
by Petr Nedved and another on a point shot by Mathieu Schneider, to 
preserve the Senators' second victory in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk McLean, subbing for injured Mike Richter, made 25 saves.  
But he gave up a goal in the final two minutes of the first two 
periods, allowing the Senators all the scoring they needed to win 
their fourth straight at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who have scored only three goals in three games,  
have lost two straight following an opening-night tie as they 
played their first home game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators went ahead 1-0 at 18:27 of the first on a goal by  
Hossa, who scored on a one-timer from outside the crease after a 
pass from Radek Bonk behind the goal line. Hossa made it 2-0 when 
he scored at 18:36 of the second period, lifting a backhander past 
McLean from in close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers finally pulled out of their power-play slump when  
Stevens scored on a deflection. It was the Rangers' first 
power-play goal this season after 15 failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Richter was out with a disc problem in his lower back and  
Tugnutt with a left knee strain for the second straight game. 
Richter, interviewed between periods, said the injury was not 
severe and he expected to be back in action for Friday night's game 
against Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Miami Coach Blames Marino for Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- For 17 years, the Miami Dolphins have blamed  
their defeats on soft defense, a shortage of speedy receivers or -- 
most frequently -- a feeble ground game. Jimmy Johnson cited a new 
culprit Tuesday: Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering perhaps the harshest critique of Marino's career,  
Johnson criticized the future Hall of Famer's play in a 23-18 loss 
Monday night to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Marino often threw to the wrong receiver, hurried  
some passes and held onto the ball too long on a costly fumble. The 
result was three turnovers, one third-down conversion in 14 chances 
and a defeat that dropped Miami to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was at fault on all three turnovers, Johnson said, but  
pass protection breakdowns contributed to the quarterback's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got to make some better decisions,'' Johnson said.  
``When he's getting banged around, he made some poor decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the decisions a 17-year veteran is expected to  
make, Johnson said, ``We're going down an avenue I don't want to go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the message from the coach was clear: Marino needs to play  
better. He went 22-for-44 for 251 yards with one touchdown, two 
interceptions and two sacks, his first of the season. The Dolphins' 
only TD came on a 4-yard drive following a 93-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's comments were even harsher than in 1997, when he said  
following the season opener that he considered benching Marino. The 
latest criticism will likely strain the sometimes testy 
relationship between player and coach, but that is clearly not 
Johnson's concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's players had Tuesday off, and Marino was unavailable for  
comment. Following the game, he had a terse response when asked to 
assess his play. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you want to know about it?'' he said. ``If you lose  
it's bad, and if you win it's good. That's how I assess it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's productivity has declined since a strong showing in the  
Dolphins' season-opening victory at Denver. In a 19-16 victory over 
Arizona he threw two interceptions, and Miami scored just one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the Dolphins must not allow Marino to get hit, and  
the coach implied that his 38-year-old quarterback's poor mobility 
has hamstrung the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can go maximum protection with Dan and only have three  
receivers, like we did with Denver,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But people figure that out pretty soon and start doubling your  
receivers, so you've got no place to throw. You put five receivers 
out, and he's going to get hit. If he gets hit, his play drops down 
significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge of protecting Marino will be compounded Sunday at  
Indianapolis (2-1), because tackle Richmond Webb bruised his left 
knee against Buffalo and is expected to be sidelined a couple of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pivotal play Monday was Gabe Northern's 59-yard touchdown  
return of a Marino fumble, putting the Bills ahead to stay in the 
second quarter. Johnson said Marino was partly to blame for the 
fumble, which occurred when he was blind-sided on a third-down 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got to release the ball,'' Johnson said. ``You dump it  
to the fullback. He held onto it a little bit long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said fullback Rob Konrad was open repeatedly, but he  
caught just three passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was also at fault on both interceptions, Johnson said.  
Safety Kurt Schulz picked off a Marino pass late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't look him off because he was rushed, or he felt like  
he was rushed,'' Johnson said.

	More costly was an interception by linebacker John Holecek, who  
stepped in front of a pass intended for Troy Drayton and returned 
it 35 yards to set up Buffalo's final field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Receivers Tony Martin and Oronde Gadsden were open deep on the  
play, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan tried to throw it to Drayton, and Drayton was double  
covered,'' Johnson said. ``So we've got to give him time to make 
the right decisions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Brett Hull's power-play goal midway through the  
third period gave the Dallas Stars a 3-2 win over the Detroit Red 
Wings Tuesday in an early matchup of Western Conference powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending Stanley Cup champion Stars had a two-man advantage  
when Hull fired a pass from Joe Nieuwendyk past Detroit goalie Ken 
Wregget 11:18 into the period to break a 2-2 tie. The goal was 
Hull's second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Zubov had a goal and an assist and Blake Sloan scored his  
first career goal for Dallas, which improved to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Murphy and Steve Duchesne scored goals in the second  
period for the Red Wings. Detroit is 1-4-0 in its last five 
regular-season games against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars played without Mike Modano, who is out indefinitely  
with a mild concussion and broken nose suffered when he was hit 
from behind by Anaheim's Ruslan Salei on Saturday. Salei was given 
a 10-game suspension by the NHL on Tuesday for the hit that caused 
Modano to collide headfirst with the boards before he was removed 
on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Darryl Sydor was also out of the Stars' lineup with a fractured  
eye socket he suffered when he was hit by Anaheim's Jim McKenzie, 
who drew a four-game suspension. Niewendyk played despite the elbow 
he took from the Mighty Ducks' Pascal Trepanier, who was given a 
five-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas goaltender Ed Belfour made 32 saves while Wregget, signed  
as a free agent in the offseason, stopped 11 shots in his first 
start for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars were outshot 13-0 in the first period until Zubov's  
shot from center ice glanced off Wregget's glove and then trickled 
over the goal line, giving Dallas a 1-0 lead at 16:38. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars' chances were once again limited in the second period  
as Detroit outshot them, 15-6. Wregget made a glove save on Zubov's 
shot from the right point and Nieuwendyk hit the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit finally broke through just eight seconds after Hull went  
off for interference. Murphy's shot from the top of the left circle 
got past Belfour at 13:48 as he was screened by Tomas Holmstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 25 seconds later, Duchesne scored his first goal as a Red  
Wing by skating in from the left with a cross-ice pass from Igor 
Larionov and beating Belfour wide to his glove side. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan flipped a loose puck past Wregget for his first career  
goal and a 2-2 tie 3:26 into the third period.

<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres and Miroslav Satan  
agreed to terms on a multiyear contract Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Satan led the Sabres last season with 40 goals and 66 points. He  
was Buffalo's first 40-goal scorer since Pat LaFontaine in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing leaves Buffalo with two holdouts, the defensive  
pairing of Jay McKee and Rhett Warrener, as the team prepared for 
Friday's home opener with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres lost their season opener in Detroit 2-0 as goaltender  
Dominik Hasek faced 44 shots.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Shows New Stock Quote System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market unveiled a new stock  
quote display system Tuesday designed to improve investor access to 
the best prices for the 5,000 stocks listed on the Nasdaq's 
computerized trading system. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system, which should be up and running next summer,  
pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, moves 
the United States stock markets another baby step closer toward the 
creation of a centralized stock quote information system, a 
proposal SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt supported in a speech last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	An SEC spokesman said the agency had no comment on the Nasdaq's  
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergence of a handful of competing electronic stock trading  
systems, where investors can trade stocks at lower prices than the 
traditional exchanges, has raised concerns that the nation's stock 
markets have become too fragmented. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, investors may be finding it more difficult to  
locate the best price for a stock because the stock is being traded 
in several markets, none of which share information. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's new system is aimed at reducing those fears by  
providing more information on the range of prices being asked for a 
stock across an array of markets. The electronic trading systems, 
known as ECNs, or electronic communications networks, are being 
asked to provide stock quotes to the new system on a voluntary 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq officials say the additional information will increase  
investor confidence, while not interfering with competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a giant step toward ending fragmentation'' in the  
markets, Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary McDermott-Holland, a senior vice-president at Franklin  
Portfolio Associates, a Boston investment firm, said the new system 
will give investors ``a better picture of the market,'' which will 
help improve the process used by investors to find the best price. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big difference between the old and new systems is that  
the old one only lists the single best price for a specific stock. 
The new one will display the three best prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly is better than the system we have now. It's a  
step in the right direction,'' said Bernard Madoff, head of Madoff 
Securities, a New York firm that matches buy and sell orders on the 
Nasdaq. Madoff said the system is ``more user friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq officials say providing the three best offers instead of  
just one will increase access to what is known as the market's 
depth, or the total number of offers to buy or sell a specific 
stock at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
	That information will allow investors to make decisions based on  
a wider array of pricing information, which will lead to improved 
confidence and more trading activity, known as liquidity, said NASD 
President Richard Ketchum.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Chides GOP on Social Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edging away from an unpopular Congress, George  
W. Bush said Tuesday fellow Republicans are too often dour, 
pessimistic and focused on economics ``to the exclusion of all 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, my party has confused the need for limited  
government with a disdain for government itself,'' the GOP 
presidential front-runner told New York conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second time in a week the Texas governor has  
declared his independence from the congressional wing of the party, 
suggesting that he feels comfortable challenging elements of the 
GOP establishment -- a contrast to the 1996 presidential nominee, 
Bob Dole, who struggled constantly to keep party leaders satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Unveiling his second education initiative in the Democratic  
bastion of New York also underscored Bush's intention to pursue a 
general election strategy that courts voters outside the GOP base. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to a conservative thinktank, Bush said:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Too often, on social issues, my party has painted an image of  
America slouching toward Gomorrah.'' He borrowed the line from the 
title of a book by conservative Robert Bork. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Too often, my party has focused on the national economy, to  
the exclusion of all else -- speaking a sterile language of rates 
and numbers, of CBO this and GNP that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Government should be limited, but not to the point that  
Americans get hurt. ``That should be our goal: A limited 
government, respected for doing a few things and doing them well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, he said Republicans have a good point: There are  
too many broken homes and lives; a vigorous economy should be 
sought and small government is good government. 
</P>
<P>
	But he weighed in with a flip side -- a rosier view -- by saying  
welfare, education and crime problems are being combatted with 
compassion by Republican reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Problems that seemed inevitable proved to be reversible,''  
Bush said. ``They gave way to an optimistic, governing 
conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers and aides say Bush is fleshing out his ``compassionate  
conservative'' philosophy with examples that show his desire to 
blend conservative principles with more moderate rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, it's a matter of tone.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a continuation of his highlighting the differences  
between conservatism with a frown and conservatism with a smile,'' 
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats called Bush's remarks a ploy to mask his true  
conservative leanings. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush is just offering new rhetorical wrapping paper on  
the same Republican package of wrong ideas for America,'' 
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said. 
</P>
<P>
	To some Democratic and Republican operatives, the strategy is  
reminiscent of Clinton's 1996 effort to distance himself from both 
his own party and the GOP majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers said, however, that the governor's goal is less  
Machiavellian. He simply wants to rise above the partisan 
leadership style of congressional leaders and discuss social issues 
in a positive light -- rather than in a way that seems to condemn 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	One Bush adviser used this example: Welfare reformers need to  
find fault with men who haven't paid child support, not single 
mothers who are trying to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show that many Americans find Republicans in Congress are  
too strident and give them lower approval ratings than President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what he's doing is laying out a vision of where he  
wants to take the Republican Party and it is frankly a very 
different direction from where it has been the last five years,'' 
said Ralph Reed, a GOP consultant who advises the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Bush criticized the Republican Congress for plans to  
trim tax credits to the working poor. He slipped his latest 
assessment of the GOP establishment in an education address Tuesday 
that separated himself from the views of many conservatives by 
calling for federally mandated state testing of students. 
</P>
<P>
	States, he said, should be required to participate in the  
National Assessment Educational Program, which tests randomly 
selected students every two to four years. Participation is now 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed expanding the tax-free, interest-bearing  
education savings account program. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's distancing himself from Congress has irked some  
GOP lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting stuff done here. Real stuff. Compassionate  
conservative stuff,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is, he's out campaigning and we right  
now are in the position of governing,'' Rep. David Dreier, 
R-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many GOP lawmakers, perhaps recognizing Bush's general election  
strategy, brushed off the criticism. ``Sometimes I take shots at 
Congress, too, and Washington as a whole,'' Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott said.

<HEADLINE> Filene's Fights To Stay on Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLESLEY, Mass. (AP) -- Troubled discount retailer Filene's  
Basement Corp. said it will fight the Nasdaq Stock Market's plan to 
delist its stock because the bankrupt retailer fails to meet 
minimum requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Filene's Basement has requested a hearing to appeal the  
decision, company spokesman Rich Tauberman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Filene's Basement filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in  
federal court Aug. 23. Nasdaq suspended trading of the company's 
shares the same day, and at Nasdaq's request, the company on Sept. 
2 submitted documents detailing its financial health, Tauberman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Filene's Basement's appeal is turned down, ``the company will  
seek alternative means of having the stock traded,'' Tauberman said 
without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq spokesman Wayne Lee said the exchange does not make  
public its dealings with listed companies. A company can still 
trade on the Nasdaq if it is bankrupt, Lee said, but it must 
continue to meet certain minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them: the company's stock must meet a minimum bid price of  
at least $1 at the close of the market, and the company must have a 
minimum of 400 shareholders and $4 million in net tangible assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced last week it will close a total of 19  
underperforming stores by year's end as part of its plan to emerge 
from bankruptcy, bringing the total number of closures to 19. After 
the closings, Filene's Basement will have 32 stores, which will 
continue to operate while the company reorganizes its debt.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 23.74 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged higher this morning as investors  
remained confident that today's Federal Reserve strategy meeting 
would not produce another boost in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 23.74 at 10,424.97, building on Monday's 
128-point rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly positive, although  
declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nasdaq trading, however, gainers led by a 6-to-5 ratio, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was up 10.46 at 2,806.43. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was up 1.64 at 1,306.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was expected to remain somewhat restrained until the  
afternoon, when Fed officials were expected to conclude one of 
their periodic meetings on inflation and interest rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of inflationary growth in the economy have prompted the  
Fed to boost lending rates twice in recent months, but analysts 
expected the central bank to take a wait-and-see approach going 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications stocks led the early advance amid news that  
MCI WorldCom had sealed an agreement to acquire long-distance rival 
Sprint for $115 billion in what would be the largest corporate 
takeover in history. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, slipped 1 to 70 5/8 as the most active Nasdaq issue,  
while Sprint was up 1 3/8 at 62 1/4 on the NYSE. Among other leading 
telecom names, AT&AMP;T was up 1 at 44 3/4 on the NYSE and Qwest 
Communications was up 1 1/2 at 34 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading today, the Russell 2000 index of smaller  
companies was up 0.18 at 426.79. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 114.41 million shares, up from 93.38 million  
at the same point on Monday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs $289B Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fiscal 2000 defense bill signed into law  
by President Clinton includes a host of financial incentives -- 
including the biggest military pay raise in 18 years -- that the 
Pentagon is counting on to boost recruiting and persuade more 
troops to make a career of their service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The excellence of our military is the direct product of the  
excellence of our men and women in uniform,'' Clinton said Tuesday 
in a bill-signing ceremony at the Pentagon. ``This bill invests in 
that excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pay package, including a 4.8 percent across-the-board raise  
effective Jan. 1 and a change in pay scales effective next July, 
represents the biggest increase in compensation in a generation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, who joined Clinton on the  
Pentagon steps to thank Congress for forging the legislation, said 
service members deserve better pay and working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to recruit and retain the best people and provide them  
with a sound quality of life if we're going to remain a dominant 
force for good for the future,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $289 billion defense bill represents an $18 billion increase  
over fiscal 1999, which ended Sept. 30. Republicans in Congress 
were quick to point out it is also $8 billion more than Clinton had 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
	``While this bill does not fully address all of the Joint  
Chiefs' critical requirements, ... it does provide short-term fixes 
necessary to ensure an improved quality of military life for our 
service members and their families,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, 
R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent pay raise is the highest since a 14.3 percent  
boost in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the Air Force ended the 1999  
fiscal year with a manpower shortage of about 10,000 -- a 
combination of too few recruits and too many people leaving the 
service for commercial aviation jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, Navy and Marine Corps reached troop strength levels  
set by Congress, although only the Marines -- the smallest of the 
major services with 172,500 people -- met their goals in both 
recruiting and retention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force, which for years didn't need to bother with TV  
advertising, fell short in both recruiting and retention, whereas 
the Army overcame a recruiting shortfall by exceeding its retention 
goal. The Navy, which was nearly 7,000 recruits short in 1998, met 
its goal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development Tuesday, the Parents Television  
Council, a private advocacy group, complained in a letter to Army 
Secretary Louis Caldera about the Army buying recruit advertising 
time on TV shows that the council considers excessively violent and 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's Steven Schweim said the objectionable shows include  
``WWF Smackdown,'' a wrestling program. He said the Army helped 
sponsor five episodes, and the Navy and Air Force sponsored one 
each. Schweim said his group planned to complain to Navy and Air 
Force leaders later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The programs the Army is currently sponsoring, which glorify  
wanton and cruel violence, obscenity and the mockery of America's 
great presidents and military heroes, undermine the Army's own core 
values,'' Brent Bozell, the chairman of the Parents Television 
Council, wrote to Caldera. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about such objections, a senior Pentagon official who  
spoke on condition of anonymity said the services are mainly 
interested in reaching the largest possible audience of potential 
recruits.

<HEADLINE> North Dakotans Suing Over Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- As Howard and Adeline Snortland approached  
their 80s, they decided to insure themselves against future steep 
nursing care costs. Nearly a decade later, they have dropped their 
coverage, after paying almost $12,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was a good idea to protect our children in case  
we were not in a condition to take care of ourselves,'' said Howard 
Snortland, now 87. ``We're discouraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Snortlands, of Bismarck, are among hundreds of North  
Dakotans who are suing two insurance companies that, they say, 
lured them to buy long-term care insurance policies with prices 
that were too low, then dramatically raised their rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Their first annual premium was $889 in 1987. By 1995, when the  
Snortlands dropped their policies, the rate had more than tripled, 
to $2,947, after premium increases of 25 percent, 25 percent and 40 
percent, Howard Snortland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this was ridiculous,'' he said. ``There was nothing  
to prevent them from going to 50 percent next time. I just didn't 
trust them anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A jury is being selected this week to hear the case, which  
focuses on whether the premium increases were justified. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Bismarck, seeks  
unspecified damages. It alleges that Acceleration Life Insurance 
Co. of Dublin, Ohio, and Commonwealth Life Insurance Co. of 
Louisville, Ky., sold fraudulently underpriced long-term care 
policies in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies later raised their rates exorbitantly, to force  
policyholders into dropping their coverage and lose the premiums 
they had paid, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Acceleration and Commonwealth have denied the claims in court  
filings, saying the coverage was priced properly, and that the 
policies did not violate North Dakota insurance law. Their 
attorneys declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar lawsuits have been filed in Wyoming and Florida by Allan  
Kanner, a New Orleans lawyer who is one of the lead attorneys in 
the North Dakota case. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care insurance covers a certain amount of custodial  
care for the elderly or sick in their own homes, or in nursing 
homes. The policies are a popular way for older people to protect 
their estates from being depleted by high nursing care costs, said 
Trent Heinemeyer, North Dakota's deputy insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers that sell policies in North Dakota must have Insurance  
Department approval of their rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a company has issued policies after we approved a rate and  
three years down the road says they need a 50 percent rate 
increase, we require they prove it's necessary,'' Heinemeyer said. 
If that requirement is met, he said, ``our hands are somewhat tied 
in denying that increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says Acceleration Life and Commonwealth Life raised  
their premiums annually from 1989 to 1996. In some cases, the total 
increase during that time was as much as 700 percent, forcing most 
policyholders to dump their coverage, the lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 300 North Dakotans out of more than 2,000 who bought  
nursing home policies from the two companies still have them, and 
those who still do are paying astronomical premiums, the lawsuit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance policies themselves told buyers that premiums  
could rise. The lawsuit acknowledges that, but says the policies 
gave no hint of the steep premium increases to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Big rate increases on some long-term care policies during the  
late 1980s and early 1990s could be tied to rising health care 
costs, said Shelly Peterson, president of the North Dakota Long 
Term Care Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term care insurance ``has been a developing field,''  
Peterson said. ``Maybe some companies didn't have as much 
information to price the product as they should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acceleration Life and Commonwealth Life were pioneers in the  
field of long-term care insurance and were likely caught unaware of 
the cost, said Pamela Schmidt, vice president of SIA Marketing in 
Bismarck. SIA Marketing, which sells long-term care policies 
nationwide, did some business with Acceleration Life several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody knew enough about long-term care to  
deliberately'' defraud, Schmidt said. ``No one had any statistics 
on usage ... and what happened with Acceleration was they didn't 
charge enough and then they started paying out high benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acceleration and Commonwealth assert in court documents that the  
Insurance Department considered their premium increases reasonable. 
Even with them, they collected about $26.4 million in premiums and 
paid $40.2 million in benefits, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some really tough increases that were requested,  
that we had no choice but to approve because the company was paying 
out way more in benefits than they were receiving in premiums,'' 
Insurance Commissioner Glenn Pomeroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Snortlands' experience with long-term care insurance has  
turned them off on the concept, and they plan to pay for future 
nursing care out of their pensions and Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	They also plan to lobby for better consumer protection. Howard  
Snortland, who is a former state superintendent of public 
instruction, was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the North 
Dakota Senate last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just hoping that either through the Legislature or the  
courts, we can protect people,'' he said. ``It's unscrupulous 
insurance companies taking advantage of old people.''

<HEADLINE> Activist Proposes Liquor Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Unable to persuade the government to shut  
down white-owned liquor stores near the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation, American Indian activist Russell Means said he wants 
to open a liquor store and use the profits to treat alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol is banned on the South Dakota reservation, a  
5,000-square-mile expanse that is home to 15,000 Oglala Sioux and 
has one of the nation's highest alcoholism-related mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Four stores in Whiteclay -- just two miles from the reservation --  
sell millions of dollars worth of beer each year, most of it to 
Oglala Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
	Means said he wants to form a nonprofit corporation to open a  
liquor store in the tiny town and use the proceeds to build an 
alcohol rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a win-win situation for the governor, state of Nebraska  
and for the taxpayers,'' Means said Monday. ``We don't want to run 
anybody out of business, contrary to the American way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Mike Johanns, who has met with tribal leaders in the past  
to discuss concerns, said the state would treat Means' liquor 
license application ``like any other application that comes 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means, co-founder of the American Indian Movement, was among  
several Indians who were arrested July 3 in Whiteclay while 
protesting the alcohol sales and the unsolved murders of two Oglala 
Sioux men found earlier this year just outside the town. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would like to have the store open by spring.  
</P>
<P>
	Fellow activist Frank LaMere said he supports Means' idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will empower the Oglala people and give them some control --  
which is something that don't have now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Climber Feared Dead in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Alex Lowe, described by Outside magazine  
as the best mountain climber in the world, was presumed dead 
Tuesday with another climber in a Himalayan avalanche, the 
expedition announced. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispatch from the American Shishapangma Ski Expedition, posted  
on the Web site MountainZone.com, said the climbers were struck by 
an avalanche on 26,291-foot Shishapangma in Tibet early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing and presumed dead was cameraman Dave Bridges.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew McLean, the expedition leader, told MountainZone.com, an  
expedition sponsor, by satellite telephone that the avalanche 
struck the climbers above Advance Base Camp on the upper slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, 40, of Bozeman, and Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colo., were  
swept away along with Colorado climber Conrad Anker, McLean said. 
Anker was ``pretty beat up'' but not seriously injured when he was 
found, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe and Bridges have not been found, and the search for them  
has been abandoned because of hazardous conditions on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	The expedition had as its goal not only climbing Shishapangma,  
the 14th highest mountain in the world, but also skiing down it. 
Bridges was part of a three-man film crew that was documenting the 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe was a celebrity in the mountain climbing community. He is  
on posters, in magazines such as National Geographic and on 
television leading the way up intimidating slabs of granite. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's climbing career spanned 25 years. He logged alpine climbs  
in France, Kyrgyzstan, Peru, Canada, Nepal, Pakistan and 
Antarctica. He summited Mount Everest twice. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of The North Face's ``Dream Team'' -- the  
best-known climbers in the country -- and was under contract to test 
and promote the sale of North Face clothing and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was called the best climber in the world in a March cover  
story in Outside magazine.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Shakes Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARMARIS, Turkey (AP) -- Another earthquake hit Turkey on  
Tuesday, jolting this resort town and sending tourists and 
residents into the streets or jumping from balconies in panic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials said 32 people were treated for broken legs  
or arms and 70 others suffered from shock. One person had a broken 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Istanbul's Kandilli Observatory said the epicenter of the quake  
was at Marmaris, 470 miles south of Istanbul. Most people in the 
resort were asleep when the magnitude 5.2 quake hit at 3:53 a.m. At 
least six aftershocks followed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of any tourists being injured.  
</P>
<P>
	A magnitude 7.4 quake devastated Istanbul and other areas of  
northwest Turkey on Aug. 17, killing some 16,000 people. Those who 
threw themselves out of windows and off balconies Tuesday 
apparently feared they could be trapped if their houses collapsed, 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some tourists set out for home after the quake. Others who had  
come to enjoy the sun, sand and deep-blue bays around Marmaris took 
to sleeping on beach mattresses or napping at outdoor cafes after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there is no intense panic, they want to go back  
home,'' said Ibrahim Gurkan, an official from the Marmaris Elegance 
Hotel. ``We are trying to help them to fly back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials decided to close the schools to assess damage  
and let children -- some of whom had spent the night outside -- 
recover and rest.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Governor Seeks $5.3B in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina needs a staggering $5.3  
billion in federal aid for its long recovery from Hurricane Floyd, 
Gov. Jim Hunt said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunt went to Washington to lobby Congress and the White House  
for $2.2 billion in immediate aid to help farmers and homeowners 
and to begin rebuilding damaged highways and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	That's in addition to $1 billion Hunt already has requested, and  
he said he plans eventually to seek $2.1 billion more for long-term 
recovery and planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse than anyone imagined,'' Hunt said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said a  
farm-assistance package approved by the House last week won't be 
nearly sufficient to cover North Carolina's needs. It includes just 
$1.2 billion for all weather-related losses nationwide this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders have suggested handling Hurricane Floyd  
losses in a separate supplemental appropriations bill next year, 
but Hunt said North Carolina can't wait that long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have the money this year,'' Hunt said.  
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, blamed for at least 48 deaths in North Carolina, is  
expected easily to surpass Hurricane Fran, which caused $6 billion 
in damage in 1996, as the state's costliest natural disaster once 
insurance claims and local government spending are counted. Floyd 
drenched eastern North Carolina with 20 inches of rain on Sept. 16, 
flooding 27 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture losses alone, including 30,500 drowned hogs and 2.8  
million dead poultry, will exceed $1 billion, officials said. Floyd 
also destroyed 3,680 homes and damaged 12,000 others, and more than 
500 people remained in shelters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding's effects likely will be felt across the nation at  
Thanksgiving, state agriculture spokesman Jim Knight said Tuesday. 
North Carolina is the nation's largest producer of sweet potatoes, 
and half of the state's crop was ruined. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the one crop that consumers may see a price adjustment  
on,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, officials in 21 counties mapped plans Tuesday to  
spray mosquitoes breeding in the pools of water left by Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're somebody who's lost a whole lot, you're trying to  
clean up, and you've got mosquitoes landing on you at 25 to 100 a 
minute, it's an endeavor we just have to undertake,'' said Debbie 
Crane, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials also decided to drop many coastal areas from an  
advisory warning people to avoid contact with some rivers, sounds 
and ocean waters, and announced that shellfishing would be reopened 
in many estuaries beginning Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo share prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices gained moderately Tuesday, as  
investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting later 
in the day. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 20.44  
points, or 0.12 percent, to 17,784.15. The average closed up 51.15 
points, or 0.29 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar was trading at 106.60 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT)  
Tuesday, up 0.49 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its 
level of 106.30 yen overnight in New York.. The greenback traded 
during the day from 105.88 yen to 106.77 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices closed slightly higher, but  
investors remained cautious ahead of the Fed's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wait-and-see attitude grew in the afternoon,'' said  
Hidenori Karaki, general manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many expect the Federal Reserve to leave key rates  
unchanged, investors will be looking for any indication of bias in 
favor of future tightening of monetary policy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were also supported by the announcement of a new  
Cabinet Tuesday, marking the beginning of Japan's new three-party 
government coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The successful creation of the coalition underscores the  
leadership of Prime Minister (Keizo) Obuchi,'' said Hideyuki Nakai, 
a senior investment manager at Nippon Global Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It also lowers the risk of short-term political instability  
and increases the likelihood of new economic stimulus measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 461.75 million  
shares, up from 434.24 million shares Tuesday. Retreaters 
overwhelmed advancers 811 to 391 while 125 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 5.92 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,510.06. The 
TOPIX closed up 0.90 points, or 0.06 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the market reacted little to government  
comments that dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan was 
unlikely in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the head of the Economic Planning Agency,  
Taichi Sakaiya, suggested that intervention in currency markets is 
not imminent because the yen may be stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``So long as the dollar-yen rate remains stable around 105 yen  
or 106 yen, I do not expect immediate intervention,'' Sakaiya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakaiya also said, ``Steps will be taken against rapid moves in  
foreign exchange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, traders said they will be watching closely the U.S.  
Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar-yen and euro-yen are being bought on dips and sold  
on highs by overseas profiteers ahead of the FOMC,'' said Takashi 
Toyohara, a senior foreign exchange dealer at Nomura Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 113.90 yen late Tuesday, up  
0.08 yen from its level of 113.82 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.6100 percent from Monday's finish of 1.6050 percent. Its price 
fell 0.05 point to 100.78.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, CAW Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers and DaimlerChrysler AG  
reached a contract agreement Tuesday night, less than two hours 
before 13,800 union workers were set to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW President Buzz Hargrove said at a news conference in Toronto  
that the deal was modeled on an agreement the union's rank-and-file 
ratified last week with Ford Motor Co. of Canada. A date for a 
ratification vote was not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent deal,'' Hargrove said. ``I have absolutely  
no disappointment at all. After bargaining a long while, I know you 
don't get everything you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for DaimlerChrysler spokesmen at the Toronto  
hotel where negotiations were held was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the deal, the two sides appeared to be at a  
standstill over four disputes related to union organizing and 
future work. The union had set a strike deadline of 11:59 p.m. 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the agreement between CAW and Ford, workers received a 3  
percent wage increase in each year of a three-year package, a 
$1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus, a lucrative retirement package and 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the agreement with DaimlerChrysler also includes a  
$1,200 (Canadian) Christmas bonus and $800 in tuition fees for 
dependents. He said that under the agreement, 2,300 workers are 
eligible to retire immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had said that the union could strike over disputes at  
DaimlerChrysler plants in Windsor and Ajax, Ontario, where work has 
not been assigned. He said the CAW had reached agreements at both 
those plants, including saving more than 70 jobs at the Ajax plant. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> FIFA Announces New Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- FIFA said Tuesday it will start  
out-of-competition drug tests in Europe next spring, a major step 
in bringing its anti-doping policy closer in line with the 
International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	As of next season, the world's top players will be subject to  
such testing by a FIFA-managed team of drug experts, wherever they 
play around the world, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to improve our fight against doping by starting  
out-of-competition testing,'' Sepp Blatter, president of the world 
soccer federation, said on the eve of a FIFA medical committee 
meeting. ``We have to show we are clean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system will start during the preparation campaigns of the 16  
national teams which will compete in the June 10-July 2 European 
Championships in Belgium and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I do not exclude there will be testing in other continents  
too,'' Michel D'Hooghe, head of FIFA's medical committee, said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA approved the principle of out-of-competition testing last  
year but found it hard to put into practice. Sports such as track 
and field have carried on out-of-competition controls for years, 
and the surprise tests are a major element of the IOC's anti-doping 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others have already done this now. Our time has come,''  
D'Hooghe said. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Hooghe has long called for out-of-competition testing,  
especially after assessing reports on the use of sophisticated 
muscle-building anabolic steroids that leave no trace in the body 
by the time the competition starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why we need to have the system as soon as possible,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, random testing in soccer is done by local  
authorities but the practice is rare.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Top-Paid Player in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Two years ago, the Pittsburgh Pirates' entire  
payroll was about $10 million. This season, Jaromir Jagr of the 
Penguins will make more than that by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr, a three-time NHL scoring champion and the league's top  
attraction now that Wayne Gretzky is retired, will make $10,359,852 
this season. His salary more than doubled -- he made $4.75 million 
last season -- under the terms of the $48 million contract he signed 
in January 1998 that runs through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr's salary is more than twice that of linebacker Levon  
Kirkland, the Steelers' highest-paid player with a $4,375,000 base 
salary this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His salary is about three times that of Pirates outfielder Al  
Martin, who made $2.9 million this season, but will be passed up 
next season by first baseman Kevin Young. Young will make $6 
million in the first year of a $24 million, four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart is in the first season of a  
$27 million, five-year contract that replaced a contract that was 
to expire after the 2000 season. Stewart got an $8.1 million 
signing bonus, but agreed to cut his salary from $2 million to 
$400,000 this season to help the Steelers stay under the salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart would make $6.3 million in 2003, the final year of his  
nonguaranteed contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr's salary is more than team owner Mario Lemieux ever made in  
a season -- Lemieux signed a $42 million, six-year contract in 1992 
that was renegotiated several times -- and is about four times that 
of any teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaromir Jagr is the best player in the world,'' said Lemieux,  
who carried that distinction himself before retiring from the NHL 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly gotten better every year, and I would  
anticipate that he will continue getting better,'' Lemieux said. 
``He's not a typical player, he's a special player, and he's gotten 
better throughout his whole career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Tom Barrasso is the Penguins' second highest-paid  
player at $2,717,000. Other Penguins making at least $2 million are 
forwards Alexei Kovalev at $2.1 million and Martin Straka at $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have five other players making at least $1 million:  
defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, $1,400,000; defenseman Peter 
Popovic, $1,400,000; center German Titov, $1,200,000; defenseman 
Jiri Slegr, $1,100,000, and forward Matthew Barnaby, $1,000,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23 players on the roster for Friday's season opener at  
Dallas will make $31,552,000 this season, or slightly above the 
estimated $30 million budgeted by Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	The payroll was $33.25 million before general manager Craig  
Patrick traded defenseman Kevin Hatcher and his $3.1 million salary 
to the New York Rangers for defenseman Peter Popovic, who makes 
$1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman John Slaney, a training camp free agent who signed  
the day before the season started, will make $400,000. Kasparaitis 
ended his holdout last week and agreed to a $3 million, two-year 
contract.

<HEADLINE> Some Talking Oprah for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- She's a multimillionaire talk-show host, actress  
and -- most recently -- college professor. Now some Reform Party 
members are talking about President Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Party members from Minnesota have created a Web site to draft  
Ms. Winfrey for the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is Jesse Ventura times 100,'' said Paul Larsen, chairman of  
the draft committee and a party leader from suburban Minneapolis. 
``She's got a thousand times as much money, 100 times the name 
recognition. She has a sterling reputation for honesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The queen of talk is not interested, a spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Larsen said he is not giving up and will ask Ventura,  
Minnesota's governor and the nation's highest elected Reform Party 
official, to help persuade her to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura spokesman Doug Friedline said the whole situation ``has  
gotten kind of weird. ... It's almost like we have celebrity-itis 
in the Reform Party.''

<HEADLINE> Leading Economic Indicators Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future economic activity declined  
in August following three straight monthly gains. But the nation's 
economy still seems robust enough to keep growing through February 
and into the record books as the longest expansion ever in U.S. 
history, the Conference Board reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to forecast  
economic activity three to six months in the future, fell 0.1 
percent in August. It had risen nine times in the last 11 months, 
including an increase of 0.3 percent in each of previous three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The first decline in the index since a 0.1 percent dip in April  
signals that rising interest rates are starting to slow the 
economy, said an economist at the Conference Board, a 
business-sponsored research organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates twice  
since June in an attempt to keep the economy from overheating to 
the point that it revives higher inflation. Fed policy-makers met 
again Tuesday, leaving rates unchanged for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Fed warned that its policy bias now leans toward raising  
interest rates and said it will be especially watchful for signs of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the slight decline in the leading index, which was not  
as steep as analysts' expected, the economy continues to grow, the 
Conference Board said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures suggest the nation's longest peacetime economic  
expansion, which began in March 1991, has enough strength to become 
the longest on record, said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest economic expansion in U.S. history lasted for 106  
months, from February 1961 until December 1969. The current 
expansion will pass that record if it runs through February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates have affected some sectors of the economy,  
leading to a dip in new housing construction and a slight drop in 
the average workweek, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most significant drags on the index in August were slower  
deliveries from vendors, lower stock prices, reduced consumer 
expectations and a decline in building permits. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, five of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index  
rose in August, including orders for nondefense capital goods and 
manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
	One economist said the tiny drop in August did not yet signal a  
trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following three months of solid gains this seems like a mere  
wiggle,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities 
America. ``We need to see a lot more movement before we see any 
real signal of weakness in the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coincident index, which measure current expansion, rose 0.2  
percent in August, the fourth consecutive monthly rise of at least 
0.2 percent. The lagging index, which measures recent past 
performance, rose 0.2 percent after a gain of 0.5 percent in July 
and a 0.4 percent decline in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading indicators are calculated from a base of 100, set in  
1992. First calculated in the late 1960s, it is periodically 
fine-tuned and figures from past years are revised.

<HEADLINE> Poll Outlines Millennium Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest challenge in the next millennium  
may be learning to live together, says an ABC News poll, which said 
the pending problems mentioned most often were racism and 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost one in four thought living together in harmony will be  
hard, according to an ABC News poll released Monday: 14 percent 
said it's because of racism and prejudice, 9 percent because of 
people's need to learn to get along with each other. Racism and 
prejudice were chosen most often by whites as well as by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top challenges mentioned for the new millennium were  
pollution, violence and overpopulation. War, immorality and food 
shortages came next. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest hope for the new millennium is peace in the world,  
named by 38 percent, followed by the discovery of cures for dread 
diseases like cancer and AIDS, named by 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC poll was unusual in that it asked ``open-ended''  
questions, which means people were able to offer whatever answers 
first came to mind rather than choose from a list. ABC pollster 
Gary Langer said ``asking open-ended questions allows for an 
unlimited range of answers, and that lets us delve more deeply into 
people's hopes and fears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll, taken Aug. 16-22 of 506 adults, has an error  
margin of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked the greatest historical figures of the last 1,000  
years, Americans tended to look close to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Former presidents Abraham Lincoln and George Washington were  
each named by 12 percent of those questioned. Martin Luther King 
Jr., former president John F. Kennedy and German dictator Adolf 
Hitler were next. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked the top figure in several different  
fields, these people got the most mentions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Medicine: Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine.  
</P>
<P>
	--Politics or government: Presidents John F. Kennedy, Abraham  
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	--Literature: William Shakespeare.  
</P>
<P>
	--Sports: Michael Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	--Music: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  
</P>
<P>
	--Exploration: Christopher Columbus.  
</P>
<P>
	--Business: Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	--Science: Albert Einstein.  
</P>
<P>
	--Religion: Pope John Paul II, followed closely by Billy Graham  
and Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
	--The military: Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, followed closely by  
Gen. Colin Powell and Gen. George S. Patton. 
</P>
<P>
	--Entertainment: Bob Hope, followed closely by Frank Sinatra,  
Elvis Presley and William Shakespeare.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Gov. Clarifies Drugs Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressed to clarify his views on legalizing  
drugs, New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson said Tuesday he foresees a 
process that would start with marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see legalization of dangerous drugs any time soon,''  
Johnson told reporters after speaking for drug legalization at the 
libertarian Cato Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a Republican in his second term, drew strong criticism  
from anti-drug leaders last week when he became the first sitting 
governor to advocate legalized narcotics. Johnson said the nation's 
war on drugs has been a multibillion-dollar failure that throws too 
many people in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not pro-drug here. I'm against drugs,'' Johnson told his  
Cato audience. ``Should you go to jail for just doing drugs? I say 
no. I say you shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Control it. Regulate it. Tax it. If we legalize it, we just  
might have a better society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug policy director Barry McCaffrey plans to speak  
Thursday in Albuquerque in opposition to Johnson's stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agenda espoused by people like Governor Johnson would put  
more drugs into the hands of children and make drugs more available 
on our nation's streets,'' McCaffrey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Johnson said he favors legalizing marijuana and  
heroin. During discussions this week with groups pressing for 
changes in drug laws, he has said that legalizing any drug, along 
with the correct restrictions, could cause use of that drug to 
remain level or decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he views marijuana -- which he admits he smoked as a  
young man -- as less dangerous than tobacco or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marijuana is never going to have the devastating effects on us  
that alcohol and tobacco have on us,'' Johnson said. ``If marijuana 
is legalized, alcohol abuse goes down, because people will have a 
substance choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said marijuana is the best candidate to be legalized first,  
followed by more dangerous drugs such as heroin or cocaine, the 
other illegal drug Johnson has admitted having used. 
</P>
<P>
	Those dangerous drugs, Johnson said, should have even more  
restrictions on their sale and use than marijuana, such as perhaps 
requiring a doctor's prescription and being administered in a 
hospital or clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see it in grocery stores,'' Johnson told  
reporters. ``I'm assuming that wouldn't happen. The more dangerous 
the perception of the drug, the more control there would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With marijuana, Johnson said he foresees a time when states will  
regulate its sale and distribution as they now regulate hard 
liquor, which some states restrict to state-owned stores and others 
allow in private outlets. The federal or state governments could 
take over the growing, distributing and selling, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that doesn't decrease drug use, I don't know what will,''  
he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Other constraints, Johnson said, should include restricting drug  
sales to those over 21 and increasing penalties for crimes 
committed under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said public reaction in calls and letters to his office  
has been running ``97 to 3'' in favor of his position, but he 
doubts he could get a drug legalization measure through the New 
Mexico legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I stand here right now, I don't see that as being  
possible,'' Johnson said. ``I see that as a federal issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a multipartisan group of Libertarians and others  
announced in New Mexico that it was filing with the Federal 
Election Commission to establish a Libertarian Draft Gary Johnson 
for President Committee. Johnson politely refused.

<HEADLINE> Florida Coach Concerned With Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Soon, No. 8 Florida will find out if  
two Steve Spurriers are better than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated with a young defense ranked last in the Southeastern  
Conference, Spurrier, the longtime mastermind on offense, has 
decided to expand his responsibilities and start helping coach the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, he began sitting in on defensive meetings, a place  
where he was a stranger in recent seasons. He wants to offer 
suggestions and make himself more accountable for a unit that has 
struggled under first-year coordinator Jon Hoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it will do any good,'' Spurrier said. ``But  
you know me. We're not going to do the same stuff we've been doing, 
that's for sure. We're going to try something different. I can't 
watch that and I know our fans don't want to watch what we 
attempted last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense languished on the field for more than 42 minutes  
last week in a 40-39 loss to Alabama, mainly because it couldn't 
stop the Crimson Tide on third down. Alabama converted 11 of 20 
third downs, including four on third-and-8 or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive backs were continually out of position. Defensive  
linemen produced only one sack. Linebackers seemed lost through 
most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Spurrier, who has taken a larger role in the defense  
before, but not since at least 1995, the year before Bob Stoops 
become coordinator. Stoops departed, as did most of last year's 
players, leaving this year's defense inexperienced and, at many 
times, looking clueless. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to find out the ones that will accept  
coaching instead of the ones who do their own stuff out there,'' 
Spurrier said. ``That's called coaching. When you're struggling, 
you've got to try to coach better. You've got to try to put players 
out there who you think at least will try to do what you're asking 
them to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Two players, safety Lester Norwood and linebacker Keith Kelsey,  
are candidates to lose their starting positions this week, although 
there is no more experience behind them on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, who coached defensive backs at Missouri last year, says he  
is not threatened by Spurrier's decision to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal, it's not a big problem,'' Hoke said. ``He  
doesn't come in there and demand you do this or demand you do that. 
He just says, `Well, this is kind of what people are doing to us 
now. If it fits, great. You might want to take a look at it.' 
That's his approach to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier says the Gators will do different things Saturday at  
LSU. He has mentioned trying more blitzing. He's also considering 
dropping eight players into coverage so Florida will ``have someone 
back there trying to cover somebody, trying to back up one of those 
linebackers who gets out of position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After allowing 865 yards in the first two games of the season,  
Florida looked like it was getting better, giving up just 287 
against Tennessee and 317 to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakdowns returned against Alabama, which gained 447 yards  
and stayed on the field for a strength-sapping 81 plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Marquand Manuel says the situation has become  
frustrating, but the Gators defenders aren't giving up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get off the field, we didn't create turnovers,''  
Manuel said. ``But it's not all going downhill. We played hard. We 
know storms will come, but we've just got to prevail.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Expected To Keep Rates Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the nation's economy purrs smoothly with no  
immediate inflation dangers at hand, the Federal Reserve is 
expected, for now, to forgo a third interest rate increase, private 
economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	They aren't ruling out the possibility of higher rates before  
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts are taking this view because inflation has  
remained well-behaved despite strong economic growth and an 
unemployment rate remaining at a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	A rate increase is ``a no-go -- primarily because there's not a  
sufficient amount of data suggesting continued inflationary 
pressures,'' said Richard Yamarone, senior economist with Argus 
Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee, which comprises Fed board  
members in Washington and the presidents of the Fed's 12 regional 
banks, was meeting privately today to review interest rate policy. 
Financial markets eagerly awaited a midafternoon announcement of 
their decision; at midmorning the Dow Jones average had gained 60 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing further evidence that the economic boom has slowed,  
the Conference Board reported today that the Index of Leading 
Indicators, a barometer of future activity, fell in August -- but by 
half the expected drop. The index lost 0.1 after three straight 
monthly gains. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another reason economists believe the central bank won't  
raise interest rates today. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan usually gives investors  
a solid sign of an impending interest rate increase. But he and 
other Fed officials haven't done that, striking instead a more 
dovish tone. That indicates they've seen few signs of inflation 
even with rapid economic growth, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've heard from people on the Fed, including Chairman  
Greenspan, doesn't point to an interest rate increase,'' said Tim 
O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and Harris Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street appeared to take the view Monday that the Fed will  
hold the line for the time being. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed up 128.23 points at 10,401.23. But even with the rebound, 
stocks are down almost 1,000 points from their record close of 
11,299.76 on Aug. 23, just before the last Fed rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the economy slowed in the second quarter to an anemic  
1.6 percent annual rate, many economists said that was just a 
temporary lull. They are looking for the economy to grow at around 
a 4 percent rate in both the third and fourth quarters, far above 
the 3 percent rate many Fed policy-makers believe is prudent with 
today's tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, many economists believe the Fed may raise rates this  
year by a quarter of a point when it meets on Nov. 16, depending on 
what a fresh round of economic data released between now and then -- 
including two employment reports and several inflation reports -- 
says about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed still thinks rates need to go up a notch,'' said  
Cynthia Latta, senior economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ``But 
they won't do it Tuesday. They will wait until November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One more quarter-point rate increase would move the short-term  
rates the Fed controls back to where they were before the central 
bank cut rates in three quarter-point moves last fall to keep 
financial turmoil in Asia and Russia from derailing the U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 30, the Fed nudged up the federal funds rate -- the  
interest that banks charge each other -- by a quarter of a point, 
the first time in two years. It raised the funds rate again, by the 
same amount, to 5.25 percent, on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks quickly responded to each of those increases by boosting  
prime lending rates by a quarter of a point. That benchmark rate 
for millions of consumer and business loans now stands at 8.25 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists were split on whether the Fed will keep its policy  
directive, which signals the future course of interest rates, at 
neutral or switch it to one leaning toward raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed had been expected to leave rates alone at both their  
Nov. 16 and Dec. 21 meetings because of anxiety about the Year 2000 
computer date change. But more and more analysts now believe that 
Y2K won't stop the Fed from acting because they have grown more 
confident that banks have made computer upgrades needed to handle 
any problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y2K has gone so smoothly -- domestically -- it's not a  
constraint on the Fed anymore,'' said Ken Mayland, an economist 
with KeyCorp.

<HEADLINE> NFL President Joins CBS Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NFL president Neil Austrian has joined a new  
major Web destination that is controlled by CBS Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian, the new chairman of the venture, iWon.com, will retain  
his positions as NFL president and chief executive officer, the 
league said. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian helped negotiate the NFL's eight-year, $18 billion  
television contract with ABC, ESPN, Fox and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL said Austrian's positions with the league and the CBS  
venture would not pose a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Mr. Austrian's view, there is no conflict,'' league  
spokesman Joe Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the founders of the Web site is Bill Daugherty, a friend  
of Austrian's from Harvard Business School, and a former senior 
vice president at the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is providing $70 million in advertising, promotion and other  
consideration to the Web destination site that aims to entice 
millions of visitors to its other Internet offerings that range 
from business news to sports and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to links to popular sites, the iWon.com destination  
offers a search and directory service, chat rooms, news and 
entertainment, and other information and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal represents CBS's first majority stake in a Web site.

<HEADLINE> Flu Drug Could Prevent A, B Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An experimental drug nearing government approval  
would give flu sufferers their first effective pill against both A 
and B flu viruses, the two major types that afflict Americans, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	An inhaled powder that works against both types was approved by  
the Food and Drug Administration in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill, to be marketed as Tamiflu, helped reduce the duration  
and severity of flu symptoms by about half in 80 unvaccinated 
adults who were voluntarily infected with the flu virus, 
researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The prescription drug also helped prevent the flu in  
unvaccinated adults who took the drug before being exposed to the 
virus, said researchers led by Dr. Frederick G. Hayden of the 
University of Virginia. Only eight of 21 people who took the drug 
before exposure got infected (38 percent), compared with eight of 
12 who did not take the drug (67 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are not a substitute for vaccine. They're an  
adjunct, a supplement, in terms of the protection they can 
provide,'' Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccination is always preferred, he said. But some people cannot  
take a vaccine because of certain medical conditions or allergies, 
many people do not get vaccinated, and vaccination does not prevent 
all cases of flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffman  
LaRoche Ltd., and the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu (generically called oseltamivir) and the inhaled drug,  
Relenza (zanamivir), are in a new class of medicines that cripple 
the chemical process used by flu viruses to spread from cell to 
cell. Unlike older drugs, they work against both A and B viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two older flu medicines, Symmetrel (amantadine) and  
Flumadine (rimantadine), use a different mechanism. Though they are 
both available as pills, they only work against flu virus A, which 
accounts for about two-thirds of the estimated 20 million U.S. flu 
cases yearly, usually the most severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ben Z. Katz, an infectious-disease specialist at Children's  
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the new medicines also have the 
advantage of affecting flu virus later in its life cycle, so are 
less likely to cause genetic mutations that lead to drug 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Katz noted the study was done only on healthy adults  
infected in a laboratory, and said the results might be different 
in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said that subsequent real-world studies have since shown  
Tamiflu effective with few side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drug is to be considered for approval later this  
month by the FDA. The FDA does not comment on its schedule for 
considering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	No price has been set for Tamiflu, according to Hoffman-LaRoche.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New iMac Hardware </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- In another move to best its  
competitors, Apple Computer Inc. unveiled an even more 
sophisticated version of its highly successful iMac line. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Tuesday also debuted a new operating system  
designed to make it easier for users to search the Internet, 
download files and maintain security. 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than a year after reversing its fortunes with the  
brightly colored iMac computer, interim chief executive Steve Jobs 
showed off a redesigned line aimed at attracting new and repeat 
customers ahead of the important holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new iMac is slightly smaller than its best-selling  
predecessor, allows a user to insert a compact disc into a slot 
instead of the typical sliding opening that exposes the optics to 
dust, contains built-in high fidelity speakers and removes the 
cooling fan in favor of a convection air process. 
</P>
<P>
	The updated version also adds a second port for connecting  
devices such as printers and digital cameras and updated digital 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I am more in love with this product than the original  
Macintosh we shipped two decades ago,'' Jobs said during a 
presentation at a college near the company's Cupertino 
headquarters. ``The day after we shipped the original iMac, we 
started working on this product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The machine, which begins shipping immediately, runs at 350  
megahertz and retails for $999. Extending the iMac family line, 
Apple also is selling the iMac DV, a 400MHz, $1,299 model that lets 
users play and edit DVD movies; and a special-edition machine for 
$1,499 that comes in a clear grey color and is more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer buyers who enroll for three years on CompuServe's  
Internet service also receive an additional $400 off any Apple 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple is hoping the added features prove more attractive than  
sub-$1,000 offerings from such competitors as Compaq and 
Hewlett-Packard Co., said Mitch Mandrich, the company's vice 
president of worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pushed the envelope here to satisfy our customers in  
giving them the maximum value at a low price,'' Mandrich said. 
``One can always find something cheaper, but you get what you pay 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Daniel Kunstler at J.P. Morgan called the new iMac line  
``a dazzler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's an industry and a company where you unveil a new  
product and the first question is `What are you going to do for an 
encore?''' Kunstler said. ``They've shown, 'we know how to do 
encores and can do encore after encore' and that the hyperbole 
really isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kunstler said the real question is whether Apple will be  
able to meet demand for the various iMac configurations. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's Mandrich said the company expects to ship ``tens of  
thousands'' of new iMac in all colors each week and should be able 
to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Availability of its new product offerings has been a key issue  
in recent weeks. The company's stock tumbled 12 percent on Sept. 21 
after it warned a lack of Motorola Inc. processors for its Power 
Macintoshes would reduce fourth-quarter earnings. Jobs also said a 
shortage of new notebook computers is easing after the earthquake 
in Taiwan slowed operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the software side, Apple also unveiled a new operating  
system, which runs a computer's basic functions. The operating 
system incorporates Apple's Sherlock 2 search engine and gathers 
information from all other search engines on the Internet and 
auction sites. The operating system also include biometric 
technology that allows a user to encrypt files and folders and open 
them with voice passwords instead of traditionally typed passwords. 
The system upgrade retails for $99 and is expected to be available 
next month.

lure of isolationism, saying the U.S. post-Cold War focus should be 
on eliminating ``tyranny, instability and poverty'' across the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: With a House vote set on launching an open-ended  
impeachment inquiry, Democrats rushed to counter Republican plans 
while still underscoring their disapproval of President Clinton's

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Talks To Resume Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical Corp. and the  
United Steelworkers will resume negotiations next week in hopes of 
ending a yearlong labor dispute affecting 2,900 union members in 
three states. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides said Monday their top negotiators will meet Oct. 14-15  
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaiser dispute affects about 2,100 Steelworkers at two  
plants in the Spokane, Wash., area, along with smaller numbers of 
workers in Tacoma, Wash., Gramercy, La., and Newark, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelworkers struck Sept. 30, 1998, over wages, proposed  
workforce reductions, reduced retirement benefits and contracting 
work to outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
	All five plants have continued to operate with temporary  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The last round of talks ended Aug. 26 over the company's demand  
that 239 jobs be removed from Steelworkers jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser, the nation's fifth largest aluminum producer, is seeking  
to contract out the jobs of carpenters, machinists, janitors, truck 
drivers, security guards and other employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest offer, Kaiser proposed pay increases of $3.13 per  
hour over the length of a five-year contract, plus some benefits 
improvements. The company said base wages for its workers are more 
than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser is also demanding that 700 jobs be eliminated at the five  
plants -- a move it says can be accomplished mostly by attrition.

<HEADLINE> New Bulls Try To Learn New Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- When the Chicago Bulls signed Hersey  
Hawkins, they figured the veteran would be the perfect player to 
help tutor the team's seven rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's fine. Now if only someone would explain to Hawkins what  
the Bulls are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know any of this stuff, either,'' he said, laughing,  
after the Bulls opened training camp Tuesday. ``That's the unique 
thing about it. Being a veteran, I'm still learning the system and 
all the plays just like the younger guys are. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time in my 12 years that I've gone into  
training camp and have really had to learn things that are totally 
new and totally foreign to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to life with the Bulls.  
</P>
<P>
	Chicago is almost an entirely different team from the group that  
won the NBA title in 1998, which means coach Tim Floyd has a lot of 
explaining to do during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense, the defense -- it's new to just about everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to gain a lot of ground in a short period of time,  
given the complexities of the offense,'' Floyd said. ``But we do 
have a full camp to do that, and we'll take it stage by stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Michael Jordan, Phil Jackson and Tex Winter are gone,  
Floyd still plans to use the triangle offense that was a hallmark 
of Chicago's six championship teams. It can be very successful -- 
know any other teams that won six titles in eight years recently? -- 
but everyone has to understand it and be able to run it smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the tricky part. Ask anyone who's ever run the triangle  
how tough it was to learn, and he'll probably just shake his head. 
It takes weeks, sometimes months, to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the type of offense you learn overnight,'' said  
Will Perdue, a member of Chicago's first three championship teams 
who rejoined the Bulls after spending his last four seasons in San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Perdue and B.J. Armstrong, who also played on the first three  
title teams, know the triangle, as does Toni Kukoc. Randy Brown and 
Dickey Simpkins learned it under Jackson, too, though they didn't 
get much playing time until last year. Kornel David, Cory Carr and 
Corey Benjamin also got some exposure to the triangle last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to show it to the new guys.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't feel like our offense will be comfortable with our  
guys until probably the second or third month,'' Floyd said. 
``That's just because, once again, we have seven or eight new 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a year off, defense will be a priority again this season.  
Chicago's championship teams were so tenacious on defense they were 
stifling. Jackson used to call his players the ``Dobermans.'' 
Jordan made a record nine appearances on the NBA's All-Defensive 
team, and he and teammate Scottie Pippen led that list of honorees 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a lockout-shortened training camp and an almost  
entirely new team, something had to give with the Bulls last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really ridiculous to try to teach eight new guys the  
triangle. We knew it going in,'' Floyd said. ``We knew that if we 
spent time in that area, that we wouldn't have enough time to be 
spent on the defensive end with the restricted number of practices 
we had. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was all about carryover. It was all about trying to  
establish some type of foundation about how we were going to play 
in hopes those guys would garner some experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Floyd, a defensive coach at heart, endured a team that could  
barely get back to the other end of the court. Forced turnovers? 
Baskets off defense? What were those? 
</P>
<P>
	But that won't happen this year if Floyd has his way. The Bulls  
are going to play defense and they're going to play it hard. And 
just so everyone was clear on just how important it is, Floyd made 
defense, not offense, the focus of the first practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``A year ago, without being able to emphasize the defense like  
we wanted to, I don't know that you could ever get that 
established, or get any base to your team in terms of a belief 
system,'' Floyd said. ``This year, we have an opportunity to create 
some type of atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now all he needs to do is explain it to the new guys.

<HEADLINE> Slain Woman's Family Seeks Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The family of a woman who was slain in Italy  
while trying to get her daughter away from her ex-boyfriend 
traveled to Rome seeking to return the child to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Dykstra was killed in July 1998, allegedly by the  
ex-boyfriend. After months of legal wrangling, her family will 
attend a hearing Thursday to determine whether her parents can take 
custody of her 4-year-old daughter, Santina. 
</P>
<P>
	Family attorney Gloria Allred is urging Italian authorities to  
allow Santina, who is living in a child care facility, to return to 
California with her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlo Alberto Ventre, Santina's father, fled to Italy with the  
girl in January 1998, in violation of a U.S. court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dykstra won sole custody of Santina in both countries. She  
was killed while traveling to Italy to reclaim the girl. Italian 
authorities said Ventre knocked the 29-year-old woman against a 
fireplace at his house north of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventre surrendered to police in connection with the killing but  
has been out of jail since July 31. He claimed Ms. Dykstra had 
threatened him with an ax. He has continued to fight for custody of 
Santina. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dykstra left behind two other daughters, ages 5 and 8, who  
live in the United States with her twin sister, Terri.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Texas Rangers didn't do anything in the  
playoffs against last year's New York Yankees, who could 
legitimately claim to be the best team ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Texas gets a shot against a Yankees team that was simply the  
best in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the main thing is they're human this year,'' said  
Rangers manager Johnny Oates, whose team opens its division series 
against the Yankees tonight. ``Last year, that was not only a team 
of the decade, it was the team of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That team won an AL-record 114 games in the regular season,  
swept Texas in the first round of the playoffs, beat Cleveland in 
the AL championship series and swept San Diego in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time they were even threatened came against the  
Indians, when New York fell behind 2-1 before winning the final 
three games. Orlando Hernandez, this year's Game 1 starter, won the 
pivotal fourth game in that series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yankees had a sense of invincibility last year,'' Todd  
Zeile said. ``They were the best team in the history of the game. 
They are still a good club, but we are confident playing against 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers lacked confidence last year against New York. More  
importantly, they lacked offense. 
</P>
<P>
	They brought one of the best offenses in the game to the  
playoffs, but scored just one run and hit .141 in the three-game 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, New York has won six straight playoff games against  
Texas since losing the opener of their series in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they will be ready for us,'' New York's David Cone  
said. ``Their whole goal this season has been to beat us. Now they 
get the chance. And we are ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won 27 of 35 meetings between the two teams before  
dropping three of the last five this year. To advance beyond the 
first round for the first time in club history, the Rangers need to 
win three of the next five as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for us not to get caught up in the past few  
series or the last three or four years,'' Oates said. ``We're 
trying to talk about our guys focusing on the opportunity as 
opposed to the obstacle. Sometimes you start looking at the 
obstacle and it becomes too big to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest obstacle for the Rangers will be the Yankees'  
starting pitching, which held Texas down last year. Manager Joe 
Torre will send out Hernandez (17-9, 4.12 ERA) in Game 1, followed 
by Andy Pettitte, Roger Clemens and, if necessary, Cone. 
</P>
<P>
	That quartet has 13 postseason wins -- 13 more than Texas  
starters Aaron Sele (18-9, 4.79), Rick Helling and Esteban Loaiza. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've all pitched big games, we all have experience,'' Cone  
said. ``We feel good about our overall depth of pitching. That has 
been the hallmark of our teams, and it has to be again if we want 
to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shutting down the Texas offense won't be as easy this season.  
The addition of Rafael Palmeiro (.324, 47 HR, 148 RBIs) has added 
balance and depth to the lineup, which was second in the AL in runs 
scored this year. 
</P>
<P>
	They had four players with at least 100 RBIs, six with at least  
20 homers, and led the league with a .293 average. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really made that ballclub a lot more potent,'' Torre  
said. ``I didn't think they needed that, but they certainly have 
added to their offensive output with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is not nearly enough to scare the Yankees. They have been  
waiting for the playoffs to start ever since they arrived at spring 
training. Now that it is nearly here, they're ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the world champs,'' Torre said. ``That's the way people  
look at us. That doesn't mean we assume we are going to win. We 
know we have a fight on our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees OF Shane Spencer, who hit two homers in six at-bats  
in last year's series against Texas, did not make the roster. INF 
Clay Bellinger took his place. ... Yankees fifth starter Hideki 
Irabu will pitch out of the bullpen, while RHP Jason Grimsley did 
not make the team. ... Texas LHP Jeff Fassero is taking the place 
of Mike Munoz, who was sidelined after dropping a computer monitor 
on his foot.

<HEADLINE> Astros 6, Braves 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Daryle Ward, who started the season in Triple-A,  
is making a big impact in October for the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's leadoff homer against Greg Maddux in the sixth inning  
sent the Astros on their way to a 6-1 victory Tuesday over the 
Atlanta Braves in Game 1 of the NL division series. 
</P>
<P>
	The win provided hope that Houston will end its history of  
playoff failures, and was a troubling start for a team with its own 
postseason struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros sealed the victory in the ninth with four runs  
against reliever Mike Remlinger. Carl Everett had a sacrifice fly 
before Ken Caminiti haunted the Braves again with a three-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing for San Diego, Caminiti hit a 10th-inning homer against  
Kerry Ligtenberg to win the first game of the 1998 NL championship 
series. The Padres went on to a 4-2 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The East champion Braves, making their eighth straight  
postseason appearance, lost only their second division series game 
since the format was instituted in 1995. Before Tuesday, they were 
12-1 overall, including 10 straight victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, which clinched its third straight Central title on the  
final day of the season, has never won in five playoff series, 
including a 3-0 sweep by the Braves in 1997. The Astros won't get 
swept this year, seizing the home-field advantage in the best-of-5 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the home field was not much of an advantage to the  
Braves, who led the majors with 103 wins but drew the smallest 
crowd in Atlanta's 44-game postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	The turnout of 39,119 was nearly 11,000 short of capacity at  
Turner Field and easily eclipsed the previous low of 42,117 for 
Game 1 of the 1998 NL championship series. In the right-field upper 
deck, only a few dozen people occupied seven sections of blue 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, the son of former major leaguer Gary Ward, was recalled  
from the minors for the second time on July 20. He took over for 
the slumping Derek Bell and doubled in the first three runs Sunday 
of a 9-4 victory over Los Angeles, securing the division title. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he came through again, hitting the first pitch of  
the sixth into the right-field seats against Maddux to break a 1-1 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves managed only seven hits against starter Shane  
Reynolds, who went six innings, and three relievers. Houston 
pitched around MVP candidate Chipper Jones, walking him twice on 
four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros went ahead in the second. Everett led off with a bunt  
single, Caminiti walked and Tony Eusebio drove in the run with a 
line drive up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maddux escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam by pitching out  
on an attempted squeeze bunt by Shane Reynolds. Caminiti, breaking 
from third, was tagged by Chipper Jones just short of home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros loaded the bases again with one out in the fifth, but  
Caminiti grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves tied it in their half of the inning, Gerald Williams  
driving home Jose Hernandez with a two-out single to center. The 
Braves then loaded the bases, but Ryan Klesko struck out swinging 
on a 90 mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	On the very next pitch, Ward homered into the first row of the  
right-field seats to open the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros didn't leave for Atlanta until late Monday night,  
waiting at the Houston airport for the outcome of a wild-card 
playoff in Cincinnati. When the New York Mets beat the Reds 5-0, 
the chartered jet flew east. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston was a clear underdog against the powerful Braves, having  
lost six of seven meeting during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta clinched its division with a week to go, winning 11 of  
its last 13 games. After a 12-game winning streak in September, 
Houston lost nine of its last 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux was 19-9 during the regular season and had the same  
record lifetime against the Astros with a 2.30 ERA. But he also 
surrendered a career-high 258 hits, a trend that continued in the 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux slipped to 9-9 lifetime in postseason play. He had been  
4-0 in the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston had 10 hits in seven innings against Maddux, but  
stranded eight runners. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Braves are the first NL team to claim 10 division  
titles. Oakland has captured 10 division flags in the AL. ... Ernie 
Johnson, who retired after nearly four decades as a Braves 
broadcaster, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. ... The pitchers 
for Game 2: Atlanta's Kevin Millwood (18-7) against Houston's Jose 
Lima (21-10). ... In the last three division series, Braves 
pitchers had a 1.30 ERA ... The Braves scored a franchise-record 
840 runs, eclipsing the mark of 826 set the previous season. ... 
Houston's Larry Dierker is only the fourth manager in baseball 
history to lead his team to first-place finishes in each of his 
first three seasons. The others: Detroit's Hughie Jennings 
(1907-09), Ralph Houk of the New York Yankees (1961-63) and Jim 
Frey with Kansas City (1980, second half of '81) and Cubs.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Escapes Punitive Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- New York Knicks guard Latrell Sprewell  
was ordered Tuesday to pay about $105,000 to a man and woman 
injured in a highway wreck that he admittedly caused. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sprewell was not ordered by a Contra Costa County Superior  
Court jury to pay the pair punitive damages, which could have been 
costly to the former Golden State Warrior. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma Feliciano, 54, were reportedly  
seeking total damages of $3.5 million, according to Sprewell's 
attorney, Richard Valerian. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members of the 12-member jury said Sprewell did not act  
with malice in the March 1, 1998, accident. Sprewell was not in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas was awarded about $75,000 for economic and non-economic  
damages. Feliciano was awarded $30,000 mostly in economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased there were no punitive damages,'' Valerian  
said. ``The plaintiffs didn't deserve to be enriched any more than 
the economic damages in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Greenseid, an attorney for the plaintiffs, referred to  
Sprewell's infamous choking attack on Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo 
in admonishing the jury. Sprewell was suspended for 68 games by the 
NBA over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely disappointed that they let Mr. Sprewell walk  
once again from outrageous conduct,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas and Feliciano were treated for minor injuries after last  
year's wreck. But they testified the accident caused nightmares, 
depression and problems with relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell admitted in court that he caused the accident when he  
tried to drive his Mercedes-Benz back on the freeway from an 
exit-only lane near Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to  
90 days in jail, which he served under electronic detention at his 
Milwaukee home. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Monday, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys  
said Sprewell has no remorse, and should pay the two $450,000 in 
actual damages plus two months of his $9 million salary in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerian argued the plaintiffs' lawyers wanted to make the  
minimal injuries appear to be major and concealed the total amount 
they want: $3.5 million. Valerian suggested giving the pair 
$30,000.

<HEADLINE> Flight Takes Off With Wanted Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A man wanted for questioning by federal authorities  
looking into the alleged abuse of a 12-year-old Haitian girl got 
away after an American Airlines flight ignored an FBI request to 
remain on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline officials on Monday apologized for the incident, which  
they called ``an honest mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We in no way meant to defy that request,'' airline spokesman  
John Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight left Friday for Port-au-Prince.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities wanted to question passenger Willy Pompee  
Sr., 43, who allegedly helped bring the girl, then 9, to the United 
States in 1996 to be a family servant. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes before Pompee Sr. was scheduled to depart from Miami  
International Airport, Miami-Dade police called the U.S. Customs 
Service at the airport asking that he be detained, The Miami Herald 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives had seen Pompee's name on a passenger list and  
mistook him for his son, Willy Pompee Jr., 20, who is accused of 
sexually abusing the girl and is named in a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Pompee was removed from the plane, but was booked on  
another flight after detectives realized he wasn't the son. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven minutes before the second flight was to depart, the FBI  
called Customs to stop him again. This time, it was not a case of 
mistaken identity; federal officials wanted to interview the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, which had pulled away from the gate, proceeded to  
take off despite orders from Customs investigators to return to the 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotard said a dispatcher thought the second order to stop the  
flight was a mistake, and cleared the plane to takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sheehan, a Customs spokesman, said the agency is  
investigating whether fines should be issued to American Airlines 
for defying the law enforcement request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel they were appropriately notified,'' said Sheehan. ``We  
have to give them permission to depart, and we had rescinded that 
permission.''

<HEADLINE> New Nixon Tapes Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Never suspecting that his secret taping system  
would eventually led to his resignation, President Nixon was 
cheerful and inquisitive the first morning the recording system was 
up and running in the Oval Office, a newly released tape shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does it work in here?'' Nixon asks his aide, Alexander  
Butterfield about 8 a.m. on Feb. 16, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work very well, judging from the poor quality of the  
recording, which was among 445 hours of tape recordings released 
today by the National Archives. Buzzing and humming noises from the 
recording machine drown out many words, but snippets of the 
conversation -- the first of 3,700 hours that Nixon would secretly 
record -- can be deciphered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this is to have the whole thing in the file for  
a potential leak,'' Nixon says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' replies Butterfield, who then goes on to school  
Nixon on the technical aspects of the voice-activated system and 
answer his queries about who was aware of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only five people that know about it outside of (Bob)  
Haldeman (Nixon's chief of staff) and you and me,'' says 
Butterfield, who two years later would disclose to the Senate 
Watergate Committee the existence of the taping system. The tapes 
provided the evidence that ended Nixon's presidency and landed a 
few of his associates in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Nixon resigned in 1974, only 420 hours have been released  
of the estimated 3,700 hours of his presidential recordings. Most 
of those that have been made public deal with the break-in at the 
Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate 
riverfront office building and the subsequent White House cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	After Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment, the government seized  
his tapes. The former president, and later his estate, went to 
court to get them back. Years of legal wrangling and archival 
processing work stalled the release of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's release, covering events between February and August  
1971, is the first in a series of chronological tape openings 
planned at the archives' complex in College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	On the tapes that were released today, Nixon talks with White  
House staff members, his foreign policy advisers, congressmen, 
Cabinet secretaries and reporters. He discusses a vast array of 
foreign and domestic issues, including Vietnam, China, the Soviet 
Union, the environment, busing, unemployment and anti-war 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an amazingly rich resource. Scholars are going to be  
chewing on this stuff for 50 years,'' said John Taylor, executive 
director of the Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace Foundation in Yorba 
Linda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the tapes were released with transcripts that the  
archives supplied over the years in response to court cases. Some 
excerpts from transcripts: 
</P>
<P>
	--On April 19, 1971, Nixon makes disparaging comments about  
federal workers. ``We have no discipline in this bureaucracy. We 
never fire anybody. We never reprimand anybody. We never demote 
anybody. We always promote the sons-of-bitches that kick us in the 
ass,'' Nixon tells John Ehrlichman, counsel to the president. 
``That's true in the State Department. It's true in HEW. It's true 
in OMB, and true for ourselves, and it's got to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On April 27, 1971, Nixon tells secretary Rose Mary Woods that  
the administration must stand firm in the face of protesters 
opposing U.S. Involvement in the Vietnam War. ``They're all a funny 
bunch, but, uh, well, I tell ya, we're going to stand firm against 
'em; I got (national security adviser) Henry (Kissinger) in here. I 
said, `Now look, just, they're not going to rattle us one bit. 
We're gonna stay on our course. This country's not gonna be run by 
a bunch of goddamned rabble. Don't you agree?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On May 7, 1971, Nixon underscores his belief that the anti-war  
demonstrations represent only a tiny slice of American public 
opinion. ``I thought, uh, that guy standin' up there naked in front 
of everybody, that must've just turned off the heartland by the 
millions.''

<HEADLINE> Braves, Astros Ready for Series  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves relaxed in front on their  
television sets, wondering who they would play today. The Houston 
Astros sat on a runway, wondering if their plane would fly east or 
west? 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 o'clock Monday night, both teams finally got the  
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Central champion Astros, their travel plans in shambles  
because of a wild-card playoff game in Cincinnati, didn't learn 
they would play the Braves in the best-of-5 division series until 
the Reds lost 5-0 to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	That sent the New Yorkers to Arizona, while the Astros turned  
their charter jet eastward and headed toward Atlanta to meet the 
team that has eight straight division titles and baseball's best 
record at 103-59. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I wouldn't want to play a game after flying to Arizona  
or coming here,'' Braves MVP candidate Chipper Jones said. ``That 
takes a toll on your body. It usually takes a day or two to 
regroup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the Braves got to a plane was Javy Lopez's  
remote-control version. 
</P>
<P>
	When rain wiped out a scheduled workout at Turner Field, the  
injured Atlanta catcher broke out his model aircraft, the stadium's 
vast expanse giving him plenty of room for a series of twisting, 
spinning maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux (19-9), who will start the opener for Atlanta  
against Shane Reynolds (16-14), spent the night watching videos 
from his recent performances against both Houston and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cincinnati had won the playoff, Atlanta would have met the  
Reds and Houston would have played Arizona in the other division 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would prefer to know,'' Maddux said earlier Monday. ``But I  
would prefer there be no traffic when I come to the park, too. It's 
really not that big a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not after what the Braves went through this year. They lost  
cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg before 
opening day, while Lopez and pitchers Odalis Perez and Rudy Seanez 
went down during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a grittier, guttier team,'' Jones said. ``We're not  
going to pop anybody's eyes out. We don't have the firepower of 
some of our other teams. But we do the little things to score 
runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every year about this time, the Braves face questions about  
their lack of postseason success. Despite eight straight 
appearances -- three more than any team in baseball history -- they 
have won just one World Series title in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the dark cloud that always hangs over the Braves,''  
said Brian Jordan, who brought emotion to the clubhouse, not to 
mention a career-high 115 RBIs. ``Hopefully, this is the year we 
get the breaks and finally win another world championship. If not, 
we've still exceeded our expectations this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston clinched its third straight NL Central title on the  
final day of the regular season, finishing one game ahead of 
Cincinnati. The Astros have been quickly eliminated in their last 
two playoff trips, a sweep by Atlanta in 1997 and a 3-1 loss to San 
Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year it was new and maybe a little overwhelming.  
Last year we weren't able to do a lot,'' manager Larry Dierker 
said. ``This year, all we're ready to do is go out and play the 
best baseball we can. If it's 3-0 again, well, we're going to give 
it our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros didn't seem concerned about their late-night travel  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This won't bother them,'' general manager Gerry Hunsicker  
said. ``I don't think anything can happen to this club that hasn't 
already happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Braves, Houston survived a devastating medical report.  
Moises Alou missed the entire season, while Derek Bell and Ken 
Caminiti were plagued by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the underdogs and maybe that's good,'' Reynolds said.  
``Everyone expects them to win, so let them have all the 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros went 1-6 against the Braves during the regular  
season, including a three-game sweep at the Turner Field, site of 
Games 1 and 2. The series shifts to Astrodome on Friday for Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of Houston's 20-game winners, Jose Lima (21-10), faces  
Kevin Millwood (18-7, 2.68 ERA) in Wednesday's game. Cy Young 
contender Mike Hampton (22-4) follows for the Astros against last 
year's Cy Young winner, Tom Glavine (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the credit for the Braves' success must go to manager  
Bobby Cox, who businesslike demeanor was criticized in the past, 
but served the team well when one player after another went down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby didn't panic,'' Millwood said. ``We just went about our  
business the way we always have.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. St. Players Return to Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State wide receiver Peter  
Warrick returned to practice Tuesday while authorities tried to 
wrap up their investigation into a $244 retail theft at a local 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some loose ends they (police) are out tying up,''  
Leon County State Attorney Willie Meggs said Tuesday. ``We have met 
with the police (and) they'll get back to us when they're done and 
some decision will be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Hunt, spokesman for the Tallahassee Police Department,  
said Monday that Warrick and receiver Laveranues Coles ``are going 
to be witnesses or suspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meggs said no decision was likely until at least Thursday. The  
top-ranked Seminoles play Miami on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Warrick is the team's leading receiver with 36  
catches for 508 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like distractions,'' coach Bobby Bowden said Monday  
night. However, he wouldn't speculate on what action, if any, he 
might take against the players. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the players sounded confident Tuesday they would be  
cleared of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be all right,'' said Warrick, who conceded he is  
learning about the pressures of being one of the nation's most 
recognized college players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's watching,'' he said Tuesday. ``When I'm doing good  
they talk about me. When I'm doing bad they talk about me. I'm just 
trying to walk a straight line and do what's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Warrick practiced Tuesday night, Coles did not.  
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Coles said he and his roommate answered all  
police questions into their theft investigation of a tan hat and 
four shirts with a total estimated value of $244. The merchandise 
was apparently sold Sept. 29 to the players for far less money by a 
clerk being investigated by police and store security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we grabbed clothes and ran out,'' Coles said.  
``It's not like that at all. They wanted to question us about some 
things. We went and answered some questions and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles and Warrick were each arrested in 1998 in separate  
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was charged with simple battery, a misdemeanor, in a  
domestic incident when he allegedly struck his stepmother outside 
her home. He was suspended for last year's opener against Texas A&AMP;M 
and later served 150 hours of community service. He also was 
suspended for this year's opener for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting  
arrest, both misdemeanors, for an altercation in the parking lot of 
a Tampa fast-food restaurant. The charges were eventually dropped.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New iMac Hardware </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. on Tuesday unveiled  
an even more sophisticated version of its highly successful iMAC 
line, introducing machines with features never before seen on a 
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced a new operating system designed to  
make it easier for users to search the Internet, download files and 
maintain security. 
</P>
<P>
	A little more than a year after reversing its fortunes with the  
brightly colored iMac computer, interim chief executive Steve Jobs 
showed off a redesigned line aimed at attracting new and repeat 
customers ahead of the important holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new iMac is slightly smaller than its best-selling  
predecessor, allows a user to insert a compact disc into a slot 
instead of the typical sliding opening that exposes the optics to 
dust, contains built-in high fidelity speakers and removes the 
cooling fan in favor of a convection air process. 
</P>
<P>
	The updated version also adds a second port for connecting  
devices such as printers and digital cameras and updated digital 
graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I am more in love with this product than the original  
Macintosh we shipped two decades ago,'' Jobs said during a 
presentation at a college near the company's Cupertino 
headquarters. ``The day after we shipped the original iMac, we 
started working on this product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The machine, which begins shipping immediately, runs at 350  
megahertz and retails for $999. Extending the iMac family line, 
Apple also is selling the iMac DV, a 400MHz, $1,299 model that lets 
users play and edit DVD movies; and a special-edition machine for 
$1,499 that comes in a clear grey color and is more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer buyers who enroll for three years on CompuServe's  
Internet service also receive an additional $400 off any Apple 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple is hoping the added features prove more attractive than  
sub-$1,000 offerings from such competitors as Compaq and 
Hewlett-Packard Co., said Mitch Mandrich, the company's vice 
president of worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've pushed the envelope here to satisfy our customers in  
giving them the maximum value at a low price,'' Mandrich said. 
``One can always find something cheaper, but you get what you pay 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Daniel Kunstler at J.P. Morgan called the new iMac line  
``a dazzler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's an industry and a company where you unveil a new  
product and the first question is `What are you going to do for an 
encore?''' Kunstler said. ``They've shown, 'we know how to do 
encores and can do encore after encore' and that the hyperbole 
really isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kunstler said the real question is whether Apple will be  
able to meet demand for the various iMac configurations. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's Mandrich said the company expects to ship ``tens of  
thousands'' of new iMac in all colors each week and should be able 
to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Availability of its new product offerings has been a key issue  
in recent weeks. The company's stock tumbled 12 percent on Sept. 21 
after it warned a lack of Motorola Inc. processors for its Power 
Macintoshes would reduce fourth-quarter earnings. Jobs also said a 
shortage of new notebook computers is easing after the earthquake 
in Taiwan slowed operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the software side, Apple also unveiled a new operating  
system, which runs a computer's basic functions. The operating 
system incorporates Apple's Sherlock 2 search engine and gathers 
information from all other search engines on the Internet and 
auction sites. The operating system also include biometric 
technology that allows a user to encrypt files and folders and open 
them with voice passwords instead of traditionally typed passwords. 
The system upgrade retails for $99 and is expected to be available 
next month.

<HEADLINE> Brisk Harvest Pace Sends Grain Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled in  
trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures were pressured by indications the U.S.  
harvest is proceeding at a brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department reports the corn harvest is 29  
percent complete, compared to a five-year average of 19 percent at 
this time of year. National Weather Service forecast indicates 
conditions will continue to be positive for the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were fractionally higher on technical  
factors. But gains were limited as the USDA estimated the soybean 
crop was 32 percent completed, compared with a 26 percent average. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices also were pressured by an estimate made  
by a private crop firm that placed the U.S. crop at 2.75 billion 
bushels, a record level. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were lower in response to continuing large  
stocks of wheat and a lack of export business. The market also was 
affected by the brisk pace of planting. The winter wheat crop was 
53 percent planted, according to the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Warm, dry weather is forecast for winter wheat growing areas, an  
expected aide to aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 4 1/4 cents lower at $2.64 1/2 a  
bushel; December corn was 3/4 cent lower at $2.03 1/2 a bushel; December 
oats were 2 cents lower at $1.10 a bushel; November soybeans were a 
1/2 cent higher at $4.83 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and pork futures were lower in trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle were .05 cent lower at 69.12 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were .53 cent lower at 81.47 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were 2 cents lower at 48.20 a pound; February 
pork bellies were 2.92 cents lower at 60.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton on Verge of Losing Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- History shows that presidents often expend  
huge amounts of energy on winning Senate ratification of treaties, 
and can sometimes pull off unexpected victories. This appears not 
to be one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
	Even strong advocates of the international ban on nuclear  
testing now before the Senate concede they are seriously short of 
Republican support in advance of next week's planned vote. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, President Clinton is vowing to fight on. But other  
Democrats are suggesting it's only a matter of time until a 
face-saving way can be found to back away from the brink. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which 154  
nations have signed, would be a humiliating defeat for the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	And many Republicans suggest that proceeding with the vote might  
put them in an awkward position, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But presidents never relish losing treaty fights, and often pull  
out all the stops in seeking to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	A good case in point: President Carter's one-vote margin of  
victory in 1978, after a bruising months-long battle, in winning 
Senate ratification of treaties relinquishing U.S. control of the 
Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has yet to line up a single prominent Republican in  
support of the test ban treaty. And he'll need 22 Republican votes, 
assuming he can get all 45 Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also went all-out to win Senate ratification of the  
Chemical Weapons Treaty in April 1997. The Senate's 74-26 vote 
sounded like a wide margin. But it was only seven votes more than 
the two-thirds needed for treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's effort followed a historical pattern in which  
presidents, especially those in second terms, invest a lot of 
political capital to win treaty fights. 
</P>
<P>
	On the chemical weapons measure, all of the Senate's 45  
Democrats were joined by 29 Republicans in supporting ratification. 
Clinton called it a ``strong bipartisan vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that time, Clinton had the support of two key Republicans:  
Lott himself, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	This time both Lott and Warner have come out against the test  
ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott generated the wrath of the conservatives for his support of  
the chemical-weapons treaty. Senate Republicans close to Lott said 
the Mississippi Republican wasn't about to get in the same bind on 
the test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Republican resentment has been rekindled toward treaties  
that they perceive could put the United States at a disadvantage, 
now that the date at which the Panama Canal is to be turned over to 
Panama is fast approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumping a four-foot-high pile of 250,000 petitions near the  
Capitol Building on Tuesday, a conservative group opposed to a Hong 
Kong business' lease on canal ports appealed to Congress to ensure 
the canal stays open to U.S. shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats complain that other milestone arms control treaties  
and agreements provided far more than the two days of floor debate 
that Lott is offering this time. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the point out that the landmark 1972  
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty consumed eight days of committee 
hearings and 18 days of Senate floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called START I Treaty of 1992 ate up 19 days of committee  
hearings and five days of floor debate; and the NATO enlargement 
treaty adopted last year accounted for seven days of committee 
hearings and eight days of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all treaties brought to the floor make it, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Aviation Protocols was the last treaty rejected in  
a floor vote. It failed 50-42 in 1983, according to Senate 
Historian Richard Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	However, defeated treaties don't automatically die. That one was  
returned to the clerk's desk at the front of the Senate -- and 
remains there today. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodrow Wilson saw his second term undermined by his failure to  
win Senate ratification for his League of Nations Treaty and 
one-termer Carter paid a large political cost for his hard-fought 
victory on the Panama Canal Treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan devoted considerable time and energy in his second  
term to nuclear-weapons reduction treaties with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Why did Clinton have so much trouble marshaling support this  
time for a treaty that's been before the Senate for two years? 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the numbers weren't there,'' said Fred  
Greenstein, a political scientist at Princeton University. ``It 
does seem to me he's never been very good at establishing 
priorities, narrowing damage and staying on top of issues over a 
sustained period of time.''

<HEADLINE> Phish Fans Go Wild in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- As far as the chief of police is concerned,  
Phish fans are welcome to stay away from Ames -- forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Dennis Ballantine said Monday the city jail has been  
filled with Phishheads, the devoted followers of the music group, 
since the band's concert at Iowa State University on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they never come back, it will be too soon,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ballantine said the lawlessness and drug use outside the concert  
was so appalling that he will ask the university to ban Phish from 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies, police and campus officers say they arrested  
26 fans, most on drug possession charges.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Scouts Watch Cuban Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Danys Baez abandoned Cuba's national  
baseball team in August with dreams of playing in the major 
leagues. Scouts who watched him work out Tuesday said his 98 mph 
fastball might get him there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely big league material,'' Los Angeles Dodgers  
scout Mike Brito said. ``The velocity is extraordinary. Without 
doubt he has a good future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed he has the tools to win,'' New York Yankees scout  
Carlos Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen scouts showed up at San Jose's dilapidated Antonio  
Escarre Stadium, some aiming radar guns as the 6-foot-4 Baez showed 
his stuff for about an hour. The exhibition was organized by agent 
Joe Cubas, who has helped other Cuban baseball players flee their 
communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same place Cubas brought scouts early last year to  
display defector Orlando Hernandez, an established star in the 
Cuban league who signed a $6.6 million, four-year contract with the 
Yankees that has since turned out to be a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez defected during the Pan American Games in Winnipeg,  
Manitoba. At the time his age was listed as 19, but Cubas said 
Tuesday that he's 22 -- still at the start of his career and much 
younger than some earlier defectors such as Hernandez or Rolando 
Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the perfect combination,'' insisted Cubas. ``In his  
favor he has youth, the experience with the Cuban team and a 
formidable fastball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas has obtained at least temporary residence for Baez in  
Costa Rica rather than the United States or Canada. That exempts 
Baez from the major league draft and makes him a free agent who can 
sell his services to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every person wants to fulfill some great dream and I want to  
be a pitcher in the big leagues,'' Baez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez is expected to play winter ball in the Dominican Republic.

<HEADLINE> Text of Federal Reserve Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The statement Tuesday by the Federal Open Market Committee,  
composed of Fed board members in Washington and Fed regional bank 
presidents: 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to leave its  
target for the federal funds rate unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengthening productivity growth has been fostering favorable  
trends in unit costs and prices, and much recent information 
suggests that these trends have been sustained. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the growth of demand has continued to outpace that  
of supply, as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers 
willing to take jobs. In these circumstances, the Federal Open 
Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months 
ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in 
excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to 
inflation pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this background, the committee adopted a directive that  
was biased toward a possible firming of policy going forward. 
Committee members emphasized that such a directive did not signify 
a commitment to near-term action. The committee will need to 
evaluate additional information on the balance of aggregate supply 
and demand and conditions in financial markets.

	Clinton Warned on Test Ban Treaty  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top Democrat on foreign affairs  
issues said he told President Clinton today the votes aren't there 
to ratify an international ban on nuclear testing. Sen. Joseph 
Biden, D-Del., said that, while all 45 Senate Democrats are 
prepared to support the treaty next Tuesday when a vote is 
scheduled, Republican support appears to be disappearing. The White 
House indicated that Clinton would continue to fight for the Senate 
to ratify the treaty.

	LONDON (AP) -- Two London commuter trains smashed into each other  
during rush hour today, killing 26 passengers and injuring 160 on 
the same rail line as another fatal crash two years ago. Ambulance 
and fire crews, police and rail workers swarmed around the 
overturned, mangled rail cars for hours, locating and freeing 
survivors in the smoldering wreckage near the Ladbroke Grove 
residential area in west London. It was Britain's worst train 
accident in more than a decade.

</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Radioactive water leaked inside a  
South Korean nuclear power plant during repair work, exposing 22 
workers to small amounts of radiation, the government said. It said 
the radioactive water was contained inside the plant and did not 
escape into the environment. About 12 gallons of so-called ``heavy 
water'' was leaked during the accident last night at a nuclear 
plant in Wolsung, 190 miles southeast of the capital Seoul, the 
Science and Technology Ministry said in a statement.

their merger. MCI WorldCom forged the largest corporate takeover in 
history, a $115 billion acquisition of Sprint, the country's 
third-largest long-distance company. But FCC Chairman William E. 
Kennard said MCI WorldCom and Sprint will have to make a strong 
case for approval.

	Bush Chides GOP on Social Issues  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush accused his own party today of being dour, pessimistic and 
focused on expanding the nation's wealth ``to the exclusion of all 
else.'' It was the second time in as many weeks that Bush has taken 
his own party to task. The Texas governor last week criticized 
congressional Republicans' plans to save money by delaying tax 
credit payments to the working poor. Bush also said he would tie 
testing results to federal education money.

	Clinton OKs Military Pay Raises  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is offering pay raises and other  
incentives in hopes of attracting more military recruits and 
keeping troops in uniform longer. President Clinton will sign today 
a $289 billion spending bill that includes a 4.8 percent pay raise 
for the 1.4 million men and women on active duty. The move comes 
after the Pentagon announced that the Air Force ended the 1999 
fiscal year with a manpower shortage of about 10,000.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians stoned a  
Russian-Serb convoy in northern Kosovo today, injuring some Russian 
troops and French police trying to stop the clash. At least one 
Serb was killed, according to Yugoslavia's Beta news agency. 
Seventeen Serbs were injured, two of them critically. A French 
military officer said the trouble started when 5,000 ethnic 
Albanians gathered near the town of Kosovska Mitrovica for the 
funeral of 18 of 28 Albanians found last week in a mass grave. Four 
Serbs have been arrested in the case.

Federal Reserve decided against raising interest rates again but 
left open the possibility of a third rate hike later this year. The 
Dow industrials closed 0.64 lower at 10,400.59. On the NYSE, losers 
led gainers 1,794-1,241. The Nasdaq rose 3.70 to 2,800.16. The Fed 
pointed out that the labor market is still extremely tight, and 
that threatens to push up wages and prices.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NFL great Jim Brown, convicted of smashing  
his wife's car with a shovel, was sentenced today to probation and

<HEADLINE> Men May Say 'Hairwell' to Baldness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hair's some hopeful news for men concerned about  
baldness. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene therapists at the Weill Medical College of Cornell  
University report that they have used injections of a gene in mice 
to force resting hair follicles into a growth phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead researcher, Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, used a virus to  
carry a gene nicknamed Sonic hedgehog, a hereditary factor 
essential for development, into young mice whose hair follicles had 
gone into a normal resting phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals' black fur was bleached blond, and a few days after  
the injections tufts of new black hair sprouted, apparently after 
their follicles were forced back into active phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, reported in the latest issue of The Journal of  
Clinical Investigation, has not yet been tried on humans. If it 
were, and it worked, human hair-seekers presumably would require 
multiple injections over their bald scalps, The New York Times 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that maybe someday we will be using Sonic hedgehog  
as part of a cocktail of growth factors to make hair grow,'' Dr. 
Ervin Epstein, a dermatologist at the University of California at 
San Francisco, commented in the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems remain to be solved, the Times noted. Epstein has found  
that overactivity of the Sonic hedgehog gene is a case of basal 
cell carcinoma, a common but treatable skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier genetic research on baldness, Columbia University  
researchers reported in the journal Science in January 1998 that a 
mutation of a gene nicknamed ``hairless'' caused a very rare 
condition in which people are born without eyelashes or eyebrows, 
quickly lose the hair on top of the head and never grow any body 
hair.

<HEADLINE> A's Give Jaha Two-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- John Jaha, who resuscitated his career  
with the Oakland Athletics this season, signed a two-year, $6 
million contract with the team on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha, 33, was plagued by injuries to his left foot and shoulder  
over two previous seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers before signing 
a minor league contract with the A's in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha impressed A's general manager Billy Beane and manager Art  
Howe, earning a spot on the team's opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit .276 with a career-high 35 home runs, tying the A's  
record for a designated hitter. He also had 111 RBIs and a .414 
on-base percentage in 142 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was an integral part to the tremendous success we had on  
the field this season,'' Beane said Tuesday. ``It was important to 
everyone in the organization to get him back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a collection of raw young talent and a few veterans like  
Jaha and Tony Phillips, the A's finished second to the Texas 
Rangers in the AL West and challenged the Boston Red Sox for the 
wild card. It was the first time the A's were in playoff contention 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaha, an eight-year major league veteran, has hit .269 for his  
career.

<HEADLINE> 7 Big 10 Teams in AP Football Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Big Ten is boss in the Top 25, at least until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	A record seven schools from the 11-team Big Ten appear in this  
week's Associated Press college football poll, the first time a 
conference has placed so many teams in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	The record probably will last all of one week, since three Big  
Ten games on Saturday feature six of its seven Top 25 teams: No. 3 
Michigan (5-0) at No. 11 Michigan State (5-0); No. 17 Purdue (4-1) 
at No. 21 Ohio State (3-2); and No. 20 Wisconsin (3-2) at No. 25 
Minnesota (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (5-0), the highest ranked team in the league at No.  
2, is at Iowa, which along with Illinois, Indiana and Northwestern 
comprise the rest of the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions became the 
league's 11th team in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP media poll began in 1936 as a Top 20 until 1960. It was a  
Top 10 from 1961-67 before it returned to a Top 20 from 1968-88. In 
'89, the poll became the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Several conferences previously have placed six teams in the AP's  
Top 25, including the Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10 and SEC. The SEC was 
the first with six -- in 1985 when it was a 10-team league and the 
poll consisted of 20 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of bigger conferences and the AP poll's  
expansion from a Top 20 to Top 25, has given leagues more chances 
to have more teams ranked. Also, league teams usually open the 
season against weak nonconference opponents before Big Ten play 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SENIOR CLASS:* College football's three grand ol' coaches --  
73-year-old Joe Paterno, 69-year-old Bobby Bowden and 68-year-old 
LaVell Edwards -- aren't going anywhere soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's Bowden re-upped for five more years through 2004  
-- at $1.5 million per -- on Monday, a few weeks after Brigham 
Young's Edwards signed a new deal that will keep him around Provo 
through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno, whose contract is not public, won't commit to his usual  
``four more years'' preseason proclamation, but made it clear he'll 
be strolling the sideline awhile longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I'm going to wait four more years  
anymore. It may be two, three, six, eight, or 10,'' JoePa said 
before the season started. ``My problem is there's nothing else I 
really want to do. I really don't want to wait around until 
cocktail hour at 5 p.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden, who turns 70 next month, has 297 career wins, and can  
get No. 300 on Oct. 23 when his top-ranked Seminoles play Clemson, 
coached by his son, Tommy. Paterno became the fourth major college 
coach to win 300 games last season. Edwards has 246 career wins. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIRATES RETURN:* East Carolina, 5-0 for the first time since  
1976, plays its first home game at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium since 
Hurricane Floyd struck on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16th-ranked Pirates play host to Southern Mississippi in a  
Conference USA game that could be the final hurdle to a perfect 
season for one of the early surprise teams of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Mississippi (2-2), off last week, is coming off tough  
losses to No. 4 Nebraska and No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M, and has proved to be 
a problem for East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Eagles have won all three games against the Pirates  
since C-USA play began in 1996, and holds an 18-6 series lead. The 
Eagles won 41-7 last year in Hattiesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's any game I don't want to lose, it's Southern  
Miss,'' Pirates QB David Garrard said. ``We've had tough times 
against them, and I really want to go out there and play well. 
Everything has to go right for, because they're going to be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Southern Miss, the Pirates play Tulane at home, Houston  
and Alabama-Birmingham on the road and finish at home against 
Cincinnati and North Carolina State.

Streeter (broken collarbone) is out four to six weeks, perhaps

1994. Rutgers and Temple are next on the schedule, but the future 
doesn't look good with games against Virginia Tech, Miami, Boston 
College and Pittsburgh. Says senior LB Barrett Green: ``We can say 
the hell with it, or we can finish this and try to get better on 
the things we need to improve on.'' After WVU's 31-28 loss to Navy 
on Saturday, an airplane flying above Mountaineer Field had this 
message: ``Nehlen must go.'' ... Miami, at No. 1 Florida State on 
Saturday, is 10-5 against the Seminoles at Tallahassee, but the 
'Noles have won the last three, including 47-0 in '97.

	For the first time since 1961, No. 3 Michigan at No. 11 Michigan  
State is a battle of unbeatens. Tickets for the game at East 
Lansing are long sold out, but hit the Internet if you're still 
looking. Earlier this week, tickets went for more than $450 on 
eBay, an Internet auction site. ... After a 42-17 loss to 
Wisconsin, Ohio State coach John Cooper said: ``Guys, it's been a 
long time since we've been physically whipped like that in a 
game.'' It's been 32 years. The loss was the Buckeyes' worst at 
Ohio Stadium since a 41-6 defeat against Purdue on Oct. 14, 1967. 
... Not only is Minnesota -- a 33-14 winner over Northwestern on 
Saturday -- in the Top 25 for the first time since 1985, but the 
Golden Gophers also snagged their first Big Ten road win since Oct. 
22, 1994.

	Since its school-record 20-game winning streak ended late last  
season, UCLA is 2-5. The Bruins are 2-3 this season entering 
Saturday's game against Oregon, the first of five straight home

next week. Other injured Gators include WR Travis Taylor (ankle) 
and center Zac Zedalis (knee). ... Mississippi FB Charles 
Stackhouse had torn cartilage repaired in his left knee but could

(hamstring) is out for the season. ... Tennessee may have beaten 
Auburn 24-0, but five times the Vols reached the Tigers' 23 or 
better without scoring a point. Tee Martin threw interceptions; 
there was a poor center snap and the game ended on the fifth 
chance. ... Florida and LSU, which hook up on Saturday are both 
coming off tough losses -- the Gators lost 40-39 to Alabama in OT on

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in Bank of NY Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal criminal charges were unveiled Tuesday  
in the Bank of New York investigation against three individuals and 
three companies alleging the illegal transmission of $7 billion 
through accounts at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were contained in a three-count indictment filed  
under seal in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Sept. 16. The 
indictment unsealed Tuesday named as defendants Peter Berlin, Lucy 
Edwards and Aleksey Volkov as well as Benex International Co. Inc., 
Becs International L.L.C. and Torfinex Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were the first to result from an investigation by  
federal prosecutors in Manhattan into what has been described as 
potentially one of the largest cases of money-laundering ever 
uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement that ``the  
ongoing investigation is very intense and broad, and it is likely 
to go on for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many questions about the various sources of the monies flowing  
through the accounts at the Bank of New York remain to be 
answered,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Schiliro, an FBI assistant director in charge of the New  
York office, said the FBI is primarily focused on determining the 
origin of the funds and tracing the path of transactions through 
accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``As this investigation has progressed, cooperation from the  
Russian authorities has been forthcoming and has been helpful,'' he 
said. ``Unsealing this indictment will serve to facilitate the 
mutual flow of information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that the defendants conspired from 1996  
to August 1999 to illegally transmit funds and receive deposits 
through the Benex and Becs accounts at the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin was the president of Benex and Becs and was married to  
Edwards, who was a vice president in the Eastern European Division 
at the Bank of New York and was also an officer of Benex and Becs, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were charged because they allegedly engaged in an  
illegal banking operation by receiving deposits without obtaining 
authorization from any federal or state banking agency, according 
to prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Tapes Show Nixon Discrediting Foes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Determined to strike back at leakers, Richard  
Nixon is heard on newly released White House tapes ordering aides 
to conduct break-ins and to circulate damaging stories about his 
political foes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to go after everyone who is a member of this  
conspiracy,'' Nixon said on July 2, 1971, two weeks after The New 
York Times and The Washington Post began publishing the Pentagon 
Papers, a 7,000-page study of American involvement in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House tapes, made public Tuesday by the National  
Archives, show a worried Nixon crafting a strategy to attack 
perceived enemies. Instead, the tapes ultimately revealed Nixon's 
role in the Watergate cover-up and led to his resignation on Aug. 
9, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings cover familiar ground but add details about  
Nixon's anger over the publication of the Pentagon Papers and his 
obsession with curtailing leaks. Nixon's attempt to keep newspaper 
from publishing the Pentagon Papers was thwarted by the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new tidbits:  
</P>
<P>
	--On April 19, 1971, Nixon makes disparaging comments about  
federal workers. ``We have no discipline in this bureaucracy. We 
never fire anybody. We never reprimand anybody. We never demote 
anybody. We always promote the sons of bitches that kick us in the 
ass,'' Nixon tells John Ehrlichman, counsel to the president. 
``That's true in the State Department. It's true in HEW (the old 
Department of Health, Education and Welfare). It's true in OMB (the 
Office of Management and Budget), and true for ourselves, and it's 
got to stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On April 27, 1971, Nixon tells secretary Rose Mary Woods that  
the administration must stand firm in the face of protesters 
opposing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. ``They're all a funny 
bunch, but, uh, well, I tell ya, we're going to stand firm against 
'em; I got (national security adviser) Henry (Kissinger) in here. I 
said, `Now look, just, they're not going to rattle us one bit. 
We're gonna stay on our course. This country's not gonna be run by 
a bunch of goddamned rabble. Don't you agree?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On May 7, 1971, Nixon underscores his belief that the antiwar  
demonstrations represent only a tiny slice of American public 
opinion. ``I thought, uh, that guy standin' up there naked in front 
of everybody, that must've just turned off the heartland by the 
millions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All told, 445 hours of recordings, capturing 3,650 conversations  
of Nixon talking to staff members, his foreign policy advisers, 
congressmen, Cabinet secretaries and reporters, were released, more 
than doubling the hours now available to the public. Many hundreds 
of additional Nixon tapes are still unreleased. 
</P>
<P>
	On many of the tapes, buzzing and humming noises from the  
recorder drown out many words. But Nixon can be heard discussing 
Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union, the environment, busing, 
unemployment and antiwar demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	In one June 14, 1971, segment, Nixon tells aides that he's  
worried that his own staffers, particularly the national security 
staff, could leak information about the war efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the leaking on a conspiracy of intellectuals -- ``they  
will lie, cheat, anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically they have no morals,'' Nixon tells chief of staff  
H.R. Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
	He instructs Haldeman to get journalists to write stories that  
discredit Leslie Gelb, a former member of Nixon's national security 
staff at the Brookings Institution who was thought to have helped 
compile a paper outlining the Nixon administration's involvement in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what I want done. Get the story out on Gelb  
right away. Get a columnist. ... I want that out,'' he ordered. 
</P>
<P>
	Another order: Break into Brookings to get the Vietnam study.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really meant it when I, I want somebody to go in and crack  
that safe,'' said Nixon on July 2. Earlier tape releases have Nixon 
ordering the break-in two days before. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated: ``Walk in and get it.''  
</P>
<P>
	On July 3, Nixon is in the Oval Office with Haldeman discussing  
information gathered by a snoop hired by one of the president's 
longtime political associates, Murray Chotiner, who interviewed 
Democratic congressional leaders with fake media credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chotiner's spy guy -- you know the guy who does the  
interviewing, snooping around -- has come up with some kind of 
interesting stuff,'' Haldeman tells Nixon.

<HEADLINE> Kerry Collins To Start for Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Kent Graham is going to miss the  
New York Giants' game against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday 
because of a concussion, and Kerry Collins will start at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, who started the first four games, was injured in last  
Sunday's 16-15 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw three interceptions against Philadelphia, one returned  
for a touchdown, and his status as the starter was in question. 
Giants coach Jim Fassel said he would evaluate Graham's performance 
and would announce his starter Wednesday. The injury made the 
decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was examined Monday by neurologist Peter Tsairis of the  
Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``All Giants are given neurological evaluations in the preseason  
and this information is used to determine any change in their 
neurological status,'' Dr. Russell Warren, the team's orthopedic 
surgeon said. ``A battery of tests on Kent on Monday showed some 
significant alteration. At this point he is still symptomatic and 
will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. My recommendations to the 
Giants is that Kent not play this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a free agent who signed for nearly $17 million in the  
offseason despite a troubled past, was 6-of-12 for 86 yards and led 
the Giants on the game-winning field goal drive after replacing 
Graham in the third quarter Sunday. However, the drive included a 
fumble by Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry will start. After listening to the doctors, obviously  
the mpost improtant thing is not to put Kent at greater risk,'' 
Fassel said. ``The doctors told me because of the concussion Kent 
suffered Sunday, he will be more susceptible to concussions this 
week. If Kent were to sustain another concussion, we would be 
looking at a longer period of inactivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants offense has struggled since the start of the season,  
although Graham has not been solely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the injury, Graham threw three horrible interceptions on  
plays he forced passes into coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Fassel said it was almost as if Graham (15-of-29 for 171 yards)  
predetermined where he was going to throw the ball and didn't 
bother making any reads on the plays. Two Eagles literally battled 
for the ball on the third pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that last one, he forced it right into the teeth of the  
defense, I said I have to take him out of the ballgame,'' Fassel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since becoming the Giants coach, Fassel has changed quarterbacks  
in each of his first two seasons. Danny Kanell took over for an 
injured Dave Brown (pectoral) in 1997 and led the Giants to the NFC 
East title, posting a 7-2-1 record as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won five of six games at the end of last season after  
Graham replaced Kanell as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question in my mind that I am aware when I made  
the quarterback switch the team has taken off,'' Fassel said. ``... 
You weigh all those factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the fifth overall pick in the 1995 draft, led New York  
on an 11-play, 67-yard march that resulted in Brad Daluiso's 
game-winning 23-yard field goal with 7:43 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The question about Collins is: Is he ready?

<HEADLINE> Default Rates on Student Loans Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The default rate on government student loans has dropped to the  
lowest level since Washington began keeping track more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate dipped to 8.8 percent in fiscal 1997, from 9.6 percent  
the year before, according to figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley credited responsible student  
borrowers, schools, underwriters and lenders, a crackdown on 
debtors, and the robust economy with its plentiful jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate has dropped each year since a peak of 22.4 percent in  
fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Student loans underwritten by the federal government averaged  
$4,103 in fiscal 1997. The loans went to 2.15 million students 
attending more than 7,000 vocational schools, college and 
universities. Of those students, about 189,000 defaulted by falling 
behind in their payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures represent borrowers whose first payment was due in  
fiscal 1997 and who failed to make a payment sometime before Oct. 
1, 1998, the end of fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Default is not the end of the matter. Collection can be obtained  
in various ways, such as taking the debtor's IRS refund or wages. 
Schools often push to get the loans repaid or risk losing student 
aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade, the total volume of loans has more than  
tripled, the Education Department said. The $11.7 billion borrowed 
from the government in fiscal 1990 swelled to $34.1 billion in 
fiscal 1997. In fiscal 1999 the total is $42.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Group Warns Vs. China Canal Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will not stand for Chinese control  
of the Panama Canal, a group that includes retired military 
officers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumping a four-foot-high pile of 250,000 petitions near the  
Capitol Building, the group opposed to a Hong Kong business's lease 
on canal ports appealed to Congress to ensure the canal stays open 
to U.S. shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1977 agreement, the last U.S. forces are pulling out of  
Panama on Dec. 31, turning over the canal to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	The petitions call upon Congress to investigate claims that the  
Clinton administration has allowed China to become the canal's 
``gatekeeper'' after U.S. forces leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We built it, we paid for it, we use it,'' said retired Adm.  
Thomas H. Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs. ``We want to 
make sure the Chinese communists don't gain control of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moorer spoke at a news conference on the Capitol lawn with other  
members of the National Security Center and several members of 
Congress concerned about the canal's future. The center, which 
includes 80 retired military officers on its advisory board, has 
been stirring concern about U.S. turnover of the canal to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States and Panama have a joint regard for democracy  
and freedom ... and we do not want to see it weakened by outside 
influence from China,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration says there is nothing to indicate  
that the Chinese have any desire to control the canal once the 
United States pulls out. 
</P>
<P>
	Panamanian officials also have dismissed fears that the 20-year  
arrangement with Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. will give China control 
over the waterway. The company will manage access to ports at both 
the Pacific and Atlantic entrances to the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress plans hearings on the issue before the end of the  
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Moorer said if the United States does not maintain priority use  
of the canal, ``then we would be forced to take it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard A. Delguadio, center president and author of a paperback  
book on China's interest in the Panama Canal, said Panamanians 
should be wary of staking their prosperity and security on a 
Chinese business.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Surround Calif. Blazes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMPO, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters were close to containing two  
southern California wildfires today, but huge fires elsewhere in 
the state remained out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3,300-acre blaze near Campo, east of San Diego, was about 70  
percent surrounded by fire lines and expected to be completely 
surrounded tonight, said Chris Hess, a fire captain with the U.S. 
Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast of San Diego, airplanes and helicopters were used to  
fight a 6,000-acre fire that started on the La Jolla Indian 
Reservation and spread into Cleveland National Forest. Crews 
expected to have it fully contained by Wednesday evening, Hess 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Near California's central coast, firefighters had reopened a  
stretch of Highway 1 that was closed by two fires totaling 76,000 
acres near Big Sur. Both fires, started by lightning on Sept. 8, 
were 50 percent contained. About $44 million has been spent 
fighting them. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, fires in the Trinity Alps Wilderness had covered  
96,000 acres but were 42 percent contained. A 51,000-acre blaze in 
Tehama County, near Red Bluff, was 70 percent contained.

<HEADLINE> Leak Reported at S.Korea Nuke Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Radioactive water leaked inside a  
South Korean nuclear power plant, exposing at least 22 people to 
radiation, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred at 7 p.m. Monday during repair work on a  
cooling water pump at Wolsung nuclear power plant, the science and 
technology ministry said in a statement. About 12 gallons of 
so-called ``heavy water'' leaked, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the radioactive water was contained inside the plant.  
</P>
<P>
	``It did not leak outside of the building. It did not affect the  
environment,'' the ministry said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who were exposed to the radiation included employees of  
Korea Electric Power Corp., which runs one of the three nuclear 
power plants in Wolsung. The one where the accident happened 
started commercial operations on July 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first reported leak of radioactive material at a  
plant in South Korea, where the first nuclear plant was built in 
1978. The northeast Asian nation has 14 nuclear power plants which 
provide about 40 percent of its electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident followed Japan's worst nuclear accident last week  
at a uranium-processing plant in Tokaimura, a town 70 miles 
northeast of Tokyo. The accident Thursday was caused when two 
workers skipped key security steps while mixing nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction that followed exposed at least 49 people to  
radiation, closed down Tokaimura and heightened fears about the 
safety of Japan's nuclear plants.

<HEADLINE> Two Former ADM Execs Sent to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- With the rejection of their latest appeals,  
two former executives of Archer Daniels Midland Co. have been 
ordered to report to federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael D. Andreas, 50, and Terrance S. Wilson, 61, were  
convicted last year of fixing prices and were scheduled to report 
to their respective prisons today to begin serving their two-year 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas was originally directed to report to Greenville, Ill.,  
less than 100 miles southeast of Decatur, while Wilson was assigned 
to a prison in Oxford, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Those locations were recommended by a federal judge, but the  
men's final destinations will not be made public by the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons until each man has reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Wilson, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons in  
Washington, D.C., said the odds are that Greenville and Oxford are 
the final locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``A judge's recommendation may or may not be followed. It  
usually is, but I can count thousands of cases where there has been 
a change,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both men had filed numerous motions and appeals  
that delayed the eventual prison time since their convictions by a 
federal jury in August 1998. Their last effort, filed jointly, was 
denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas is on leave as ADM's executive vice president. Wilson,  
who is retired, was the head of ADM's corn division. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Blanche M. Manning sentenced Andreas and  
Wilson, along with FBI informer Mark E. Whitacre, on July 9. 
Whitacre, the former head of ADM's BioProducts Division, is already 
in prison on a previous conviction of embezzling $9 million from 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, Wilson and Whitacre were convicted in one of the  
nation's biggest federal antitrust cases ever. The government said 
they had led ADM into a global conspiracy to set prices and divide 
up competition in sales of citric acid and lysine, which is a 
protein component of hog and chicken feed.

<HEADLINE> Man Suggests His Own Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- In a calm, deliberate voice, Brandon Wilson  
said he felt no remorse for fatally slashing the throat of a 
third-grade boy in a beach restroom last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would do it again in a second if I had the chance,'' Wilson  
told jurors Monday as the boy's mother, Sharon Cecchi, gasped from 
her courtroom seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Execute me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year old drifter spoke against the advice of his lawyer  
as jurors began hearing evidence to help decide between 
recommending a sentence of life in prison without parole or 
execution. Testimony was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole purpose in life is to help destroy your society,''  
Wilson told the panel. ``You people are here as representatives of 
that society and as such you should do everything in your power to 
rid the world of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson admitted he smiled at 9-year-old Matthew Cecchi and  
followed him into the restroom at Oceanside, north of San Diego, in 
November. Then he came up behind the boy as he stood at the urinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he then pulled back the boy's head, slashed his  
throat and stabbed him five times in the back. Wilson fled the 
bathroom, leaving Matthew to bleed to death as his aunt waited 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, from St. Croix Falls, Wis., claimed he was insane at the  
time, driven by voices from God to kill and hallucinogenic drugs. 
Jurors deliberated less than six hours last week before rejecting 
the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury Monday heard more than two hours of prosecution  
testimony that included tearful recollections of Matthew by his 
mother, an uncle and the boy's third-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Two jurors wept as the teacher, Deborah Peck of Stanford Avenue  
School, described how she tried to explain the boy's murder to his 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Third-graders always ask why and that was a question I had no  
answer for,'' said Peck, who called Matthew a straight-A student 
and an extraordinary boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Cecchi recalled trying to comfort her son and to give him  
CPR as he lay bleeding. ``I put my hand on his hair and told him, 
`Hang in there baby. I love you,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said life has been difficult without her eldest son,  
especially holidays. Her 4-year-old son wears Matthew's shirts as a 
way to feel closer to his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was everything to us,'' she said. ``He was a very special  
boy.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Give Baseball a Boost in Cincy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The sheets of plastic intended to protect the  
Cincinnati Reds' cubicles from champagne were rolled out, ready for 
deployment at the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't needed. Instead of champagne, the clubhouse quickly  
filled with tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds' passenger-class ride towards the playoffs ended  
emotionally Monday night. After 54,621 fans stood and applauded 
them one final time following a 5-0 loss to New York, players 
tossed caps into the stands and headed for the clubhouse to pack, 
to hug and to weep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't so much losing as it was the season's over,'' first  
baseman Sean Casey said, his eyes brimming with tears. ``It's tough 
when you realize that such a special season has come to an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the tears dry, Casey will realize that 1999 was more of a  
beginning than an end. It was the year that Cincinnati turned back 
into a baseball town. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is certainly a springboard to leap off of,'' managing  
executive John Allen said Tuesday. ``Everybody I've talked to feels 
that yesterday's crowd sent a message: Baseball is certainly not 
dead in Cincinnati.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in years, it's wonderfully alive again.  
There's new ownership, a new ballpark in the works and a sense that 
the franchise is headed in the right direction after years of 
lurching from crisis to crisis under Marge Schott. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott transferred her controlling interest to three limited  
partners last Friday. She still owns one share but has no authority 
and no spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	She retains a block of 21 seats behind the Reds' dugout and can  
use the owners' luxury box. She'll have to give up her office at 
the stadium and her practice of going on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	New owner Carl Lindner plans to remain behind the scenes,  
allowing Allen and general manager Jim Bowden to continue 
rebuilding a front office and farm system gutted by Schott. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, the question was: Will Jim Bowden be back?'' Allen  
said. ``This year it was: Will John Allen be back? Those 
uncertainties are behind us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the years of losing on the field.  
</P>
<P>
	The Reds began slashing payroll and officially embarked upon a  
rebuilding program on July 31, 1997, when they traded pitcher John 
Smiley to Cleveland for prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	They were aiming to be competitive again by 2003, when the new  
ballpark is supposed to open and more money is available. Despite a 
$35 million payroll, they figured out a way to contend while the 
ballpark was still on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
	The offseason additions of Denny Neagle and Greg Vaughn gave  
them a chance to contend ahead of schedule. The unexpectedly rapid 
development of a young lineup -- Casey, Aaron Boone, Pokey Reese, 
Dmitri Young, Scott Williamson and others -- landed them in a 
playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just developed earlier than we thought they would,''  
Bowden said. ``We thought some would develop this year, some next. 
What happened was that they all developed at one time, so we were 
very fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of good young players to build around now.  
Obviously it took our timetable of 2003 and pushed it up about four 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an added bonus that they got to develop in the middle of  
a playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an invaluable experience,'' said shortstop Barry  
Larkin, a member of the Reds' 1990 World Series title team. ``To 
win early in your career is an experience that you can bank on for 
years and years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Jack McKeon thinks the excitement of '99 will make his  
young players crave more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous advantage as they try to get going along  
with their careers,'' McKeon said. ``The pressure situations in 
close ballgames and the way they've succeeded have got to be a plus 
for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the short-term, it will be difficult for the Reds to repeat  
'99. Vaughn is a free agent and has dropped hints that he'll be 
moving on. Starter Juan Guzman, obtained in a July 31 trade with 
Baltimore, also is a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the young core intact will become expensive because of  
salary arbitration. The payroll might increase a little, but the 
Reds will remain a small-market club competing on a limited budget 
while they rebuild the farm system and prepare for a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure there can be any solid rationale for deviating  
from that plan after this season, based on what people saw,'' Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	What they saw was a preview of the future.  
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't expected to do a lot, and it went down to the final  
game,'' Casey said. ``Hopefully, this was such a special season 
that we'll be able to do it again next year.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Plans Majority Web Co. Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. is buying its first majority stake in  
a Web destination in a deal that intensifies the company's already 
aggressive foray into the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The company agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of cash for CTC  
Bulldog Inc., an Irvington, N.Y. venture formed earlier this year 
that has yet to unveil its Internet site, a source familiar with 
the transaction said yesterday. CBS also will run ads promoting the 
site, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement was planned in New York today. Spokespeople from  
CBS and CTC Bulldog declined to comment on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	CTC Bulldog's Web site is ready to be launched and will use  
promotions such as prizes to try to draw Internet viewers, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has been greatly expanding its Web strategy and currently  
holds minority stakes in 11 Web sites, including SportsLine USA and 
financial news provider MarketWatch.com, which sold stock to the 
public this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	But CBS has yet to buy a majority stake. While some of its  
recent investments have paid off handsomely, CBS currently has no 
single Web destination to help guide Internet surfers to other 
holdings. In contrast, NBC has Web portal Snap.com and ABC created 
Go.com to organize links to its Web properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether CBS would use its latest Web holding to unify its  
disparate properties, the source would only say: ``This is the 
beginning of what they're doing. It's their entrance.''

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart To Add, Remodel Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will open, remodel  
or relocate as many as 340 stores next year, as well as greatly 
expand the number of distribution centers it operates. 
</P>
<P>
	News of its expansion plans on Tuesday came as the world's  
biggest retailer reported better-than-expected September sales at 
its stores. Wal-Mart continues to woo shoppers with its wide 
selection and affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's stock rose 93.75 cents to $51.25 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Wal-Mart's new stores, 160 to 165, will be  
SuperCenters, which combine traditional Wal-Mart discount stores 
with grocery operations. About 100 of them will be expansions of 
existing discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 new stores will be the retailer's regular discount  
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart will expand testing its Neighborhood Markets, adding  
five to 10 units in the fiscal year starting Feb. 1. Wal-Mart's 
Sam's Club division will open 20 to 25 discount warehouse stores, 
with about half being relocations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also plans to open up to 100 stores in existing  
foreign markets, including Germany and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't deviate much from what they've been doing. It is  
probably a very manageable growth rate for them,'' said Steve 
Paspal, senior retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a 
subsidiary of John Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter Barnard's Retail Trend  
Report, said the expansion will benefit consumers because it will 
intensify competition with rival merchants, which could bring down 
prices at other stores.. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart also unveiled the largest distribution center expansion  
in its history. It will add four regional general merchandise 
centers, four food distribution centers and two fresh food 
distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Sept. 30, Wal-Mart had 1,821 discount stores, 650  
SuperCenters and 453 Sam's Clubs in the United States. It also has 
more than 850 stores overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart also announced that its sales from stores open at least  
a year rose 7.2 percent in September compared with a year ago, 
while total sales rose 26.4 percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart benefited from a strong back-to-school season.  
Hurricane Floyd, which hit the East Coast in the middle of the 
month, also helped sales, with shoppers stocking up on everything 
from food to flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. Other retailers are expected to report their monthly 
sales figures on Thursday.

	FCC Warns on MCI WorldCom-Sprint  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom's $115 billion deal to take over  
Sprint met with quick resistance today from federal regulators. 
Chairman William E. Kennard of the Federal Communications 
Commission said the nation's second- and third-largest 
long-distance telephone companies ``will bear a heavy burden to 
show how consumers would be better off'' after their merger. But 
MCI WorldCom and Sprint insisted the richest corporate buyout ever 
would strengthen competition.

	Charges Filed in Bank of NY Probe  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --Three individuals and three companies have been  
charged with illegally funneling $7 billion from Russia through 
accounts at the Bank of New York in what investigators 
investigators believe to be one of the largest cases of money 
laundering in the United States. Peter Berlin, Lucy Edwards -- a 
former vice president at the bank -- and Aleksey Volkov as well as 
Benex International Co. Inc., Becs International L.L.C. and 
Torfinex Corp. were named as defendents.

	Nuke Test Ban Faces Opposition  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top Democrat on foreign affairs  
issues said he told President Clinton today the votes aren't there 
to ratify an international ban on nuclear testing. Sen. Joseph 
Biden, D-Del., said that, while all 45 Senate Democrats are 
prepared to support the treaty next Tuesday when a vote is 
scheduled, Republican support appears to be disappearing. The White 
House indicated that Clinton would continue to fight for the Senate 
to ratify the treaty.

	London Trains Crash, Killing 26  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two London commuter trains smashed into each other  
during rush hour today, killing 26 passengers and injuring 160 on 
the same rail line as another fatal crash two years ago. Ambulance 
and fire crews, police and rail workers swarmed around the 
overturned, mangled rail cars for hours, locating and freeing 
survivors in the smoldering wreckage near the Ladbroke Grove 
residential area in west London. It was Britain's worst train 
accident in more than a decade.

	South Korea Nuclear Plant Leaks  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Radioactive water leaked inside a  
South Korean nuclear power plant during repair work, exposing 22 
workers to small amounts of radiation, the government said. It said 
the radioactive water was contained inside the plant and did not 
escape into the environment. About 12 gallons of so-called ``heavy 
water'' was leaked during the accident last night at a nuclear 
plant in Wolsung, 190 miles southeast of the capital Seoul, the 
Science and Technology Ministry said in a statement.

	Annan Says UN Needs Reform  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today  
the U.N. still has too many administrators and rules, and too 
little money. Member countries, primarily the United States, owed 
the United Nations more than $2 billion, he said. Unpaid dues and 
bureaucratic delays have made it virtually impossible for the U.N. 
to respond quickly to crises like those in Kosovo and East Timor, 
he said.

	Infant Deaths Hold Steady  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's infant death rate held steady in  
1998 after dropping for almost four decades. Researchers were at a 
loss for explanations and uncertain whether last year's figures 
represent a one-year glitch or an end to decades of progress. The 
portion of babies who died before their first birthday in 1997 was 
7.2 deaths for every 1,000 live births. It did not change in 1998. 
At least 24 other counties have lower rates than the United States.

left open the possibility of a third rate hike later this year. The 
Dow industrials closed 0.64 lower at 10,400.59. On the NYSE, losers

in the sixth inning broke a 1-1 tie and helped the Houston Astros 
to a 6-1 victory today vs. the Atlanta Braves in Game 1 of their NL 
division series. The Astros got four runs in the ninth, topped by 
Ken Caminiti's three-run homer. Houston starter Shane Reynolds, who 
went six innings, and three Astros relievers held the Braves to 
seven hits.

<HEADLINE> WorldCom Boss a Modest Billionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, Miss. (AP) -- In this town where roads are made of  
brick, cars are left unlocked and college kids dart in and out of 
coffee shops, Bernard J. Ebbers is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 native of Edmonton, Alberta, came here in the late  
1960s to play basketball for Mississippi College, a private school 
with more than 3,600 students. Today, Clinton is the 58-year-old 
billionaire's home and the center of his life's work -- MCI WorldCom 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	To townspeople, he is Bernie Ebbers, not only the boss to 900  
MCI WorldCom employees, but also the vice chairman of the 
Mississippi College board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes to ball games,'' said Howell W. Todd, Mississippi  
College president. ``He's very loyal to this institution. He's very 
keen on our philosophy and mission, and in ensuring that we carry 
out that mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is also quiet and faithful and once canceled a Saturday night  
business function with the Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce so he 
could finish preparing the lesson for Sunday school the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he is a deeply spiritual man; his faith is extremely  
important to him, and his values,'' said Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be faith that helped prompt Ebbers, whose early jobs  
included that of basketball coach and small-chain motel owner, to 
invest in a tiny long-distance company called Long Distance 
Discount Services, even though he knew little about the phone 
business. That was in 1983, just before AT&AMP;T was dismembered. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned that company, an idea drawn up in a Hattiesburg coffee  
shop, into the nation's second-largest telecommunications company 
with net income last year of $2.6 billion and an overall value 
around $117.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	LDDS has been involved in 60 mergers since it was born. Before  
Tuesday, Ebbers' biggest deal was when his company, renamed 
WorldCom, bought MCI Communications. Now, he's maneuvered MCI 
Worldcom to take over Sprint Corp., in a $115 billion deal that is 
the largest corporate acquisition in history. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was surprised about the latest announcement; analysts had  
been saying MCI WorldCom needed Sprint for its wireless segment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ebbers realized that, too, his friends say.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say that Bernie is always a step or two  
ahead of the rest of us,'' said Duane O'Neill, president of the 
Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce. ``He's a true visionary in that 
he makes it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers, a former cowboy and soybean rancher, is credited with  
methodically making his company grow and remain profitable and 
competitive in an era of corporate mergers that has set the entire 
industry on its ear. 
</P>
<P>
	None of which surprises Todd, who has known Ebbers for five  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very unassuming; doesn't want to draw a lot of attention  
to himself,'' says Todd. ``But beware because underneath all that 
laid-back attitude is a steel-trap mind and one of the sharpest, 
shrewdest individuals I've ever known. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at the company and see that.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos Hope Loville Can Replace TD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Don't be misled by the silver stud piercing  
through Derek Loville's right nostril or the nipple ring under his 
shirt. He is not the anti-Terrell. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the man who will replace MVP running back Terrell Davis  
does not crave attention and may be one of the most disciplined 
members of the Denver Broncos' backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the weight room every day,'' Loville said. ``I've put  
in work just like the next man. I think I work harder than a lot of 
people. ... I'm looking forward to the opportunity to helping my 
team get a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Davis out for the season with two torn ligaments and  
cartilage damage in his right knee, Loville will be called upon to 
handle the bulk of the rushing duties. 
</P>
<P>
	While no one can be expected to put up Terrellian numbers,  
Loville has spent the last three years as Davis' understudy, 
capably filling in when needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek's going to get the job done,'' offensive lineman Tony  
Jones said. ``I'm glad he's had the reps he's had with us. We feel 
comfortable with him. We've just got to bear down more and block 
better and find a way to get a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Davis healthy for the first three games, the Broncos  
(0-4) have struggled offensively averaging just 90.5 yards per game 
on the ground and 274 overall. Those numbers rank 20th and 26th, 
respectively, in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no telling what the statistics will look like with  
Loville as the primary running back, but he carries a confidence 
borne from nine seasons in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always optimistic. That's me. That's my demeanor,''  
Loville said. ``This is my ninth year. I'm fortunate. Running backs 
are only supposed to play for, what, 3 1/2 years? I'm playing on 
borrowed time and I'm having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loville is no stranger to replacing a top-flight running back.  
In 1995, he waded into starting role with San Francisco after Ricky 
Watters left the 49ers to sign a lucrative free agent contract with 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	That season turned out to be Loville's best as he ran for  
career-high 723 yards and 10 touchdowns and caught 87 passes for 
662 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek is an experienced football player and he understands the  
game,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``He's a great special 
teams player. He's been a tremendous worker. He's been a starter in 
the NFL, so he does bring that experience and that drive that you 
look for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loville won't be alone in trying to replace Davis, who refers to  
the Denver running backs as No Limit Soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Loville, the corps will include rookie Olandis  
Gary and second-year player John Avery, who came to the Broncos in 
a trade that sent wide receiver Marcus Nash to Miami two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tight,'' Loville said. ``We're a tight group because we  
take pride in what we do and we pull for one another. There's no 
animosity. There's no jealousy. We want all of to do good, whether 
it's on special teams or offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether being close-knit leads to success remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Falcons are 0-3 since losing star running back Jamal  
Anderson to a torn knee ligament. Anderson's replacement, Byron 
Hanspard, has run for 155 yards on 53 carries -- an average of less 
than 3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in our guys,'' Shanahan said. ``I really believe our  
guys will step up. It's not going to be easy. It's going to have to 
be a heck of a commitment by everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Harvard Acquires Communist Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- An extensive collection of previously  
classified documents from the Communist Party archives in the 
former Soviet Union has a new home at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 million sheets of material include the archives of the  
Gulag, the system of Soviet forced labor camps; documents from the 
organization responsible for internal purges of the Communist 
Party; the archives of the Soviet police; and a variety of records 
detailing deliberations within Communist leadership between 1903 
through the Gorbachev period of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the archives have been available only to Russians  
with top secret clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection, named in honor of George and Abby O'Neill, who  
donated the funds to acquire the materials, will be stored on 
10,000 reels of microfilm and housed within the Harvard College 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
	Another related gift, the Elizabeth H. and Ernest E. Monrad  
Library Collection of materials from the former Soviet Union, will 
enable Harvard's Davis Center for Russian Studies to build a 
computer data bank and add to its Soviet collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Both collections will be dedicated at a ceremony Oct. 28.

the full amount of their loans and accrued interest to the 
Omaha-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis is on performance,'' Chairman and CEO Dick  
Davidson said. ``These targets will require dedication and hard 
work. Our senior executives are making a substantial personal 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shares were sold to participants out of treasury stock,  
Union Pacific said. The company said it plans to replace the shares 
through open market purchases over time.

<P>
	KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- Thomas J. Bienemann, who played defensive  
end for the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League from 
1951-56 and later headed up the underwear manufacturer Jockey 
International, died Tuesday of leukemia at the age of 71. 
</P>
<P>
	After his football career, Bienemann joined Jockey International

Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years later, he joined Hanes Corp. and worked as vice  
president for sales and marketing until 1975, when he joined 
Warnaco Northwest, which makes Speedo and other sportswear 
products. 
</P>

home. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Brauer was known for his efforts to diversify the predominantly  
Protestant school. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been credited with helping the university become one of  
the nation's leading theological centers, representing many faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenures as dean of the university's federated

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Nigel Broakes, a prominent property developer  
whose holdings included London's Ritz Hotel and the Cunard shipping 
line, has died. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Broakes, who headed the property and construction conglomerate  
Trafalgar House died Sept. 28 after a short illness, news reports 
said Tuesday. He was known as the figurehead behind the successful 
redevelopment of the London Docklands area. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Wakefield in the English Midlands, Broakes began his  
career as an insurance underwriter, but soon became interested in 
property development. He became a millionaire in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	He assumed the chairmanship of Trafalgar House at 35,  
accumulating some of the country's best-known assets over the next 
decade, among them Cunard and the Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Broakes made a successful bid for the troubled  
Beaverbrook empire, which owned the Daily Express, the Sunday 
Express and the Evening Standard newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	His development of the London Docklands led to a knighthood in  
1984.

	Broakes is survived by two sons and a daughter. His wife, Joyce  
Horne, whom he married in 1956, died in 1993.

                          *Martin S. Davis    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Martin S. Davis, who reshaped the sprawling Gulf  
&AMP; Western conglomerate into the publishing and entertainment 
powerhouse called Paramount Communications before presiding over 
its hotly contested sale to Viacom Inc., has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis died of a heart attack Monday evening, family spokesman  
Jerry Sherman said Tuesday. Davis was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had been a partner in recent years in a private  
investment firm whose holdings include the maker of Lionel trains, 
was known for a tough and aggressive style. But he described 
himself as an ``employee-captain'' whose job was to get the best 
return possible on shareholder's investments. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, Davis was selected as chief executive of G&AMP;W after its  
longtime boss Charles Bluhdorn died. The company at the time was a 
classic diversified conglomerate with assets ranging from cigars 
and agricultural products to financial services, industrial 
products, metals, chemicals and motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	But Davis felt conglomerates were no longer in vogue and that he  
could get better returns by selling assets. He began a sweeping 
corporate restructuring, selling about 150 busineses with revenues 
amounting to $6 billion between 1983 and 1989 and liquidating a 
$900 million investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	The company focused on its publishing and entertainment  
operations which included Simon &AMP; Schuster, Prentice Hall, Madison 
Square Garden, TV stations and Paramount Pictures. It changed its 
name to Paramount Communications in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1993, Davis and Paramount agreed to sell Paramount  
to Sumner Redstone's Viacom, the owner of the MTV and the Showtime 
pay TV service, for about $8.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal provoked a bidding battle war led by former  
Paramount and Fox executive Barry Diller and involving many of the 
biggest names in the media and entertainment businesses. Davis was 
forced to abandon his deal with Viacom and conduct an auction. 
Viacom eventually prevailed, although the price was about $2 
billion more than the initial agreement.

</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Bernard Buffet, one of France's major contemporary  
painters, killed himself Monday at his home in southern France, 
police said. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffet was found dead by his wife with a plastic bag over his  
head, police sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallery owner Maurice Garnier, who had worked with Buffet for 51  
years, said the artist was suffering from Parkinson's disease and 
had been unable to work for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffet, a millionaire who basked in fame since he was 20, was an  
outspoken advocate of figurative painting at a time when 
abstraction was the rage. He remained faithful to the distinctive, 
black vertical brushstroke he used to recreate emaciated faces, 
imperial Russian palaces and sad-faced clowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffet was roundly ignored by the French art establishment. The  
Georges Pompidou Center, France's most prestigious collection of 
modern and contemporary art, never purchased any of his work. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Buffet was a superstar abroad, His work was the subject  
of two separate museums in Japan, one featuring more than 600 of 
his works.

<HEADLINE> Colon Cancer Follow-Ups Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of men worry that their annual blood  
tests will show an elevated screen for prostate cancer. That result 
is far from good news, but at least it may mean the body is trying 
to overcome the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute  
indicates that prostate specific antigen, the protein doctors test 
for as an indication of prostate cancer, may be part of the body's 
tumor-fighting arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of American men get blood tests every year to check for  
elevated levels of PSA, an indication that cancer is present. 
</P>
<P>
	``God didn't put PSA as a marker of prostate cancer. There's got  
to be some biological function of this molecule, and in our minds 
eye it had not been defined adequately,'' said Dr. John W. Holaday, 
one of a team of researchers in Maryland that found evidence that 
PSA itself may slow the growth of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was data showing that women with advanced breast cancer,  
who had higher levels of PSA, had a better prognosis,'' Holaday 
said in a telephone interview. ``That taught us two things: that 
prostate specific antigen is not prostate specific; and, secondly, 
it appears to be correlated with an improved outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really ever asked the question: 'What does PSA do?'''  
Holaday said. So his team did the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our results suggest that, in addition to its role as an  
indicator of prostate cancer, PSA may also inhibit the growth of 
blood vessels associated with cancer progression,'' the team from 
EntreMed Inc. of Rockville, Md., reports in the Oct. 6 issue of the 
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a man over 50, I know that when my prostate PSA levels are  
measured on an annual basis, I look to that as a measure of 
progressive disease or lack thereof,'' Holaday said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also realize that when it reaches the later years, often  
people don't even treat prostate cancer in men 75 years of age and 
older because it grows so slowly. We think it grows slowly because 
the PSA it makes keeps it in check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer researcher Dr. Gerald Murphy of Northwest Hospital's  
Pacific Northwest Cancer Foundation in Seattle called the result 
``very interesting. I had no idea that PSA would have this 
associated effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said he would need to know more about the type of PSA  
tested and how it operates but said the report helps explain the 
increase in PSA as cancer grows. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists see two fronts in the battle against cancer:  
attacking the tumor cells and battling the endothelial cells that 
make up blood vessels to bring the tumor oxygen and nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	The EntreMed scientists have been working on endostatin, a  
protein that blocks blood-vessel development in tumors. It is 
currently in the first phase of clinical trials on humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticing that many patients with growing tumors have increased  
levels of natural endostatin, they began to wonder if increasing 
amounts of PSA, rather than just being ``a harbinger of bad news,'' 
might also indicate that the body is attempting to fight cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	After lab tests indicated that PSA added to cancer cells  
inhibited the formation of new blood vessels, the scientists 
introduced cancer cells to mice susceptible to lung cancer, and 
treated some of the mice with PSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice that had been treated with PSA averaged 62 to 78 tumor  
nodules in their lungs after 14 days. In contrast, mice that did 
not receive PSA averaged 99 to 131 tumors. In similar tests using 
endostatin, treated mice averaged eight to 24 tumors.

<HEADLINE> Sprint Accepts MCI WorldCom Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In what would be the largest corporate takeover  
ever, MCI WorldCom Inc. has struck a $115 billion deal to acquire 
the Sprint Corp., the nation's No. 3 long-distance telephone 
company, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom sweetened its offer in a stock swap late Monday  
rather than risk losing Sprint to rival BellSouth Corp., which 
offered $100 billion in cash and stock, a person involved in the 
negotiations said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear early today whether BellSouth, an Atlanta-based  
Baby Bell, would raise its offer or walk away. Also unclear was the 
potential of a third bid from Deutsche Telekom, which owns 10 
percent of Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached when MCI WorldCom increased its offer  
to $76 per share in stock, while BellSouth's last bid was $72 per 
share in cash and stock, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boards of MCI WorldCom and Sprint voted to approve the deal  
Monday night and the companies were expected to announce the deal 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A successful bid would produce the largest corporate merger  
ever, eclipsing the pending $82 billion deal between Exxon Corp. 
and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers might not see any immediate benefit from a Sprint  
buyout because long-distance and wireless calling rates are at 
historic lows. But with competition driving telecommunications 
companies into new markets such as cable television, consumers are 
expected to enjoy increasingly attractive bundles of telephone, TV 
and Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom is the nation's second largest long-distance  
company and one of the world's biggest operators of networks that 
make up the Internet. It has no wireless calling business, and 
Sprint PCS would fill that hole nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth wanted Sprint's long-distance business to complement  
its local telephone service in nine Southeast states. Like the 
other Baby Bells, the Atlanta-based company is hopeful that federal 
regulators will soon allow it to offer long-distance service in its 
home region. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the mightiest telecom companies are racing to grab an edge  
in technology and geographic reach so they can compete in a market 
where distinctions between telephones, television, radio and 
computers are disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint, a leading player in long distance, wireless and Internet  
services, is a plum target. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sprint has got some pretty premium assets,'' said Catherine  
Jackson, a managing director for Trainer Wortham Co., which owns 
500,000 shares of MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., not only beat BellSouth's  
offer, but also promised greater cost savings and nationwide 
customer base. MCI will assume $13 billion in Sprint debt, 
according to the AP's source. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are expected to scrutinize any deal Sprint makes.  
Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to spur 
competition, but mergers have greatly reduced the number of major 
players in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 233 telecom deals this year totaling $195  
billion, according to Thomson Securities Data Co. If Sprint inks an 
agreement, this year's total will far surpass the $220 billion in 
1998 telecom deals.

<HEADLINE> Jamal Anderson Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson  
underwent successful knee surgery Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, an All-Pro who rushed for 1,846 yards last season,  
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a loss 
to the Dallas Cowboys on Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed at Piedmont Hospital about two weeks  
after the injury, allowing time for a reduction in swelling. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indians Ready for Pedro Martinez  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez isn't worried about any new  
tricks the Indians might have planned for him. Or that Cleveland 
was the first team in 49 years to score more than 1,000 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Martinez is just glad of one thing -- he doesn't have to face  
the Florida Marlins this October. 
</P>
<P>
	Winless against Martinez the past two seasons, the Indians have  
drawn up a new blueprint for the AL playoffs designed to defeat 
Boston's ace Wednesday night in Game 1 of the best-of-5 division 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	They're planning to work Martinez deep into the count by fouling  
off good pitches, not chasing bad ones. They won't overswing. 
They'll run on the right-hander. They'll score early, stay close 
and hope he wears down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what we have to do,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds great, right? Well, everyone has a plan for Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
	Then they have to step into the batter's box.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll see what they bring up to the table,'' Martinez said  
Tuesday. ``If it doesn't work for them, it might be too late. 
Somehow, I've got to stay in the strike zone and somehow they have 
to swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And somehow the Indians have to try and beat the seemingly  
invincible Martinez and finally win a Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who will be opposed by Cleveland ace Bartolo Colon,  
was baseball's most dominant player this season. In a year when 
softball-like scores became the daily norm in baseball, Martinez 
put up astounding stats. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA, nearly three runs lower than the  
league average (4.86). He struck out 313 hitters in 213 1-3 
innings, walking just 37. He held opponents to a .206 batting 
average, .247 on-base percentage and .289 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Cy Young is in the bag, and Martinez may win the league  
MVP award, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player I did not think that a pitcher should be the  
MVP,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``As a manager, I kind 
of feel the same way. Pedro, though, may be the exception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams, who played for St. Louis when Bob  
Gibson was in his prime and has been in baseball for more than 30 
years, isn't sure he has ever seen anything like the year Martinez 
is having. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize what you're seeing with this kid? What he's doing  
with that ball?'' Williams said. ``Especially when the ERA in the 
American League is what it is. Especially when throughout all of 
baseball to have 20 homers today is nothing or 30, 40 or 60. He has 
that ability to take that baseball and stop some awfully good 
teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are one of them. But in the past two years, Martinez  
has treated Cleveland like everyone else, posting a 4-0 record with 
a 1.83 ERA in the regular season and beating the Indians in Game 1 
of the division series in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Martinez started four games against the Indians,  
going 2-0 with a 2.17 ERA and striking out 40 in 29 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his last start against Cleveland on Sept. 15, the Indians  
tried something new. They were more patient at the plate, swinging 
at the fourth and fifth pitches they saw rather than jumping on the 
first close one. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez still struck out 14 in seven innings, but he had to  
work much harder than usual and left a tied game after throwing 131 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved it,'' said Vizquel, who had three hits and had one  
13-pitch at-bat. ``The last game we hit him good. We got a lot of 
guys on base. We were relaxed at the plate, and we saw a lot of 
pitches. We know it's going to be tough to get on base, but we've 
got to look for any mistake that he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez knows the Indians may try the same strategy. That's  
fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to have to prove to me that what they're going  
to do is going to work for them,'' Martinez said. ``Because I'm not 
going to change my approach. I do what I do against every team and 
against Cleveland. If they want to run, they can go ahead and run. 
If they want to hit and run, let them do their thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez hasn't lost since Aug. 19, and excluding a one-inning  
relief tuneup last Sunday, has struck out at least 11 in his last 
eight appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians don't scare him. Not as much as the Marlins, who  
finished with the worst record in the NL yet chased him after 3 2-3 
innings in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they were the strongest team I faced all year,'' he  
said. ``They got me for nine runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland is counting on Colon to keep them close and to  
hopefully win an opener. The Indians have dropped the last eight 
series openers in a row, last winning a Game 1 in the '95 division 
series against the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Beating Martinez would also mean the Indians could sweep and not  
have to face Martinez a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be huge,'' said catcher Sandy Alomar. ``But you still  
have to beat the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Red Sox are 16-7 vs. the Indians the past two regular  
seasons, but have lost their last two playoff series to Cleveland. 
``I'm hoping the third time is a charm,'' said DH/first baseman 
Mike Stanley. ... Hargrove has not yet announced his postseason 
roster, but said Charles Nagy would start Game 2 against Boston's 
Bret Saberhagen. ... The Indians are just 1-for-30 against Red Sox 
reliever Derek Lowe this season with seven strikeouts in 9 1-3 
innings. ``I can't explain it,'' Lowe said. ``The only thing I can 
think of is that I've been well rested when I've faced them.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Drift Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were lower in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell as prices continue to be pressured by large  
supplies and a lack of new export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were lower as the market reacted to news the  
harvesting of the crop continues without being hampered by adverse 
weather. The quiet export market also is pulling corn lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were lower on indications the soybean  
crop this year could reach 2.75 million bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	National Weather Service forecasts call for mostly dry  
conditions in the soybean belt over the next six to 10 days. That 
is expected to help the harvest, which the U.S. Agriculture 
Department reports is 32 percent completed as of Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, December wheat was 1 1/4 cents lower at $2.67 1/2 a  
bushel; December corn was a 1/4 cent lower at $2.04 a bushel; 
December oats were a 1/2 cent lower at $1.11 1/2 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 1 1/4 cents lower at $4.82 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices were lower in early trading today  
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle were .22 cent lower at 68.95 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle were .50 cent lower at 81.50 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were 1.30 cents lower at 48.90 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 1.27 cents lower at 62.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Teen Admits Hacking Into AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teen-age hacker admitted in court  
Tuesday that he broke into America Online's internal computers from 
his bedroom and altered programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Satiro, 19, pleaded guilty in Westchester County Court to  
first-degree computer tampering. He could be sentenced to up to 15 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, police showed up at Satiro's home and took him and his  
computer into custody after AOL detected the intrusion, traced it 
to Satiro and notified the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal complaint said damage Satiro did to AOL would cost  
more than $50,000 to repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Satiro had once worked as a volunteer at AOL technical support  
and ``combined his AOL knowledge with other information that he had 
gathered from other hackers,'' the district attorney's office said 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Jewell Was Public Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that Richard Jewell was a  
public figure to a certain degree before The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution identified him as a suspect in the 1996 
Centennial Olympic Park bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling means Jewell now has a tougher burden in proving the  
newspaper libeled him. Jewell filed a defamation suit against the 
newspaper and its parent company, Cox Enterprises, in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulton County State Court Judge John Mather said Jewell became a  
voluntary limited purpose public figure through media interviews he 
gave after he discovered a knapsack with the bomb. The interviews 
occurred before he was identified by the newspaper as a suspect, 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While news coverage alone would be insufficient to convert him  
to a public figure, plaintiff granted eleven interviews in which he 
not only related the events witnessed but also spoke repeatedly of 
the training which he and others had received, commented on park 
safety, and encouraged the general public to return to the park,'' 
Mather wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell was working as a park security guard when the bomb  
exploded, killing one person and injuring more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was initially praised as a hero for his role in helping  
evacuate the park, he was then investigated by the FBI and 
identified as a suspect by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department cleared him three months later.  
</P>
<P>
	A private person claiming libel must prove a news organization  
was negligent in reporting information that was false and damaging. 
But a public figure must prove malice, which means a news 
organization knew or suspected it was reporting harmful falsehoods 
and acted with reckless disregard. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewell will probably appeal the ruling, said his attorney, Lin  
Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you sue a media defendant such as The Atlanta  
Journal-Constitution and Cox Enterprises, you know going in you 
have to climb a large mountain,'' Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Mather ordered two of the paper's reporters to jail for  
refusing to disclose the sources who identified Jewell as a suspect 
in the Olympic bombing. The paper is appealing that order. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was cleared as a suspect, Jewell received a reported  
$500,000 settlement with NBC over comments that anchor Tom Brokaw 
made on the air shortly after the bombing. Jewell also settled with 
CNN for an undisclosed amount.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Decry Altered Food Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists worry that a public backlash  
against genetically modified foods could slow the development of 
crops that could improve health and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Crops are in development that would be more nutritious than  
current varieties -- rice enhanced with beta carotene, for example -- 
or engineered to contain vaccines that would inoculate people in 
developing countries against disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see a knee-jerk reaction and fear take away these  
possibilities,'' Michael Thomashow, a plant scientist at Michigan 
State University, told the House Science subcommittee on basic 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn, soybeans and other crops that already are in wide use have  
been genetically engineered to resist insects and weed killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists and farmers have been surprised by the growing public  
resistance to genetic engineering in Europe and to a lesser extent 
in Asia. The Clinton administration is under pressure from 
environmental groups to require labeling of foods that contain 
biotech ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of the technology has sharpened since a laboratory  
study at Cornell University found evidence that pollen from a 
genetically modified corn can kill larvae of the monarch butterfly. 
Following the study's release, the European Union agreed to tighten 
rules on trading and selling new genetically modified seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Goldburg, director of the Environmental Defense Fund's  
biotechnology program, said there is good reason for consumers to 
be cautious. Not enough research has been done to protect people 
with food allergies and to ensure that the crops won't damage the 
environment, she said, adding that she thinks the benefits of the 
technology have been overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does bear some risks,'' said Goldburg, the lone biotech  
critic among five scientists who appeared before the House panel on 
Tuesday. ``To go whole hog without stepping back and taking 
reasonable precautions would be a mistake,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of genetic engineering insist it isn't fundamentally  
different from traditional breeding, in which one plant might be 
cross-pollinated with a wild cousin to produce a hardier variety. 
Genetic engineering involves splicing a single gene from one 
organism to another one that often is unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
	A major concern of scientists is making sure that the  
transplanted genes don't cause allergic reactions. Development of a 
new type of soybeans had to be stopped when it was discovered that 
some people might be allergic to them because they would have 
contained a gene from Brazil nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	A colleague of the Cornell researchers, entomologist Anthony  
Shelton, told the lawmakers that Europeans overreacted to the 
butterfly study. 
</P>
<P>
	``As scientists and policy makers we should not be so easily  
swayed by preliminary laboratory reports and the media,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Losey, the entomologist who led the study, acknowledged  
when it was released that more research was needed and said he 
believed that the benefits of the corn outweighed the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Bt corn is designed to produce a natural pesticide  
that kills the European corn borer.

<HEADLINE> Winthrop Soccer Coach Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) -- Winthrop University suspended its men's  
soccer coach for one game for pulling his team off the field with 
26 minutes left in a scoreless game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rich Posipanko will miss the Eagles game against North  
Carolina on Wednesday, athletics director Tom Hickman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Big South Conference game at Coastal Carolina on Saturday  
was scoreless when Posipanko pulled his team. Winthrop had received 
one red card and five yellow cards, one to the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	A yellow card can be a warning for an excessive foul and two  
yellow cards become an automatic red card, meaning the player must 
leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Posipanko said emotions were running high on the field and he  
wanted to avoid a more serious situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I did was wrong and I'm not proud of it,'' Posipanko  
said. However, he said it was the best decision he could make at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal Carolina was awarded a 1-0 forfeit win.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do not condone Coach Posipanko's actions in this matter,''  
Hickman said. ``Regardless of his reasons for doing so, by removing 
his team from the field Coach Posipanko took control of the game 
away from the officials who have responsibility for the arbitrary 
field management and conduct of the contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posipanko also could face additional penalties from the  
conference ranging from a reprimand to an additional game 
suspension.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Offense Hurts Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux took another playoff loss, but the  
puny Atlanta offense and the smallest Braves' postseason crowd 
since the 1914 World Series had to share the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Astros got home runs from rookie Daryle Ward and Ken  
Caminiti as the NL Central champions opened the best-of-5 division 
series with a 6-1 win Tuesday over the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do much offensively,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox  
said. ``It didn't look pretty. We had some chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of them came in the fifth inning after Gerald Williams had  
tied the game at 1 with a two-out single off Shane Reynolds. Bret 
Boone followed with an infield hit and Reynolds pitched around 
Chipper Jones, walking him on four pitches to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleanup hitter Ryan Klesko, however, struck out on a 2-2  
fastball to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan gets a hit there with the bases loaded, it changes the  
complexion of the game,'' said Jones. ``There were a lot of 
what-ifs? The bottom line is we didn't get anything done today with 
runners on and two outs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other opportunity for the Braves came in the fourth with two  
outs and runners on first and third, but Andruw Jones popped to 
second for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL East champion Braves, who had won 10 straight division  
series games, including a three-game sweep of the Astros in 1997, 
lost for only the second time in 14 first-round games since the 
series was started in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who had been 4-0 previously in division play, dropped to  
.500 at 9-9 in postseason play, but could have been a winner had 
the offense produced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy with the way I pitched. That's a game I certainly  
very easily could have given up 6 or 7 runs, but didn't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a personal side, I'm glad I hung in there. It just didn't  
work out. The other pitcher threw a better game,'' said Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, who had dropped six of seven to the Braves during  
the regular season, including two to Maddux, got only two runs off 
the Atlanta right-hander in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave up 10 hits, walked four -- two intentionally -- and struck  
out five and escaped from two bases-loaded, one-out jams to keep it 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which had captured its eighth consecutive division  
title, only had seven hits off Reynolds and three relievers before 
a crowd of only 39,119 at Turner Field (50,062 capacity) on a 
near-perfect baseball day with a blue sky and temperature in the 
low 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was certainly disappointing,'' said Chipper Jones. ``It  
takes away from our home-field advantage, something we worked six 
months for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, with 103 regular-season wins, had the most in the  
majors and earned the home-field advantage throughout the NL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said the team didn't do enough to get the crowd excited.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we do one little thing on offense to ignite the crowd, to  
get them behind us and get them standing up and clapping, maybe the 
outcome is different,'' said Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous smallest crowd was 34,365 at Boston's Fenway Park  
between the Braves and Philadelphia Athletics in Game 4 of the 1914 
World Series.

<HEADLINE> Guards Accused of Setting Up Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Four guards have gone on trial, accused  
of using a known sexual predator to rape an inmate as punishment 
for kicking a female guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged incident took place at the Corcoran State Prison,  
where eight other officers face a later trial for allegedly setting 
up gladiator-style battles among inmates for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The guards are accused of putting 118-pound Eddie Dillard in the  
cell of Wayne J. Robertson, a 230-pound sexual predator serving a 
life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson admitted to a grand jury that he sodomized Dillard and  
threatened to kill him if he put up a fight during the three days 
in 1993 when guards left the smaller man in the cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard, a first-time offender sent to prison for assault with a  
deadly weapon, had just been transferred from another prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this trial, you will hear things unlike anything you've  
ever heard before,'' prosecutor Vernon Pierson told jurors as the 
trial began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor also said the guards knew Robertson and Dillard  
had fought at another lockup and violated prison policy by putting 
the two together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dillard should have never been put in the cell with me,  
period,'' Robertson testified to a grand jury. ``The Corrections 
Department used me as a pawn to get inmate Dillard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal trial in state court is the first in nearly a  
decade for guards at Corcoran, a maximum-security prison in the San 
Joaquin Valley. The prison was the nation's most deadly from 1989 
to 1995, when 43 inmates were wounded and seven shot to death by 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Two state investigations into abuses at Corcoran and alleged  
cover-ups by prison officials ended without criminal charges in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A special grand jury last year indicted the four guards -- Sgts.  
Robert Decker, 41, and Dale Brakebill, 34, and Officers Anthony 
Sylva, 36, and Joe Sanchez, 38 -- on charges of aiding and abetting 
the rape. 
</P>
<P>
	All four guards, who face up to nine years in prison if  
convicted, are on administrative leave with pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Sisk, the lawyer for Decker, sought to put the blame on  
Robertson, and on poor paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the files that the guards were given on the prisoners  
didn't include Dillard's enemies list or mention his attack on the 
female guard. The files also showed that Robertson was being 
allowed to have cellmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our clients had no motive to punish inmate Dillard,'' Sisk  
said. ``At the time these two inmates were put together, there was 
no particular reason for these inmates not to be celled together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that Wayne Robertson is a rapist and a thug, but that  
fact was not known to the floor staff,'' Sisk said.

<HEADLINE> Camp Victims Threaten To End Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Survivors of Nazi labor camps threatened today  
to walk out on negotiations with German companies, calling the 
companies' compensation offers ``peanuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference a day before reopening of negotiations,  
slave labor victims and their attorneys urged the companies to 
finish the talks quickly and offer ``meaningful compensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't step up to the plate and start  
negotiating...with real money that is representative of their 
ability to pay, we are going to walk away from these meetings,'' 
said attorney Mel Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in months of negotiations the German companies have  
never given a specific figure of how much money they would pay for 
an estimated 2.4 million persons forced to work in German industry 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But Weiss said attorneys have relied on newspaper reports and  
rumors for an idea of what the companies might offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting such a report in Tuesday's edition of the Washington  
Post, he said compensation of $200 per slave labor survivor is 
being contemplated and he called that offer a ``paltry amount'' and 
``a disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported that lawyers for the German companies would go  
into meetings with officials from the U.S. and other governments 
starting Wednesday offering $3.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss declined to say how much survivors are demanding but said  
it was ``far in excess'' of the $20 billion that has been reported 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official said Monday it was premature to  
comment on any anticipated offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will bring together representatives from countries  
where former slave laborers live such as Poland, Russia, Ukraine 
and Israel as well as leaders of Jewish groups and plaintiffs' 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	German participants include top government officials and  
executives from leading German companies. 
</P>
<P>
	One Jewish group, B'nai B'Rith International, took out a full  
page ad in the New York Times that named Bayer, a German 
pharmaceutical company, accusing it of ``human experiments and 
slave labor'' during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad said ``Bayer executives explicitly directed Nazi doctors  
to perform specific experiments with their products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Reinert, a spokesman at Bayer headquarters in Leverkusen,  
Germany, said Bayer was absorbed during the Nazi era into the IG 
Farben pharmaceutical and chemical conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no connection between (Nazi doctor Joseph) Mengele  
and the Bayer company,'' Reinard said. ``We know of no evidence 
that he ever worked for IG Farben.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the wider issue of Bayer's role in the Third Reich, including  
slave labor, Reinert said: 
</P>
<P>
	``Bayer rejects legal responsibility for whatever may have  
happened under the Nazi dictatorship and at IG Farben. However, 
Bayer is aware of a humanitarian responsibility and therefore is 
taking part in negotiations aimed at creating a foundation for the 
victims.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Urged To Avoid Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is urging U.S. citizens  
to defer nonemergency travel to Indonesia and says those who travel 
to that country should exercise extreme caution. 
</P>
<P>
	In a travel warning dated Monday, the department reminded  
potential travelers that demonstrations have occurred in Jakarta 
and on all major islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some areas, violence has been directed at American  
businesses,'' it said. It added that popular demonstrations against 
the Indonesian government are growing in frequency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demonstrations can be spontaneous and have the potential to  
turn violent,'' the announcement said. ``Although most 
demonstrations have been peaceful, some protesters have been 
injured or killed in recent confrontations with police in 
Jakarta.''

<HEADLINE> Waco Evidence Granted to Counsel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday allowed Special  
Counsel John Danforth access to the trove of documents being shared 
by the government and plaintiffs' attorneys in the Branch 
Davidians' civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Walter Smith broadened the protective order  
governing the evidence to let Danforth see deposition testimony, 
exhibits and other information gathered by both sides in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth, a former  
Republican senator from Missouri, to investigate whether there was 
a cover-up or other wrongdoing in the government's handling of the 
51-day Branch Davidian siege, which ended in a fire at the sect's 
compound in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and about 80 followers died.  
Survivors of the siege and relatives of the dead have filed a 
wrongful death lawsuit, challenging the government's assertion that 
the Davidians set the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial was to begin this month, but Smith delayed it to give  
federal officials time to produce evidence he has requested. A new 
date has not been set.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. To Execute Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the  
way for Tennessee to carry out its first execution since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court on Monday refused without comment to review the  
case of Robert Glen Coe, convicted in 1981 of raping and murdering 
an 8-year-old girl. Unless Gov. Don Sundquist grants clemency or a 
stay is granted, Coe will receive a lethal injection on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee is the only Southern state that hasn't executed anyone  
since the high court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The 
state has 99 men and two women on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	The last person executed in Tennessee was William Tines, who  
raped a housekeeper after escaping from prison where he was serving 
time for a double murder. He died in the electric chair on Nov. 7, 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundquist is unlikely to intervene in the Coe case. He has said  
the death penalty should be reserved for heinous crimes, and ``this 
fits that definition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public defender Henry Martin, one of Coe's attorneys, said that  
he is disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision and is 
evaluating options. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, 43, said that in 1979, he kidnapped Cary Ann Medlin near  
her home, raped and sodomized her, then choked her and stabbed her 
in the throat with a pocket knife. The former auto mechanic told an 
FBI agent that he became enraged when the girl kept saying, ``Jesus 
loves you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe recanted before his 1981 trial and his lawyers used an  
insanity defense. The jury took an hour to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers have argued that there was no scientific evidence  
linking Coe to the crime, that the confession was unreliable and 
that evidence pointing to another man had been hidden or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Coe's conviction was set aside by a federal judge who  
said the jury was not given proper guidance. But a federal appeals 
court reinstated the conviction.

<HEADLINE> Devils Get Sutton Back From Caps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils reacquired  
Ken Sutton on Tuesday, getting the defenseman back from the 
Washington Capitals for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutton, claimed by Washington in the NHL Waiver Draft last  
month, becomes the first Devils player to be acquired three 
different times. The 29-year-old first went to New Jersey in a 
trade from the St. Louis Blues in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In five games with New Jersey last season, Sutton had one goal.  
He spent the majority of the season with Albany of the AHL, where 
he was voted the league's top defenseman. In 308 career NHL games, 
Sutton has 22 goals, 69 assists and 291 penalty minutes.

<HEADLINE> Sales Strong for Reagan 'Memoir' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sales remain strong days after the publication  
of ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' but reviews of Edmund 
Morris' controversial book have turned increasingly sour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's flying off the shelves,'' Barnes &AMP; Noble spokeswoman Mary  
Ellen Keating said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dutch'' has dropped from No. 4 to No. 20 on Amazon.com's  
best-seller list, but Internet purchases comprise only 2 percent of 
the market, according to the Book Industry Study Group. In chain 
bookstores, which account for 25 percent of sales, Morris' 
``memoir'' is still a big favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales have been very good and we expect the book to stay  
strong through the holidays,'' said Ann Binkley, a spokeswoman for 
Borders Books &AMP; Music. 
</P>
<P>
	Random House paid a reported $3 million to Morris, winner of the  
Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Theodore Roosevelt, and gave 
``Dutch'' a first printing of more than 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Morris has been attacked by critics for inserting himself  
into the book as a fictional character and by Reagan supporters for 
writing that the president was an ``apparent airhead'' and 
``possessed of no inner warmth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since receiving favorable reviews last week from The New York  
Times and USA Today, ``Dutch'' has been panned several times. 
Joseph Ellis, author of an award-winning biography of Thomas 
Jefferson, called Morris' book ``a scandal and a tragedy.'' 
Reviewing for The Washington Post, Ellis wrote that ``editorial 
integrity has lost another battle to the proverbial bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan historian Lou Cannon, reviewing ``Dutch'' for the Los  
Angeles Times, criticized Morris' tendency ``to rework familiar 
material and present it as original.'' Stanley I. Kutler, author of 
``The Wars of Watergate,'' complained in the Chicago Tribune that 
Morris' ``intrusiveness is self-indulgent, irrelevant and, most of 
all, confusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A notable review came Saturday from The New York Times, in which  
daily book critic Michiko Kakutani contradicted the positive 
assessment given by colleague Christopher Lehmann-Haupt earlier in 
the week. Kakutani described ``Dutch'' as a ``cloying, egocentric 
novel'' and accused Morris of wasting ``a rare opportunity to 
chronicle a sitting president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential biographer Roger Morris, no relation to Edmund  
Morris, said Tuesday that he found the use of a fictional narrator 
``juvenile'' and that the author of ``Dutch'' had let down his 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My quarrel with the book is its shallowness as history. We  
depend on our biographers, especially our presidential biographers, 
to give us the larger historical context,'' said Morris, author of 
works on Presidents Clinton and Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt betrayed. I might have expected this from the dozens of  
lightweights out there who write puff stuff, but Edmund Morris is 
not in that category. He's earned the right to be taken 
seriously.''

<HEADLINE> Health Care Problems Said Y2K Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medicare is warning doctors, hospitals and  
other health-care providers about possible financial consequences 
if the Y2K computer bug catches them unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can't get their bills to us, they just won't get  
paid,'' Dr. Robert A. Berenson, director of Medicare's center for 
health plans and providers, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, hospitals and others are barred by law from upfront  
billing of the 39 million elderly and disabled Americans covered by 
Medicare for medical services. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, providers finding they must switch from filing electronic  
Medicare claims to paper claims because they are unprepared will 
have to wait longer for payment. By law, Medicare must pay bills 
submitted electronically within 14 days, but has 27 days to process 
old-fashioned paper invoices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medicare warning was prompted by new surveys of health-care  
providers that government investigators say suggest many aren't 
ready for the so-called Year 2000 computer problem. That is the 
possibility that when the clock turns to midnight New Year's Eve, 
some older computers, built to recognize only the last two numbers 
in a year number, may mistake the 2000 for 1900 and malfunction or 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some significant gaps that have to be bridged yet,''  
George Grob, the Health and Human Services Department's deputy 
inspector general, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general mailed surveys June 30 to 5,000 providers  
of health care for elderly and disabled Americans covered by 
Medicare, including doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, home-care 
agencies and medical equipment suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than half of the 1,924 caregivers responding said all of  
their biomedical equipment, such as X-ray machines and respirators, 
is Y2K ready. About two-thirds said their billing and 
record-keeping systems are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third said, however, they had not tested information  
exchanges with vendors or bill-processing contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find a great lack of testing, and, in the computer world in  
particular, if you haven't tested, you don't know,'' Grob said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate IG survey of 161 HMOs participating in Medicare,  
85 percent said they are prepared for Y2K. 
</P>
<P>
	The health department, the Clinton administration's Y2K task  
force and congressional auditors previously have raised alarms that 
the medical industry may not be doing enough to address the 
computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups such as the American Hospital Association insist  
providers are making progress and will be ready.

<HEADLINE> Sprint Chairman Waited for Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp. Chairman William T. Esrey,  
a former investment banker, waited patiently as telecommunications 
companies all around him were doing deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's topped them all.  
</P>
<P>
	Esrey dealt his company to MCI WorldCom for $115 billion  
Tuesday, the biggest corporate takeover in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase will enrich both Esrey, who holds ample stock  
options, and the Sprint shareholders handsomely. MCI will pay a 
roughly 25 percent premium over Sprint's stock market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always viewed him as a very seasoned, sharp telecom  
executive with an uncanny ability to create shareholder value,'' 
said Brian Adamik of the Yankee Group in Boston. ``Sprint is a 
great American success story and he is the financial architect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nespola, a former Sprint employee who worked with Esrey  
back in the late 1980s, calls him ``one of the most patient 
executives that I've seen in the industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Esrey, 59, helped build Sprint into the No. 3 long-distance  
company and patiently rode out talks of takeover bids through the 
years. He now becomes chairman of WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Where was he when the largest corporate takeover to date was in  
the works? 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out on my horse in the middle of Colorado, in the middle  
of nowhere,'' said Esrey, an avid athlete, at a New York City news 
conference Tuesday with Bernard J. Ebbers, president and chief 
executive of MCI WorldCom. ``Bernie and I talked it all out. I was 
on an Iridium phone, and it does work,'' he joked about the 
satellite phone company, currently reorganizing in bankruptcy 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Esrey joined Sprint, then known as United Telecommunications, in  
1980 as executive vice president of corporate planning. In January 
1982, he became president of United Telecom Communications, a 
Sprint subsidiary, directing efforts that resulted in the decision 
to construct the first all-digital, fiber-optic network. He became 
executive vice president and CFO of Sprint in January 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Esrey was a managing director of the investment bank  
Dillon, Read &AMP; Co. from 1970-1979. He also held management 
positions with AT&AMP;T and New York Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	One could say he had the phone business in his blood. His late  
father, Alexander, rose through the ranks at AT&AMP;T for 44 years, 
retiring in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	In laid-back suburban Kansas City, where Sprint is based, Esrey  
has a low-key profile. Some people know him and Sprint better as 
supporters of civic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Lemke, chairman of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of  
Commerce cited Sprint's establishment of a telemarketing center to 
provide jobs to help people in a welfare-to-work program. ``I think 
that's an indicator of a commitment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tellabs To Create 2,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISLE, Ill. (AP) -- Tellabs, a Lisle-based telecommunications  
company, announced plans Tuesday for a $75-million expansion in 
Naperville that will include a new office facility and the creation 
of up to 2,300 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion along Illinois' high-tech corridor will be  
supported by infrastructure grants and tax credits from state 
government and the city of Naperville worth up to $30 million over 
20 years, said Brian Reardon, of the state Department of Commerce 
and Community Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellabs, which designs, manufactures and markets  
telecommunications equipment, has more than doubled its size in the 
last five years. It now has 6,200 employees working in Naperville, 
Lisle and Bolingbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	The new 800,000-square-foot facility proposed for a 55-acre  
Naperville site will probably serve as a new corporate 
headquarters, said Steve Bauer, a Tellabs spokesman. Construction 
is expected to begin in the spring, with an expected completion 
date in late summer 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the jobs created will be at the headquarters, about half  
in research and design, Bauer said. The rest of the jobs will 
probably be in marketing, sales and administration.

<HEADLINE> Salon Hair-Washing May Harm Necks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Ouch! Leaning your head back over a hair  
salon sink for a shampoo could cause far more than fleeting 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark say  
people with neck problems who frequently visit the beauty parlor 
risk developing a painful neck condition. They have dubbed it Salon 
Sink Radiculopathy, or injury to nerve roots going from the spinal 
cord to extremities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a newly recognized phenomenon,'' Dr. Patrick Foye said  
Tuesday. It is a risk mainly for people with problems such as 
arthritis or neck injuries from traffic, work or sports accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers previously have reported people suffering  
strokes at hair salons when they lean back for a shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts recommend padding the sink edge with towels, having your  
hair washed face down -- or washing your hair at home before a visit 
to the salon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pain specialists at the New Jersey school have spotted nearly a  
dozen patients with the problem since first diagnosing it several 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't recommend having your hair washed in a beauty salon  
to anyone,'' said one patient, 50-year-old Michael Werner of 
Bloomfield. He said he suffered so much pain a day after getting 
his hair washed before a haircut six months ago that he couldn't 
move his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Mable Graham, a 60-year-old South Plainfield billing clerk who  
developed a pinched neck nerve from a computer-related work injury, 
said one of her twice-a-month beauty parlor visits worsened the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was amazed to know that just lying in a chair in a beauty  
parlor could cause these kinds of problems,'' she said. ``I noticed 
when I picked my head up out of the sink, the pain was more 
severe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salon-sink nerve injury generally causes pain radiating from the  
neck down one or both arms. It is usually treatable with medication 
and therapy, but surgery may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Faye Chiou-Tan, assistant chief of physical medicine and  
rehabilitation at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said 
doctors should warn patients with pinched nerves that leaning their 
heads back in a hair salon sink can worsen their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patients need to advocate for themselves and say, `I'm  
serious. Don't put me in this position,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Cole, medical director of the Spine Center at  
Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Wash., said such nerve-root injuries 
can occur when the neck is tilted so far back that it further 
compresses the narrow openings in the spinal cord through which 
nerves pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Poor posture and computer work is usually the culprit,'' said  
Cole, but he has treated two women for salon-sink injuries.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Bombing Suspect Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A man wanted in a series of bombings last year  
in Northern California -- including a blast at a police chief's 
house -- was arrested Tuesday at his suburban San Diego home, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodney Blach, 53, was wanted on a warrant on 11 charges,  
including attempted murder, using a destructive device to murder 
and a using destructive device to terrorize. He was being held 
without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from bombings last year in Fremont, about 30  
miles southeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Blach was arrested as he walked out of his home in the upscale  
Rancho Penasquitos neighborhood, where he has lived for a year. 
Police confiscated a two loaded weapons -- a semiautomatic handgun 
and a rifle -- and a bulletproof vest. No explosives were found in 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Blach has been a suspect since four bombings  
and two attempted bombings in the peaceful, scenic city of Fremont, 
including an explosion at Fremont Police Chief Craig Steckler's 
home. The blast ripped a 10-foot-wide hole in the roof and set the 
front porch on fire. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	That same afternoon, Steckler's predecessor, Councilman Bob  
Wasserman, found an explosive in a brown paper bag on the walkway 
leading to his front door. It was safely disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The other explosives were three pipe bombs planted in newly  
constructed homes in the upscale Mission Heights neighborhood. Two 
exploded and severely damaged the homes. The other bomb was 
detonated by police. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth bomb went off in backpack left hanging on a water tank  
above the same neighborhood. The tank was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Blach lived in the neighborhood, within a mile of where the  
bombs were planted, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox, Indians To Renew Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Put aside for a moment the fact that the  
Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox are meeting for the third time 
in five Octobers and consider why this might be the year's juiciest 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	There is:  
</P>
<P>
	--Pedro Martinez, baseball's best pitcher, trying to slow an  
Indians lineup that scored more than 1,000 runs in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bad blood stemming from two bench-clearing brawls in April when  
the team's exchanged beanballs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Boston manager Jimy Williams accusing the Indians of stealing  
signs last month by using a camera above the center-field wall at 
Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Need more? How about that both teams are trying to finally bring  
a World Series trophy to cities convinced that their teams are 
cursed? 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have a good series on our hands,'' Boston shortstop  
Nomar Garciaparra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians and Red Sox don't particularly like each other, and  
this week they'll renew their sometimes testy rivalry in the 
postseason when their best-of-5 AL division series starts Wednesday 
night at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox will start Martinez (23-4) in Game 1 against the  
Indians, who are expected to counter with their ace, Bartolo Colon 
(18-5). Game 2 is Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The series seems too close to call. As Cleveland coasted into  
October, Boston was driving hard to secure the wild-card berth and 
make a run at AL East champ New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps an impartial outsider would be best to make a  
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Boston as a sleeper,'' said Toronto's David Wells, who  
beat the Indians on Sunday. ``They got Pedro. Pedro's the man this 
year. It's just something I feel. That's my pick. Boston. They've 
had all those years without winning it. Maybe this is their year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's Cleveland's year, too. Even the prospect of facing  
Martinez, 4-0 against them in two years, doesn't seem to concern 
the Indians, who have had to overcome injuries all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could win three straight, that would be great, but  
that's going to be real hard,'' Indians catcher Sandy Alomar said. 
``Game 1 is always important. If you can knock out their pitcher 
right away, that's good. Every game counts, though. We need to win 
three. Whatever three, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the first one has been Cleveland's biggest problem the  
past few Octobers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have lost eight straight playoff openers, last  
winning a Game 1 in 1995 when they beat the Red Sox in 13 innings. 
Last year, Martinez and the Red Sox got off to a great start, 
winning the opener 11-3 before the Indians won three straight to 
advance to the ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez went 2-0 against the Indians during the '99 regular  
season, twice beating Colon in tight games. In his last start at 
Cleveland, Martinez struck out 14 in seven innings, but got a 
no-decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to beat Pedro,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel said.  
``We have to show we can beat him. We beat him before and we have 
to do that again. The No. 1 game is always important to win. It 
doesn't mean anything if we go the full five games or seven games. 
It is just the first step. You want the first step, but it is more 
important to take the last step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 1 pitching matchup is but one of a number of  
interesting subplots in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	When the teams played at Fenway Park in April, a series of  
brushback pitches, the first by Cleveland's Jaret Wright, led to 
two bench-clearing incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, during Boston's most recent visit to Cleveland last month,  
Williams requested that a center-field camera at Jacobs Field be 
covered up. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and several of Boston's players accused the Indians of  
using the camera to steal signs. The Indians found the charge 
amusing but the AL took it seriously enough to ask Cleveland to 
keep the camera covered and to remove a video monitor behind their 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, for one, says what has happened between the teams before  
October is already ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that stuff with Jaret and them earlier this season is  
over,'' Alomar said. ``It was over back then. Now it is time to 
play postseason baseball. The bottom line is we have to eliminate 
mistakes and win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox got a scare last week when Garciaparra, the AL's  
leading hitter and an Indians killer this season, returned to 
Boston to have his injured right wrist examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, hit by a pitch Sept. 25, sat out the Red Sox final  
two regular-season games, but said he was set for Wednesday's 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah,'' he said. ``I'll be ready.''  
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra led the AL with a .357 average, but he was even  
tougher on the Indians, batting .451 with five homers and 17 RBIs 
in 12 games to help the Red Sox win the season series 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garciaparra knows regular-season records mean nothing now,  
especially against a team with as much postseason experience as the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the postseason, and we know what they can do,''  
he said. ``They definitely have a lot of veterans, and they've been 
in the postseason before. They know how to win. We played them last 
year and they knocked us out. Hopefully, we can turn it around this 
year. We know we've got a good series on our hands.''

<HEADLINE> Charlotte WNBA Seeks Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The WNBA is close to completing talks  
aimed at locking the Charlotte Sting into a long-term relationship 
to stay in the city, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the midst of negotiating a new deal for the Sting. It  
will be for more than one year,'' Sam Russo, the team's executive 
vice president of business, said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``We will have the Sting in Charlotte for an 
extended period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some media reports over the summer questioned whether the  
franchise, a charter member of the WNBA, had a future in Charlotte 
because of sagging attendance. WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman said 
in late July that such reports were premature and that the league 
preferred to keep a team in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as Charlotte goes, the WNBA operating committees are  
having discussions and working out the specifics of the agreement 
right now,'' league spokesman Mark Pray said Monday. He said there 
was no specific timetable established to conclude talks that would 
set up the Sting to play in the WNBA for a fourth year and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte was among the league leaders in attendance its first  
two seasons, but the Sting got off to a slow start this year, 
struggling to stay near the .500 mark. Charlotte rallied in the 
final half of the season, made the playoffs for the third time in 
as many years and wound up averaging 7,081 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Russo said the WNBA would work with the Sting to try to devise  
marketing strategies to increase crowds at the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our organization has put in a lot of hours and effort to make  
this successful,'' Russo said. ``So having the opportunity to 
continue down the road with it is gratifying. It would have been a 
shame if we could not go down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sting have traditionally been strong at attracting family  
crowds -- one or two parents taking their children to games. Where 
the Sting want to improve is in drawing more support from 
Charlotte's substantial corporate community, Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every market has its little nuances that we still have to work  
on in Charlotte. We haven't gotten there yet,'' he said. ``But I 
don't believe it's a reason to give up on the market, and I think 
the WNBA realizes that this is a good market. And once we work 
together to find out what the real problems are and how we can 
rectify them, I think we'll be able to turn this market around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA, which is to add expansion franchises next  
season in Indianapolis, Miami, Portland and Seattle, has focused on 
marketing the overall league in its first three seasons. The league 
plans to expand its marketing approach to concentrate on helping 
individual franchises address local attendance issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to have all the same teams,'' Pray said. ``We don't  
have any plans to relocate any teams.''

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Won't Test Sterile Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Monsanto Co., one of the giants in  
agribusiness, has promised not to experiment with biotechnology 
that leaves seeds sterile -- a possibility that has raised fears 
among critics of gene manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto Chairman Robert B. Shapiro said concerns have made it  
important to stress his commitment against the practice of 
manipulating three genes to make a seed good for only one planting 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments were contained in a letter sent to Gordon Conway,  
president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which says gene-altered 
crops can help reduce world hunger but opposes the idea of sterile 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Conway called Monsanto's decision a first step in  
making ``the fruits of plant biotechnology'' available to poor 
farmers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Producing crops with infertile seeds -- dubbed the ``terminator''  
technology by critics -- could prove very valuable to 
agribusinesses, which already make genetically altered seeds 
resistant to insects and herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents fear companies could begin offering those traits only  
in sterile seeds, which would require farmers to buy them each year 
rather than replanting seeds gathered from mature crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto has been criticized over the issue even though it  
didn't develop the technology, hasn't done research on making 
sterile seeds and doesn't expect sterile seeds to become a 
commercial prospect for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The terminator technology was developed by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture and Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co., the world's largest 
cotton seed company. 
</P>
<P>
	It was patented in 1998, two months before Monsanto offered to  
buy Delta, a bid awaiting antitrust review by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said Monday that it would continue trying to commercialize  
the seed sterilization technology based on its agreement with the 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system offers valuable uses for breeding and scientific  
purposes, as well as beneficial environmental qualities,'' said 
Harry Collins, Delta's vice president of technology transfer. He 
said the technology has been ``misrepresented'' by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto spokeswoman Scarlett Foster said the St. Louis-based  
company still may use sterile seed technology in internal research, 
but will make sure no commercial products are infertile. She told 
The New York Times that it also would refuse to license the 
USDA-Delta project if the cotton seed company is acquired.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Trying To Lure Students / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- When the agriculture instructor at Richland  
Community College asked 2,000 high school students on a field day 
who was interested in a career in agriculture, only one raised his 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, 'Well, that's driving a tractor,''' instructor Dan  
Dunphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. employers seek to fill about 48,000 jobs each year in food  
and agricultural sciences, but only 46,000 graduates have training 
or education specifically in those areas, according to a U.S. 
Agriculture Department study. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, agriculture and closely related jobs employ 1.5  
million people. 
</P>
<P>
	But fewer students have been entering agriculture as a career  
because they view it as a dying or backward occupation, according 
to farm agencies and educators like Dunphy. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, a growing number of programs are directed at  
showing students that agriculture is more than just driving a 
tractor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is chemistry, satellite communications, marketing  
and economics, in addition to traditional farming,'' Dunphy said. 
``There is still a big demand for ag jobs, and the variety is so 
vast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer children grow up on farms today, leading to a decline in  
interest in agricultural careers, according to Jay Runner, 
coordinator of a state program called Facilitating Coordination in 
Agriculture Education. 
</P>
<P>
	``The declining agricultural population base has left most  
people ignorant about where their food and fiber comes from,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Runner's program has a $2 million state-funded budget, five  
field advisers and partnerships with the Illinois Farm Bureau, 
University of Illinois Extension and Soil and Water Conservation 
districts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Runner said 17,000 students are now in high school agriculture  
programs, a 46 percent increase from seven years ago. Most are 
urban residents, and 30 percent are female. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agriculture curriculum has a heavy emphasis on science,  
horticulture, finance and computer technology -- the more modern 
applications of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Macon County Farm Bureau recently stepped up its ``Ag in the  
Classroom'' program to expose grade school students to 
opportunities in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Information director Lisa Cobb, who has shown students how to  
make a plastic-like material out of corn starch and homemade ice 
cream, said even children in traditional farming communities seem 
to be out of touch with the importance of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know crops are used for food, but they don't realize all  
the different products that are made,'' Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson Naylor, 22, graduated in May from the business  
administration program at Millikin University. As an intern, he 
handled high-tech equipment and computer accounting programs for 
the Macon office of Corn Belt FS, a farm supply company. He was 
hired immediately upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	Naylor said his fellow students understood why he wanted to go  
into agriculture, but only because they knew he grew up on a farm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an appreciation of farming,'' he said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. introduced its latest  
software Tuesday, eyeing a future where wireless phones and 
hand-held organizers are as popular as computers for reaching the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL 5.0 software will let users adapt such features as a new  
interactive calendar to portable devices, which are starting to hit 
the market for Net use. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Case, chairman and chief executive officer of AOL, said he  
wants to move away from tying AOL to any one device such as the 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You stop thinking about AOL as a screen-based, PC-based,  
telephone-based service and start thinking of it as a set of 
capabilities imbedded throughout your life,'' he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Case envisioned a world in which subscribers can access e-mail  
and other features ``no matter where you are, no matter what you 
are doing, no matter what device is near you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to phones, pagers and organizers, AOL plans to offer  
its service through the television set. If subscribers spend more 
time online, then the company could boost rates for online ads and 
get commissions from shopping sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the features will be available for some devices  
initially, AOL said. Services will be rolled out in the next 
several months and years as those devices become more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with the Internet research firm  
Jupiter Communications, cited portable devices as a largely 
untapped market in which the first suppliers have the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's scrambling to figure out how users will interact in  
these devices,'' she said. ``It's becoming hypercompetitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, online retail giant Amazon.com announced that  
it will sell its products through new wireless devices, including 
the Palm VII hand-held device that 3Com Corp. released nationwide 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Case said the success of laptop computers points to a high  
demand for mobility. And as new devices become more popular, AOL 
wants to serve their users. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's calendar feature allows users to transfer data such as  
appointments or birthdays from computers to hand-held organizers. 
Users can then exchange the information with other portable 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-based calendars are often impractical because users  
must be at a computer to find out where they need to be. AOL hopes 
to get around that by adapting its system for portable devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The new software offers more comprehensive searching and access  
to recently deleted e-mail. AOL will also begin to let users check 
their e-mail by telephone -- with an electronic voice ``reading'' 
each message. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is also launching nationwide a digital photo service it runs  
with Eastman Kodak Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``You've Got Pictures'' service, tested in a few cities this  
past summer, allows users to send electronic copies of pictures to 
AOL accounts. From those accounts, consumers can arrange photos in 
online albums, send them as e-mail to friends and family, or order 
reprints and enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL 5.0 will also recognize how computers connect to AOL so that  
those using higher-speed connections could get more video clips and 
other items that do not work as well at regular speeds. Such 
broadband access is only beginning to enter the home market. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is the world's largest Internet service provider, with more  
than 18 million subscribers.

<HEADLINE> West Nile-Like Virus Found in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Four dead crows found in New Jersey tested  
positive for the West Nile-like virus believed responsible for the 
deaths of at least five people in the New York City metropolitan 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The state health department said Monday this is the first time  
the virus has been identified in New Jersey. The crows were found 
in Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Union counties in the northern part 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is believed to be transmitted by mosquitoes that bit  
infected birds. New York City, Long Island, New Jersey and 
Connecticut have been spraying pesticides to kill as many 
mosquitoes as possible before the first winter chills. Scientists 
are also concerned the virus will move south as birds migrate this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been five confirmed deaths and several dozen cases of  
infection in the New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey Health Commissioner Christine Grant said residents  
should take precautions against mosquito bites but should not be 
``unduly concerned'' by the test results. There have been no 
reports of New Jersey residents being infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to think that in fact we will see cases in  
New Jersey residents,'' Grant said. ``Diseases like this can have a 
hot spot, a fairly localized outbreak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Centers for Disease and Control Prevention have  
classified the ailment as a West Nile-like fever, a virus never 
before seen in the Western Hemisphere. It is called West 
Nile-''like'' because scientists have not yet identified it with 
certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials initially thought the virus was the more  
dangerous St. Louis encephalitis. Symptoms of both -- fever and 
headache -- are similar, but are generally milder with the West Nile 
virus. In rare cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders 
and death.

<HEADLINE> JJ Faults Marino in Loss To Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Don Shula used to respond to criticism of Dan  
Marino by saying if the Miami Dolphins' biggest concern was their 
quarterback, the team was in terrific shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Times change. Shula is no longer the coach, and Marino is no  
longer beyond criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson delivered perhaps the harshest coaching critique  
of Marino's career Tuesday, criticizing his play in a 23-18 loss 
Monday night to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said Marino often threw to the wrong receiver, hurried  
some passes and held on to the ball too long on a costly fumble. 
The result was three turnovers, just one third-down conversion in 
14 chances and a defeat that dropped Miami to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino was at fault on all three turnovers, Johnson said, but  
pass protection breakdowns contributed to the quarterback's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got to make some better decisions,'' Johnson said.  
``When he's getting banged around, he made some poor decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the decisions a 17-year veteran is expected to  
make, Johnson said, ``We're going down an avenue I don't want to go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the message was clear: Marino needs to play better. He was  
22-for-44 for 251 yards with one touchdown, two interceptions and 
two sacks, his first of the season. The Dolphins' only TD came on a 
4-yard drive following a 93-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's comments were even harsher than in 1997, when he said  
following the season opener that he considered benching Marino. The 
latest criticism will likely strain the sometimes testy 
relationship between player and coach, but that is clearly not 
Johnson's concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's players had Tuesday off, and Marino was unavailable for  
comment. Following the game, he had a terse response when asked to 
assess his play. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you want to know about it?'' he said. ``If you lose,  
it's bad, and if you win, it's good. That's how I assess it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's productivity has declined since a strong showing in the  
Dolphins' season-opening victory at Denver. In a 19-16 victory over 
Arizona, he threw two interceptions, and Miami scored just one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the Dolphins must not allow Marino to get hit, and  
the coach implied that his 38-year-old quarterback's poor mobility 
has hamstrung the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can go maximum protection with Dan and only have three  
receivers, like we did with Denver,'' Johnson said. ``But people 
figure that out pretty soon and start doubling your receivers, so 
you've got no place to throw. You put five receivers out, and he's 
going to get hit. If he gets hit, his play drops down 
significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge of protecting Marino will be compounded Sunday at  
Indianapolis (2-1), because tackle Richmond Webb bruised his left 
knee against Buffalo and is expected to be sidelined a couple of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The pivotal play Monday was Gabe Northern's 59-yard touchdown  
return of a Marino fumble, putting the Bills ahead to stay in the 
second quarter. Johnson said Marino was partly to blame for the 
fumble, which occurred when he was blindsided on a third-down 
blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan's got to release the ball,'' Johnson said. ``You dump it  
to the fullback. He held onto it a little bit long.''

<HEADLINE> Historic Launch Pad Being Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- When the countdown reaches zero next  
week at historic Launch Complex 41, the entire pad will be blasted 
to pieces -- deliberately, as part of a modernization project. 
</P>
<P>
	In a business where even the word ``blastoff'' touches a nerve  
(rocket scientists prefer ``liftoff''), the very idea was 
unsettling, especially for the safety officers at the Air Force 
station where the pad is located. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spend their lifetimes trying to make sure we don't blow  
things on the pad,'' said Adrian Laffitte, a Lockheed Martin Corp. 
launch manager. ``They went, `Hel-lo, are you guys on something 
here?' But once we explained the process, then they said, `Hey, 
that sort of makes sense.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Blowing up the 34-year-old pad that launched innumerable spy  
satellites as well as NASA's Viking spacecraft to Mars and Voyager 
probes to the outer planets is the quickest, cheapest way for 
Lockheed Martin to renovate the place for its new line of Atlas V 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	It also happens to be the most fun. Next Thursday's demolition --  
the first at Cape Canaveral in 23 years -- is turning into a party 
and charity fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of workers are expected to gather a safe 2,500 feet  
away to watch the two steel launch towers come tumbling down within 
milliseconds of each other. Hundreds if not thousands of others at 
Cape Canaveral Air Station and NASA's adjacent Kennedy Space Center 
will almost certainly stop wherever they are to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	A countdown will precede the 10 a.m. demolition.  
</P>
<P>
	``5-4-3-2-1 and then figure out what the right word is,'' said  
Laffitte, laughing. ``How about boom? 3-2-1-boom, kaboom. I'm 
trying to think what Wile E. Coyote said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the precise moment the 180 pounds of explosives are  
detonated, the winner of a Demolish-the-Pad raffle will push a 
make-believe plunger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of $5 raffle tickets have already been sold. Also going  
like speeding rockets: $10 T-shirts with the words ``Blasting Out 
of the Past'' and a picture of a rodent pushing a detonator. 
(Launch pad workers call themselves ``pad rats.'') The money will 
go to needy families at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a launch pad was deliberately blown up, in 1976,  
the Army was called in to do the job. Launch Complex 14 -- John 
Glenn's pad -- had become too dangerous, and the Air Force lacked 
the money to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	The much larger Launch Complex 41 will be brought down by  
demolition experts hired by Lockheed Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1965, Complex 41 was the starting point for 27 Titan  
flights, most of them military. The last two, in August 1998 and 
April 1999, ended in failure: one rocket blew up seconds after 
liftoff; the other dumped a satellite in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, demolition workers used blowtorches to weaken the  
legs of the 200-foot umbilical tower, from which propellants once 
flowed to the rockets. The 300-foot mobile service tower, which 
shielded the rockets until just before liftoff, stands 500 feet 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The towers won't be needed for Lockheed Martin's powerful Atlas  
V, which will be transported from a still-unfinished building to 
the pad a mere 12 hours before liftoff, a process intended to speed 
up launches. The first flight is set for 2001. The Atlas V also 
will soar from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California; an old 
launch pad there will be razed the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	Laffitte figures it will take 60 seconds for the two towers at  
Complex 41 to fall and a month for the 7 million pounds of steel to 
be hauled away for recycling. To dismantle everything piece by 
piece, the traditional method, would have taken three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions are mixed going into the countdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a complex that has certainly seen a lot of launches, has  
meant a lot to the space program of this nation,'' said Ken 
Dinally, an explosives safety manager at Cape Canaveral Air 
Station. ``The optimistic way of looking at it, though, is it's 
progress.''

<HEADLINE> Bilingual Education Foe Wants Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Unz, the software entrepreneur who  
helped pay for the campaign that ended most bilingual education in 
California, will seek the Republican nomination for Democratic Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Unz, 38, said Tuesday that he will focus on dismantling  
bilingual education nationally and reforming a campaign finance 
system he called corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	His advantages include a personal fortune from the software  
industry and name recognition. Unz bankrolled a substantial part of 
the campaign last year for Proposition 227, which repealed 
bilingual education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unz is also sponsoring a campaign finance reform initiative on  
the March ballot. He financed his own unsuccessful campaign against 
incumbent Pete Wilson for the Republican nomination for governor in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feinstein so far has no opposition for the Democratic  
nomination in the March 7 primary. San Diego County Supervisor Bill 
Horn and state Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside are also expected to 
run for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Unz opposed the anti-illegal immigrant measure  
Proposition 187, which most Republicans supported. But in 1996, he 
backed Proposition 209, which ended state-sponsored affirmative 
action.

<HEADLINE> Unbeaten Cowboys Happy, Restrained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Maybe if the Dallas Cowboys were 6-0 or  
10-0 they would be a little excited. Winning their first three 
games sure hasn't done it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't sense that anybody is thinking we're world-beaters,''  
owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday. ``I don't see anybody feeling it's 
automatic when we walk out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys picked a strange time to become humble because they  
do have things to crow about. A month into the season, Dallas is 
the only reigning division winner alone in first place and one of 
three undefeated teams in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we haven't played any great teams yet,'' said Deion  
Sanders, an All-Pro cornerback and normally an all-world talker. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing the Cowboys downplay their success can be added to list  
of bizarre events this season, joining winless Super Bowl teams and 
an undefeated team led by a former Arena League quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The attitude change stems from coach Chan Gailey. Although he's  
a self-professed eternal optimist, he doesn't believe in 
I-told-you-sos when things go his way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I believe we're able to keep an even keel about  
things,'' Gailey said. ``That's part of the process of being able 
to play a 16-game season. You have to maintain a balance in the way 
you look at things. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're never as good as they say and you're never as bad as  
they say. We've got enough veteran leaders who understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The credit for Dallas' early winning streak gets spread through  
the lockerroom. The offense pulled out a 41-35 overtime victory 
over Washington, then the defense shined in a 24-7 victory over 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	This past Sunday, the Cowboys had three offensive touchdowns and  
two from their defense in routing Arizona 35-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up is winless Philadelphia, providing Dallas a great chance  
to be 4-0 for the first time since 1995, its last Super Bowl 
championship season. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory over the New York Giants the following Monday night  
would make Dallas 5-0 for the first time since the 1983 team won 
its first seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the make of this team,'' running back Emmitt Smith  
said. ``I think the guys we brought in to make plays and the guys 
we have drafted have great attitudes. But we have to improve every 
week to keep this roll going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with injuries could be the determining factor.  
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Cowboys have done fine in two games without fullback  
Daryl Johnston, who is out the rest of the year with a neck injury, 
and over the last six quarters without Erik Williams and Everett 
McIver, their right-side starters on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams should be back Sunday, but McIver probably won't.  
Neither will his top backup, Tony Hutson, who was put on injured 
reserve Tuesday because of a knee injury. That means Tom Myslinski, 
who was signed last week, is likely to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have other injuries, other tough times,''  
Gailey said. ``We've got to learn to handle that. The key is to win 
through those tough times as well and that's what we've been able 
to do.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Revokes Virginia Scholarship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The NCAA revoked a basketball  
scholarship from Virginia for the 2000-01 season because of 
recruiting infractions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA deemed the violations secondary, meaning they provided  
a limited recruiting or competitive advantage because they occurred 
after the prospect had signed letters of intent to attend Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said Tuesday a former head coach arranged for a  
university basketball supporter to rent an apartment to a prospect 
in early 1996. The NCAA and the university would not identify the 
coach and prospect, but Jeff Jones was head coach at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement included a $50 deposit and monthly rent of $200.  
However, rent was not paid for the short duration of the 
arrangement, the NCAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another supporter of Virginia athletics provided the prospect  
with legal expenses, impermissible transportation, lodging, meals, 
spending money and other benefits totaling about $14,000, the NCAA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The university itself reported two other violations. Two coaches  
were transported in the personal airplane of a university 
basketball supporter to high school basketball games. The 
transportation was provided as a donation to the university but it 
was not properly documented as such. The owner of the plane also 
had recruiting contacts with four prospective players during their 
official visits to the university in violation of NCAA rules, the 
NCAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the loss of one scholarship, Virginia must reduce  
the number of official player visits during the current academic 
year from 12 to nine. 
</P>
<P>
	U.Va. athletic director Terry Holland placed part of the blame  
on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acknowledge that serious mistakes were made and that the  
responsibility for those mistakes rests, not merely with our former 
basketball coaches, but with officials at all levels of the 
Department of Athletics, myself included,'' Holland said in a 
letter to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has taken action to avoid future violations.

<HEADLINE> Vein Makes Bypasses Last Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Harvard Medical School researchers have  
genetically altered the blood vessel used in heart bypass surgery 
in a quest to keep it from reclogging, and they said Tuesday the 
first few patients treated have shown a significantly lower 
incidence of relapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure of heart bypass surgery is a big problem: Up to 30  
percent of bypass patients have their heart arteries reclog badly 
in just a year. Few patients survive 10 years without needing 
retreatment, and high-risk patients -- such as those who already 
have undergone repeat surgery -- reclog at even greater rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is how to make bypasses last longer.  
</P>
<P>
	To do a bypass, surgeons typically remove a vein from the leg  
and implant it around the original clogged heart artery. 
</P>
<P>
	But a vein, which has thinner walls than an artery, is not  
accustomed to the intense pressure of blood pounding that an artery 
is. So the vein reacts in shock, causing rapid growth of cells 
against the vessel wall that result in a flabby, dangerous 
thickening. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard researcher Dr. Victor Dzau has genetically manipulated  
this vein to look and act more like a trim, muscular artery. 
</P>
<P>
	He removes the vein from a patient's leg and bathes it in a  
solution containing a short piece of DNA. This DNA binds to, or 
soaks up, a protein that otherwise would switch on the gene 
responsible for driving the cell growth that reclogs so many bypass 
patients' vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: The bypass graft is ``more muscular, what I call the  
Schwarzenegger effect,'' he told a seminar Tuesday. ``It begins to 
look more like an artery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first experiment at Brigham &AMP; Women's Hospital in Boston,  
17 high-risk patients had their vein bathed in the DNA solution for 
about 10 minutes before continuing bypass surgery. Another 16 
patients had regular bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, more than 60 percent of the high-risk patients who  
had traditional bypass operations had failed -- they had undergone 
repeat surgery or were suffering severe reclogging. Just over 20 
percent of patients who received the genetically altered bypass had 
failed, Dzau said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dzau could give no further details of the study, which has not  
yet been published in a medical journal. Fellow heart experts have 
not yet seen his results, which he will present next month at an 
American Heart Association meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dzau stressed that while highly promising, the study was too  
small to be sure of the technique's effectiveness. ``It may be a 
fluke,'' he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he has won Food and Drug Administration permission for a  
2,000-patient study. The study, to be performed at several 
hospitals around the country, should begin soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dzau said his study did show the experiment was safe. The  
genetic manipulation all takes place while the vein is outside of 
the patient's body, providing further reassurance of its safety, he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seek Vote on Wage Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats are circulating a petition  
intended to force a floor vote on a bill to increase the minimum 
wage by $1 over two years. Republicans insist it can't be done 
without pro-business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will have a proposal that will have broad  
bipartisan support,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., part of a group 
of lawmakers designing the GOP plan. ``We want to increase 
take-home pay for those at the bottom of the ladder while not 
punishing the businesses that create their jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats accused the GOP of stalling on a measure to raise  
the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour and began circulating 
a document Tuesday known as a ``discharge petition'' that would 
force House floor action if at least 218 members sign on. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Americans are putting in overtime, Republicans in  
Congress are wasting time,'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, 
the second-ranking Democrat in the House. ``It shouldn't take a 
discharge petition for Congress to consider this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Democrats don't expect enough Republicans to sign the  
petition and force floor action, it could turn up political heat 
for the GOP to act -- particularly moderates with large blue-collar 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Refusing to provide for a decent living wage is part of this  
Republican Congress' pattern of contempt for working families,'' 
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans concede that the minimum wage bill would pass if it  
got to a floor vote. Instead of simply handing Democrats one of 
their signature issues, Republicans want to put their stamp on it 
with a tax package filled with business sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
	``A minimum wage vote this year gives you an opportunity to give  
some small-business tax relief this year,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, 
R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The major tax issue to be decided is whether to reduce or begin  
to phase out the estate tax, a top priority for small business 
owners. A gradual repeal of the estate tax was part of the 10-year, 
$792 billion tax cut vetoed by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Other likely candidates include immediate 100 percent  
deductibility for insurance premiums paid by the self-employed, an 
increase in the deduction for business meals, several provisions 
expanding pensions and an increase from $19,000 to $30,000 in the 
limit on the amount businesses can deduct for certain expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel said most Democrats would oppose the tax package if it  
spends part of the projected budget surplus, just as they opposed 
the big GOP tax cut and smaller tax reductions. Clinton and the 
Democrats say the surplus should first go to shore up Social 
Security and Medicare and to ensure adequate spending on important 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting against a minimum wage increase coupled with the GOP tax  
package might be politically painful for many Democrats, but Rangel 
said they would stick to their position that tax cuts must be paid 
for in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you set a principle and you believe in it, you've got to be  
consistent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Majority Leader Trent Lott said he expects a  
minimum wage increase eventually to come to a vote in this session 
of Congress. But he said he has resisted scheduling one this year 
because Democrats want to attach numerous unrelated amendments on 
issues such as gun control and farm assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's totally irresponsible, and I'm not going to  
make it easier for them,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say they don't intend to weigh the bill down in the  
Senate and fault Lott for not bringing the bill to the floor. Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Tuesday that he would ``take 
advantage of every opportunity'' to attach the minimum wage measure 
to other bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't have a minimum wage vote this year, Republicans  
will have to answer to the American people,'' said Kennedy, top 
Democrat on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.

<HEADLINE> Mets Fly to Phoenix To Face D-Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- With the smell of champagne probably still in  
their hair, the New York Mets flew to Phoenix to face the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and one of the game's most intimidating pitchers, 
Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets celebrated as if they'd won the World Series after  
their 5-0 victory over Cincinnati in Monday night's wild-card 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a good, fun feeling on our flight to Phoenix,'' said  
Al Leiter, the Mets' hero. ``Hopefully we can do some damage down 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine, who will make his first postseason  
appearance, said that the way this team came back from the edge of 
oblivion, bouncing back to play tonight should be a piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone questions what this team can do,'' he said, ``I'd  
like to hold you at bay. They've answered the bell. They've taken 
shots to the body and shots below the belt and come out swinging 
and won the title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, at least they've won a spot in the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, reliever John Franco said, the pressure is gone.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a weight off our shoulders,'' he said. ``Last week, we  
were at the bottom of the barrel, the bottom of the hill. Now we've 
got a second life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York will start Masato Yoshii, who hopes things go a lot  
better against Johnson than they did when the two faced off on May 
26 in New York. In that game, Yoshii was shelled for seven runs in 
2 2-3 innings. Among the eight hits he surrendered were two by 
Johnson, including a two-out RBI single that knocked Yoshii out of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, meanwhile, struck out 10 in eight innings in a 10-1  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is the playoffs, where Johnson has had more than his  
fair share of misfortune. His five consecutive postseason losses 
tie a major league record. 
</P>
<P>
	Those losses, like his 17-9 record this year, hardly reflect how  
well he's pitched. Johnson has a 3.41 ERA to go with his 2-5 
playoff record. So he sees no need to defend himself as he prepares 
to pitch in Arizona's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the postseason, I've pitched pretty well,''  
Johnson said. ``It's not like I've been a total flop. People just 
look at the numbers and they want wins, and that's all I want. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than probably anybody in the clubhouse on the day I  
pitch, that's all I want to do is win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other pitchers to lose five postseason games in a row  
are Joe Bush from 1914-23 and Doyle Alexander from 1973-87. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson seems poised to end his losing streak. He is coming off  
a season in which he struck out a career-best 364, fourth-most in 
baseball history. He pitched a career-high 271 2-3 innings and led 
the NL with a 2.48 ERA. Only the inability of his team to score 
runs for him, including an amazing four-game stretch when he was 
0-4 with a 1.41 ERA, but Arizona failed to score a single run, 
prevented him from amassing a Pedro Martinez-like win-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm coming off the best year of my career, and I want  
to take that into the postseason and be extremely focused,'' 
Johnson said. ``Much like the regular season, I'll lay it all on 
the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after his midseason trade from Seattle to Houston,  
Johnson was 0-2 in the divisional series against San Diego. In the 
opener, he pitched eight strong innings, but lost 2-1 to Kevin 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot is riding on that first game,'' Johnson said. ``I can  
only go out and pitch as good as I can pitch. I've lost some close 
games. I feel I pitched extremely well last year in Game 1 and we 
lost. Did I choke? I don't think I did. I tip my hat to Kevin 
Brown. He pitched better than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks worked out Monday without knowing whether their  
first-round opponent would be the Mets or Houston Astros. Manager 
Buck Showalter was preparing extensive scouting reports on both 
potential foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona was 7-2 against the Mets, including a three-game sweep  
in New York May 28-30, part of the slump that led to the firing of 
three Mets coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter shrugged off that long-ago sweep.  
</P>
<P>
	``With all the stuff they were going through at the time, that  
doesn't mean anything,'' he said. ``They're as talented a club as 
there is in our league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks hit .316 against New York pitching. Luis  
Gonzalez hit .441, Jay Bell .375 and Tony Womack .364.

<HEADLINE> Some Talking Oprah for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- She's a multimillionaire talk-show host, actress  
and -- most recently -- college professor. Now some Reform Party 
members are talking about President Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Party members from Minnesota have created a Web site to draft  
Ms. Winfrey for the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is Jesse Ventura times 100,'' said Paul Larsen, chairman of  
the draft committee and a party leader from suburban Minneapolis. 
``She's got a thousand times as much money, 100 times the name 
recognition. She has a sterling reputation for honesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The queen of talk is not interested, a spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Larsen said he is not giving up and will ask Ventura,  
Minnesota's governor and the nation's highest elected Reform Party 
official, to help persuade her to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura spokesman Doug Friedline said the whole situation ``has  
gotten kind of weird. ... It's almost like we have celebrity-itis 
in the Reform Party.''

<HEADLINE> Strange May Be Next Ryder Cup Boss  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Curtis Strange, who hasn't won since his second straight U.S.  
Open in 1989, was the topic of conversation at the Buick Challenge 
-- before the tournament began, after his first-round 77 and even 
after missing the cut despite a 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Why?  
</P>
<P>
	All signs point toward him as the front-runner to be the next  
Ryder Cup captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody would be interested,'' Strange said. ``Everybody  
would treat it as a tremendous honor to go to the Belfry and be a 
captain. But I haven't talked to anybody, so I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange fits the perfect profile to be the next captain. He will  
be 46 when the 2001 Ryder Cup is played, is still very involved 
with the current crop of stars and is not hurt by his work as a 
television analyst for ABC Sports. He also has player support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Curtis would do a great job,'' Justin Leonard said.  
``I don't know who the PGA of America is thinking about, but he 
would be on my short list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange also got a strong endorsement from Davis Love III, who  
described him as a ``co-captain'' with Lanny Wadkins at Oak Hill, 
where Strange was a captain's pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew the things to do to pump you up and keep you lose,''  
Love said. ``I think he would be a great captain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA of America will announce the new captain before the end  
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is clear -- the next U.S. captain could be saddled with  
additional responsibilities -- namely, damage control -- if the furor 
over this year's Ryder Cup doesn't calm. 
</P>
<P>
	After the last uproar at Kiawah Island in 1991 -- the ``War on  
the Shore'' -- the PGA of America sent five-time British Open 
champion Tom Watson to the Belfry as its captain. Clearly, a 
captain regarded as a great ambassador might not be a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Where does that leave Strange?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he's perceived over there,'' Love said. ``But  
I know he's tough enough to handle whatever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HALL HAPPENINGS:* For the second consecutive year, no player  
from the International ballot received enough votes to be elected 
into the World Golf Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour ballot, featuring Greg Norman and Ben Crenshaw, has  
yet to be mailed. That means as of now, Juli Inkster and Beth 
Daniel will be the only inductees at the 2000 ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is when that ceremony will take place.  
</P>
<P>
	The World Golf Village at St. Augustine has decided to move the  
induction from the Monday of The Players Championship in late March 
until after the season in November. Executive director Ruffin 
Beckwith said one possibility is to hold the ceremony in 
conjunction with the PGA Tour awards luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are hopeful a November induction would allow more  
players to watch their peers get inducted. The March date made it 
virtually impossible for LPGA Tour members to attend since that is 
the week of their first major, the Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOWN THE ROAD:* Two weeks after their raucous Ryder Cup  
celebration before a rowdy hometown crowd at Brookline, Mass., Tom 
Lehman, Mark O'Meara and Payne Stewart could be in for a rude 
reception this week at St. Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Ryder Cup players comprise the U.S. team for the  
Dunhill Cup. The British gallery is expected to be quick to remind 
them what it's like on foreign soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm making my plans to fly over and secure a couple of big,  
burly guys for security,'' Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
	And don't forget Valderrama, site of a raucous victory for  
Europe in the 1997 Ryder Cup, and the end-of-the-year World Golf 
Championship event. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Leonard wonders how the Spanish gallery will treat U.S.  
Ryder Cup players, particularly since the 17th green celebration 
disrupted the chances of Jose Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll catch some flak,'' Leonard said. ``I'm hoping  
that people start to put that behind them, but I'm sure I'll 
encounter some things that we wouldn't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would it cause him to think about not going to Spain this year?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll probably wait until the event,'' Leonard said. ``Right  
now, I have every intention of going.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RYDER RINGS:* Davis Love III compares winning the Ryder Cup to  
any other team championship, such as a World Series or Super Bowl. 
The players can even dress the part, thanks to rings captain Ben 
Crenshaw gave them. 
</P>
<P>
	The only difference?  
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw gave them rings BEFORE the matches.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was Monday night at the Oyster House,'' Love said. ``He  
said, 'Super Bowl teams get their rings after they win. I'm going 
to give you guys this Monday night. That's how good I feel about 
this.' `` 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPLIT SERGIO:* Sergio Garcia plans to divide his time between  
the PGA Tour and the European tour next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, who finished third in the Nelson Classic and runner-up  
to Tiger Woods in the PGA Championship, is 49th on the PGA Tour 
money list and has secured his card. He also has his European card, 
having won twice in nine tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure where I'll play most, but I wanted to get both  
cards because I enjoy playing both tours,'' Garcia said after a 
playoff victory in Germany. ``I feel very comfortable in the United 
States, but I also want to play in Europe. It's my continent, it's 
where I grew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Greg Norman (No. 51) and Bernhard Langer  
(No. 54) have fallen out of the top 50 in the world rankings for 
the first time since its inception in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINAL WORD:* ``We were a half-point away from Europe not  
complaining about the crowd, and a half-point away from Justin 
(Leonard) getting hammered.'' -- Paul Azinger on the Ryder Cup.

<HEADLINE> AOL Offers New User Interface </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. unveiled new software today  
that will allow users to adapt such features as a new interactive 
calendar and a digital photo service to wireless phones, hand-held 
organizers and other portable devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Case, chairman and chief executive officer of AOL,  
predicted that the user interface for the AOL 5.0 software ``will 
lead the interactive medium's next wave of growth and create a 
bridge from the PC to other interactive devices as we move into a 
more connected society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The software was released in New York today.  
</P>
<P>
	The calendar feature, for instance, will let subscribers keep  
track of appointments and birthdays and exchange their kids' soccer 
schedules with one another. 
</P>
<P>
	But computer-based calendars are often impractical to use  
because they require people to be at a computer to find out where 
they need to be. AOL hopes to get around that restriction by making 
its system adaptable for portable devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with the Internet research firm  
Jupiter Communications, said portable devices represent a largely 
untapped market and companies that enter it first have the 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's scrambling to figure out how users will interact in  
these devices,'' she said. ``It's becoming hypercompetitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 18 million subscribers using its flagship service  
worldwide, AOL is the largest Internet service provider. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL 5.0 interface could help the company meet its stated  
goal of offering ``AOL Anywhere.'' The company also hopes the new 
features will encourage subscribers to stay online longer and allow 
AOL to boost rates for online ads. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the calendar, AOL will expand to the rest of the  
nation a digital photo service it runs with Eastman Kodak Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``You've Got Pictures'' service, tested in a few cities this  
past summer, allows photofinishers to send electronic copies of 
pictures to AOL accounts. From those accounts, consumers can 
arrange photos in online albums, send them as e-mail to friends and 
family, or order reprints and enlargements. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new interface, subscribers will be able to view  
pictures using portable devices as well, making them as mobile as 
photo albums. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL 5.0 will also recognize how computers connect to AOL so that  
those using higher-speed connections could get more video clips and 
other items that do not work as well at regular speeds. Such 
broadband access is only beginning to enter the home market. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, fearing it could be denied parts of the broadband market,  
is currently lobbying regulators to force AT&AMP;T and other cable 
providers to sell it access to high-speed cable data networks at 
wholesale prices. AOL already has deals with a satellite TV firm 
and phone companies to offer non-cable broadband services.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Down But Up Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen Tuesday  
but fell against most other major currencies after the Federal 
Reserve brought down U.S. stocks and bonds with a hint of a future 
interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, dollar rose to 106.41 yen from 106.23  
yen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But other leading currencies gained against the dollar as U.S.  
financial markets stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro rose to $1.0743 from $1.0735 and the British pound  
edged up to $1.6565 from $1.6559. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, which has raised short-term interest rates  
twice since June in an attempt to keep the economy from 
overheating, left rates unchanged Tuesday. But it also warned it 
now is leaning toward raising rates in the future and would be 
especially watchful for signs of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, stock and bond markets -- spooked by the thought of  
higher interest rates -- turned lower, leading to a sympathetic 
selloff by currency traders. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our stock and bond markets aren't attractive to foreigners,  
they won't buy dollars,'' explained Grant Wilson, senior foreign 
exchange trader at Mellon Bank. ``There will be less of a demand 
for dollars to buy our assets.''

<HEADLINE> Rugby Officials Assail Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARDIFF, Wales (AP) -- Two players were suspended for the rest of  
group play at the Rugby World Cup, a move organizers hope sends a 
clear signal that ``gratuitous violence will not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Charvis of Wales and Roberto Grau of Argentina were cited  
following a fight during Wales' 23-18 victory in Friday's 
tournament opener. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Siua Taumalolo of Tonga was banned for 21 days for  
high tackling. Brendan Reilly of Samoa and Jose Miguel Villau of 
Spain escaped suspensions despite being cited for punching. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Gresson, the International Rugby Board's chairman of  
referees and a member of the Rugby World Cup disciplinary 
committee, said Tuesday the IRB and the Rugby World Cup will not 
``tolerate wanton, unnecessary violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Rugby is a tough, physical game but there's no reason it can't  
be played within the rules,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IRB disciplinary officer Steve Griffiths said he hoped the  
suspensions acted as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
	Like hockey, rugby appears to accept that violence is inevitable  
in such a contact sport. But the rulemakers are trying to control 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a theory that the odd scrap is just part of rugby but  
the IRB is determined o get rid of gratuitous violence and foul 
play in rugby,'' Gresson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything is calculated to alienate people from the game,  
it's foul play. There is real potential for players to be turned 
off due to gratuitous violence.''

<HEADLINE> WorldCom Boss a Modest Billionaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLINTON, Miss. (AP) -- In this town where roads are made of  
brick, cars are left unlocked and college kids dart in and out of 
coffee shops, Bernard J. Ebbers is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 native of Edmonton, Alberta, came here in the late  
1960s to play basketball for Mississippi College, a private school 
with more than 3,600 students. Today, Clinton is the 58-year-old 
billionaire's home and the center of his life's work -- MCI WorldCom 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	To townspeople, he is Bernie Ebbers, not only the boss to 900  
MCI WorldCom employees, but also the vice chairman of the 
Mississippi College board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes to ball games,'' said Howell W. Todd, Mississippi  
College president. ``He's very loyal to this institution. He's very 
keen on our philosophy and mission, and in ensuring that we carry 
out that mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is also quiet and faithful and once canceled a Saturday night  
business function with the Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce so he 
could finish preparing the lesson for Sunday school the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he is a deeply spiritual man; his faith is extremely  
important to him, and his values,'' said Todd. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be faith that helped prompt Ebbers, whose early jobs  
included that of basketball coach and small-chain motel owner, to 
invest in a tiny long-distance company called Long Distance 
Discount Services, even though he knew little about the phone 
business. That was in 1983, just before AT&AMP;T was dismembered. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned that company, an idea drawn up in a Hattiesburg coffee  
shop, into the nation's second-largest telecommunications company 
with net income last year of $2.6 billion and an overall value 
around $117.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	LDDS has been involved in 60 mergers since it was born. Before  
Tuesday, Ebbers' biggest deal was when his company, renamed 
WorldCom, bought MCI Communications. Now, he's maneuvered MCI 
Worldcom to take over Sprint Corp., in a $115 billion deal that is 
the largest corporate acquisition in history. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was surprised about the latest announcement; analysts had  
been saying MCI WorldCom needed Sprint for its wireless segment. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ebbers realized that, too, his friends say.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say that Bernie is always a step or two  
ahead of the rest of us,'' said Duane O'Neill, president of the 
Metro Jackson Chamber of Commerce. ``He's a true visionary in that 
he makes it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers, a former cowboy and soybean rancher, is credited with  
methodically making his company grow and remain profitable and 
competitive in an era of corporate mergers that has set the entire 
industry on its ear. 
</P>
<P>
	None of which surprises Todd, who has known Ebbers for five  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is very unassuming; doesn't want to draw a lot of attention  
to himself,'' says Todd. ``But beware because underneath all that 
laid-back attitude is a steel-trap mind and one of the sharpest, 
shrewdest individuals I've ever known. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can look at the company and see that.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Scraps Indoor Park Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. is closing its five Club  
Disney indoor play parks at shopping centers and has scrapped plans 
for more of the sites because of disappointing results. 
</P>
<P>
	The family play centers in Thousand Oaks and West Covina,  
Calif., Chandler and Glendale, Ariz., and Lone Tree, Colo., will 
close Nov. 1, Disney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers had opened in 1997 as test sites for as many as 100  
such play parks Disney considered opening nationwide. The company 
would not disclose how much it invested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney ``concluded that a broad rollout of the clubs will not  
meet the company's return requirements for the capital that would 
be invested in the business,'' said Art Levitt, president of Disney 
Regional Entertainment, the division that operated the centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The parks, roughly half the size of a football field, were aimed  
at families with children 10 and younger. Attractions included 
computer games, art projects, party rooms and fashion shows in 
which children could dress up as Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will try to transfer the clubs' 750  
employees to other Disney jobs. Consumers with annual passes or 
prepaid tickets will receive refunds, Disney said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 0.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in volatile trading Tuesday after  
the Federal Reserve decided against raising interest rates again 
but left open the possibility of a third rate hike later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.64 lower at 10,400.59  
after swinging from a 106-point gain to a 124-point loss over the 
final two hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares lifted the Nasdaq composite index 3.70 to  
2,799.67, but most broad-market indexes also turned lower in the 
afternoon, cresting just as the Fed was set to announce the outcome 
of a meeting on inflation and interest rates. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 
500 index fell 3.25 to 1,301.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials, faced with numerous signs of inflationary  
pressure but little evidence of actual inflation, decided not to 
push rates higher for the third time since June. However, they also 
shifted their bias from neutral toward a possible rate increase in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks had rallied Monday amid expectations the Fed would leave  
rates unchanged, but the policy shift dampened hopes that the 
central bank wouldn't try to slow the economy any further to combat 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're worrying about the next Fed meeting'' on Nov. 16,  
said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed officials ``are obviously concerned with some of the  
economic numbers they've seen,'' Rice said. ``They probably want to 
give it another month of data, and they'll probably raise rates 
again in November.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications stocks dominated Tuesday's most active list  
amid news that MCI WorldCom had sealed an agreement to acquire 
long-distance rival Sprint for $115 billion in what would be the 
largest corporate takeover in history. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's shares slid 6 percent, falling 3 11/16 to 67  
15/16 as the most active Nasdaq issue, while Sprint fell 2 to 58 7/8 
in heavy trading on the NYSE. But among other leading telecom 
names, AT&AMP;T rose 1 1/4 to 45 on the NYSE to help bolster the Dow, and 
Qwest Communications rose 9/16 to 33 1/4 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express also helped the Dow, rising 3 1/8 to 140 11/16  
after the company announced plans to launch a new brokerage unit 
with online trading and access to financial advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.60 to 426.01.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 3-to-2 ratio  
on the New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq decliners led by a 
smaller margin. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 1.159 billion shares as of 4 p.m., up from  
1.030 billion at the same point on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.12 percent,  
Germany's DAX index rose 1.59 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
0.52 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.26 percent.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Makes Last Pitch for NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Real estate mogul Ed Roski delivered a  
sealed, 11th-hour bid for an NFL team at the Coliseum, bolstered by 
letters of support from city and county leaders and a pledge of 
$100 million in public money, a city councilman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is the latest for an NFL team in Los Angeles and  
will compete with bids from Hollywood super agent Michael Ovitz, 
who hopes to build a stadium at Hollywood Park racetrack near Los 
Angeles, and Robert McNair on behalf of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski went to Atlanta on Tuesday to deliver the bid containing a  
proposal that will be ``far more competitive than anyone else in 
California,'' Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, NFL expansion committee members began meeting  
in Georgia, supposedly to make a recommendation for the NFL owners 
session Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley-Thomas said Roski carried letters of support from Mayor  
Richard Riordan and the chairman of the county Board of 
Supervisors, committing as much as $100 million in public money 
with no risk to the city or county's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not explain how the funding would work. The NFL's demand  
for public money has been a major stumbling block for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the Houston Chronicle that McNair was prepared to  
offer $700 million for the franchise in what would be the most ever 
paid for any professional sports team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz was expected to offer much less. Ridley-Thomas didn't  
reveal the total of Roski's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley-Thomas said he didn't expect a final decision on the  
NFL's 32nd franchise this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``a very fruitful exchange'' during a 45-minute  
phone call with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most promising option that the NFL will find  
anywhere in Southern California,'' Ridley-Thomas said of the 
Coliseum. ``I think the commissioner got the message today, that it 
would be a huge mistake to miss this opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The selection process has stretched over a year. Several  
promoters have vied for the franchise and the state appointed a 
representative to help, but he quit in frustration. The NFL set 
deadlines, then ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the NFL failed to place a person in Los Angeles to  
make this deal, a point person. They have never done that. They 
committed to setting a franchise fee and never did it. They said 
they were going to do it, they never did,'' Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The larger issue is it's hard to get the league to play by one  
set of rules. It's hard to know what those rules are. It's like 
they're making up the rules as they go along.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Utilities To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two Michigan utilities are combining in a $2.6  
billion deal that will create the state's largest electric and gas 
company with more than 2 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, DTE Energy Co., parent of  
Detroit Edison Co., will buy MCN Energy Group, parent of Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co., for $28.50 per share in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	DTE will also be assuming about $2 billion in MCN debt in the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, based in Detroit, will be the largest electric  
and gas utility in Michigan with about 11,500 employees, 2.1 
million electric customers and 1.2 million natural gas customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is  
subject to approval from shareholders and regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	When the transaction closes, expected in six to nine months, it  
will create DTE Energy Company, the utilities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be able to market coal, gas and  
electricity in the region and to compete more effectively in the 
development of new power plants and distributed generation, the 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	DTE chairman Anthony F. Earley Jr. said the combined company  
will ``more effectively pursue growth and expansion opportunities 
available in the region spanning the corridor from the Great Lakes 
to the Northeast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That corridor accounts for about half of the nation's total  
energy consumption, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
	MichCon and Detroit Edison will retain their corporate  
identities and be operated as subsidiaries of DTE, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	No layoffs were planned, Detroit Edison spokesman Lew Layton  
said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Say Waco Evidence Hidden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorneys for surviving Branch Davidians and  
relatives of those who died during the 1993 Waco siege contend the 
government is withholding important evidence by saying it is 
classified or falls under Privacy Act protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers expect to go to trial early next year in  
their wrongful-death civil lawsuit against the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of documents which have been turned over to  
us, large portions of which have been blacked out,'' said lead 
counsel Michael Caddell, calling some of the evidence critical to 
his case. ``And that, we'll be taking up with the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell said he anticipates filing motions asking U.S. District  
Judge Walter Smith in Waco, Texas, to examine the government's 
privilege claims and he intends to bring up the matter when the 
parties meet privately with the judge Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell's concern is shared by co-counsel James Brannon, who is  
representing the estates of the three children Davidian leader 
David Koresh had with his legal wife, Rachel Jones. The children, 
and others that Koresh fathered with different women, were among 
the approximately 80 people who died during the fiery end to the 
51-day standoff on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the lawyers' assertions, Justice Department spokesman  
Myron Marlin said: ``This matter is currently under litigation and 
we will certainly respond to any complaint we receive in court'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caddell questioned the government's blacking out of passages  
from ``virtually every'' post-siege interview conducted with all 
FBI agents at Waco. ``We're entitled to know everything that they 
heard or saw or did on April 19,'' Caddell said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Brannon is challenging the government's refusal to provide  
the names of certain participants in the final assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cannot hide behind any laws, any statutes to inflict  
wrongful deaths on American citizens and then say `You can't ever 
find out who these people were,''' Brannon said, vowing to take the 
matter to the Supreme Court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to past misstatements by federal officials, including  
the now-recanted denial that the FBI lobbed potentially incendiary 
tear gas canisters, Caddell said: ``At this point, you have to be 
suspicious when they are withholding things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith or a court-appointed special master should review the  
items the government wants to keep private, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials are finalizing production of an avalanche of  
siege-related documents for Smith's court, the special counsel 
appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno and a House committee, 
said Michael Bradford, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Smith granted Bradford 30 more days to give the court  
every Waco-related government document. The documents had been due 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're under deadlines from congressional subpoenas and court  
production deadlines and we've been working literally around the 
clock to try to get that accomplished,'' Bradford said. ``It's a 
huge undertaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee is expecting more than 1  
million documents, said committee spokesman Mark Corallo.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pledges Special Ed Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEMBROKE, N.H. (AP) -- Word that Vice President Al Gore was about  
to arrive turned the volume up a notch in the already chaotic 
middle school cafeteria 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the best thing about your school?'' Gore asked a group  
of girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your visit!'' one of them shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, Gore told about 40 teachers, school board members  
and parents that it was time to turn funding for special education 
up a notch, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a six-point plan, Gore on Monday promised the largest  
ever increase in federal funding for special education, and to veto 
any budget that does not provide enough education money for all 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts across the country have struggled with the cost  
of educating disabled students as mandated by federal law. The law 
allows the federal government to contribute up to 40 percent of the 
states' costs, but it actually pays only 7 percent to 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he ``fully embraces'' the goal of paying the full 40  
percent eventually. For now, funding should be significantly 
increased, but he did not say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``As president, in my first budget I will announce the largest  
increase in special education ever,'' he said. ``It's wrong for 
parents of children who need special education to be put at odds 
with parents of children who do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, other students should not be overlooked, Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will veto any budget that does not have adequate funding for  
all students,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to create a special fund to help school  
districts pay for students who need expensive care. He also said 
more money should go to programs to identify learning disabilities 
in very young children and to train all teachers to work with 
special education students. He also wants to reduce related 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore planned to compaign today in New York, where the latest  
polls show him running neck-and-neck with former Sen. Bill Bradley 
for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore campaigned in New Hampshire, members of his staff  
spent Monday preparing to move from Washington to Nashville, Tenn., 
where Gore hopes to rejuvenate his campaign by getting ``closer to 
the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized the new strategy at the education meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	``This set of proposals comes out of the dialogue I've had with  
the people of New Hampshire,'' he said. ``This is my response. It 
is an example of how our democracy is supposed to work: Listen, 
learn and come up with proposals to form a more perfect union.''

<HEADLINE> Paterno Takes Penn St. To Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Penn State is 5-0 and ranked No. 2.  
That hasn't stopped Joe Paterno from declaring them stupid, taking 
them to task for too many fumbles and threatening personnel 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're undisciplined and sometimes just plain dumb,'' he griped  
last week following four days of idle-week practices. 
</P>
<P>
	And that was just his cleaned-up, off-the-practice-field  
version. 
</P>
<P>
	``We called it `Preseason II,''' Rashard Casey said. ``We were

wouldn't do during a regular week. Coach just tried to get us ready 
and get our minds right, make sure we stay in shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the season's only week off followed by this Saturday's  
visit to 1-3 Iowa, the timing seemed right for some old-fashioned 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been critical of them because they're things I know they  
can correct,'' Paterno said Tuesday. ``I have not been critical of 
their effort. I've been critical of them because I think they've 
been careless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno is talking about a few troubling trends:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Lions have fumbled 17 times -- 3.4 times a game -- and lost  
six, second-worst in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The offensive line has given up a conference-worst 19 sacks  
for 98 yards in losses. The defense has only gotten to the opposing 
quarterback 11 times, third-to-last in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	-- They've been flagged for 29 penalties for 253 yards.  
</P>
<P>
	-- They have not been able to depend on the running game,  
averaging only 127 yards in the past three games. 
</P>
<P>
	So last week was not a time for rest. On Friday, Paterno had  
them on the field at 6 a.m., although players say they asked for it 
so they could leave early for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously had some things to go over,'' Kevin Thompson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tough, very tough, something we needed. We worked  
very hard, and I think we got a lot out of it,'' tailback Eric 
McCoo said. ``We made some changes as far as how we run the ball, 
when we run the ball, aiming points for running backs and linemen -- 
trying to get on the same page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best news for the running game is that tailback Cordell  
Mitchell, who started the first two games, has a ``good shot'' of 
playing against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the week off did not help the offensive line. Backup center  
Josh Mitchell (knee) is hurt, and Eric Cole, still recovering from 
a shoulder injury of his own, is taking snaps at center to spell 
Frank Spano. Cole's backup, Greg Ransom, is also questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Other injured starters are defensive tackle David Fleishhauer  
(ankle) and wideout Corey Jones (hamstring). Paterno also must 
replace defensive lineman Jason Wallace, who broke his ankle 
against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were playing tomorrow, we'd be in tough shape,'' Paterno  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the spate of injuries shouldn't be a problem against  
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	There is concern down the road. Five of the Lions' next seven  
opponents are currently ranked: No. 21 Ohio State, No. 17 Purdue, 
No. 25 Minnesota, No. 3 Michigan and No. 11 Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really banged up,'' Askari Adams said. ``But like coach  
said yesterday, we've got to play with the bumps and bruises. We 
have no breaks coming up now. If you're hurt, you've got to play 
hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Man Must Stay Away From Ashley Judd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- A Kentucky man who got into Ashley Judd's  
house by posing as a police officer has been ordered to stay away 
from the actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once this order is entered, you are to have no contact, you  
are not to follow, stalk or harass Miss Judd again,'' Judge Jeffrey 
Bivins told Guy Dukes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dukes, who was charged with trespassing and impersonating a  
police officer, was ordered to come no closer than 100 feet to Ms. 
Judd and her residence. Dukes apologized for his actions and said 
``it won't happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Judd, 31, called 911 Sept. 27 after discovering Dukes in her  
rural home. He left at her request and did not touch her, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Judd's boyfriend, race car driver Dario Franchitti, followed  
Dukes by car into Franklin, where police cornered the suspect in a 
parking lot and arrested him.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Sink on Interest Rate Worry / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bonds plummeted Tuesday after Federal  
Reserve policy-makers said they are leaning toward raising interest 
rates to hold down inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 7/32  
points, or $12.18 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.17 percent from 6.08 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's policy-setting Federal Reserve Open Market  
Committee left short-term interest rates unchanged Tuesday as 
expected by Wall Street economists and traders. But the Fed also 
said it was being extra vigilant about the risks of rising 
inflation and now is leaning toward raising rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed already has raised short-term interest rates twice since  
June and many traders were hoping the central bank was through 
tightening credit for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who had been betting the Fed would keep a neutral  
stance toward interest rates started selling Treasurys after the 
central bank's midafternoon announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the Fed's decision likely will leave the market  
volatile in coming weeks as investors scour economic data in an 
attempt to predict how the Fed will act. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 3/16 point to 1/4 point, while intermediate maturities fell 1/2 
point to 3/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the yield on three-month Treasury was 4.85  
percent, as the discount fell 0.01 point from Monday's auction to 
4.72 percent. The six-month yield was 5.11 percent as the discount 
rose 0.04 percentage point from the weekly auction to 4.91 percent. 
One-year yields rose to 5.31 percent as the discount rose 0.07 
percentage point from late Monday to 5.04 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5 percent from 5.25 percent late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/8 to 111 1/2. The average yield to 
maturity of the index was 5.93 percent, up from 5.91 percent.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Offered Baseball Wager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Leader Dick Armey, whose  
relations with the White House have often been unfriendly, 
challenged first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to a ``friendly 
wager'' Tuesday over the baseball playoff between the New York 
Yankees and the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey, R-Texas, who is fond of quoting from country-and-western  
songs, said he would sing Frank Sinatra's ``New York, New York'' if 
the Yankees win the American League playoff series. If the Rangers 
win, the first lady has to sing Sinatra's ``Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have made much of the fact that Mrs. Clinton, who is  
considering a run for the Senate from New York, is an Illinois 
native who has not lived in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many wonder if she has actually ever read a Yankees box score.  
That's why I'm inviting the first lady to take up this wager,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey's frequent criticisms of Mrs. Clinton -- he once called her  
a Marxist -- led to a shouting match with President Clinton during 
the 1996 budget talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is currently traveling in Poland and there was no  
immediate response to Armey's offer.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Announces New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi named a new Cabinet  
today, inaugurating a coalition government that will have a 
commanding majority in both houses of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The reshuffle, which was delayed while the government dealt with  
last week's nuclear accident, was aimed at both strengthening the 
position of Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party in Parliament and 
bolstering his efforts to pull Japan out of its worst economic 
downturn in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet was to be formally sworn in by Emperor Akihito  
later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stressing the need for continuity, Obuchi retained his top  
economic advisors -- Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Economic 
Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya -- in the new 18-member Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa called today for more government spending to spur  
recovery from Japan's worst economic downturn in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``More pushes are needed,'' he told reporters at the prime  
minister's official residence. 
</P>
<P>
	He also described the current condition of Japan's economy as  
better overall than a year earlier, though he said corporate 
capital investment remains slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakuo Yanagisawa, head of the Financial Reconstruction  
Commission, a Japanese government body overseeing banking industry 
reform, will be replaced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's 
financial issues chief, Michio Ochi. 
</P>
<P>
	Ochi has served twice as minister for economic planning and is a  
former Finance Ministry bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi also named Yohei Kono to be the new foreign minister, and  
gave Takashi Fukaya the trade portfolio. Kono has previously held 
the post of foreign minister, and Fukaya was formerly minister of 
posts and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi is generally credited with sparking a glimmer of recovery  
with a bank bailout and public spending packages, and public 
opinion polls indicate he is one of the most popular prime 
ministers Japan has had in years. 
</P>
<P>
	He easily won re-election Sept. 21 as head of his party, taking  
about 70 percent of the votes in a three-way contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval rating for his Cabinet soared to a record 48  
percent in October, up 16 percent from last month, according to the 
Mainichi newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But the poll also found that a majority were opposed to the  
three-party coalition involving Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party, 
the Liberal Party and the New Komeito party. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberals were already in the old coalition government, which  
only had a majority in the lower house. With the Komeito, the 
coalition controls the majority in the upper house as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-party ruling bloc will command over 350 seats in the  
500-seat House of Representatives, the lower house of Japan's 
parliament, and more than half of the 252-seat House of 
Councillors, the upper house.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Union Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling Vice President Al Gore a clear  
supporter of public education, the nation's second-largest 
teachers' union endorsed him for president today over Bill Bradley 
and George W. Bush, who have been criticized for supporting 
private-school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vouchers, which in some parts of the country are providing  
public money for private education, have long been the bane of the 
American Federation of Teachers, which represents nearly a million 
teachers, mostly in the nation's largest school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	AFT President Sandra Feldman, speaking shortly before the  
union's 38-member executive council board voted here today, said 
the endorsement is more about supporting Gore and less about 
punishing Bradley, a former New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about Bradley,'' said Feldman. ``We're not using  
that (the voucher issue) as a single-issue litmus test at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that Al Gore has been for years a close friend of  
education and of children,'' said Feldman, noting especially his 
support of federal programs that help poor and urban children. 
``This is a very positive endorsement of Al Gore on the record, not 
an endorsement against anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who hadn't won many friends among the teachers' unions  
for his views, recently backed away from his congressional support 
for school voucher experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	He now says that giving parents public funds for private-school  
tuition is not ``the answer to the problems of public education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the AFT vote, one council member abstained, but 37 members  
voted for Gore, said spokesman Gregory King. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential front-runner Bush has also been criticized by  
organized labor for his support of school vouchers, which many 
argue help only a few students and take resources from public 
schools and give them to private institutions that don't need 
federal help. Bush proposed giving parents choice funds to hold 
schools more accountable for federal aid, particularly under the $8 
billion Title I program for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Bradley nor Bush camp was immediately available for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association, the nation's largest  
teachers' union with 2.4 million members, could issue an 
endorsement as early as Friday, said spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	For months the Democratic hopefuls have fought for the favor of  
organized labor, with Gore getting more competition than expected 
from Bradley. Bradley's campaign said it had won a small victory in 
beating back plans for an early AFL-CIO endorsement of Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers have said today's AFT nod, taking advantage of  
the growing political clout of education issues, may have come 
early to help solidify a stumbling Gore campaign, and to prod its 
parent organization, the AFL-CIO, and other labor organizations 
into issuing endorsements. The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of 
unions, is expected this month to finally throw the weight of its 
72 unions and 13 million members behind the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be playing a strong role in trying to make that  
happen,'' Feldman said. ``The endorsement of the American 
Federation of Teachers is very powerful not just in a primary but 
in the general election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman added that the vote today by the organization's  
executive board has support from the larger membership, which was 
polled earlier.

<HEADLINE> Fed Reserve Vice Chairman Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roger W. Ferguson, a Harvard-trained economist  
and lawyer, was sworn in Tuesday as vice chairman of the Federal 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan administered the oath to  
Ferguson, 47, who was nominated by President Clinton to fill a 
vacancy created by the departure of Alice Rivlin in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In making that announcement this summer, Clinton said Ferguson  
would be the first African American to hold the post of vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate confirmed Ferguson's nomination last Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton appointed Ferguson to the seven-member Fed board of  
governors two years ago. He has focused much of his attention on 
technical matters, including overseeing the Fed's plans to deal 
with the Year 2000 computer problem and heading a panel that is 
searching for ways to upgrade the central bank's check-clearing 
operations for commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson is a former partner at the consulting firm of McKinsey  
&AMP; Co., where he specialized in the management of 
information-technology systems. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the third black to serve on the Fed board, following  
Andrew Brimmer, nominated by Lyndon Johnson in 1966, and Emmett 
Rice, nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Rams 3-0 Heading Into 49ers Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams, one of two unbeaten teams  
in the NFC, see no reason why they can't keep rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are going to have to stop taking us for granted and  
start preparing and getting ready to play a good team,'' 
quarterback Kurt Warner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams haven't had a winning season since 1989 and haven't had  
a 3-0 start since 1995, their first season in St. Louis. That year, 
they won their first four games thanks to a handful of trick plays 
that worked and the fact they had no turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this season, they're plus-1 in turnover ratio with five  
takeaways and four giveaways. They're winning with solid plays, 
especially from the previously unknown Warner, not gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the squad, because I knew about that year, that we  
weren't really interested in winning by accident,'' Vermeil said 
Monday. ``If you're going to have a good team, you've got to win 
because you're fundamentally sound and have good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're not just winning, they're winning big. The Rams have  
outscored their opponents 100-27, with the Cincinnati Bengals 
(38-10 on Sunday) the latest victim. The two teams went into the 
game with an NFL-high 99 losses in the 1990s, so the Bengals became 
the first to 100. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams, however, are still waiting for respect. They'll be  
underdogs at home Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers (3-1), who 
have beaten the Rams 17 straight times. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can keep it going, great,'' Vermeil said. ``I'd be a  
liar to say I don't think there'll be a little extra incentive 
because they are the 49ers and a division rival that's been 
dominating the Rams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warner, a former star in the Arena League and NFL Europe, became  
the first quarterback in 50 years to throw three touchdown passes 
in his first three starts. He leads the NFL with a 125.0 efficiency 
rating, has completed 68.9 percent of his passes and was at fault 
for only one of his two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing it about as well as it can be done,'' Vermeil said.  
``It's almost scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is the rest of the Rams offense, rated fourth in the NFL and  
first in yards per play, for opposing teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Bruce and Marshall Faulk are among the league leaders in  
receptions, with 17 and 15 catches, and Bruce is fifth in receiving 
yardage (312). Faulk figures to get his running game untracked 
soon, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also are fourth on total defense, and their special  
teams have excelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Az-Zahir Hakim leads the league in punt returns after taking one  
84 yards for a touchdown against the Bengals. Kicker Jeff Wilkins 
has been perfect since the preseason and punter Rick Tuten got off 
a career-best 70-yarder last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't hurt that the Rams' first three opponents are a  
collective 2-10. The Rams, by virtue of their 4-12 season last 
year, have the NFL's third-easiest schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, who lost 27-10 to the Rams in Game 2, went to the  
Super Bowl last year but were without Jamal Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say whatever you want about our schedule,'' Vermeil  
said. ``I don't make the schedule, I just coach.''

<HEADLINE> Frat House Brawl Gets Player Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- The one Illinois State University  
football player to stand trial for a 1998 fraternity house brawl 
was sentenced to six years in prison on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Ramsey, 23, was convicted of two counts of home invasion  
and one count of mob action in a bench trial in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ramsey led a group of 30 to 40 current and  
former ISU football players who broke into the Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
fraternity house in March 1998. He was among eight players accused 
of attacking about 40 fraternity members in retaliation for a fight 
the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said as many as six fraternity members were injured  
in the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-year sentence was the minimum required by law. In  
handing down the sentence, Judge Michael Prall said he regretted he 
had no other option. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dropped against football player Aveion Cason in  
June due to insufficient evidence. Robert Boyd, who pleaded guilty 
to misdemeanor battery, received 24 months probation and was 
ordered to pay a share of $9,000 in restitution to fraternity 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other players who earlier pleaded guilty to more serious  
charges were sentenced to 90 days in the McLean County Jail and 
also ordered to pay restitution.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pledges Special Ed Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEMBROKE, N.H. (AP) -- Word that Vice President Al Gore was about  
to arrive turned the volume up a notch in the already chaotic 
middle school cafeteria 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the best thing about your school?'' Gore asked a group  
of girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your visit!'' one of them shouted.  
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, Gore told about 40 teachers, school board members  
and parents that it was time to turn funding for special education 
up a notch, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a six-point plan, Gore on Monday promised the largest  
ever increase in federal funding for special education, and to veto 
any budget that does not provide enough education money for all 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts across the country have struggled with the cost  
of educating disabled students as mandated by federal law. The law 
allows the federal government to contribute up to 40 percent of the 
states' costs, but it actually pays only 7 percent to 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he ``fully embraces'' the goal of paying the full 40  
percent eventually. For now, funding should be significantly 
increased, but he did not say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``As president, in my first budget I will announce the largest  
increase in special education ever,'' he said. ``It's wrong for 
parents of children who need special education to be put at odds 
with parents of children who do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, other students should not be overlooked, Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will veto any budget that does not have adequate funding for  
all students,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to create a special fund to help school  
districts pay for students who need expensive care. He also said 
more money should go to programs to identify learning disabilities 
in very young children and to train all teachers to work with 
special education students. He also wants to reduce related 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore planned to compaign today in New York, where the latest  
polls show him running neck-and-neck with former Sen. Bill Bradley 
for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore campaigned in New Hampshire, members of his staff  
spent Monday preparing to move from Washington to Nashville, Tenn., 
where Gore hopes to rejuvenate his campaign by getting ``closer to 
the people.''

	He emphasized the new strategy at the education meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	``This set of proposals comes out of the dialogue I've had with  
the people of New Hampshire,'' he said. ``This is my response. It 
is an example of how our democracy is supposed to work: Listen, 
learn and come up with proposals to form a more perfect union.''

<HEADLINE> Now the Real Baseball Season Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's still a chance of a Subway Series.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets made that possible Monday night, beating  
Cincinnati 5-0 in a one-game playoff for the NL wild card. The 
victory put them in the postseason together with the Yankees for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am drained. I am excited. I am elated. I am thankful,'' Mets  
manager Bobby Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final spot filled, baseball was set to begin the most  
important season. A quick note about this year's remaining teams: 
For the second straight year, the eight playoff clubs all are among 
the majors' 12 biggest payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will be trying to duplicate last October's success.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we're the world champs,'' manager Joe Torre said Monday.  
``I think that's the way people look at us. We've done well over 
the last few years. Again, that doesn't mean that we assume we're 
going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Rangers will try to stop them, starting tonight when  
the best-of-5 AL playoffs open at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Yankees had a sense of invincibility last year,'' Texas'  
Todd Zeile said. ``They were the best team in the history of the 
game. They are still a good club, but we are confident playing 
against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Turner Field, the Atlanta Braves begin the quest for a second  
World Series championship in the '90s. Greg Maddux was to throw the 
first pitch of this year's playoffs this afternoon against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about going to the playoffs, you talk about  
having the hot hand at the right time,'' Braves pitcher Tom Glavine 
said. ``And I think this team definitely has that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros wound up headed to Atlanta when the Mets won at  
Cincinnati. Houston was just 1-6 against the Braves this season and 
was swept by Atlanta in the first round in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know how we've fared against the Braves,'' closer Billy  
Wagner said. ``Their reputation seems to beat us before we get out 
there. We seem to try to do too much against them. This season, we 
didn't get the job done against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Jacobs Field, Cleveland will renew its bid for its first  
Series title since 1948. The Indians face a rough start, drawing 
ace Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox in Game 1 Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to beat Pedro,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel said.  
``We have to show we can beat him. We beat him before and we have 
to do that again. The No. 1 game is always important to win. It 
doesn't mean anything if we go the full five games or seven games. 
It is just the first step. You want the first step, but it is more 
important to take the last step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Diamondbacks also are in the playoffs, making it in  
just their second season. Randy Johnson will start Game 1 tonight 
at 11:09 p.m. EDT at Bank One Ballpark against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're as talented a club as there is in our league,''  
Arizona manager Buck Showalter said of the Mets. ``They've got 
great depth. It's a well put-together club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is 2-5 lifetime with a 3.10 ERA in the playoffs and has  
lost five straight decisions, tying the postseason record shared by 
Doyle Alexander and Joe Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the postseason, I've pitched pretty well,''  
Johnson said. ``It's not like I've been a total flop. People just 
look at the numbers and they want wins, and that's all I want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are making their first playoff appearance since 1988.  
Valentine and Mets reliever John Franco are going for the first 
time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week we were at the bottom of the barrel, the bottom of  
the hill,'' Franco said. ``Now we have a second life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the teams, these matchups are all-too-familiar.  
</P>
<P>
	The Indians eliminated Boston in the first round in 1995 and  
again in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the postseason, and we know what they can do,''  
Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said. ``They definitely have a 
lot of veterans, and they've been in the postseason before. They 
know how to win. We played them last year and they knocked us out. 
Hopefully, we can turn it around this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also hope for a bit of role reversal. The Yankees  
chased them in the first round in 1996 and 1998, and both times 
went on to win the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, New York held the AL's top-hitting team to one run  
and a .141 average in a three-game sweep. Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez will start the opener against Texas' Aaron Sele. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we'd have to face the Yankees some time,'' said Rafael  
Palmeiro, who rejoined Texas this season. ``It doesn't matter if it 
is the first or second round. The road to the World Series goes 
through New York, so we might as well do it now.''

<HEADLINE> Stalled Steelers Plan No Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kordell Stewart has led two touchdown drives  
in seven games against teams not named the Browns. His offensive 
line collapsed against Jacksonville, resulting in two safeties in 
five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Who said the Pittsburgh Steelers' offense couldn't score -- even  
if it is for the other team? 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's confidence admittedly is fragile, his protection in  
the pocket even more so. Two home games into a new season that is 
fast resembling how last season ended, the Steelers' starting 
offense has yet to score a touchdown. For the most part, it hasn't 
come close. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't get much worse than this: the Steelers' offensive  
starters have been outscored two straight games by the opposing 
defense, which might be an NFL first. Seattle did so 7-3 in winning 
29-10 on Sept. 26; the Jaguars' defense outscored them 4-3 Sunday 
in a 17-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	So where does the Steelers' stationary offense go from here?  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher offered this suggestion Tuesday: How about the  
end zone? 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissing suggestions that big changes are in order, such as  
benching Stewart and playing backup quarterback Mike Tomczak, 
Cowher expects no substantive personnel moves. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to envision a scenario in which Stewart would be benched  
sometime this season, Cowher said, ``I can't foresee that 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I thought it was one person, I'd make the change. I don't  
care who it is, because then you're not being fair to everybody,'' 
Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher denied the Steelers (2-2) are hesitant to bench Stewart  
after signing him to a $27 million contract extension only last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with what a guy makes or who a guy is,''  
Cowher said. ``The fact that I haven't made a change ought to be 
indicative of the fact that it's not one person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line play, among the best in the NFL for years,  
has been substandard. All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson said he has 
never played worse than he did against Seattle. Both tackles, Wayne 
Gandy and Anthony Brown, were beaten on the fourth-quarter safeties 
against Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stewart's inability to throw downfield, either because  
his receivers aren't open or his protection breaks down, is 
allowing defenses to gang up against the run. Jerome Bettis, the 
No. 2 rusher in team history to Franco Harris, still hasn't had a 
100-yard game, gaining 97 yards on 31 carries the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last eight starts, Stewart has one touchdown pass -- in  
the opener against Cleveland -- and 11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' inability to move the ball consistently led Cowher  
to gamble twice Sunday on fourth-and-1 situations. Stewart was 
sacked for a big loss on one play and threw incomplete into the end 
zone on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you still have to be aggressive in thought and action,''  
Cowher said. ``If you lose your aggressiveness, you lose your 
confidence and ability to execute. I didn't lose my aggressiveness 
on fourth-and-1. It might not have been smart, but ...''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Embraces First Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Like tens of thousands of other fans, Brian  
Landreville dutifully stood for the national anthem before Tuesday 
night's playoff opener between the New York Mets and Arizona 
Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the rest, however, he was standing in chlorinated water.  
And wearing just purple swim trunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Playoff baseball, welcome to the desert.  
</P>
<P>
	In a state where folks defy the heat, fans celebrated in a  
ballpark featuring a retractable roof, a mammoth cooling system 
and, to Landreville's delight, a swimming pool just behind the 
right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely no better way to watch the game,''  
Landreville said, wading with a view of the field at Bank One 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, no better way for people able to afford the $4,500 price  
tag to rent the pool area, which also includes a hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
	It actually was around 90 degrees outside -- positively mild by  
Phoenix standards -- and those in the stands 15 minutes before 
gametime marveled at the $354 million stadium's roof opening to a 
flourish of new age music. The game was played under a clear sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just incredible,'' said Lori Crawford, who watched the  
roof open from the upper deck. ``The newness hasn't worn off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the five-minute roof opening often was the only  
highlight as the expansion team struggled mightily. Things were 
different the second time around, thanks at least in part to some 
jaw-dropping free agent signings. 
</P>
<P>
	The high price of success wasn't lost on Dan Bleasdale, a season  
ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We paid a lot of money,'' he said. ``We took a pay increase in  
tickets to get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks created more than a little ill will late last  
season when they announced a 12 percent average ticket price 
increase during Fan Appreciation Weekend. The team then proceeded 
to shell out big bucks for free agents, including pitchers Randy 
Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Beth Dodaro was more concerned with the end than the  
means. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we brought in Randy Johnson, we started thinking we  
could go all the way with this,'' Dodaro said. ``We're praying 
every night we're going all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson started the best-of-5 series against the Mets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Here we are,'' Chris Peddie said. ``People can say we've  
bought our way into this, but we're here. That's all that matters 
to me.''

<HEADLINE> Fairfield Football Player Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A senior co-captain of the Fairfield  
football team was arrested for allegedly assaulting a police 
officer and inciting a riot at a local bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Wise, 21, from Reading, Pa., is due in court Oct. 12 to  
face charges stemming from a melee Sunday outside the Seagrape 
Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Keith Broderick was one of about a dozen police officers  
responding to the disturbance. Police said Wise was cursing at bar 
employees, and when Broderick tried to subdue him, a scuffle broke 
out. Both men sustained minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``During officers' attempts to arrest him, Wise was encouraging  
the large crowd that gathered to assist him in his attempts to 
resist,'' Detective Sgt. Gary MacNamara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise, a wide receiver, was charged with breach of peace and  
interfering with an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stags are on a 12-game winning streak. Wise had six catches  
for 49 yards in Saturday's 41-14 victory over Central Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Honeywell-Allied Signal Plans Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Honeywell Inc. and AlliedSignal Inc. have  
agreed to divest some of their aviation electronics businesses in 
order to win the U.S. Justice Department's clearance of their 
planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell will divest its traffic alert and collision avoidance  
system business, and AlliedSignal will divest its search and 
surveillance weather radar product lines; space and navigation 
business; operations in Cheshire, Conn.; and MEMS microSCIRAS 
guidance technology. The areas accounted for about $250 million in 
1998 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The divestitures would represent only about 1 percent of overall  
revenues of the combined company and would not affect future 
earnings significantly, both companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement in principle with U.S. regulators leaves only one  
regulatory approval to be cleared before the merger can be 
completed. The companies are still working with the European Union 
Commission to obtain clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice brings  
us to the final stage for completion of this important merger,'' 
said Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, 
who will head the merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the European Union Commission has until late December  
to decide whether it will require changes in the alliance, the 
companies said they expect to receive clearance in time to complete 
the merger this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company will be known as Honeywell International and  
will be headquartered in Morristown, N.J., where AlliedSignal is 
now based. Honeywell's Minneapolis headquarters will be shut down 
after the merger closes. The companies have said about 4,500 
employees will be laid off due to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies also confirmed that their third-quarter earnings  
will be in line with expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	AlliedSignal is active in aerospace, automotive and engineered  
materials products. Honeywell specializes in controls and systems 
for homes and buildings, as well as industrial applications for the 
aerospace industry.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Mechanics Vote on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- US Airways mechanics voted Tuesday on whether  
to approve a tentative contract agreement with the airline after 
months of contentious negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers of the International Association of Machinists and  
Aerospace Workers endorsed the agreement but said approval of the 
rank and file is uncertain. They warned that the union would strike 
if the contract is defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the contract is rejected and the strike vote is reaffirmed,  
it's not a threat, we will withdraw services within 48 hours,'' 
said the union's lead negotiator, Bill Freiberger. 
</P>
<P>
	The count of ballots cast at union offices across the country  
was not expected until midday Wednesday. Union members were asked 
to vote on two questions: whether to approve the 5-year contract 
agreement, and whether to authorize a strike in case it is not 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike could hobble the nation's sixth largest airline.  
</P>
<P>
	About 7,500 mechanics, airplane cleaners and other maintenance  
workers for US Airways, based in Arlington, Va., would be covered 
by the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	They already have voted down one potential agreement this year,  
in July, and a strike deadline was averted by just four days when 
federally mediated talks reached the current tentative deal Sept. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of part-time workers has been among the most contentious  
issues in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Language in the new agreement would allow US Airways to use  
part-time workers to clean aircraft between flights but limit those 
workers to no more than a third of the full-time cleaning work 
force, down from 50 percent in the first agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract also promises immediate bonuses and raises for all  
covered workers. Experienced US Airways mechanics currently earn 
about $23 an hour.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Calls Portland 'A Great Fit' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- On his first day in a Portland Trail  
Blazers uniform, Scottie Pippen tried to set the record straight 
about his trade, Charles Barkley and whether he can win another NBA 
title without Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, speaking publicly for the first time since the Houston  
Rockets traded him Saturday for six reserves, was all smiles 
Monday, even as he dispelled reports that he wanted to rejoin 
former Bulls coach Phil Jackson on the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is very much not true,'' he said. ``The opportunity to  
come here and play just made me overwhelmingly excited. I feel very 
good about coming here and winning a championship. That's what I'm 
all about, is winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said he didn't want to be traded, but that once his  
departure became imminent, Portland was his first choice because 
the Blazers have a better shot at a title than either the Lakers or 
the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Pippen was traded for Stacey Augmon, Kelvin  
Cato, Walt Williams, Brian Shaw, Ed Gray and Carlos Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67 million contract when he  
joined the Rockets last season, will now be the centerpiece on one 
of the NBA's most formidable starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said the Blazers, who signed free agent Detlef Schrempf  
and acquired Steve Smith in a trade with Atlanta in a busy 
offseason after losing to San Antonio in the Western Conference 
finals, have the best team he's ever seen -- period. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is far more talented than probably any team that's  
been assembled in the league,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked whether Pippen meant just this season, or  
ever, the seven-time All-Star smiled and said, ``Far as I can 
remember. I haven't been around forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers, who did not have a single championship ring among  
them before the trade, were impressed by Pippen's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel great about that,'' forward Brian Grant said. ``We  
know he's not just saying it. We know he really, truly, honestly 
believes that, so we're going to go out there and try to do 
everything we can to prove that he's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen grew frustrated with his lack of scoring opportunities in  
Houston, playing in the same frontcourt as Hakeem Olajuwon and 
Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, he made a trade a virtual certainty when he  
ripped Barkley in a television interview, calling him ``selfish'' 
and saying Barkley owed him an apology for coming to play with his 
``sorry fat butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After mulling over his statements for a few days, Pippen at  
first tried to laugh off the episode, saying ``I forgot what I 
said.'' But he did soften his comments, even if he didn't 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't mean anything personal about Charles,'' he  
said. ``I think we've had an off-and-on relationship over the 
years, and I'm sure we'll cross each other's path again, and all 
that will be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what kind of greeting he expected from Barkley when the  
Blazers host the Rockets on Nov. 26, Pippen said, ``I've had 
confrontations with a lot of players. Charles is just one of them, 
so I'm not looking for any warm welcome or anything different from 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen said the media ``sucked up'' to Barkley in Houston, and  
that the Bulls' run of six NBA titles in eight years taught him how 
to stand up to scrutiny. ``Playing with Michael, I realized that 
somebody has to take the blows,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a red, white and black Trail Blazers jersey at Media  
Day, Pippen was asked the inevitable questions about playing in 
Jordan's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the opportunity of winning another championship, but  
it's not about trying to prove to anybody that I can win without 
Michael,'' he said. ``It's about just winning and showing that I'm 
a good player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen averaged just 14.5 points last season, but still averaged  
40 minutes a game. He said he will gladly settle for fewer minutes 
this season, and with coach Mike Dunleavy still bringing back a 
roster that goes 10 deep, Pippen will have to. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see Mike having a very tough job trying to get guys minutes  
out on the court, but we have to be one happy family, and realize 
that the most important thing is about winning,'' Pippen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Blazers grumbled about playing time last season, and  
Schrempf, for one, has mixed feelings about giving up even more 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying if I said I was cool with it,'' Schrempf said.  
``It's going to be a change. (But) I'm not playing for a new 
contract, I'm not playing for the All-Star team. My goal is to win 
a championship, and I think we have all the ingredients here.''

<HEADLINE> Flu Drug Could Prevent A, B Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An experimental drug would give flu sufferers  
their first effective pill against both A and B flu viruses, the 
two major types that afflict Americans, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	An inhaled powder that works against both types was approved by  
the Food and Drug Administration in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The pill, to be marketed as Tamiflu, helped reduce the duration  
and severity of flu symptoms by about half in 80 unvaccinated 
adults who were voluntarily infected with the flu virus, 
researchers said in today's Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The prescription drug also helped prevent the flu in  
unvaccinated adults who took the drug before being exposed to the 
virus, said researchers led by Dr. Frederick. Hayden of the 
University of Virginia. Only eight of 21 people who took the drug 
before exposure got infected (38 percent), compared with eight of 
12 who did not take the drug (67 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	``These drugs are not a substitute for vaccine. They're an  
adjunct, a supplement, in terms of the protection they can 
provide,'' Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccination is always preferred, he said. But some people cannot  
take a vaccine because of certain medical conditions or allergies, 
many people do not get vaccinated, and vaccination does not prevent 
all cases of flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffman  
LaRoche Ltd., and the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamiflu (generically called oseltamivir) and the inhaled drug,  
Relenza (zanamivir), are in a new class of medicines that cripple 
the chemical process used by flu viruses to spread from cell to 
cell. Unlike older drugs, they work against both A and B viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two older flu medicines, Symmetrel (amantadine) and  
Flumadine (rimantadine), use a different mechanism. Though they are 
both available as pills, they only work against flu virus A, which 
accounts for about two-thirds of the estimated 20 million U.S. flu 
cases yearly, usually the most severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ben Katz, an infectious-disease specialist at Children's  
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the new medicines also have the 
advantage of affecting flu virus later in its life cycle, so are 
less likely to cause genetic mutations that lead to drug 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Katz noted the study was done only on healthy adults  
infected in a laboratory, and said the results might be different 
in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said that subsequent real-world studies have since shown  
Tamiflu effective with few side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the drug is to be considered for approval later this  
month by the FDA. The FDA does not comment on its schedule for 
considering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	No price has been set for Tamiflu, according to Hoffman-LaRoche.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Union Endorses Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore won endorsement Tuesday  
by the nation's second-largest teachers' union for his steadfast 
opposition to private-school vouchers. But the AFL-CIO's bigger 
prize remained an agonizingly open question for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	With the AFL-CIO biennial convention looming next week, the  
Teamsters union stood ready to resist Gore's once-certain early nod 
from the federation. But labor and political operatives close to 
the wrangling said they believed Gore would overcome such 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken a position that it's too early,'' said Teamsters  
political director Mike Mathis. ``This is not an anti-Al Gore 
thing. But there's still so much gray area out there on worker 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the United Auto Workers, Machinists, Food and  
Commercial Workers, and International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers also have signaled some reservations to backing Gore this 
early in a tightening Democratic nomination race with Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, several leaders who have questioned an early endorsement  
of Gore have indicated to AFL-CIO President John Sweeney that they 
would be willing to support the vice president at the convention if 
Sweeney pushed for a vote, according to the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all boils down to John Sweeney and whether he will push  
it through,'' said Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney did not tip his hand, telling The Washington Post: ``We  
are going through a process. ... There are some people who think we 
should take a little longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A final decision wasn't expected until after the union  
presidents who comprise the federation's executive council meet 
Friday in advance of the convention, which convenes in Los Angeles 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley continue to fight intensively for the  
endorsement. Neither was scheduled to address the convention, but 
both were planning to be in California with open space on their 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive council of the American Federation of Teachers,  
which represents nearly a million teachers, mostly in the nation's 
largest school districts, overwhelmingly endorsed Gore on Tuesday. 
There was one abstention among the 38 members, said spokesman 
Gregory King. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very positive endorsement of Al Gore on the record,  
not an endorsement against anyone,'' said Sandra Feldman, president 
of the AFT, who said the endorsement has support from the larger 
membership, which was polled earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, like the teachers unions, opposes voucher programs.  
Bradley has voted for school voucher experiments but has said he 
doesn't believe they are the solution to fundamental problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said the endorsement is more about supporting Gore and  
less about punishing Bradley: ``We're not using that (the voucher 
issue) as a single-issue litmus test at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Republican presidential candidates favor voucher  
programs. Front-runner George W. Bush has steadily touted vouchers, 
which in some parts of the country are providing public money for 
private education. In a speech Tuesday, he suggested money from the 
nation's largest federal education program could be used to fund 
state voucher programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said, ``We expect  
(Texas) Governor Bush to receive many endorsements from individual 
teachers but we are not surprised that an entrenched organization 
that has defended the status quo would endorse Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Education Association, the nation's largest  
teachers' union with 2.4 million members, may issue an endorsement 
as early as Friday, said spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley have fought for the favor of the traditional  
Democrat stronghold of organized labor, with Bradley waging a 
tougher-than-expected challenge to Gore's institutional support. 
Gore allies have been pushing for the AFL-CIO endorsement since 
February, and the Bradley camp claims a small victory in 
forestalling them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly making a case to labor and have throughout the  
campaign, said Bradley campaign spokesman Eric Hauser. ``They 
haven't made an endorsement yet; we'll keep making a case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The AFT nod, some observers say, may have come early in an  
attempt to prod its parent organization, the AFL-CIO, and other 
labor organizations into issuing endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be playing a strong role in trying to make that  
happen,'' said Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Gore's campaign said he had won endorsement by the  
International Association of Washington State Machinists. A 
campaign news release noted that ``the organization is the largest 
machinists union in the country, with more than 50,000 members 
statewide.''

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Stays Away from Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Already two days late, Latrell Sprewell  
should arrive soon for training camp. Whether he does so in a 
timely fashion remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks went through their first day of two-a-day  
practices Tuesday while Sprewell decided to stay on the West Coast 
and wait out the verdict in his civil trial in California. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not present in court, however, when a jury ruled that he  
must pay $105,000 to two people who were injured in a car accident 
that he admittedly caused. The jury did not award any punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reaction is he shouldn't have to pay anything,'' teammate  
Chris Childs said. ``It was just a matter of someone trying to get 
some money off a professional athlete again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he got off and is able to go on with his life. To go  
through what he's been through the last couple of years, whenever 
he gets here it's understandable by his teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Scott Layden didn't say whether he expected  
Sprewell to catch a red-eye flight across the country so he could 
make it to Charleston by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will continue holding two-a-day practices through  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent originally told the Knicks he would join the  
team following closing arguments in the trial, which came Monday. 
But Sprewell then decided to wait for the jury to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we just hope he's here soon, and hopefully we'll hear  
soon what his plans are,'' Layden said following practice Tuesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, did not return numerous phone  
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was sued by Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma Feliciano, 54,  
of Antioch, Calif., whose car overturned when Sprewell tried to 
drive his Mercedes-Benz back onto a freeway from an exit lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was  
sentenced to 90 days in jail, which he served under electronic home 
detention in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs asked for $450,000 in actual damages, plus two  
months of his $9 million salary for the upcoming season in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's attorney said the plaintiffs were trying to make  
minor injuries seem major and asked the jury to award $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas was awarded about $75,000 for economic and non-economic  
damages. Feliciano was awarded $30,000, mostly in economic damages.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Escapes Punitive Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) -- New York Knicks guard Latrell Sprewell  
was ordered Tuesday to pay about $105,000 to a man and woman 
injured in a highway wreck that he admittedly caused. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sprewell was not ordered by a Contra Costa County Superior  
Court jury to pay the pair punitive damages, which could have been 
costly to the former Golden State Warrior. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnulfo Perlas, 55, and Irma Feliciano, 54, were reportedly  
seeking total damages of $3.5 million, according to Sprewell's 
attorney, Richard Valerian. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine members of the 12-member jury said Sprewell did not act  
with malice in the March 1, 1998, accident. Sprewell was not in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas was awarded about $75,000 for economic and non-economic  
damages. Feliciano was awarded $30,000 mostly in economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased there were no punitive damages,'' Valerian  
said. ``The plaintiffs didn't deserve to be enriched any more than 
the economic damages in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Greenseid, an attorney for the plaintiffs, referred to  
Sprewell's infamous choking attack on Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo 
in admonishing the jury. Sprewell was suspended for 68 games by the 
NBA over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely disappointed that they let Mr. Sprewell walk  
once again from outrageous conduct,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perlas and Feliciano were treated for minor injuries after last  
year's wreck. But they testified the accident caused nightmares, 
depression and problems with relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell admitted in court that he caused the accident when he  
tried to drive his Mercedes-Benz back on the freeway from an 
exit-only lane near Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to  
90 days in jail, which he served under electronic detention at his 
Milwaukee home. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments Monday, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys  
said Sprewell has no remorse, and should pay the two $450,000 in 
actual damages plus two months of his $9 million salary in punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerian argued the plaintiffs' lawyers wanted to make the  
minimal injuries appear to be major and concealed the total amount 
they want: $3.5 million. Valerian suggested giving the pair 
$30,000.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox, Indians To Renew Rivalry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Put aside for a moment the fact that the  
Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox are meeting for the third time 
in five Octobers and consider why this might be the year's juiciest 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	There is:  
</P>
<P>
	--Pedro Martinez, baseball's best pitcher, trying to slow an  
Indians lineup that scored more than 1,000 runs in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bad blood stemming from two bench-clearing brawls in April when  
the team's exchanged beanballs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Boston manager Jimy Williams accusing the Indians of stealing  
signs last month by using a camera above the center-field wall at 
Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Need more? How about that both teams are trying to finally bring  
a World Series trophy to cities convinced that their teams are 
cursed? 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have a good series on our hands,'' Boston shortstop  
Nomar Garciaparra said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians and Red Sox don't particularly like each other, and  
this week they'll renew their sometimes testy rivalry in the 
postseason when their best-of-5 AL division series starts Wednesday 
night at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox will start Martinez (23-4) in Game 1 against the  
Indians, who are expected to counter with their ace, Bartolo Colon 
(18-5). Game 2 is Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The series seems too close to call. As Cleveland coasted into  
October, Boston was driving hard to secure the wild-card berth and 
make a run at AL East champ New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps an impartial outsider would be best to make a  
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Boston as a sleeper,'' said Toronto's David Wells, who  
beat the Indians on Sunday. ``They got Pedro. Pedro's the man this 
year. It's just something I feel. That's my pick. Boston. They've 
had all those years without winning it. Maybe this is their year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's Cleveland's year, too. Even the prospect of facing  
Martinez, 4-0 against them in two years, doesn't seem to concern 
the Indians, who have had to overcome injuries all year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could win three straight, that would be great, but  
that's going to be real hard,'' Indians catcher Sandy Alomar said. 
``Game 1 is always important. If you can knock out their pitcher 
right away, that's good. Every game counts, though. We need to win 
three. Whatever three, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the first one has been Cleveland's biggest problem the  
past few Octobers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have lost eight straight playoff openers, last  
winning a Game 1 in 1995 when they beat the Red Sox in 13 innings. 
Last year, Martinez and the Red Sox got off to a great start, 
winning the opener 11-3 before the Indians won three straight to 
advance to the ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez went 2-0 against the Indians during the '99 regular  
season, twice beating Colon in tight games. In his last start at 
Cleveland, Martinez struck out 14 in seven innings, but got a 
no-decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to beat Pedro,'' Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel said.  
``We have to show we can beat him. We beat him before and we have 
to do that again. The No. 1 game is always important to win. It 
doesn't mean anything if we go the full five games or seven games. 
It is just the first step. You want the first step, but it is more 
important to take the last step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 1 pitching matchup is but one of a number of  
interesting subplots in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	When the teams played at Fenway Park in April, a series of  
brushback pitches, the first by Cleveland's Jaret Wright, led to 
two bench-clearing incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, during Boston's most recent visit to Cleveland last month,  
Williams requested that a center-field camera at Jacobs Field be 
covered up. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and several of Boston's players accused the Indians of  
using the camera to steal signs. The Indians found the charge 
amusing but the AL took it seriously enough to ask Cleveland to 
keep the camera covered and to remove a video monitor behind their 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, for one, says what has happened between the teams before  
October is already ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that stuff with Jaret and them earlier this season is  
over,'' Alomar said. ``It was over back then. Now it is time to 
play postseason baseball. The bottom line is we have to eliminate 
mistakes and win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox got a scare last week when Garciaparra, the AL's  
leading hitter and an Indians killer this season, returned to 
Boston to have his injured right wrist examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, hit by a pitch Sept. 25, sat out the Red Sox final  
two regular-season games, but said he was set for Wednesday's 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah,'' he said. ``I'll be ready.''  
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra led the AL with a .357 average, but he was even  
tougher on the Indians, batting .451 with five homers and 17 RBIs 
in 12 games to help the Red Sox win the season series 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
	But Garciaparra knows regular-season records mean nothing now,  
especially against a team with as much postseason experience as the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the postseason, and we know what they can do,''  
he said. ``They definitely have a lot of veterans, and they've been 
in the postseason before. They know how to win. We played them last 
year and they knocked us out. Hopefully, we can turn it around this 
year. We know we've got a good series on our hands.''

<HEADLINE> Monsanto Won't Test Sterile Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Monsanto Co., one of the giants in  
agribusiness, has promised not to experiment with biotechnology 
that leaves seeds sterile -- a possibility that has raised fears 
among critics of gene manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto Chairman Robert B. Shapiro said concerns have made it  
important to stress his commitment against the practice of 
manipulating three genes to make a seed good for only one planting 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments were contained in a letter sent to Gordon Conway,  
president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which says gene-altered 
crops can help reduce world hunger but opposes the idea of sterile 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Conway called Monsanto's decision a first step in  
making ``the fruits of plant biotechnology'' available to poor 
farmers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Producing crops with infertile seeds -- dubbed the ``terminator''  
technology by critics -- could prove very valuable to 
agribusinesses, which already make genetically altered seeds 
resistant to insects and herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents fear companies could begin offering those traits only  
in sterile seeds, which would require farmers to buy them each year 
rather than replanting seeds gathered from mature crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto has been criticized over the issue even though it  
didn't develop the technology, hasn't done research on making 
sterile seeds and doesn't expect sterile seeds to become a 
commercial prospect for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The terminator technology was developed by the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture and Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co., the world's largest 
cotton seed company. 
</P>
<P>
	It was patented in 1998, two months before Monsanto offered to  
buy Delta, a bid awaiting antitrust review by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said Monday that it would continue trying to commercialize  
the seed sterilization technology based on its agreement with the 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system offers valuable uses for breeding and scientific  
purposes, as well as beneficial environmental qualities,'' said 
Harry Collins, Delta's vice president of technology transfer. He 
said the technology has been ``misrepresented'' by opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto spokeswoman Scarlett Foster said the St. Louis-based  
company still may use sterile seed technology in internal research, 
but will make sure no commercial products are infertile. She told 
The New York Times that it also would refuse to license the 
USDA-Delta project if the cotton seed company is acquired.

<HEADLINE> UAW Sets Deadline for Ford Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers on Tuesday in effect set  
a strike deadline of 3:30 p.m. Friday against Ford Motor Co., 
saying it would not extend its contract beyond then -- a sign talks 
could be intensifying. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Ford said the union made the decision and talks  
recessed for the day. Negotiations on a new contract to cover about 
100,000 employees were scheduled to resume Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel this is a normal part of the collective bargaining  
process,'' Ford spokesman Edward Miller said. ``Our negotiations 
are continuing in good faith, and we believe we can reach an 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiated new contracts with DaimlerChrysler AG,  
General Motors Corp. and GM's former parts unit without setting a 
strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW President Stephen P. Yokich said earlier this week he  
expected Ford to accept the same contract terms the UAW agreed to 
with DaimlerChrysler AG and General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler workers ratified their agreement last month,  
while GM and Delphi workers are scheduled to finish voting by Oct. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the union, the four-year contracts with  
DaimlerChrysler, GM and Delphi Automotive Systems give workers an 
annual raise of 3 percent a year, a $1,350 signing bonus and 
improved cost of living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies also agreed not to spin off any division into a  
separate business or close or sell any factories. That clause was 
expected to create some problems for Ford, which has plans to spin 
off or sell its Visteon parts unit. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW leaders have been vigorously opposed to a spinoff of  
Visteon, which has about 23,500 UAW members, saying it could lead 
to pay cuts, plant closures and fewer union jobs. During the Labor 
Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried signs depicting 
Visteon as ``the alien within'' Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	One labor expert said it wasn't clear whether the union was  
upset with Ford or simply wanted to speed talks along. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's out of character for what they've been doing,'' said Dale  
Brickner, an emeritus professor at Michigan State University. ``It 
could be a threat that they don't find whatever offer they have on 
the table acceptable.'' 
</P>

	A strike at Ford would be a sharp reversal of the company's  
relations with the UAW. Ford was the lead company in negotiations 
in 1993 and 1996. The last time the union held a national strike 
against Ford was 1976 -- during contract negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Riggleman Fired As Cubs Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jim Riggleman finished third in manager of the  
year balloting a year ago, so successful and popular after taking 
the Chicago Cubs to the playoffs that his contract was extended. 
</P>
<P>
	How quickly it all went away.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's without a job, fired after one of the Cubs' worst  
seasons in nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody involved felt that changes were needed, and maybe  
they were right,'' Riggleman said Monday after his dismissal by 
general manager Ed Lynch . 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel badly more than anything for my coaches. They were  
loyal and I'm going down with them. That's one silver lining. We 
will walk out together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman, coming off a 67-95 season on the heels of a 90-73  
mark and wild-card berth the year before, could never have 
predicted such a collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have blamed the many injuries that ravaged the pitching  
staff, the poor performances of veterans who played so well in 
1998, a farm system that wasn't ready, a few players who were 
unhappy with playing time, or a front office that didn't compensate 
when the season began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 46-year-old Riggleman stood at the end of the Cubs'  
clubhouse, in the same spot where he held postgame news conferences 
for most of his five seasons, and took the blame himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He hinted that, in some areas, he should have been tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know there were some things I probably should have done  
differently during the course of the season, and I didn't do 
them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just little things that just get away from you. You become  
indebted to what players have done for you and you start letting 
things go when you know in your heart you shouldn't be. The next 
thing you know, it festers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even Sammy Sosa's 63 homers could save the Cubs, who had the  
second-worst record in the National League and the team's worst 
since 1980, not counting the strike years of 1981 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman had a 374-419 record with the Cubs, including two  
90-game losers and one 90-game winner in the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes down to you got to win ballgames, and we didn't win  
enough,'' Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got nobody to blame. I think everybody has to be  
accountable. I'm accountable and this is the result of wins and 
losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riggleman, who managed two seasons in San Diego before coming to  
Chicago, couldn't stop a slide that began in early June when the 
Cubs were nine games over .500 and in second place in the NL 
Central. Chicago won only 26 of 77 games after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We underachieved as a team. The numbers don't lie,'' said  
Lynch, who decided to fire Riggleman about a week ago and promised 
the Cubs would be in a ``retooling'' mode next season 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it is necessary to change the perception or attitude  
or the direction of the club down in the clubhouse, and that's what 
I'm trying to do,'' Lynch added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deserve a lot of the blame for what has happened here, and I  
accept that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs offered Riggleman the chance to work in their minor  
league operations. He said he would consider it, but hopes to 
manage again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to manage,'' he said. ``If a good opportunity comes  
up, I would jump at it. I had a good opportunity here, and it 
didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Mark Grace came to Wrigley Field on Monday to say  
goodbye to Riggleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not his fault or the staff's. It's the guys between the  
lines, from Sammy to myself to the 25th guy,'' Grace said. ``We 
failed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also fired four coaches and said Cubs Hall of Famer  
Billy Williams, the bench coach with Riggleman, will be interviewed 
for the manager's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever comes in here will have some work to do,'' Grace  
predicted. ``We have some quality players, but we have some spots 
that need to be filled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's starting rotation that was a big part of the success a  
year ago fell apart in 1999, starting in spring training when 
Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood blew out his elbow. Steve Trachsel, a 
15-game winner, became an 18-game loser in 1999; and staff ace 
Kevin Tapani, who won 19 games a year ago, was hit by injuries, 
finishing the season on the disabled list with a 6-12 record. 
</P>
<P>
	And veteran players who helped the Cubs to the playoffs in 1998  
couldn't match their performances of a season ago -- namely Lance 
Johnson, Mickey Morandini and Gary Gaetti. For the second straight 
season, Jeff Blauser was a non-factor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs ended up with rookie Chad Meyers at second and Jose  
Nieves at short. 
</P>
<P>
	Also fired were pitching coach Marty DeMerritt, third base coach  
Tom Gamboa and first base coach Dan Radison, although the Cubs said 
they would be considered for positions after a new manager is 
hired. Bullpen coach Dave Bialas also was fired but will be offered 
another position. Hitting coach Jeff Pentland will be retained. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting Joe Altobelli, who managed one game, Riggleman was the  
Cubs' sixth manager in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said Williams is the only person on his list to be  
interviewed and said there was no timetable, but that he wouldn't 
drag out the process for three months.

<HEADLINE> Hutu Rebels Kill 12 in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Hutu rebels attacked two neighborhoods  
north of the capital and killed 12 civilians, a local official said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, some of whom spoke Kinyarwanda, the language of  
neighboring Rwanda, attacked the Bubanza and Kanga neighborhoods in 
the Kinama district on Monday night, said district chief Idi 
Viragucumura. 
</P>
<P>
	Viragucumura identified the attackers as members of the armed  
wing of Palipehutu, an extremist Hutu party. Various reports 
indicate these rebels occasionally carry out joint raids with 
Rwandan Hutu rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack followed another over the weekend in which five  
people were reported killed, although it was not clear whether they 
were civilians, rebels or Burundian army troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Burundi's 6.5 million people are Hutus, but the  
minority Tutsis have dominated the army and the administration 
since before the tiny Central African nation gained independence 
from Belgium in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Tutsi paratroopers in 1993 assassinated the country's  
first democratically elected president, a Hutu, more than 200,000 
people, mainly Hutu civilians, have been killed in fighting between 
the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations Security Council expressed concern Tuesday  
about the recent spate of attacks and the forced relocation of 
about 75 percent of Bujumbura Rural province's population. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 council members called for and end to the killings,  
looting and destruction and the peace process be revived, council 
president Sergey Lavrov of Russia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The final round of the yearlong peace talks, being held in  
neighboring Tanzania under the mediation of former Tanzanian 
President Julius Nyerere, were postponed for several weeks when 
Nyerere, 78, was hospitalized in London for leukemia. They were 
scheduled to resume this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mean time, Burundi's army said last week it had killed 30  
Hutu rebels in cleanup operations in and around the capital, after 
rebels killed at least seven people last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The army has forced more than 200,000 villagers into makeshift  
camps both to deprive rebels of possible support and to clear the 
way for counter attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	World Food Program spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said there  
were 267,000 displaced people in the Rural Bujumbura province 
alone, where the agency began distributing food in the camps on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a visit to several camps on Friday, President Pierre Buyoya  
acknowledged that life there was not comfortable. But he said the 
camps were created for people's own protection ``during the current 
exercises to restore security in Bujumbura Rural.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, nine political parties in Burundi announced on Monday  
the establishment of a new political group called National 
Convergence for Peace and Reconciliation.
