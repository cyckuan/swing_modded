NEW LAW INCREASES SCOPE OF HANDYMAN WORK (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _You just bought a new house and noticed that the
wrought iron gate to the spa in the back yard is busted, the wooden
fence is missing a few slats and the Santa Ana winds blew open the
gate and broke off the spigot for the garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   It's more of a nuisance than a disaster. But it's more than you
want to tackle. So who ya gonna call?
</P>
<P>
   Probably a handyman.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, thanks to a new state law that took effect Friday,
handymen can do even more work around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The new law calls for an increase in the ``monetary
jurisdiction'' of handymen. It simply ups the dollar threshold
before the job you have requires the skills of someone with a state
contractors license.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, if the cost of materials and labor exceeded $300, a
handyman needed a contractors license to do the job. Now the limit
is $500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, handymen must tell consumers that they are not licensed
even if the job is for less than $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good handyman is skilled in all of the trades and it is
really hard to find one that can do both electrical and carpentry.
But there are some out there,'' said Ronald F. Hammond, a Realtor
who specializes in residential property management.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, here are some tips to follow before making
that call:
</P>
<P>
   --Use the word-of-mouth network. Ask neighbors, co-workers or
real estate agents whom they would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask the person you hire if he has workers' compensation
insurance and then ask to see a copy of the policy. You could be
protected if the handyman is hurt on your job. If he doesn't have
workers' compensation, you could be liable if he injures himself on
your property.
</P>
<P>
   --Ask to see if he has a general contractors license. Some
handymen do and this is a plus because it shows the handyman has
extra skills.
</P>
<P>
   --Find out if the license is valid. The National &AMP; California
Contractor Referral and Contractors' License Bureau will check for
a $25 fee. It could be money well spent. The Web site is
www.contractorreferral.com.
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure the handyman has a business license.
</P>
<P>
   --Get a written contract that spells out the terms and
conditions of what will be done. Costs can be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   --If you think you'll frequently be using these kinds of
services, track down a copy of the ``Marshall &AMP; Swift Estimator.''
It is a book used by contractors and appraisers to estimate the
cost of various jobs. It includes everything from replacing a
washer on a leaky faucet to the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about $40 and is updated annually.

ONCE-BEATEN BUCKEYES WIN, AND NOW THEY CAN ONLY WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ohio, Texas)  (js) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Even when his team was leading Texas A&AMP;M by 24-7
late in the third quarter, Ohio State Coach John Cooper had the
pained expression of a desperate man trying to climb out of a pit
with its sides lined with sand. Many of the Ohio State fans among
the 76,503 here at the Superdome could feel Cooper's pain.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M has a way of doing that to opposing coaches and teams.
Entering Friday night's Sugar Bowl game, the No. 9 ranked Aggies
had five recorded victories this season after having trailed by 5
points or more. Texas A&AMP;M trailed Kansas State 27-12 with 9:20 to
play, before roaring back to tie the game 27-27 and eventually
winning it in overtime to take the Big 12 conference championship.
That game sank Kansas State's national championship hopes and sent
them spiraling from the Bowl Championship Series into the Alamo
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 minutes 22 seconds to play, Ohio State kicker Dan
Stultz's 47-yard field goal attempt clanked off the right upright,
leaving the Buckeyes with a 24-14 lead and leaving a crack for the
Aggies to squeeze through for another improbable comeback victory.
Then, the big question hung in the air: Could Ohio State beat fate?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they could and in the process the Buckeyes (11-1) were able
to hold on and defeat Texas A&AMP;M 24-14. Now, the Buckeyes must wait
for the outcome of Monday's Fiesta Bowl game between Tennessee and
Florida State to determine whether they can finish campaigning for
a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes were hoping that an impressive victory over the
Aggies, coupled with a loss by No. 1 Tennessee to Florida State in
the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night, would vault them to a national
championship. That's what Ohio State Coach John Cooper campaigned
for here this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Buckeyes still had to do their part against the Big 12
Conference champions Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M made it look easy on its first possession, going 59
yards in six plays and taking a 7-0 lead on a 9-yard run by
tailback Dante Hall. But it was fun while it lasted: that was the
last time the Aggies scored in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State took over from there, rolling to a 21-7 first-quarter
lead. As soon as quarterback Joe Germaine figured out that he could
pick apart the Aggies' zone coverage, he exploited it. And once the
secondary was riddled, Ohio State put its rushing attack in high
gear. The combination was lethal for the Texas A&AMP;M defense. If not
for a couple of brilliant plays to break up passes in the end zone
by cornerbacks Jason Webster and Sedrick Curry, the deficit would
have been even larger.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State scored its first touchdown on an 18-yard slant pass
from Germaine to receiver Reggie Germany that capped an eight-play,
71-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Aggies quarterback Branndon Stewart had trouble waiting for
receivers to complete routes downfield as Ohio State's blitzes and
coverages limited Texas A&AMP;M's options. What was left was not very
appealing _ short passes and predictable runs that left receivers
and running backs wearing tattoos after hard tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes turned running backs Michael Wiley and Joe
Montgomery loose on their next possession. The splendid blend of
speed (Wiley) and power (Montgomery) set the Texas A&AMP;M defense on
its heels. On second-and-4 at the Aggies' 39, Montgomery burst up
the middle for a 29-yard gain. On the next play, he plowed through
the middle again for a 10-yard touchdown that helped make it 14-7
Ohio State with 4 minutes 10 seconds to play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were stymied again on offense, and Shane Lechler's
punt was blocked by Ohio State safety Derek Ross, who had lined up
on the left end and came free. The ball was scooped up by Kevin
Griffin, who returned it 16 yards for a touchdown and a 21-7 Ohio
State lead with 1:59 to play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On their second possession of the second quarter, the Buckeyes
had a touchdown opportunity wiped out when Webster deflected a
25-yard strike from Germaine to David Boston in the end zone at the
last second. The Buckeyes gambled on fourth-and-1, and the Aggies'
defense dropped Wiley for a 2-yard loss. It was a great defensive
effort, but Texas A&AMP;M's offense remained in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' defense saved another touchdown late in the half
when Curry tipped away a pass from Germaine to Boston, who was open
in the end zone on third-and-6 at the Aggies' 36. The Buckeyes were
forced to punt, although they initially lined up for a 54-yard
field goal before thinking better of it and calling a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State got a 31-yard field goal from Dan Stultz with 16
seconds to play in the half for a 24-7 lead. &QL;

UCLA OFFENSE FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Funny how the finger points. A month ago, UCLA's
offense blamed the defense for the devastating loss at Miami.
Friday evening, the pointing reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic how things work out,'' Bruins linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo said. ``Our offense couldn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a simplified version of what transpired in the Rose Bowl,
but true nonetheless. The defense may have played well enough to
win, but mistakes by the offense sealed the Bruins' fate in a 38-31
loss to Wisconsin before 93,872.
</P>
<P>
   Using five freshman starters, the defense overcame injuries to
safeties Jason Stephens and Larry Atkins and held the Badgers to
seven points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been good enough to secure UCLA's first Rose
Bowl win since 1986. But two second-half turnovers _ DeShaun
Foster's fumble and Cade McNown's interception returned for a
touchdown _ created a 14-point swing, and that was enough for the
Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That nail got the coffin going,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   So UCLA's two-year charge up the rankings ended where it began,
with back-to-back losses. Last year, it was Washington State and
Tennessee at the start of the season; this year, Miami and
Wisconsin at the end.
</P>
<P>
   In between, they carved out a school-record 20-game winning
streak. That was little consolation in a dejected _ but not divided
_ locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mad at one guy in there,'' said offensive tackle Kris
Farris, who was called for two drive-killing holding penalties.
``We were ready, and they just played better than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that, there was no doubt. The Badgers (11-1) are not the most
athletically gifted team that UCLA (10-2) has faced this season,
but they certainly are the smartest and most fundamentally sound.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, they did exactly what the Bruins expected: no
tricks, no fancy passing game, just smash-mouth, Big Ten football.
Massive tailback Ron Dayne ran behind a massive offensive line for
246 yards _ one yard short of a Rose Bowl record _ averaging 9.1
yards per carry. His four rushing touchdowns also tied a Rose Bowl
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch film of him and wonder how people could miss tackles
like they do,'' UCLA nose guard Ken Kocher said. ``Then you get out
there and think, `That's how they missed tackles.' He's really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA gained a Rose Bowl-record 538 yards, but it was a
deceiving. The Bruins never generated a consistent rushing game
(3.2 yards per carry) as the Badgers' line held its own against
Farris and Friends.
</P>
<P>
   In his final game, McNown threw for 340 yards and two
touchdowns, but it was far from his best performance _ in part
because starting receiver Brian Poli-Dixon missed most of the game
with a hamstring injury, allowing the Badgers to concentrate on
Danny Farmer during crucial situations.
</P>
<P>
   McNown was sacked three times, pressured throughout and had no
rhythm when the Bruins, trailing by a touchdown, took possession at
their 46-yard line with 1:42 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   First down: incomplete pass to Brad Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   Second down: incomplete pass to Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   Third down: incomplete pass to Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth down: McNown sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Really, UCLA lost the game much earlier, beginning with a wasted
possession early in the third quarter. After moving 74 yards in
seven plays, the Bruins had first down at Wisconsin's 6. But the
raucous Badgers fans crammed into the north end zone forced McNown
to call timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way would you think it would have been 65 percent Wisconsin
fans,'' UCLA fullback Durell Price said. ``You'd think it would be
the other way around. It was disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, the noise returned. McNown audibled at the
line of scrimmage, using hand signals to change the play from a
handoff to a pitch. But Foster mistakenly thought McNown had called
a handoff. At the snap, Foster moved towards McNown and was unable
to handle the unexpected pitch. The ball squirted forward,
Wisconsin recovered at its 2, and the Bruins were denied a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeShaun wasn't the only one who didn't get it,'' offensive
coordinator Al Borges said. ``That was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense held, and UCLA closed to 31-28 on Jermaine Lewis'
10-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter. On the second play
of the fourth, facing third-and-9, McNown underthrew Foster on the
right sideline. Wisconsin's Jamar Fletcher intercepted and raced in
for a touchdown that gave the Badgers a 38-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad decision in retrospect,'' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   One fumble and one interception equals two turnovers, a 14-point
swing and a loss that will last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played bad in the first half and good in the
second,'' guard Andy Meyers said. ``In the first half, the offense
played good. In the second, we turned it over two times. It's
unfortunate how we played.''

BURNED BOYS IN CRITICAL CARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two boys who were badly burned when a suspicious
Christmas tree fire engulfed their Val Verde home remained in
critical condition Friday at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman
Oaks Hospital, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both remain on respirators. Not much has changed, which is
what we expected _ and therefore, that's good news,'' hospital
spokesman Larry Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time to get better from these kind of
injuries, and that's why any dramatic change is not for the good.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons are scheduled to operate on Shawn Williams, 17, today
to remove dead and dying tissue from the burns that cover 43
percent of his body, Weinberg said. Burn areas will be covered with
cadaver skin in an effort to fend off infection.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also will insert a scope through his mouth and into his
airways to assess the seriousness of the burns inside his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Crawford, 7, is tentatively scheduled for similar
surgery Monday, if he has stabilized enough to cope with the
procedures. He had third-degree burns over 65 percent of his body.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, who are half-brothers, were receiving treatment to
keep their major organs functioning, Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping them quiet, comfortable and stable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were injured in the blaze, which broke out about
8:15 a.m. Thursday at 29016 Val Verde Road in the Santa Clarita
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Also injured in the blaze were Shawn's girlfriend, Patricia Lynn
Martin, 20, and the boys' aunt, Dawn Carter, 45. Both continued to
recuperate at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over 18
percent of her body, was listed in critical condition in the burn
intensive care unit. She had burns to her arms and back and was
suffering from smoke inhalation, hospital spokeswoman Adelaide
DeLaCerda said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was listed in fair condition with a fractured ankle,
DeLaCerda said.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the fire remained under investigation Friday. A
dispatcher at the Los Angeles County Fire Department said arson
investigators probably will resume their investigation Monday.

BRUINS' TIMING ALL WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ For the UCLA football team, the bane of an otherwise
auspicious season was a hurricane and a guy named Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   We predict you'll see rainfall during the Rose Bowl game before
you see another national-championship season that hinges on a
meteorologist's call. Watching the Bruins succumb to Wisconsin
38-31, one thing was as clear as the vista on another gorgeous New
Year's Day:
</P>
<P>
   They got jobbed. By the professionals tracking Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Because as soon as those good people made the determination that
the storm that devastated Haiti and the Dominican Republic had the
potential to pack a wallop in south Florida, it put the Bruins on a
collision course with Robo-running back Ron Dayne. The 5-foot-10
junior ended up leaving far more destruction in his wake at the
Rose Bowl on Friday than Georges did around the Orange Bowl the
last weekend of September.
</P>
<P>
   By pushing back UCLA's game at Miami, it afforded the
Hurricanes' football team time to hit its stride and the Bruins
time to hit the wall. The Bruins' pursuit of perfection hit a dead
end because they didn't play as well in December and January as
they had in September and October while their final two opponents,
it can be argued, played better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We peaked in the middle of the season,'' said junior offensive
lineman Kris Farris. ``Our best game was at Arizona (on Oct. 10).
Little did I know we were going to peak and go straight down.''
</P>
<P>
   As any member of the Bowl Championship Series committee will
tell you, 'tis a far graver sin to lose late in the season than
early on. The Bruins would have to agree, having seen 10-2 from
both sides now. They lost their opening two games in 1997 before
stringing together 10 straight wins and strung together 10 straight
wins this season before dropping their last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose the last two,'' said junior receiver Danny
Farmer, ``it just kind of overrides everything else that you've
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this about Farmer, there was no drop-off in his production;
he came through with 13 catches for 277 yards and three scores
against Miami and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the same could not be said for the defense; it gave up 750
combined rushing yards in the final two games. Dayne scorched it
for 246 yards, missing by one measly yard Charles White's
19-year-old Rose Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   The offense, on this day, wasn't much better. It ran into a red
man's curve at the north goal in the third quarter. Wisconsin fans
were wrapped around that end zone like a solid red scarf and they
made it hard for the Bruins _ who were appropriately designated the
visitors _ to hear a Cade McNown audible and that contributed to
freshman DeShaun Foster's fumble inside the Badgers' 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The upside is Foster will only improve in the next couple of
years. So, too, we trust, will the Bruins' postseason following.
Wisconsin fans were dressed louder than the Bruins faithful _ red
overwhelms powder blue any day _ and they made sure they were
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Why was anyone surprised so many of them made the trip out here?
Duh! Where would you rather ring in the New Year, in 75 degree
sunshine or 5 degree chill?
</P>
<P>
   No one in the crowd of 93,872 would have been shocked if, late
in the second quarter Gov. Pete Wilson had inspected the scene from
high overhead in the omnipresent blimp and promptly declared the
Bruins' defense a disaster area. By halftime safety Larry Atkins,
the captain of the unit and one of its two senior starters, had
joined a bandage brigade that already included erstwhile starters
Micah Webb, Pete Holland and Jason Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins suffered a sprained right knee and the Bruins never quite
recovered, though a patchwork lineup performed valiantly in holding
Wisconsin to a single score in the second half (Jamar Fletcher
intercepted one of McNown's passes and ran it in for the other
Wisconsin score in the final 30 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   It'll be fitting if Atkins ends up having to have a magnetic
resonance imaging test done on his knee. You see, the man who
invented the now ubiquitous MRI, Raymond Damadian, is a Wisconsin
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Andy Meyers will be graduating from UCLA later
this year. When he leaves he'll take with him fond memories of his
senior season. Before you quibble over the degree of success
achieved by this year's squad, listen to Meyers describe how the
identical 10-2 seasons are different:
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year our team had so much more talent,'' Meyers said.
``If we had had the heart and attitude and camaraderie on that team
that we've had from Day One this year, we would have won the (1997)
national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand this: it was the early losses last year to Washington
State and Tennessee that spurred the Bruins to re-commit themselves
to a common goal and to one another. In those failures were planted
the seeds of the success they since have enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   If the 16 Bruins starters who will return next year come back
meaner, leaner and more focused, it'll be safe to look back on this
season as an unqualified success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the young guys know what it's like to lose,'' Meyers said.
``We've won the Pac-10 title two years now and that gives UCLA
something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is strong, even if the finish was weak. &QL;

   Well, get out your kiddie pocket rulers, puck heads.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, even with the absence of superstars Keith Tkachuk
and Jeremy Roenick, can easily consider themselves in the same
company as the league-leading Stars after their gutsy effort Friday
night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before their seventh consecutive sellout crowd in a game
of inches, the Coyotes more than held their own in a 2-1 overtime
loss that was even closer than the final score indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the bounce at the end of the game, but it was
anybody's game up until that point,'' said Coyotes defenseman Deron
Quint, who couldn't have picked a better time to score his first
goal of the season. His rebound score with 33 seconds left in
regulation sent it to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played just as well as they did. Guys played hard. Guys
competed. Shoney (Coach Jim Schoenfeld) came up with a great
system, everybody followed it, and we pretty much shut them down.
We could have scored three or four goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull scored the biggest one, driving home Mike Modano's
sliding reach pass in front of the net just 37 seconds into the
extra five-minute period. The goal extended the Stars' club-record
unbeaten streak (11-0-3) to 14 games, matching the longest of the
season, set earlier by the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix defenseman Keith Carney shadowed Modano into the
Coyotes' zone, knocking him off the puck. But sliding on his
stomach, Modano, who had given Dallas a 1-0 lead four minutes into
the third period, stretched out and managed to tip it over to Hull
for the one-timer that beat Nikolai Khabibulin, who had 29 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a replay of it yet,'' Carney said, ``but I'll
be watching them (today) for sure. I didn't think he could get it
over there, but he's got that long reach and made a good play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (21-8-4) pressured Dallas starting goalie Roman
Turek during the final minutes of regulation, but couldn't get
anything past him until Quint brought the crowd to its feet by
knocking in a missed shot from Shane Doan.
</P>
<P>
   Turek turned away 26 other shots, though, to remain unbeaten
(6-0-2) as Eddie Belfour's backup and to keep the Stars (24-5-6)
rolling. Coach Ken Hitchcock said the 14-game streak is just part
of the reward for hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that winning feeling that you don't want to let go
of,'' he said. ``It's like a racehorse that's winning a lot of
races. You just want to keep running it week after week until it
just runs out of gas, then you kind of rest it, and then start it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first period in which they skated with the
Stars stride for stride _ and may have actually outplayed them,
considering the circumstances _ the Coyotes had an excellent
opportunity to grab the lead with 13:17 left in the second. That's
when the Stars' Brian Skrudland went to the penalty box with a
double minor, putting Phoenix on the power play for four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland took down Quint on a two-on-one rush set up by Daniel
Briere, and then he was hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct for
yapping about the call with referee Rob Shick.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coyotes, who have been struggling on the power play all
season, couldn't convert. With 12 seconds left in the four-minute
advantage, they got another chance when Modano was whistled for
hooking Jyrki Lumme. But again, nothing. The Stars killed off that
penalty, too, just as they did two others in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It extended the Coyotes' skid to 0 for 13 to that point, dating
back four games earlier, when Phoenix broke loose with three
man-advantage goals in eight tries against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes should have been awarded another power play in the
first, but the two-man refereeing crew of Shick and Dennis LaRue
missed it. It happened behind the Dallas net, when Modano
high-sticked Doan above the right eye, which opened up a nasty cut.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, meanwhile, which has ranked at or near the top of the
league all season with a dominating power-play unit, probably felt
like complaining a little bit, too. The Stars, who entered the game
having scored an NHL-high 40 goals with the man advantage, went on
the power play only once during the first two periods. &QL;

HERE ARE TICKETS, WHERE ARE FANS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a national championship football game in town Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But Valley ticket brokers are wondering whether anyone cares.
</P>
<P>
   They say that they already are buying tickets from bummed
speculators at their $135 face value and that the price is expected
to tumble below that by kickoff time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to offer below face value, I could buy a lot right
now,'' said Reed Simon, owner of Team One Tickets and Sports Tours
in Tempe. ``But I don't want to be stuck with more than 20 tickets
come game day the way things are going.''
</P>
<P>
   The best seats in Sun Devil Stadium on the 50-yard line, which
started at $950, have fallen to $375, and slightly less prime areas
are going in the $150 range, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and other ticket brokers blame it on Florida State. They
say that losses by Kansas State, UCLA and Ohio State _ which opened
the door for the Seminoles to play in the championship game _ have
sent the market into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Simon says he hasn't been able to sell an
upper-deck end zone seat for any price. It certainly hasn't helped
matters that both schools are from the other side of the country.
But it's been downright fatal that Florida State has a previous
loss and doesn't seem to generate passion on a mass scale, Simon
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that no one expected Florida State to sneak in
like this,'' said Marty Fettman, spokesman for Ticket Connection in
Phoenix. ``We were all counting on UCLA, Ohio State and Kansas
State coming here. The dreams have been ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Fettman wouldn't say how many tickets he had sold but ``they
haven't been flying out the door, to put it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This just isn't the right match-up, at least for us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fettman also said he expects the price of some tickets to fall
below $100 before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   But one central Phoenix ticket broker, Bob Tuma of Ticket
Exchange, wasn't buying into all the negative thinking. He was
still trying to get $175 for goal-line seats in the upper deck and
$250 for seats in the area of the 10-yard line. Tuma had no
customers at midafternoon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Seminole fans without tickets also haven't been opening their
pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Simon says that Tennessee fans have purchased 476 of the 500
tickets he has sold thus far, Florida State backers only 18. Even
more depressing, he has sold only six tickets to people from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been absolutely no local interest. If you asked 10
people, six of them wouldn't even know who was playing,'' Simon
said. ``You need two unbeatens and it helps if they are titans, the
last of the unbeatens. But neither of them can be from Florida
because those schools are the weakest at sending people.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon said he sold about 800 tickets for the 1996 Fiesta Bowl
national championship game between Nebraska and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those tickets bottomed out at about $225 apiece. But that had
everything to do with the fan interest from Nebraska and little to
do with Florida,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no Cornhuskers this time around. Fettman, however,
is holding out hope that he can at least score one major deal. He
said he has a luxury skybox with 18 seats on the 50-yard line that
he is trying to sell for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll have to parcel it up to small groups and reduce the
price,'' Fettman said with a moan. ``Yeah, that's probably going to
be what happens.'' &QL;

JAKEMANIA REACHES PEAK  
 WITH HIS PAST BEHIND HIM, QB'S STOCK SOARS WITH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can he walk on water? Leap over buildings? Coax rain out of a
dry sky?
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Cardinals fans, the real question is, What
``can't'' Jake Plummer do?
</P>
<P>
   In less than two seasons as the team's quarterback, he has
established himself as the most popular athlete in the Valley. The
Snake has enchanted the populace with scrambles, dives, timely pass
completions and comebacks, beating almost impossible odds. And
don't forget that staggering contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Jake Plummer Show has been the hottest ticket in town.
Teammates and opponents sing his praises. Analysts gush; fans are
ecstatic; charitable causes are grateful for his support. The media
can't get enough of him. During the past week, he has been
virtually off-limits for daily interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's success has been parlayed into a huge new deal: a $15
million signing bonus, the largest in NFL history, as part of a
four-year contract extension worth $29.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contract and his penchant for last-minute heroics,
from his days as ASU's Rose Bowl quarterback to the present, he
remains refreshingly down to earth. He exudes youthful earnestness.
Plummer says that cordial relations with fans will be an easy chore
if they recognize that he can't always spend as much time with them
as they would like. He also said he ``won't be a jerk and tell
people to get out my face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the support around the Valley,'' said Plummer, who
also talked about the flip side, that it's nice sometimes to be
treated like the average Joe. He laughed as he recalled going this
week to see the movie ``Patch Adams,'' pulling a baseball hat over
his eyes and not being recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has done more than lead the Cardinals to the National
Football League playoffs for the first time since their arrival in
Arizona. He has virtually erased the ghosts of indiscretions past.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a couple of years ago that Plummer was embroiled in
a bitter battle over his conduct in a Tempe nightclub. The passage
of time, helped no doubt by on-field success, has all but
obliterated the public's memory of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of groping the women _ something he said he
didn't do _ but he did admit that he ``was wrong'' to kick a woman
outside the club.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer doesn't talk about the incident, and his teammates are
more interested in the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership,'' offensive teammate Lomas Brown said. ``That's
the thing about Jake. It's his leadership qualities even more than
his athletic ability. He has a knack for leading this team in the
last few seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, one of the most respected players in the NFL, said that,
to his knowledge, no one on the team has ever brought up Club Rio.
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, the March 23, 1997, incident is ancient
history in almost every corner. Even the lawyer for three of the
four women involved is happy to see Plummer doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for the clients, I haven't talked to them about
that, but I can say, generally, that he is a positive image for the
community,'' attorney Ed Novak said. ``He presents himself very
well both in the media spotlight and out of the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to hope that his actions at Club Rio were
aberrant behavior, and as time goes on my feeling about it will
probably be confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct charges,
receiving two years' probation, rather than fight the felony sex
abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   Novak said the women involved won't talk about the case, saying
they wanted closure. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Rallying the city'
</P>
<P>
   The Jake frenzy is contagious, and most Cardinals fans,
including Chris Ferrara of Phoenix, are caught up in it. Plummer's
No. 16 is the most popular sports jersey in town, and it's a tossup
as to what's harder to find, the jersey on a store rack or a
Plummer detractor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``This could be the start of a dynasty,'' Ferrara said. ``Jake
could be another (John) Elway or (Dan) Marino. His comebacks have
been awesome. His success has overshadowed anything bad that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fan, Jim Greenhalgh of Paradise Valley, said Plummer's
attitude is a big thing in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems nonchalant about the big contract,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pulled this team together. His past? It never comes to
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to find a Plummer detractor, but it's not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the Club Rio incident) definitely colors my perception of
him,'' said Vicky Frechette of Phoenix. ``In general, and I'm not
necessarily talking about Plummer, I'm disgusted with the behavior
of a lot of athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Garth Jax, the Cardinals NFL program/community outreach
coordinator and a former linebacker for the team, thinks Plummer is
light-years removed from Club Rio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done his penance,'' Jax said. ``It's a testament to his
character, and he has been rewarded (with a new contract). He's not
a taker; he's a giver. He's the total package and a hero to a lot
of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's rallying more than this ballclub. He's rallying this
city.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Endorsements aplenty
</P>
<P>
   During the Chargers-Cardinals game, a commercial promoting
Plummer was shown on Channel 5 (KPHO). Cutouts of the quarterback
decorate the aisles at some Bashas' stores, in place to help
promote the sale of cancer cards from Phoenix Children's Hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's agent, Leigh Steinberg, represents many high-profile
players and also puts emphasis on developing his clients' images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is to take it slowly at first,'' said Jamey
Crimmins, the director of athlete services for Integrated Sports
International, the group that handles off-field activities for the
athletes it represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has endorsement-related deals now with Nike and Logo
Athletics, and locally with Sprint. We want to develop his
community involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, continued on-field success will lead to more
opportunities down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Crimmins said big contracts don't necessarily lead to fat
endorsement deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because of his contract; it's his play,'' Crimmins
said. ``He's one of the most exciting players in the league. We
have been getting more calls lately about him.''
</P>
<P>
   One huge plus in Plummer's favor on the endorsement trail is his
induction into the NFL Quarterbacks Club.
</P>
<P>
   The only method of gaining entrance into the elite group is a
yearly vote of peers. Crimmins said that for a player in the early
stages of his career, being a member of the club is ``quite an
honor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TD for charity
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has been involved in a number of charitable ventures in
the area in the past two seasons, and every appearance has served
to solidify and multiply his fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer will contribute $250,000 to Cardinals owner Bill
Bidwill's favorite charity, and he plans to set up a scholarship at
his old high school in Boise, Idaho, and to begin a rebuilding of
the athletic facilities there. He also will create an endowment at
ASU that will support a student each year, and the newly created
Plummer Foundation will deal with ill and abused children and
assist in funding for research into Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, he has been great for that team and great
for this community,'' attorney Novak said.
</P>
<P>
   Is he rooting for his former courtroom adversary?
</P>
<P>
   ``As for separating my representation, yes, I am a Plummer
fan,'' Novak said. ``I like the guy. I think he's a decent enough
guy.'' &QL;

PLAYOFF WIN IS CARDS' NEXT HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ They've broken through so many barriers, this
little Cardinals team that couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't win on the road, on artificial turf, indoors,
against AFC teams or in close or pressure games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of bad history,'' outside linebacker Jamir
Miller said. ``If we looked back at that history, we'd be home
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A 16-13 victory over San Diego last Sunday ended the NFL's
longest playoff drought at 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be the kings of mediocrity,'' offensive
guard Chris Dishman said.
</P>
<P>
   The next door for the Cardinals to knock down is trying to beat
Dallas in Texas Stadium for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (9-7) play Dallas (10-6) today in an NFC wild-card
game, their first playoff appearance in a non-strike season in 23
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff is made to fall,'' Miller said. ``We've got the
bulldozer out. It hasn't stopped rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals win today, they will get their first playoff
victory since 1947 when they were located in Chicago and won their
only NFL title.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the year my dad was born,'' center Aaron Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wasn't even born yet,'' Dishman said. ``I think Lomas
was playing on the 1947 team.''
</P>
<P>
   That was another gratuitous shot at offensive tackle Lomas
Brown, the team's 13-year pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares if we haven't won (a playoff game) since 1947,''
Graham said. ``This is the 1998 team.''
</P>
<P>
   The '98 team heard in the off-season how it couldn't win on the
road, particularly on artificial turf in domed stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in Week 4, they beat the St. Louis Rams, 20-17, on Sept.
27 at the Trans World Dome. They finished with a 4-4 record on the
road, their best mark since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all the things we heard, all the negativity, we didn't
allow that to affect us,'' Graham said. ``When we had a rough start
(0-2), everybody said we were the same old Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a point in your career when you have to say,
`Enough is enough.' It's like what (offensive coordinator) Marc
Trestman said, `It's not about them. It's about us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Cardinals played nine games that came down to
the final minute or overtime and won only three.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they played eight games that were decided by three
points or less and won seven, an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   The past three weeks, they've won on Chris Jacke field goals on
the final play, including a 52-yarder that beat the Chargers last
Sunday and sent them into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all they've heard this past week was that they didn't
deserve to be in the playoffs because of their failure to beat a
team with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   They only played one _ the Cowboys twice _ and could have been
blown out in each game.
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener at Texas Stadium, the Cowboys, behind
running back Emmitt Smith's 124 yards rushing, routed the
Cardinals, 38-10. It was the Cardinals' most lopsided loss in 30
games.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rushed for 242 yards and three scores in Dallas' two
victories over the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you have to do is be disciplined against
him,'' defensive tackle Bernard Wilson said of Smith. ``People
(defenders) put the game on their shoulders and get out of
position, and he'll exploit that. If you let him rack up yards, it
opens up their passing game, and either way they go, they can make
it a miserable game for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who have lost 16 of their past 17 games against
the Cowboys, did little offensively in their last trip to Texas
Stadium. They had eight series of four plays or less, including
five consecutive ``three and outs'' in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   They gained only 205 yards, their lowest total in 28 games, and
didn't convert a third-down conversion in 10 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give ourselves a chance,'' second-year quarterback
Jake Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rematch, the Cardinals fell behind, 28-0, before Plummer
led a furious rally. He threw for 314 second-half yards and 465
overall, the second-most allowed by the Cowboys in team history.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with Plummer throwing to Cardinals wide receiver
Rob Moore in the right corner of the end zone. Replays showed Moore
was mauled and that pass interference should have been called on
cornerback Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   No flag was thrown and the Cowboys were victorious, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second half gives us confidence going into this game,''
Graham said. ``They had a big lead. We had to find a way to get
back in the game, and we could have scored even more points.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in time, the problem we had with our offense was
we weren't starting fast. Then, we went to the `no-huddle' and, in
the following weeks, put up the most yards in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was in the regular season. Now the Cardinals are in the
playoffs, which is foreign ground for all but 11 of their players,
who have been in a total of 46 postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, meanwhile, have 225 games of playoff experience.
But Dallas first-year Coach Chan Gailey thinks that will help the
Cowboys for only the ``first minute'' of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veterans on this team and other people I've talked to say
that as big a step as it is from the preseason to the regular
season, the step from the regular season to the playoffs is even
bigger,'' Plummer said. ``It is that much more intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going be intimidated. It will help us that
we've been in so many close games.'' &QL;

SEMINOLES LINEMEN BULK UP ON ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-OFFENSIVE LINE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of last season, Florida State's returning offensive
linemen were given a mandate: Become bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles had been pushed around in the final regular season
game in 1997, a 32-29 loss to Florida, and weren't able to run the
ball when they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Jason Whitaker did his part, gaining 36 pounds
up to 306. His colleagues did the same, gaining anywhere from 15 to
30 pounds. The line averages about 6 feet 5 { and 305 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker understands the need for the extra weight, but lugging
it around isn't so pleasant, even when you are 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, I'd play at 225 pounds,'' Whitaker said.
``Three hundred pounds wears and tears on the body. It's just not
healthy in everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker was feeling the effects Monday when the offensive
linemen ran ``gassers'' at the conclusion of practice. After
completing the required 16, Whitaker collapsed face down on the
practice field at Mountain Pointe High School.
</P>
<P>
   His mom would not have been happy. When Whitaker went away to
school, she told her son not to bulk up to 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Momma, I'm going to revolutionize the offensive
line position. I'll be an All-American at 245 pounds.' All I was
was an All-American rag doll.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, a junior, is the dean of the starting offensive
linemen. Starting tackles Ross Brannon and Tarlos Thomas, guard
Jerry Carmichael and center Jarad Moon are sophomores. All of the
backups are sophomores except for center Eric Thomas, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still feeling their way around a little bit,'' said
offensive coordinator Mark Richt.
</P>
<P>
   This line should be a dominating group for years to come, and a
few of them will be pushed next year by some impressive freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we signed the best class we've ever signed up front
last year,'' Richt said. ``I think we have five potentially great
college football players.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, has seen growing pains. The Seminoles have
yielded 38 sacks, twice as many as last year. Part of the reason
for the increase was quarterback Chris Weinke, an accurate passer
who is not known for his mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke is injured and his replacement, Marcus Outzen, is more
mobile. Whitaker said the offensive line still has to protect
better Monday against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two quarterbacks (Weinke and Dan Kendra) hurt in the
same year, and we gave up a school record for sacks. We're doing
well, I guess,'' Whitaker said when asked to assess the line's
performance. The inconsistency is not unexpected, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you get baptized, the preacher might hold you
under the water a little more than you'd like,'' Whitaker said. &QL;

TERRY BOWDEN LYING LOW  
 EX-AUBURN COACH REFLECTS ON JOB, FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
 SONS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While his former colleagues have been busy coaching in bowl
games or racking up frequent-flyer points while recruiting, Terry
Bowden has not just been sitting idly at his Auburn, Ala., home.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on a field trip with a second-grade class, attended
PTA meetings, watched youth basketball and soccer games, visited
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's in the Valley, watching his father, Bobby Bowden,
prepare his second-ranked Florida State football team to play No. 1
Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is life after playing football, and there is life after
coaching football,'' said Terry Bowden, 42, who has six children,
including five under the age of 9.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has had plenty of time to spend with his kids since
midseason, when he resigned as Auburn's head coach when it became
apparent to him that he would be fired at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is in no hurry to return to coaching and plans to take
the next year off. He probably will spend part of it working in
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still rehashing some old things and healing some old
wounds,`` Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowden family has endured all the vagaries of the collegiate
coaching profession this season, from Terry's midseason resignation
to his older brother Tommy, 44, coaching Tulane to an undefeated
season, then leaving before its Liberty Bowl game to take the head
coaching job at Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the senior Bowden, 69, enjoyed a magical end to the
season when two teams ranked ahead of the Seminoles lost on the
last weekend, placing Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl. Another of
his sons, Jeff, coaches the receivers at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud of Tommy, and he is so deserving,'' Terry said.
``I think it gives you great perspective about this business.''
</P>
<P>
   When Terry arrived at Auburn, Tommy was under considerable heat
as Pat Dye's offensive coordinator. Now, Terry can't help but smile
at Tommy's climb to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you have to handle the adversity. I
considered this year _ when we had to go through six centers _ as
that year that every coach has to go through, when you're tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bowden watched his brother's news conference when he was
hired at Clemson and thought back to when he was hired at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made the statement that he swaggered up to the podium
with incredible confidence,'' Terry said. ``I said, `That's Tommy
swaggering?' I see a little bit of me in him when I seem him doing
interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Bobby Bowden said, a school would stick with a
coach through tough times. That's how he survived at West Virginia,
despite going 4-7 in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody wins all the time,'' Terry Bowden said. ``My
dad's had one national championship in his life and never been
undefeated at the end of the season in his life. But it (the
possibility of being fired) is a given going in. If you say, `Gee I
didn't expect this,' well, what are you, an idiot or something? If
you go into the business and rise to level of head coach at a major
Division I school, you have to be in a vacuum to not know there is
a lot of pressure and instability.'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
UNHERALDED FULMER HAS HARD TIME BEING NOTICED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than two decades ago, Phillip Fulmer turned to his
roommate, John Stucky, and reflected on the greatness of
Tennessee's football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to be the head coach there some day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer was an anonymous assistant at Wichita State at the time,
and like hundreds of anonymous assistants, he longed for a top job
at a big-time program. He got it, and today he has the Volunteers
on the verge of a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone noticed?
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one's Fulmer?'' a Fiesta Bowl volunteer whispered
Thursday at media day festivities for Monday's national title game.
</P>
<P>
   Which one, indeed. For all the 48-year-old has accomplished at
Tennessee _ and there has been plenty _ few could pick him out of a
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   It borders on bizarre. He has coached Tennessee to four
consecutive top-10 finishes and sports the best career winning
percentage (.857) in college football, but all many seemed to care
about was his five-game losing streak to the Florida Gators, which,
mercifully, ended this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, even though the Volunteers won the Southeastern
Conference championship, Georgia Coach Jim Donnan beat out Fulmer
for SEC Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing to me because I think Coach Fulmer
deserved it,'' linebacker Raynoch Thompson said. ``He doesn't get
the national hype from a coaching standpoint that he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Fulmer's team finished 12-0 this year, the
Volunteers are five-point underdogs to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Athletic Director Doug) Dickey tells me all the time, `If you
can lay your head on the pillow at night and know you've done the
very best that you can do, that's all you can do,' '' Fulmer said.
``I don't worry about it. I don't read papers and don't listen to
talk shows. I surround myself with my friends who I can tell to
shut up if I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were questions about his coaching ability, they were
put to rest this season. The Volunteers went undefeated, despite
having to groom a new quarterback, losing a star running back for
two-thirds of the season and needing to pull out four victories in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One can't help but wonder if the previous presence of star
quarterback Peyton Manning hurt the perception of Fulmer. Sometimes
great players make things look too easy, and it didn't help matters
that the Volunteers couldn't beat Florida during Manning's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer appears to have found peace, personally and
professionally, this season.
</P>
<P>
   He committed himself to being at home Wednesday and Thursday
evenings during the football season, something he hasn't done in
years. For the most part, he is an 18-hour, seven-day-a-week guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we'd be lucky to get a little piece of him after a
football game,'' his wife, Vicky, said. ``He'd be up and gone
Sunday morning, and we literally wouldn't see him until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I think he realized his girls (Courtney, 15;
Brittany, 13; Allison, 12) aren't going to be in the house that
much longer. I think he realized he and I hadn't been touching base
that much through the last couple years and that we needed to work
on our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over in 1992, he's made it a point of having his
three daughters involved in as much of his football life as
possible. One of his daughters can always be spotted working as a
ball girl during games.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the idea was met with resistance by Tennessee's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was something I really pushed for because I felt like
when a coach has sons, they're at practice, they're in the locker
room, they're really a part of their dad's profession,'' Vicky
Fulmer said. ``I really saw my girls getting pushed away. College
football is a male's world. I was adamant that I wasn't going to
get left behind, and I wasn't going to let my children get pushed
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some feared the girls could get hurt or hear offensive language.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've probably heard worse from me,'' she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Not many pejoratives can be heard from Phillip Fulmer's mouth.
His greatest strength, those around him say, is his poise, which
has allowed him to weather the occasional storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levelheadedness is not a hard thing for me,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   He does have his moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, you might catch him walking down the hallway, and he
may come up to you and joke with you and laugh with you and
stuff,'' linebacker Steve Johnson said. ``And other days he's
walking down the hallway and he has that look on his face, and you
know to watch out and not step on his toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trait that has served him well is his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to have a `t' that's not crossed and an `i'
that's not dotted,'' defensive coordinator John Chavis said. ``It's
just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer came to Tennessee in 1968 as an offensive lineman out of
Franklin County High School in Winchester, Tenn. After his playing
career in Knoxville and a brief apprenticeship as a graduate
assistant, he moved on to assistant stints at Wichita State,
Vanderbilt and back at Tennessee in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He took over the top job in 1992, replacing Johnny Majors in a
messy scene.
</P>
<P>
   After Majors underwent quintuple-bypass heart surgery, Fulmer,
then the offensive coordinator, led the team to a 4-0 start. When
Majors returned, the Volunteers lost three of their next five
games, and some critics suggested he had returned too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Majors said Tennessee then reneged on a promise to extend his
contract, and he quit before being shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   The event put a strain on Fulmer's relationship with Majors, who
perceived his assistant as opportunistic. When asked several years
later about Fulmer, Majors said, ``I don't have anything to say
about that guy.'' He could not be reached for comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   That got Fulmer off to a rocky start in some eyes, even though
he was successful immediately _ 10-2 in his first full season. He's
managed 10 wins in five of six seasons, but some fans couldn't get
past the losses to Florida from 1993 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was frustrating to me personally, but I didn't
let it play over into the football team,'' Fulmer said. ``I take
what some disgruntled fans may have to say with a grain of salt
because those are the same people who stand at the front of the
line when you're doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   He has quieted the critics this season and gained recognition,
though he's up for a tough comparison this week against Florida
State's colorful Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   His assistants insist Fulmer is funnier than most think. Vicky,
who has spent a little time with the Bowdens, ventures that
``Phillip's personality and Bobby Bowden's personality are very
much the same. He just doesn't allow (the media) to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the lack of recognition bothers Fulmer, he doesn't let on.
</P>
<P>
   There may be no more telling trait about Fulmer then a sign that
hangs in the locker room at the Neyland-Thompson Sports Center:
``It's amazing what you can accomplish when nobody cares who gets
the credit.'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
AT 69, COLORFUL BOWDEN WANTS TO BUILD ON LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-BOWDEN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reaching the status of legend in the college coaching profession
can be tricky. You usually don't get there until retirement age,
and once you're there, everyone wants to know how long you plan on
staying.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar question for Florida State's Bobby Bowden, who
at 69 has accomplished nearly everything a coach can. Among active
coaches, he's second to Penn State's Joe Paterno in victories and
bowl victories. His Seminoles teams have won 10 or more games for
12 straight years and finished the season ranked no lower than
fourth for the past 11 years, not counting this one. And Bowden can
earn his second national championship if No. 2 Florida State beats
No. 1 Tennessee Monday in the Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So why not retire, play golf in the mornings, take naps in the
afternoon and make it home most nights in time to eat supper with
your wife, Ann?
</P>
<P>
   Why not travel to Europe and visit all those World War II
landmarks, the places that captured your imagination when you were
13, bedridden with illness and following the war through the radio
in your home in Birmingham, Ala.?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's a bunch of dadgum reasons, as Bowden would tell
you. He already plays golf every day for three months a year, April
through June. Even during football season, he'll take a nap most
every day. He does make it home most nights in time for supper, and
football hasn't stopped him from traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he still loves the feeling of taking a bunch of
``boys,'' as he calls them, and molding them into a team that wins.
All that touchy, feely stuff wouldn't cut it if his boys lost
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses just kill me,'' Bowden said. ``I'd rather go 11-1,
11-1, 11-1, 11-1 than be 12-0, 7-4, 12-0, 6-5. If I lose four
games, I'm leaving. Of course, if we start 0-4 next year, I'm
changing that statement.''
</P>
<P>
   What might drive Bowden more than the thrill of winning is his
hatred of losing. He was that way even when he played at Woodlawn
High in Birmingham and in college at Howard, which later became
Samford University.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else about the profession bothers him much, not the
expectations of fans, the pressure of keeping the program at the
highest level, not even Florida Coach Steve Spurrier's occasional
snide remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `You must can't stand him,' '' Bowden said.
``But I kind of enjoy being around him. People don't bother me.
Losing games is something I just hate. It's a feeling that I
betrayed everybody. That nobody likes me anymore. It's an
inferiority problem, like people are ashamed of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his generation, Bowden is one of the sport's few remaining
icons. Paterno and BYU's LaVell Edwards are among his few remaining
contemporaries. Nebraska's Tom Osborne, Iowa's Hayden Fry and
Grambling's Eddie Robinson have all retired in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, too, thought he would be out of the profession by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was coaching at West Virginia when (Texas
Coach) Darrell Royal and (Arkansas) Coach Frank Broyles resigned
without a month of each other,'' Bowden said. ``They were 53 and I
remember thinking, `I guess when I am that old, I'll retire, too.'
''
</P>
<P>
   But here Bowden is, at 69, about to conclude his 33rd year as a
Division I head coach, his 46th overall, and not about to retire.
``I'm like the guy who said he wanted to retire one day before he
died,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bowden has heard that line from his father before and
doesn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know my dad, he's not going to die the day he gets off
the football field,'' said Terry, the former Auburn coach. ``He
loves coaching, but he loves playing golf. For him, I guarantee
there is going to be enjoyment when he gets through.''
</P>
<P>
   Few coaches run a program quite the way Bowden does. He has a
loyal staff and has endured very little turnover in recent years _
only one assistant since the 1993 championship season. Three
coaches have been with him for more than 10 years, including two
who have been at Florida State for more than 20.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning is that being an assistant at Florida State is
better than many head coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason is Coach Bowden,'' said offensive coordinator
Mark Richt.
</P>
<P>
   The staff's experience and familiarity with Bowden's
philosophies allow him to operate more as a CEO. He gave up
play-calling in the early '90s, when the outside demands on his
time became too great, and no longer watches hours of tape on
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   He can afford to take a nap most every afternoon and make it
home at a decent time most every evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think football has changed,'' said Bowden, in his 23rd
season at Florida State. ``It's gotten more scientific. When I
began to slip away from it (play-calling) was when (quarterback)
Charlie Ward was here and we were using the no-huddle. You simply
can't call that from the sideline. It was a different game all of a
sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   The time Bowden spends in game preparation has been cut back in
the past decade. Today, Bowden will look at tape of an opponent's
kicking game, to see if he can find an advantage there. And he'll
watch one tape of the opponent's offense as a gauge of how
productive his offense will have to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have to score 28? Do we have to score 40? Will 18 do it?
That's what I'm looking for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He watches tape of an opponent's defense and make suggestions to
Richt and other coaches, who do the brunt of the preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time,'' Bowden said. ``I used to. Now, I have to
go here, go there, do this and do that. Head coaches don't have
time for that anymore unless they are somebody who just wants to
shut everything else down.''`
</P>
<P>
   That's never been Bowden's way. He doesn't lock himself in his
office, emerging only when forced to attend weekly press
conferences. Bowden has those other interests, especially and World
War II history. He became interested in the war as a kid and can
still remember the day Germany invaded Poland.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family were taking a trip in a borrowed '37 Ford to a
river outside Birmingham when they saw someone selling ``Extra''
editions of a newspaper. The picture on the front captivated
Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was five German soldiers running across a field with hand
grenades,'' he said. ``As a 9 year old, that caught my eye.``
</P>
<P>
   Bowden turned 13 in 1943 and spent six months of that year
bedridden because of rheumatic fever. He passed the time by
listening to radio reports about the war, imagining what armies
were where, and anticipating what an general's next move might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Generals) have a lot of different makeups, and you can relate
it to coaching,'' he said. ``There are some generals who have the
virtue of audacity. They'd do things you wouldn't think they would
possibly do. Patton and Rommel were like that. Others were very
passive or were defensive, they would sit back and dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden used to be audacious. He earned a reputation at Florida
State for being a gambler, a coach willing to try darn near
anything, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we weren't winning in those days,'' he said. ``And I'd do
anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden still insists that his coaches put a few ``barnyard
plays'' in every game plan, but he doesn't use them nearly as much.
``When you're winning, you don't call them,'' he said. ``Now you
have good players and if you go out there and play the best you can
play, don't make mistakes, you're probably going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden hasn't changed much else about his style in recent years,
however. He still runs a program that's as open and accessible as
any in the country. He loves bantering with reporters, telling
stories and isn't afraid to speak his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so brutally honest and forthright,'' said Wayne Hogan,
the former sports information director at Florida State and now the
athletic director at Montana. ``He'll take people aback.''
</P>
<P>
   One year in the late 1980s, Hogan said, Florida State was
preparing to play Miami. Several writers from across the country
were in Tallahassee, so Hogan set up an interview with Bowden. When
the writers walked into Bowden's office, the head coach had his
bare feet up on his desk and was having his hair cut and eating a
salad at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all don't mind, do you?'' Bowden asked.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the writers playfully accused Hogan of setting it all
up. ``No, that's just him,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes time for everybody, not just the media,'' Hogan said.
``I saw fans wander in his office during the busiest times, and
he'd sit down and talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Devoutly religious, Bowden travels throughout the South speaking
at churches. He is a captivating speaker who could make what he ate

   And while he enjoys all those other parts of his life, he's not
quite ready to give up the challenges of coaching.

   ``I haven't reached the point of satisfaction yet,'' Bowden
said. ``As long as I'm coaching and have another game to play, I
can't reach the point of satisfaction. When I retire, I'll either
be satisfied or not. Right now, there is another game and another
year. If I'm healthy, I want to coach that year.'' &QL;

DESPITE NEGATIVE IMAGE, BIDWILL ON RIGHT TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is not what you expect, and very little of what you think.
</P>
<P>
   He is shy, untrusting, terrible in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   He tells a lot of jokes, the kind that are so unfunny they make
you laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He spends most of his time floating in the past, and if he
forgets your name, don't worry. There are probably days when he
forgets his own.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not the devil, no money-grubbing villain, nowhere near
the image that has shadowed him for the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a bad person. Rather, a very good person who happened
to be a very bad owner. But that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   And the more you're around Bill Bidwill, the more likable he
becomes. In the eccentric, round-the-bend uncle kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mr. Bidwill is a little strange. But aren't we all?
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill is an owner. He inherited his team. He moved his team.
And that trifecta will get you scorned every time.
</P>
<P>
   But just as there is a shroud of privacy smothering his
personality, there is a huge gap between myth and reality.
</P>
<P>
   The image: He is a miser. Legendary for his cheapness. Moths
terrorize his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The truth: Not since he moved to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The image: He doesn't want to win.
</P>
<P>
   The truth: Until recently, he didn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   The image: He is cold and distant, pleasant as a snake.
</P>
<P>
   The truth: He is extremely suspicious of strangers, downright
charming among friends. But even if he knows you, he might walk
right by you without acknowledging a hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans will always blame the owners for everything,'' said Larry
Wilson, former Cardinals player, current Cardinals executive.
``It's not only in Arizona. Pick up any newspaper in any city
across America and you're reading about the rottenest guy in town _
the owner. But Mr. B. has been maligned by the best of them, and I
don't think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started in St. Louis, a place where football has its
place, where there once existed, in order, the Cardinals and the
football Cardinals. A reputation was born, one that Bidwill claims
started with a couple of writers and snowballed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, here's the bottom line with Bill Bidwill and
why the shadow will always exist: He simply doesn't have the
communication skills to spin opinion. Or the energy. Or the desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like a lot of attention,'' said his son, Michael.
``Should he be criticized for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill is asked if he cares about his legacy. He flatly says
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all show business now,'' he said. ``I grew up in a
different era. When it was a sport. People want to hear from the
players, from the coaches, and around draft time, maybe from the
scouts. But they don't care what I have to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change myself. I'm not going to self-promote
myself. I'm not going to be something I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cardinals prepare for their first playoff game since
arriving in the Valley, Bidwill is enjoying a wave of good
publicity. But there are 11 years of history to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   I tell the son that his father doesn't care about his legacy. I
ask if he does, and the son stares ahead, past the practice field,
into dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ya' know, my father is a very good family man, and I love my
father,'' he said. ``I want people to like him. I'd like him to be
a very well-liked man, and all the thing that go along with
that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There are defining moments in everyone's life. Things that
happen that stay with you forever, shaping and molding the nuances
of your personality.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bidwill was 30 years old when he found out he was adopted.
Found out his given name was really Robert. Found out that his
brother, Charles a.k.a Stormy, wasn't really his brother. That both
had come from different families.
</P>
<P>
   He found this out after both his parents _ or at least who he
thought where is parents _ were dead. And he found out in a
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The story in brief: Two years after Charles Bidwill died in
1947, Violet Bidwill remarried a man named Walter Wolfner. When
Violet died in 1962, she bequeathed 82 percent of Cardinals stock
to her two boys, which didn't go over well with Mr. Wolfner.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfner took the matter to court on the grounds that boys had
misrepresented themselves at an heirship hearing, that neither had
told the probate judge they were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they had no clue.
</P>
<P>
   The case crawled along for three years until they settled out of
court.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it can be sunny on the outside while a hurricane brews
within. Internal scars are always impossible to gauge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   There is another misgiving about Bidwill, and it's all about
motive.
</P>
<P>
   He has made some bad decisions. He listened to bad advice when
he first came to the Valley, setting the highest ticket prices in
the NFL. He is resistant to change, which is bad. He's surrounded
himself with bad people. And he is loyal to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but how can you call loyalty a fault?'' Wilson asked.
</P>
<P>
   When you're too tolerant of failure, that's how. But Bidwill is
changing, fast and for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the Cardinals would never have thought to stage two
fan festivals, as they did this past week. America West reportedly
floated the idea of a Cardinals plane past the old man a few years
ago, and he wouldn't budge. That plane, painted in brilliant red
and featuring the logo, flew over Sun Devil Stadium last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill is a better owner because he's less of an owner, someone
who has finally surrounded himself with the right people. And he's
listening more and more to the two people with vision _ player
personnel boss Bob Ferguson and his son Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have grown by releasing a lot of control, by
listening to other people,'' Bidwill said. ``I've allowed myself to
be overruled by people in the organization when they have strong
arguments for something. Sometimes I'm right, and sometimes I'm
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a big man to relinquish control, especially when this
team is his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him what he does for fun and he responds by telling you what
he doesn't do (golf). He likes to relax at home. He goes to bed
early. He loves the History Channel and old movies and ice cream,
except ``the three-scoop deal is a thing of the past.'' Oh, and he
did not sleep with the game ball from last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a history major, and he is a World War II naval buff,''
Michael said. ``He served in the Navy, and if you go to his house,
he has like every book written, every ``Time/Life'' series. A real
history buff.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to work here, run this team,'' Michael said. ``This
is his life. And he loves to tell stories about the old days. I
thought I'd heard every one of them until I started working with
him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   What you won't hear is chest-thumping over the contributions he
makes to charity. Or crying over an explicit promise for a new
stadium that crumbled along with the old guard shortly after he
arrived. Or chirping for a new dome while telling you how much
money he's spent on prototypes and planning. That is all good
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You won't hear it because, somewhere along the way, Bill Bidwill
gave up. He quit trying to be liked, convinced himself not to care.
And he gave up the battle of perception, a battle he was never
qualified to win. &QL;

TOO LATE, UCLA DEFENSE SHOWS HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ UCLA went into the Rose Bowl with the most ridiculed
defense since Dan White and his Twinkies. The Bruins had an image
to restore after giving up 679 yards and 49 points to Miami in the
regular-season loss that kept them out of the national-championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was !ital!maligned!off!,'' head coach Bob Toledo
said, though he didn't say he thought it was undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, the Bruins did almost everything wrong
in the first half of their 38-31 loss to Wisconsin on Friday: They
missed tackles. They let the Badgers' 1,065-pound offensive line
push them around. And they watched (exactly the right word) as
tailback Ron Dayne set out on a pace to break Charles White's Rose
Bowl rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bruins defense did one last thing wrong: In the second
half, when its best player was injured and out of the game, when it
had undergone so many lineup changes you'd think Steve Lavin was
coaching football, when fans might finally have started to feel
sorry for the whole hapless lot, the defense came up with its best
performance literally in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   See, the Bruins had it in them all along.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of which caused any self-respecting wise guy on the
blue-and-gold side of the stadium to ask, ``Where was this
rock-solid defense when we needed it?''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti is asking himself the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) just yelled at 'em louder, I guess,'' Aliotti said later,
sounding more bewildered than he would have been if the defense had
continued to fail. ``They really bowed their necks a little bit in
the second half. For whatever reason, the guys responded a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins' first defensive series of the second half, in
which Wisconsin drove 89 yards for a 22-yard Dayne touchdown and
took a 10-point lead, they played 24{ minutes of shutout ball. Not
only that, but Dayne didn't get the record, finishing with 246, one
short of White's 1980 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was the Bruins' offense that gave up the last,
crushing Wisconsin touchdown on a fourth-quarter interception
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really ironic _ everybody criticized our defense, but it
was the offense that couldn't get it done when it had to,''
linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo said in a jibe that stirred the
embers of a locker-room civil war. ``The defense went out on a
positive note.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the theme of the evening for the defensive players,
especially the many young ones who, unlike the senior Ayanbadejo,
must work up some optimism for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore cornerback Marques Anderson: ``This is something to
build on. We're a young defense that you can expect to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman linebacker Santi Hall: ``We can take some good things
out of it and say the defense can do the job when it has to.''
</P>
<P>
   Heartwarming, huh?
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the young Bruins attributed their 24{-minute
revival less to substitutions or tactical changes than to a
collective summoning of will.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman nose guard Ken Kocher: ``To me it just seemed like we
came out and played tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore defensive end Kenyon Coleman: ``We didn't want to
repeat the Miami game, so we went in and strapped it on. We came in
(to the locker room at halftime) and said, `Hey, fellas, we've got
to walk the walk.'''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being Aliotti, wondering where the Bruins might have
been today, or where they might have been Monday when the Fiesta
Bowl settles the national title, if the defense had decided to walk
the walk in Miami on Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   That they did their best walking (since the victory over USC six
weeks ago) after star safety Larry Atkins hobbled to the sideline
with a knee sprain only magnified Aliotti's exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to play anybody that could give us effort,''
Aliotti said of his frequent substitutions, which often put three
true freshmen on the field.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the question: Do we permit the Bruins to feel good
about their too-little, too-late defensive show and what it
promises for 1999? Or slam them for the listless game-and-a-half
that preceded it?
</P>
<P>
   We'll side with Aliotti on this one when he says: ``Unless we
get a lot tougher, a lot more physical, and learn how to bow our
necks, it's not going to be much better than it was this year.
There is some talent there. But returning nine guys doesn't mean
you'll be good unless those nine guys are good.'' &QL;

NO TROUBLE FINDING TICKETS AT ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILLY WITZ &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The Wisconsin Badgers weren't the only winners at the
85th Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone showing up looking for a ticket was in luck, too.
</P>
<P>
   An hour prior to kickoff, ticket sellers were willing to take
well under half the $110 face value for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking $40 and we haven't had any luck,'' said Kara
Valdez of Hacienda Heights, who had been trying unsuccessfully for
15 minutes to sell two end-zone tickets. ``We're not looking for a
profit, but I never, ever thought it would be like this. We thought
people would do anything for these tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The game drew 93,872 _ the smallest crowd since 1944 _ but Rose
Bowl officials expected less since the stadium's capacity was
reduced this year as seats replaced benches in parts of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors contributed to the lukewarm interest in the
game:
</P>
<P>
   _UCLA's falling out of the Fiesta Bowl and into the Rose Bowl by
virtue of its loss at Miami;
</P>
<P>
   _Wisconsin's weak schedule;
</P>
<P>
   _and most importantly, this year's $35 increase in ticket
prices.
</P>
<P>
   It also marked for a sharp contrast in the '94 Rose Bowl between
the same two teams. Tickets sometimes sold for as much as $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a student then,'' said Mark Davidson, a UCLA alum who
had been trying unsuccessfully for a half hour to get $50 for a
pair of tickets. ``I remember standing at the Central Ticket Office
(on campus) and there were Wisconsin fans there with wads of $100s.
I'm really disappointed. It speaks to the poor participation of our
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only UCLA fans who were stuck with tickets. Some
Wisconsin fans who had been burned by arriving in Los Angeles
without tickets five years made the mistake of arriving this year
with too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll either take $20 for them or take them home as souvenirs
and write `UCLA spirit' on them,'' said Steve Householder of
Madison, Wis., who had been trying to unload a pair of end zone
seats for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Arizona was here, there'd be 30,000 people. With UCLA,
you're lucky to get the bus to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could find three kids to give 'em to I would,'' said Tim
Townsend of Milwaukee. ``Too bad they don't have a program with the
YMCA for underprivileged kids.''

FLETCHER'S ROLE NOTHING NEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ It figures the NCAA's leader in interceptions this
season would have a hand in impacting Friday's Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wisconsin redshirt freshman cornerback Jamar Fletcher
had two hands involved in the Badgers' 38-31 upset of UCLA in front
of 93,872 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's 46-yard interception return for a touchdown with
14:08 remaining broke open a close game and proved to be the
difference as Wisconsin handed UCLA another Rose Bowl defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I helped this team out a little bit this year,'' said
Fletcher, who finished with seven interceptions this season,
including a school-record three returned for touchdowns. ``But this
entire defense is a team thing and not just about individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But no freshman _ or defensive back for that matter _ in
Wisconsin history has had the impact of Fletcher, who broke Bob
Radcliffe's school record for interceptions returned for
touchdowns, set in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fletcher didn't allow himself to get caught up in his
heroic moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The interception) had a pretty big impact,'' Fletcher said,
``but with a team like UCLA, they have the ability to score in one
play. It didn't really mean anything because we had a lot of
football to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did give the Badgers the lead for good at 38-28; the
Bruins managed only a field goal the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first interception returned for a touchdown against
UCLA since last season's Cotton Bowl when Texas A&AMP;M's Dat Nguyen
and Brandon Jennings, using a lateral along the way, combined for
an 83-yard return.
</P>
<P>
   On the play Friday, UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, out of shotgun
formation, felt the pocket closing fast as Wisconsin's John Favret
and Ross Kolodziej came in from the right and left sides,
respectively, on a third-and-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all that played a big role in it,'' Wisconsin
defensive end Tom Burke said of the pressure. ``Fletch played his
man well, came back on it and scored a touchdown. Once he caught
it, I just thought, `I need to find someone to block.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher stepped in front of UCLA running back DeShaun Foster,
who flared out of the backfield and ran up the right sideline.
McNown said he thought Foster would come back for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I dropped back, the corner was way off DeShaun and I was
throwing it to hold him up,'' McNown said. ``DeShaun kind of kept
running and the guy made a play on it. DeShaun's not wrong for
doing that. I wish I had the throw back. I just expected him to
come back and he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said by the time he realized the ball was even thrown,
Fletcher already had read the play and ducked in behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Cade had pressure or anything, but I know he
released the ball a little early,'' Foster said. ``I couldn't stop
in time to get back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he made the catch, Fletcher had an open field in front of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just came right in my hands,'' Fletcher said. ``It
was clear sailing from there and I thought if I didn't score it
would have been a real shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The only block Fletcher needed came from linebacker Bob Adamov
down near the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Jamar make the interception, I turned upfield and
he had the angle,'' Adamov said. ``The only guy coming was McNown
and I was able to block him.''
</P>
<P>
   Adamov wasn't surprised it was Fletcher making the play,
considering the St. Louis native did the same thing in back-to-back
games this season against Purdue and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big-play guy and we don't expect anything less in this
game,'' Adamov said. ``He came through once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Echols, Wisconsin's other redshirt freshman defensive back,
said the secondary's goal the entire season has been to make a
significant contribution to help take the Badgers to the next
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the season, we said we had to make plays
to make this defense a great defense,'' Echols said. ``Throughout
the whole year, we just had to answer our tests. We've done it all
year and we did it again today.''

LAST DANCE FOR McNOWN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ In this what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world, where
one day you're the toast of the town and the next day you're just
toast, the last impression is often the lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Wayne Cook, the UCLA quarterback whose ended his career
in the Rose Bowl loss of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic then that the career of Cade McNown, the most
accomplished quarterback in UCLA history, came to an end that was
most un-McNownlike. That is to say that the Bruins' money player
came up a few coins short.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were fine for McNown --- his 390 yards passing were
the fourth most in Rose Bowl history --- but as the numbers have
rarely defined his successes, they didn't reveal his shortcomings
Friday in a 38-31 loss to Wisconsin in the 85th Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The clutch, game-turning plays that McNown has made his
signature in his four years were absent --- or worse yet, were made
in Wisconsin's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The one interception he threw was returned 46 yards for a
touchdown by Jamar Fletcher early in the fourth quarter. A mixup
with tailback DeShaun Foster resulted in the Bruins fumbling away
the ball on first-and-goal at the Wisconsin 6 midway in the third.
The Wisconsin crowd forced him to burn timeouts twice in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the Bruins perched at midfield and trailing by a
touchdown with nearly two minutes left, they failed to even gain a
first down. On fourth down, with the Bruins season in his hands,
McNown was sacked by Wendell Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   As the Badgers, after running out the clock, stormed the field
and celebrated at the north end of the Rose Bowl, McNown, his
helmet in his hand, walked stone-faced and purposefully toward the
Bruins' locker room at the south end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to lose,'' he said later outside the UCLA locker room.
``For it to turn out this way is frustrating. The last couple of
games have been disappointing. I wish we could have played a little
better, but sometimes things aren't going to go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown threw 1,250 passes in his career and the first one he'd
like back is one he floated down the right sideline to Foster.
Fletcher trailed Foster but he had help over the top from safety
Jason Doering.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher simply caught the underthrown ball and raced down the
sideline untouched to put Wisconsin ahead, 38-28, with 14:08 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad decision in retrospect,'' said McNown. ``I
shouldn't have thrown the ball. I kind of thought (Foster) would
come back. He didn't do that, but he's not wrong for not doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as costly was the fumble at the goal line. The Bruins,
trailing 31-21, were planted at the Wisconsin 6 after McNown's
44-yard bomb to Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin crowd at the north end was so loud it forced
McNown to call timeout. The play that was called was changed twice,
but Foster and several others didn't hear the second change.
</P>
<P>
   McNown tossed the ball to Foster, but the freshman was expecting
a handoff. The ball hit him in the chest and bounced to the ground
where Chris Ghidorzi landed on it at the 3 for the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough one,'' said offensive coordinator Al Borges.
``You'd like to say don't audible, but you don't want to run a play
that's going to run right into the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown completed 19 of 34 passes for his 340 yards and also
threw two touchdown passes and scrambled for a first downs on a
pair of third downs.
</P>
<P>
   But he was hampered by the absence of receiver Brian Poli-Dixon
(hamstring) for the final three quarters and a Wisconsin pass rush
that consistently pressured him for the first time all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who had allowed 12 sacks in 10 games, allowed three
including Bryant's game-sealer and also deflected three balls at
the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarterback like that, you've got to pressure him,'' said
Wisconsin All-American defensive end Tom Burke. ``You don't try to
get sacks because he gets rid of the ball quickly, but you try to
force him into some bad decisions. We definitely did that. You
could see he was forcing some balls at the end, throwing a few in
the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant that McNown, who had helped UCLA to a school-record
20-game winning streak, back-to-back 10-win seasons and rewrote the
school's record book, wouldn't go out the way he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he deserved is to go out a winner and he didn't get the
chance,'' said Borges. ``It's disappointing because of all he's
done here. I appreciate everything he's done and the opportunity to
work with him. He deserved a better fate.''

DAYNE HAS MEMORABLE DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Add Ron Dayne's name to the roll call of Rose Bowl
legends.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin tailback was named Player of the Game after
rushing for 246 yards and four touchdowns on 27 carries in the
Badgers' 38-31 victory over UCLA on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The four touchdowns tied the modern-day Rose Bowl record, shared
by USC's Sam Cunningham and UCLA's Eric Ball. Cunningham did it
against Ohio State in 1973; Ball scored four in 1986 against Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's yardage total fell 1 yard short of the record set by
USC's Charles White in 1980 against Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's in-your-face running attack was a priority in the
Rose Bowl game plan, Dayne said as he was mobbed by camera crews
and reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought process was to come in and run the ball like we
normally do,'' he said. ``When everything was going well, we
started running. It was just easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, a junior, was mentioned as a candidate for the Heisman
Trophy two seasons in a row. He now figures to be the front-runner
for the award heading into his senior season. He's already said
he's passing on the NFL this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about that right now,'' he said. ``If I
win it, I'm giving it to my linemen anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's performance was all the more remarkable considering he
is not fully recovered from a shoulder injury suffered earlier in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, known as the ``Great Dayne'' among Badger fans,
overlooked the pain and simply savored his team's win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' he said. ``I probably won't appreciate it until
after.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's near-record day gives him 5,091 yards in three years
with the Badgers. He is already third all-time on the Big Ten
career rushing list.
</P>
<P>
   Was he thinking about the record?
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, You know I kind of said I want to get the touchdown
record,'' Dayne said. ``But when I got to about 240 (yards), then I
started thinking about the yardage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the credit for Dayne's outstanding performance goes to
the vocal Wisconsin fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are great,'' Dayne said. ``I love the fans; they support
us everywhere we go.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo said the Bruins recognized Dayne's
abilities going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what we expected,'' Toledo said. ``He had an excellent
game, scored a lot of touchdowns. He's hard to bring down and he's
a great back.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he's glad Dayne is returning for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that I am happy for him that he is coming
back,'' he said. ``That makes me feel good; he's going to come back
and try to win the Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said he wasn't surprised by the
performance of the 5-foot-10, 258-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron had a great day,'' Alvarez said. ``I thought he would have
a good day from the way he practiced this week. He played with pain
today and still had a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne's plans for today are simple. He wants to share his joy
with his 18-month-old daughter Jada, who's home in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably asleep now,'' Dayne said. ``So I'll call her in
the morning.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

WILDCATS TUNED UP, READY TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lute Olson finally came out from underneath the hood this week
with basketball grease smeared all over his khaki slacks and navy
blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has spent the season tinkering with Arizona's engine, a
starting lineup that changed seven straight games before he found
one with the horsepower to start defending its Pac-10 crown tonight
at No. 10 UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Jason Terry and center A.J. Bramlett, arguably the
nation's top senior duo, have been the only Wildcats to start every
game as No. 6 Arizona (8-0) remains one of four undefeated Division
I teams with the assist of a fluffy schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the lineup was a tinkering job that Olson did not
tighten the bolts on until Wednesday's Bank One Fiesta Bowl Classic
championship, when he settled on a lineup with Terry, Bramlett,
freshman Richard Jefferson at off-guard and freshman Michael Wright
and sophomore Justin Wessel at forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I think we'd have been better off with a couple
more tough ones (in non-conference play), but on the other hand,
it's been helpful to play different people,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Eugene Edgerson and freshman guard Traves Wilson
are first off the bench, but Arizona still lacks a definitive
backup for Terry. For the first six games, Terry averaged 39
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Ruben Douglas or sophomore John Ash will get the duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need miracles from that position, just
consistency,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona goes into its Pac-10 opener, not having been challenged
in nearly a month. Players were admittedly had their minds already
wandering Wednesday to UCLA, which it swept last season.
</P>
<P>
   It still is the second-best start in Arizona history, even if it
has come off the likes of UC-Irvine, Iowa State, Holy Cross and
Florida International of late. The Wildcats have established a
hallmark of defense this season, holding opponents to 37 percent
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a countdown to the Pac-10 season all season, and
our goal has been to make progress every game,'' Olson said. ``Now
that we are at that point, we can't go out there and be too
uptight. There are 18 games in the Pac-10 season. The name of the
game is improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona chalks what mistakes it has made to its youthful look,
including four freshman in the eight-man mix. But at UCLA (8-2),
Coach Steve Lavin's top 10 players are freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin felt like a baby-sitter this week when his third-leading
scorer, homesick freshman JaRon Rush, missed two practices and a
game for an extended Kansas City holiday stay. Rush was suspended
for tonight's game after returning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To make UCLA matters worse, guard Brandon Loyd is doubtful
(flu), forward Billy Knight is out (groin) and forward Matt Barnes
and center Dan Gadzuric are questionable (knees).
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA may be better prepared for the Pac-10 rigors than
Arizona, having played Maryland, Kentucky and Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have used eight different lineups and now have Baron
Davis back from knee surgery to make for a dangerous penetrating
backcourt with sophomore classmate Earl Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman center Jerome Moiso averages 13.3 points and 6.7
rebounds. &QL;

SUN DEVILS RETURN TO USC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The floor of the Sports Arena has long been tidied
up and swept clean of any of the pieces that remained of Arizona
State's basketball hopes last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a brand new Pac-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new team,'' ASU guard Eddie House said.
</P>
<P>
   Remember? House and the other returning Sun Devils would rather
not. Needing to win its final regular-season game to stay in
contention for an NCAA Tournament berth, a sick, tired ASU team,
sapped of the energy they spent overachieving for most of the
season, lost to Southern California by 46 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, NIT. And goodbye season, after a first-round defeat to
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to USC was the third-worst in the history of ASU
basketball, inflicted by a team that shocked Arizona two days
earlier but still finished 9-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were an NCAA Tournament team,'' forward Mike
Batiste said. ``We knew it would be tough because they beat
Arizona, but they beat us in every phase of the game, shooting,
passing, rebounding, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played harder than us. They dove on the floor for loose
balls. They did everything to win the ballgame, and we didn't. We
got the crap beat out of us, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But Batiste, whose pride was especially wounded because he grew
up in southern California and knows some of the USC players, said
he doesn't plan to dwell on what happened. Neither does House, who
said the importance of today's game is not to get even, but to ``go
in and show the Pac-10 how we're gonna play this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's certainly not a factor for new ASU Coach Rob Evans,
whose knowledge of the game was a tiny line of agate type in
whatever newspaper he was reading back in Mississippi as the Ole
Miss coach.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Evans had been on the losing bench instead of former
interim coach Don Newman, it wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to use a ploy like that (to get a team motivated),
you don't have a sound basketball team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sun Devils sporting an 8-4 non-conference record and
winning six straight, Evans believes they are close to being a
sound basketball team heading into conference play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep all the pieces healthy, I think we can be very
competitive,'' he said. ``Where that leads to, you never know
because you've got to get some breaks along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really like this team because I think they're starting
to get some confidence. I know they like each other, and that's
huge, and they're starting to play a little bit better defense and
execute on the offensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary strength of the team is the three-headed scoring
monster _ House, averaging 21.2 points a game, followed by Batiste
at 18.5 and forward Bobby Lazor at 18.1. House, a junior who
averaged 11.3 and 12.6 points a game his first two years, is
closing in on a milestone faster than expected. He needs six points
to become the 24th ASU player to score 1,000, the 16th to do it in
three years or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the offense, the Sun Devils have outrebounded their last
eight opponents and are showing a better grasp of Evans' defensive
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still learning, but we're learning quick,''
Batiste said. &QL;

STARS HOPE TO BUILD FROM PLAYOFF LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
 STREAK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG MORGAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hockey cynics have long argued that there is nothing more
meaningless than an NHL regular season. For proof, they point to
the handful of sub-.500 teams that regularly qualify for the
playoffs and the top seeds that fall every year in droves.
</P>
<P>
   No team has added more support to this argument over the past
two seasons than the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the Central Division title two years ago, Dallas
fell in the first round of the playoffs to lowly Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Stars set numerous franchise records in
capturing the President's Trophy as the league's top regular-season
club. But an injury to leading scorer Joe Nieuwendyk and a Western
Conference final loss to Detroit left another stellar season
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The recent setbacks haven't deterred the Stars, however. Through
35 games this season, Dallas is again on pace to finish with the
league's best record. Entering Friday's game at America West Arena
against the Coyotes, Dallas was six points ahead of last year's
pace with just five losses in its first 34 games. The Stars' 2-1
win Friday also extended their season high unbeaten streak to 14
games (11-0-3), tying the Coyotes for the longest mark this year in
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for the Stars, there is a belief that this
year will be different from the past two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know where you build from? You build from hurt,'' Stars
Coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``You can't build from success. The
losses and the adversity are where you learn about your team. We've
responded well so far this year, and we believe in ourselves.
Hopefully, that will continue on into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoying Dallas' confidence is the return of Nieuwendyk, who is
fifth on the team in scoring with 23 points and has shown no ill
effects from a torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered last season
on a hit from San Jose's Bryan Marchment.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced scoring, another Dallas shortcoming, was addressed in
the off-season with the signing of sniper Brett Hull, who leads the
team in goals with 13 after scoring the game winner in overtime
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't evaluate our team on Detroit last year,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We evaluated it on the entire conference, and we felt like
we needed to sign a top-six forward just to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Mike Modano, who scored the Stars' first goal Friday,
admitted that the regular-season success won't mean anything if the
Stars falter again in the playoffs. But he also likened the team to
Detroit three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to go through some playoff failures before they
finally succeeded,'' Modano said. ``I think we might be on that
same path.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Stars think the Coyotes may be, as well. With 46 points,
Phoenix is second in the overall league standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a quality team at all positions that you can't take
lightly,'' goalie Ed Belfour said. ``They're gonna get some playoff
experience this year, and then you never know.'' &QL;

ASU STARTS WOMEN'S PAC-10 PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State Coach Charli Turner Thorne vowed at the Pac-10
women's basketball media day not to become the CNN ``Play of the
Day'' by giving birth to her first child on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Her former mentor and mother of two, Southern California Coach
Chris Gobrecht, kidded Turner Thorne about whether she learned
anything about timing during their two years together at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's not due until Feb. 6, Conor Thorne is beginning to
show signs of being eager to see his mother's 6-3 team, which will
begin Pac-10 play at 2 p.m. today against USC (4-5) at Wells Fargo
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first of four games in eight days for the Sun Devils,
three of them compacted into a five-day period with travel in
between because of the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne picked up a technical foul Wednesday
</P>
<P>
   against San Jose State, putting the officials on the delicate
verge of ejecting mother with child. And if a 37-point win aroused
the third-year ASU coach to a ``T'', what can be expected of a
televised Pac-10 opener that her team absolutely needs to win?
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes the focus off what I want to keep the focus on to say
we've got to win,'' Turner Thorne said. ``This team has more
expectations of its own than any I've coached at ASU. If we handle
the pressures of competition and play good basketball, I know we're
going to win our share of games.''
</P>
<P>
   But with three of the strongest Pac-10 teams, including
ninth-ranked UCLA, just ahead, the Sun Devils must break their
16-year home losing streak vs. USC to have a reasonable hope of
being 2-3 minimum after five conference games.
</P>
<P>
   The last time ASU beat the Trojans in Tempe, now New York
Liberty center Kym Hampton was a sophomore triggering a 53-51 upset
in the season before now Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller started USC on
a two-year NCAA title run. All told in the series, USC leads, 38-3.
</P>
<P>
   Making even a dent in that history, which includes a 13-point
USC win in last year's finale to decide sixth place in the Pac-10,
will be difficult without Leah Combs.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic resonance imaging Thursday confirmed that the
6-foot-2 freshman has advanced stress fractures in both legs that
will indefinitely sideline the Pac-10's fourth leading rebounder,
who is averaging 9.5 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidently, the Sun Devils will return 6-foot forward Kisha
White from academic ineligibility and NCAA suspension today and are
edging closer to the return of 6-3 freshman Theresa Jantzen from a
fractured left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Jantzen, who has not played since registering 13 points and
seven rebounds in 15 minutes of a Nov. 4 exhibition, might attempt
warm-up drills today with an eye toward returning Thursday against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne said White, who averaged 8.5 points and 4.4
rebounds and started 20 games last season, ``can give us some of
the things Leah was giving us. I'm hoping for that totally hungry,
first-game-back effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will need big games on the boards from not only
White, 6-3 Rachel Holt and 6-foot Kristine Sand, who will start in
place of Combs, but also from their perimeter players. Especially
5-9 small forward Leaf Newman, who blocked out enough against San
Jose State to have a team-high seven boards.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams suffered recent losses to Big West Conference power
California-Santa Barbara. &QL;

PRO BULL RIDER REDISCOVERS SUCCESS AFTER LONG DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever Cody Custer had about given up on himself as a bull
rider, the Wickenburg, Ariz., cowboy turned to his strength. His
spiritual faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt God wanted me back riding bulls to do some Biblical
studies at the bull ridings,'' said Custer, who was so busted up
from 1993-97 that his '92 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association
world championship was merely a fading belt buckle. ``Then lo and
behold, I have the best year I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the PRCA, in which he placed fourth on the money list,
and the Professional Bull Riders (ninth), Custer won $222,602 in
1998, almost 50 percent more than his '92 PRCA-only earnings.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the best bull riders are gravitating almost
exclusively to the PBR, which makes its Phoenix debut tonight at
America West Arena. Even without riding in enough PRCA events to
qualify, there is plenty of money to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one PBR riders won between $50,000 and Chris Shivers'
tour-leading $300,213 this year. The PRCA's top 17 money-winners
ranged from $55,000 to Ty Murray's $167,154.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad that the saddle-bronc and bareback riders don't
have the PBR and I do,'' Custer said. ``I know where I'm going a
year in advance, I can buy my (plane) tickets and get rates on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we were hated by some of the (PRCA)
higher-ups, I'm sure of it. It was one of them deals where we saw
we had something that would stand on its own outside of rodeo and
was the only event that could really do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision we had in '92 was to see some kids then in diapers
be able to make a million dollars a year. What we foresaw, we're
reaping some of it now. If I'd won $300,000 like Chris Shivers at
age 19, I'd probably be dead now.''
</P>
<P>
   Shivers, who turned 20 Wednesday, was second in Bud Light Cup
points behind Troy Dunn and third at the Bud Light Cup World
Championships, which preceded the NFR in Las Vegas by a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn dislocated his hip in the first round of the PBR Finals,
putting him out until late March or April, and is home in Australia
celebrating the recent birth of his daughter, Tyrah.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eight Second Thunder field here will include not only
Shivers and Custer but also Phoenix native Murray, who clinched a
PRCA-record seventh world all-around title at the NFR as well as
winning his second bull-riding crown.
</P>
<P>
   And fresh from Thursday night's opener of the 29-city PBR tour
in Salt Lake City are top-three finishers Cody Hart, Leslie Doyle
and Tater Porter.
</P>
<P>
   All were absent from October's Coors Rodeo Showdown in Phoenix
because of a scheduling conflict. So that title went to
little-known Vince Stanton, who was the only one of four finalists
to complete a ride, scoring 83.
</P>
<P>
   Custer, by contrast, produced a PBR Finals-record 95.5 ride on
the still feared Red Wolf, 1996 PRCA and NFR Bucking Bull of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that bull at a rodeo in California in '96, and he
stuffed me on my head right quick,'' Custer said. ``He bucked me
off so fast, I never got to see how he was going to feel. He feels
real good. He has a lot of power and speed. Most bulls his size
(2,000 pounds) are not as fast as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Custer had five Bud Light Cup top-10 finishes before the Finals,
where he was fifth and won $65,450. He also won the Laughlin
Shoot-Out in mid-September to spark a glorious fall.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Laughlin with PBR earnings of $30,000, Custer said
he rode the first round ``like a Girl Scout instead of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I went behind the chutes and had a fit back
there,'' Custer said. ``I kicked and screamed. I told my wife I was
leaving if I didn't ride better on my second one.'' She reminded
him that his last such outburst led to a victory, which, sure
enough, happened again.
</P>
<P>
   Custer scored 87.5 and 86.5 on his next two bulls and 88 in the
finals. That resulted in an $18,465 windfall and buried for good
the ``operation years'': 1993 (left biceps/elbow), '94 (right
shoulder), '95 (right shoulder), '96 (broken hand), '97 (right
shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   The injuries sent him home to what he jokingly calls his
half-acre in-town ranch that he soon hopes to trade in for a
10-acre spread where his three children (Aaron, 5; Lacey, 4; Brett,
11 months) can grow up with horses and he can retire to raise
bucking bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm closer to the end than the beginning,'' Custer said. ``I'm
going to try to enjoy the ones I've got left.'' &QL;

A GREAT DAY TO DEFEAT COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Arizona Cardinals aren't playing the most
valuable sports franchise in North America, worth $413 million,
according to ``Forbes'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Or its 381 luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   Or its fancy Stadium Club.
</P>
<P>
   Or a 146th consecutive sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't playing the Cowboys Ring of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing NFL Hall of Famers Bob Lilly and Roger
Staubach and Tony Dorsett and Randy White and Mel Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing five Super Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't playing the ``Dallas Cowboys Official
Weekly,'' the largest team publication in sports with a circulation
of almost 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing the Dallas Cowboys' vast radio network.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't playing ``The Chan Gailey Show''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Cowboys Special Edition'' with team owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, ``one of the NFL's most influential and active owners,''
according to his bio. Jones, a ``man of varied interests.'' Jones,
who engineered ``what may have been the most dramatic and visible
turnaround in the history of professional sports.'' Jones, who
``will not rest on yesterday's achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (unfortunately) aren't playing Ronda and Pamela
and Shaina and Johnene. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders recently
reached a major milestone by making more international
entertainment trips to U.S. military bases than any other
professional performer or group over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are not playing Cowboys Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   They're not playing the team's sprawling's stone-and-glass
headquarters known as Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't playing the plush executive offices or the
acres of soft blue carpeting trimmed in silver-gray.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing a fan base that _ this from Jones' bio again
_ ``spans the nation and reaches all corners of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans like Bill ``Cowboy'' Lamza, president of a Houston-based
fan club and editor of a Cowboys newsletter he distributes
worldwide. Cowboy has his own trading card. He is pictured sitting
atop a horse, reins in hand. The back of the card reads, ``Better
to die as a young child than to grow up disliking the Dallas
Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't playing Dallas Cowboys Travel
(1-800-6-COWBOY).
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Or Nike.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing the Lombardi Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing Cowboys mystique.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't playing Don Meredith's 95-yard pass to Bob Hayes or
Staubach's ``Hail Mary'' to Drew Pearson or Danny White's
club-record 155 touchdowns or the team's 20 consecutive (1966-85)
winning seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a surprise, the Cardinals aren't playing Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are playing a solid, well-coached team they
respect but believe they can beat.
</P>
<P>
   They're playing a team Jake Plummer took apart by throwing for
more than 400 yards six weeks ago. A team that watched its 28-0
lead melt like a sugar cube in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals didn't beat a team with a winning record this
season. The Cowboys beat one. The Cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are playing a team with playoff experience. But
how important is experience?
</P>
<P>
   ``If experience is so important,'' said Doug Rader, the former
big-league manager, ``we'd never have had anyone walk on the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are playing a team that lost to the Bears and the
Saints.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are playing a team that most everyone believes
will win.
</P>
<P>
   But can the underdogs surprise? Sure. The Cardinals are going to
beat the Cowboys someday. Today seems as good a day as any. &QL;

PAC-10 COACHES RATE THEIR CONFERENCE HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  NOTES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four teams made the NCAA Sweet 16 last season and the
predictors loaded up the front ends of their preseason polls with
the likes of Stanford and Washington, are we ready to officially
declare the Pac-10 a basketball conference?
</P>
<P>
   Like any other subject of vast importance and cosmic meaning, it
depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way, how should I know?
</P>
<P>
   This week's Associated Press rankings show three teams _
Stanford, Arizona and UCLA _ in the Top 10. That's the same number
as the Atlantic Coast Conference, where college basketball was
presumably invented. A fourth team, California, is likely to crack
the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the RPI (power ratings to you), which indicates
that the Pac-10 is the third-strongest conference in the nation,
behind the Big Ten and ACC.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, other than Cal beating North Carolina on its
home court in Oakland, and maybe Washington's win in Seattle over
overrated New Mexico, the Pac-10 hasn't generated many
attention-getting victories.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to convince the coaches. To a man, they are
sure their conference is the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an absolutely incredible season for the
conference,'' Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the analysis of first-year Arizona State Coach Rob
Evans probably is the most sensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be tough,'' he said. ``But what's happened now
is, some of the teams that haven't been as tough have really turned
up the heat. Oregon. Southern Cal. Cal. They've done a great job
recruiting, and the coaches have really done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans didn't mention himself and the Sun Devils, but we will.
</P>
<P>
   There.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bottom part of the league starts meeting up with the
top, your league is very, very difficult,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   With conference play starting today, a look at who's where: &QL;  &QL; 
Stanford (10-2) &QL;  &QL; 
Montgomery said ``there's a lot of stuff we can do better'' after
the Cardinal's victory over Temple Tuesday, but despite injuries
that have weakened the bench, this remains the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   As advertised, the Cardinal frontcourt is rough and tough, but a
little finesse around the basket wouldn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Arthur Lee, is having a strong all-around season and
backcourt partner Kris Weems can shoot. &QL;  &QL; 
California (9-1) &QL;  &QL; 
For those who overlooked the Golden Bears at the start of the
season, the secret's out. Tuesday's victory over North Carolina was
no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bears off to their best start since 1980-81, brainy Ben
Braun is the early leader for Pac-10 Coach of the Year, and guard
Geno Carlisle is a candidate for Player of the Year. The heretofore
obscure (outside the league) Sean Lampley, a 6-foot-7 forward,
sometimes plays 7-foot-6. &QL;  &QL; 
Arizona (8-0) &QL;  &QL; 
The Wildcats are the only unbeaten team in the Pac-10 and just one
of four nationally, although their biggest test of the season comes
today against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Senior point guard Jason Terry is the best player in the
conference, scoring, passing, defending and exerting leadership on
a team that needs it. Center A.J. Bramlett has become a genuine
presence inside.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Richard Jefferson (Moon Valley High School) is
starting to live up to the hype as Coach Lute Olson finally has
settled on a lineup after using seven different combinations. &QL;  &QL; 
UCLA (8-2) &QL;  &QL; 
With a very talented, very young team, no one said it wouldn't be
interesting. Freshman forward JaRon Rush, the club's third-leading
scorer, went back to Kansas City, Mo., for Christmas and stayed
there because he was homesick. Problem was, the Bruins had a game
against Loyola Marymount. Rush later returned but was suspended for
today's Arizona game.
</P>
<P>
   Two more members of the highly touted freshmen class, center Dan
Gadzuric and forward Matt Barnes, have battled injuries, and
sophomore guard Billy Knight is out for the season. On the other
hand, sophomore point guard Baron Davis is regaining his form after
reconstructive knee surgery. &QL;  &QL; 
Washington (7-3) &QL;  &QL; 
The Huskies were oversold by many at the start, and injuries, plus
Coach Bob Bender's decision to send his team on a six-game death
march away from home, fueled the notion until last week's win over
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to get excited over this bunch, which struggled
to beat Portland at home after the New Mexico win. Center Todd
MacCulloch is a first-rate college center, and guards Donald Watts
(who is still out) and Deon Luton can score. But the Huskies don't
get the type of play from the point guard position necessary to
compete for a championship. &QL;  &QL; 
Arizona State (8-4) &QL;  &QL; 
The improvement is noticeable, and not just because senior forward
Mike Batiste has regained his academic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are finally grasping first-year Coach Rob Evans'
system, which harps on defense, rebounding and total effort. It
also helps that ASU has perhaps the best scoring threesome in the
conference _ Batiste, senior forward Bobby Lazor and junior guard
Eddie House, whose transformation this season has been nothing
short of amazing. &QL;  &QL; 
Oregon (8-1) &QL;  &QL; 
Like ASU, the Ducks had to get used to a new coach. Except that
they did it last season, when Ernie Kent replaced Jerry Green, and
the year of getting acclimated is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks still haven't beaten anyone of note, but the talent is
there, and they hustle. The backcourt is strong, with Alex Scales,
a junior college transfer, and freshman Frederick Jones joining
veteran Terik Brown. &QL;  &QL; 
Southern California (8-1) &QL;  &QL; 
The Trojans lost big to Kansas on the road in their only test of
legitimacy, but this looks like a team with lots of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Juco transfer Brain Scalabrine, a 6-9 forward/center, is
probably making the biggest impact of any newcomer in the
conference. &QL;  &QL; 
Oregon State (6-3) &QL;  &QL; 
The Beavers have defeated Brigham Young and Notre Dame. Whoops,
make that BYU-``Hawaii'' and ``College of'' Notre Dame. After
beating the latter by 32 points this week, forward Jason Heide
said, ``Offensively, we still stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Coach Eddie Payne, the Beavers have won two, three and two
Pac-10 games during the past three seasons. Don't expect much
better this time around. &QL;  &QL; 
Washington State (6-5) &QL;  &QL; 
The injury-marred Cougars have done better since an 0-4 start that
included a loss to Division II Alaska-Fairbanks, and guard
Jan-Michael Thomas is another impressive juco transfer in the
conference. &QL;  &QL;

VOLUNTEERS' DEFENDERS HOLD THEIR OWN DURING PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Volunteers' scout team is probably having the most fun it's
had at practice. The defensive backs have been instructed by their
coaches to hold Tennessee's star receivers at every possible
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just holding us to death,'' sophomore wide receiver
Cedrick Wilson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? It's the best way to prepare for Florida State,
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive backs are really good, but they hold all the
time, and the referees don't call it,'' he said. ``So that's how we
decided to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been lost in the hype surrounding the Fiesta Bowl's
big-time receivers, primarily the Seminoles' Peter Warrick and the
Volunteers' Peerless Price.
</P>
<P>
   But he was the player who caught the game-clinching touchdown
pass in the Southeastern Conference championship game against
Mississippi State. He is Tennessee's No. 2 receiver with 33 catches
for 558 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' he said. ``I like it hush-hush.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rope trick
</P>
<P>
   After Florida State lost to North Carolina State in the second
game of the season, Seminoles defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews
went to a hardware store to buy some rope.
</P>
<P>
   No, the longtime assistant wasn't going to hang himself. The
rope was used as a motivational tool, which obviously worked. The
Seminoles have won 10 straight and are playing Tennessee for the
national championship Monday in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the story of a guy in the mountains,'' Andrews said
Friday. ``He falls and he's holding onto a limb. He knows he's
going to face his death with a 10,000-foot drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If you're in that situation, look around the room.
Who do you want to have at the end of the rope.' I said, `How many
of you are willing to hang on to the rope and be accountable?' ''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the story, Andrews told reporters who had asked
about the rope, ``I don't think that has a lot to do with the
football game, but I appreciate your question anyway.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Million-dollar man &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Phillip Fulmer's new contract may sound like a lot,
Tennessee Athletic Director Doug Dickey said it's just a sign of
the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract is in keeping with the economic standards of
college coaching and is deserved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Fulmer signed a six-year contract worth $1 million
a year on Thursday. It will raise Fulmer's total pay by about
$200,000 and makes him the second-highest paid coach in the SEC
behind Florida's Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to many more years coaching this team,'' Fulmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer's new base salary will be $175,000. The largest chunk
comes from radio and television commitments, which pay $400,000;
apparel and shoe contracts pay $250,000; and he gets a $250,000
annual retention bonus that began after the 1997 season. Other
benefits bring the total to $1 million. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No midnight madness &QL; 
 &QL; 
Florida State players opted to stay at their hotel Thursday night
instead of ringing in the New Year at the Block Party in Tempe as
planned. The team captains made the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to take a chance of some Tennessee fan taking a
shot at us there,'' linebacker Lamont Green said. ``That would have
gotten us in trouble with the coaches, especially if it meant not
being able to play in the game. I want to be able to celebrate
being national champions on the Fiesta Bowl logo at the 50-yard
line Monday night.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Going long
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers watched Mississippi's 35-18 victory over Texas
Tech in the Independence Bowl Thursday with considerable interest.
</P>
<P>
   They were rooting for David Cutcliffe, Tennessee's offensive
coordinator since 1992, who left after the SEC title game to become
Mississippi's coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels were impressive, and quarterback Romaro Miller threw
for three touchdowns, a bowl record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were throwing the ball deep, and I was jealous,''
Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin said. ``He (Cutcliffe) used to
tell me we were going to throw deep eight times in a game, and then
we'd throw it two times.'' &QL;

SEASON TO CROW ABOUT  
 `ROOSTER' OUTZEN RESCUES SEMINOLES 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-OUTZEN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His teammates call him Rooster, one of the few things Marcus
Outzen could do without at Florida State. He hates the nickname,
given to him last year by then-quarterback Thad Busby.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden says he used to sing ``The Rooster'' song in
college. Nobody on the team knows the words to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good thing,'' Outzen said.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen responds to Rooster only to his teammates and coaches,
and, lately, the red-haired quarterback with the buzz cut has been
hearing it a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, and unexpectedly, Outzen finds himself in the middle
of one of the biggest games in Florida State history. The
20-year-old sophomore, a year removed from questioning his future
as a Seminole, has spent the week coolly handling questions from
national media on everything from the pressures of leading the
Seminoles in the national championship game to his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   With only two games as a starting college quarterback on his
resume, Outzen can't wait to run into Sun Devil Stadium on Monday
in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl against top-ranked Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this situation,'' he said. ``I don't look at this as a
tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Outzen's good fortune came with Chris Weinke's misfortune on
Nov. 7. Weinke, a 26-year-old sophomore who spent six years playing
minor league baseball in the Toronto Blue Jays' organization,
suffered a season-ending neck injury in the last 30 seconds of the
first half of the Virginia game. Outzen led the Seminoles to 24
second-half points, completing 5 of 6 passes.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, Outzen led Florida State past Wake Forest,
connecting on 11 of 19 passes for 164 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The big question, however, was how would Outzen hold up against
Florida. There is no bigger game each year for the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   He twice fumbled, once resulting in a safety, and Bowden had
doubts in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going through my mind is, `Gee, I'm not sure he's going
to be good enough to win this game,' '' Bowden said. ``He came out
and just did an excellent job in the second half, which should help
his confidence. It sure helped ours about him.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates never got down on him. After Outzen fumbled,
cornerback Mario Edwards came up to Outzen on the sideline and
said, ``Rooster, keep doing what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of series later, he threw a touchdown pass,'' Edwards
said. ``I'm talking to (another player) and I just happen to look
around, and Rooster is this close to me. He was fired up and just
waiting for me to congratulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Outzen ended up passing for 167 yards in a 23-12 victory that
put the Seminoles in a wait-and-see mode. What they saw was UCLA
and Kansas State fall on the same day, sending them to Tempe for
the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses any nerves leading up to this showdown, as he did
in the Florida game. Eric Outzen, Marcus' father, confidant,
adviser and No. 1 fan, made up for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't sleep all week and lost weight,'' Outzen said of
his dad. ``I probably gained two pounds during the Florida game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big game, but I took it with a grain of salt. I
ignored the pressures that were put upon me. I knew what I had to
do to lead the team. Focusing on the pressures won't help you do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who threw for more than 200 yards in nine of the 10
games he played and didn't throw an interception in his last 218
attempts, still is hurting from not being able to finish what he
started. But he said he is here to support Outzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's not nervous, but he will be as it gets closer to
the game,'' Weinke said. ``I'll be there to encourage him. This is
a huge game. He knows it. But he's been through it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a long way from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., where Outzen
was raised with a pitcher's mound on one end of his back yard and
an old tire to throw at on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He followed former Florida quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner
Danny Wuerffel at Fort Walton Beach High and led the school to the
Class 5A championship his senior year. But Outzen grew up
worshiping Florida State football.
</P>
<P>
   His father took him to the 1990 Fiesta Bowl. The Seminoles beat
Nebraska, and the young Outzen got Bowden's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   He was in awe of Bowden then. A year ago, however, Outzen
wondered if he had a future in Tallahassee. He played in all 12
games as a freshman, but as a holder on extra points and field
goals. He was the fourth-team quarterback, behind Busby, Dan Kendra
and Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Outzen was in Bowden's office, asking if it
might be in his best interest to transfer. Bowden told him to stick
it out through spring football.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen was running third string in the spring, until Kendra, a
junior, blew out his knee in a scrimmage that wiped out his 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a sophomore, I knew that I'd be a backup and the most I
could ask for was some mop-up duties in games,'' Outzen said.
``Going into the season, I prepared myself for that role.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to sit. But as impatient as he was, his heart
was with the Seminoles. He leaned on his father, who told him not
to worry, things would work out, he'd get his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't deny myself the privilege of being a Seminole,''
Outzen said. ``I couldn't get away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanker Peter Warrick said Outzen possesses the same take-charge
attitude in the huddle that Weinke had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to rally around a guy like that,'' Warrick said.
``We know he's going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Outzen's mobility gives the Seminoles another dimension, the
ability to take off with the ball. The quarterback draw, rarely
used since Charlie Ward led Florida State to its only national
championship in 1993, is back in the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   The Rooster is amazed and exhilarated at where he is now. But
how long will he be in FSU's plans? Weinke and Kendra both should
be back in the fall, completely healed. He'll also have to contend
with Jared Jones, a hotshot freshman from Walla Walla, Wash. The
Seminoles don't go as far as Walla Walla, Wash., for someone whom
they think is going to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, at Florida State, we don't lose jobs to injuries,''
Outzen said. ``But I'd have to say, if we win the national
championship, that it will be an open battle again.'' &QL;

BLITZ EASY AFTER GUNFIRE  
 FAMILY HELPED VOLS QB ESCAPE VIO LENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is 12-0 as a starting quarterback, 0-12 as a friend to those
who died young.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. National championships and 6-foot-5 defensive
linemen don't seem nearly as intimidating when you've lived by the
beat of a metronome of gunfire. When you've lost enough friends,
12, to field an offense and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin keeps
stiff-arming adversity, and why he once said oncoming blitzes make
him, well, giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put everything in perspective now,'' the junior said.
``I see football as a game. Being in the situations I was in
growing up really taught me to be calm under tough situations. You
just can't panic if things are going bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good lesson to take into Monday's Fiesta Bowl game
against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the Volunteers weren't supposed to be here,
and a big reason was Martin. How could Tennessee get to a title
game with a quarterback with zero starts, when one of the best in
the country, Peyton Manning, couldn't do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't scary, because I didn't prepare like I was filling
the shoes of Peyton Manning,'' he said. ``Coming in and saying I
was going to do something he didn't do and this, that and the other
thing, it never came into my thinking. I was just going to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and by the fifth game of the season, when Tennessee's
coaches finally opened up the offense for the maturing quarterback,
he flourished. During the final seven games, he threw 10 touchdown
passes and two interceptions, and he completed 63 percent of his
passes.
</P>
<P>
   He also set three NCAA records with a 23-of-24 effort against
South Carolina. By Nov. 8, the Volunteers had moved into the No. 1
spot of the Associated Press poll for good.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a big reason. A peek into his past may explain why
the quarterback remained so poised, even during a season that
included four fourth-quarter victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt God was watching over Tee,'' his mother, Marie,
said. ``He had to be, considering what he's been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie was 16 when Martin was born in Mobile, Ala. His father,
Maurice Marshall, was a freshman football player at Mississippi
Valley State. After several years, Marie and Maurice married, and
after several more, they divorced. Marshall drifted in and out of
Tee's life.
</P>
<P>
   Tee got his name, Taumaurice, after Marie handed the newborn to
Marshall and said, ``To Maurice.''
</P>
<P>
   As he grew up, he lived at different times with his mother,
grandmother and great-grandmother. Marie said she has lived in more
than 20 places since Tee was born and that most moves were prompted
by a search for safer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs and violence surrounded Martin's youth. As a senior in
high school, he left a friend, Gary Simmons, outside his house for
a minute. He heard gunshots. When he ran outside, Simmons, who had
been holding his baby boy, had suffered two gunshots to the head.
The baby had been shot in the foot. The baby survived. The father
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Martin would lose at least 11 more friends to violence,
accidents or illness.
</P>
<P>
   Although he saw it, Martin said violence never directly touched
him because the women and the uncle who raised him instilled proper
values from a young age. He had to be home by dark. He cooked and
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't strict, but they were strong,'' Martin said. ``I
knew what to do by the time I was 2 or 3. They did a good job of
molding my mind and trying to put me on the right path when I was
young. When I got older, they didn't have to worry about what I
would do because they raised me the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he still has a good relationship with his father and
that they write to one another.
</P>
<P>
   He received plenty of letters from colleges as a standout
quarterback at Mobile's Williamson High School. He chose Tennessee,
even though he felt Tim Couch was its No. 1 choice. Couch ended up
at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   After backing up Manning as a sophomore, he was handed the reins
for the 1998 season. While the coaching staff respected his
abilities, they simplified the offense and limited what he was
allowed to do in the early part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Volunteers started out 4-0, including recording
their first victory over Florida since 1992, it wasn't easy for the
parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was very frustrating for our senior receivers,
Peerless (Price) and Jeremaine (Copeland),'' sophomore wide
receiver Cedrick Wilson said. ``They were used to Peyton throwing
the ball 75 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of necessity, and because they grew more confident with
Martin, the coaches opened up the offense in the fifth game of the
season, against Georgia. One week earlier, standout running back
Jamal Lewis went down with a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Martin went 16 of 26 for 156 yards, two touchdowns and two
interceptions in a 22-3 victory over the Bulldogs. Two weeks later,
he had the record-setting effort against South Carolina. That's
when Tennessee faithful, among others, realized the Volunteers had
something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I understood, and it was only right for the coaches
to do what they did,'' Martin said. ``They had to depend on the
players that had already proven themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like I was being contained by my own coaches,
living in my own jail. When they finally let me out, I was like a
little kid in a candy store.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin flourished and led Tennessee to a 12-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out there controlling the offense and calling the huddles
with a lot more firmness than he did early on,'' cornerback Steve
Johnson said. ``He's a real field general now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Martin's contributions on the field, Coach
Phillip Fulmer said he likes what the player contributes off of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as fine a person as you'd ever want to meet,'' he said.
``He's a guy you'd say, `Tee, I'm going to be gone for a month,
watch my house and take care of my kids.' He's that kind of a guy.
He's got as good a heart as any person I've been around.'' &QL;

INJURIES TO AC COLADES: SEMINOLES' SIMON WORKS THROUGH PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-SIMON-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just how good is Florida State's No. 1-ranked defense?
</P>
<P>
   This good:
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Seminoles' starting nose guard Larry Smith
suffered a sprained knee that will keep him from playing in
Monday's Tostitos Fiesta Bowl national championship game against
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who will step into the starting lineup in Smith's place
is an Associated Press first-team All-America selection.
</P>
<P>
   That's really good.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Corey Simon, the 6-foot-4, 275-pound junior who will
move into Smith's spot, is not a typical backup.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida State's interior defense isn't typical, either.
Three players, Smith, Simon and Jerry Johnson, rotate at nose guard
and tackle, keeping fresh and talented bodies coming at the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the team's best run-stopping tackle and brings
boundless energy to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our intensity guy, the most aggressive defensive
lineman we have,'' linebacker Lamont Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon led the group with 65 total tackles, 16 tackles for
losses, five sacks and five pass deflections.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who was shocked to be named to the All-America team after
having his first two seasons shortened by injuries, was the
recipient of the Atlantic Coast Conference's Brian Piccolo Award,
given to the player who makes the most courageous comeback from an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Question is, which injury?
</P>
<P>
   Simon has had six major injuries, including a rotator cuff
injury in his shoulder, a dislocated shoulder, a neck injury and
knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned that he could stay healthy,'' said
Mickey Andrews, Florida State's defensive coordinator. ``He hadn't
been able to the entire time he had been at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with a hurt shoulder that had surgery. He got out
to practice for a few days in spring, and he's hurt again. We come
into fall, and he hurts a knee. He seemed like he had a blue jersey
on (for the injured) more than garnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon has had some minor injuries this season, but nothing to
keep him from playing and producing big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great to receive the accolades,'' he said. ``It's
always nice to be recognized as an All-American or all-conference.
But the focus of my season wasn't what I can accomplish as far as
accolades. It was to go in and help this team win a national
championship, and we have that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season is so much sweeter than last season or the season
before that when I really didn't have much say so in what we did.
That's what makes everything sweeter, to be recognized as an
All-American and still be playing for a national championship and
helping the team be the No. 1 defense in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it extra special.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's loss was a blow to the Seminoles, emotionally as
well as strategically against a Tennessee offensive line that is
the heart and soul of the Volunteers' attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went down (for two games) early in the season, but this is
something different,'' Simon said. ``It's not like we're playing
Duke. This is for the national championship. He's a great player,
and it's motivation for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the threesome of Smith, Simon and Johnson make their
own adjustments during games and will take themselves in and out of
the lineup to stay fresh. Simon says he's got enough ``in my tank
to go all the way,'' but he won't hesitate to call on sophomore
Bryne Malone, who is preparing to back up the interior starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryne has really stepped up to the challenge since we lost
Larry,'' Simon said. ``He's a great player when he decides to step
it up, and we're confident he can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a safe bet that Simon is going to be less willing
than usual to share time with a national title on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about him,'' Andrews said. ``He never
lost the faith. He never gave up, and the rehab he had to go
through was just unbelievable because it has happened so many times
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey Simon is a very talented football player, and when he's
healthy, he's got the ability to go make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what All-America backups do. &QL;

CARDS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I was laying in supplies for today's Cardinals playoff game
when . . .
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second. I can't believe I just typed those words
_ &UR; Cardinals
 &UR; playoff game. Still sounds weird, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I feel like one of those guys from the 1800s who wondered if he
would live to see the country linked by rail. You occasionally
allowed yourself to dream about it, but when it finally happens,
you almost can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the hype, fair amounts of people are jumping on the
Big Red bandwagon. No surprise there. It's hard not to. The last
time the Cardinals were in the playoffs, people were reading
``Sports Illustrated'' by gas lamps and listening to radio call-in
shows with ear horns. The novelty is exciting. And when you're
playing a love-to-hate-'em team like Dallas, it only gets sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   And I have to admit, I'm excited, too. True, with all its
injuries, the Arizona defense couldn't stop a dung beetle with a
sledgehammer. But if Jake Plummer gets hot, who knows? Maybe it'll
come down to an end- zone call again this time _ and maybe this
time the officials will remember to pack their backbones.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I cannot claim to have always been so excited about
Cardinals football. I looked back at some of the things I've
written about the team over the years, and I have to admit, on
first blush, not everything was so positive. But in this age of
spin doctoring, I think I can explain away almost all of it. A few
examples:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: Sure, nearly everyone on whom the Cards spent more
than $1 million to acquire during the off-season played as if they
were worth something approaching minimum wage . . . but there's
still hope. For instance, Joe Bugel hopes he won't have a new
address next year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: Is anything more optimistic than hope?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: The good news is that police found 11 missing Boy
Scouts at Sun Devil Stadium. The bad news is that they're beating
the Cardinals by 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: Actually, humor is more optimistic than hope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: Things are supposed to be different this season. Last
season's defense was great . . . but the offense couldn't score
with Heidi Fleiss' help. This season, Dave Krieg is in charge, at
least until he starts drawing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: A clear nod to Krieg's leadership ability, nothing
more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: You have to start wondering, is Dave Krieg the answer?
Only if the question is, ``Who's better than Tom Tupa?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: Oops. Well, I did say he was better than Tupa,
didn't I?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: I guarantee you that the Cardinals will not lose
today. Of course, they don't even play today, but you take the
little victories where you can find them. Or the little non-losses,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: Sometimes we hurt because we love.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: Here's a familiar phrase: The Cardinals' game today
will be blacked out in the Phoenix area, because they failed to
sell out Sun Devil Stadium. It's like typing ``embattled
President'' before ``Bill Clinton'' _ your fingers seemingly move
by themselves, because it's something you type so often. I think
it's called muscle memory.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: I certainly nailed the Clinton thing cold.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comment: You would think that in a state so stubbornly
right-wing that car-pooling and seat belt laws are considered merry
skips down the roads to socialism and fascism, football fans would
enjoy a good old-fashioned conservative offense. Apparently not.
Cardinals fans have spoken and have said they like the occasional
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Explanation: Still true today.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm hoping for several Cardinals' scores. You never can
tell in the playoffs. A win today and then an upset next week and .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, pardner. I'm dreaming again. &QL;

ALL FOR THE BEST  
 IN THE END, CARDS GET THEIR WADSWORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Only Andre Wadsworth could sign a $42 million
contract and then apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, the Cardinals' rookie defensive end, apologized for
being a distraction before the season-opening loss to Dallas at
Texas Stadium. Then, he apologized again for costing rookie
free-agent defensive lineman Mike Moten of Florida a job.
</P>
<P>
   Moten was led off the team plane on the tarmac at Sky Harbor
Airport, minutes after Wadsworth ended his 44-day holdout on Sept.
5. The Cardinals needed to cut a player to leave a spot for
Wadsworth on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really did feel bad because I know him personally,''
Wadsworth said. ``He worked hard in two-a-days. He came from
nowhere. I'm just glad it all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals re-signed Moten to the practice squad on Oct. 27,
and he was promoted to the active roster Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wadsworth and Moten are expected to play against the
Cowboys today at Texas Stadium in an NFC wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy Andre got his contract, and I knew I would get
another chance,'' Moten said. ``I just didn't know when. But, even
now, when I tell people what happened on the plane, they don't
believe me. I wasn't mad. I'm just glad the way everything went
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four months later, Wadsworth acknowledges that playing
against the Cowboys one day after he signed was bizarre. He hadn't
even practiced with the team, except for a three-day minicamp last
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't put on full pads since the (bowl) game,'' said
Wadsworth, the third pick overall in the 1998 draft out of Florida
State. ``I don't think I'd ever been that unprepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the health risks, Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice
president-player personnel, agreed with the coaches' decision to
play Wadsworth immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was excited to get on the field,'' Ferguson said of
Wadsworth. ``Like Vince (Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin), I say, `Put
him out there and let him play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth assisted on one tackle in the game. He also put heat
on Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman on one play and drew a holding
penalty on offensive tackle Erik Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did all right for a pop quiz,'' Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis thinks Wadsworth,
who finished the regular-season with 5{ sacks, will become a
dominant player next year after going through a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the two reminisced about their last trip to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Andre, we're going back to where it all started,' ''
McGinnis said. ``I told him it seems like it was 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot in this league. I've been through two
strike teams _ the ``Spare'' Bears and the real Bears, but I never
had been through anything like that, one guy signing and playing
the next day and another guy having to be taken off the plane. That
was hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what Andre could do that day. We didn't know
what Andre could do in the NFL. We knew what he could do at Florida
State.
</P>
<P>

about what happened to Mike. Then, when we brought Mike back, Andre
was the guy who went to get him.'' &QL;

GRAHAM CAN'T MEET TICKET DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals center Aaron Graham grew up in Denton, Texas, and said
playing in the NFL playoffs in Texas Stadium was his boyhood dream.
He also said he could use ``probably 500 tickets'' for family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a rookie, I bought 50 tickets when we played
there,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made only 500 tickets available to the Cardinals. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Loaner ball?
</P>
<P>
   After Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith broke the NFL record for
rushing touchdowns with two against the Redskins in the
regular-season finale, giving him 125, the Pro Football Hall of
Fame came calling _ and Smith put them on hold. His father advised
him to keep all the balls he scored touchdowns with, and he has 121
of them in his possession. He has given four of them away, three to
teammates and one to a Vietnam veteran he met in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a Congressional Medal of Honor,'' Smith said. ``He
had one simple request _ the first touchdown I scored that year
(1995), he wanted me to dedicate to him. I told him I'd do better
than that. The first one I scored, I'd send him the football.''
</P>
<P>
   On the request from Canton, Smith said: ``I might loan it to
them, as long as I get it back.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
After-Christmas sale &QL; 
 &QL; 
Phoenix artist Bill Tomsa has been sitting across from the
Cardinals practice facility this week, trying to sell two acrylic
paintings. One, titled ``Center of Attention,'' depicts Larry
Centers walking past fans. The other, called ``Birds of a
Feather,'' shows Cardinals paraphernalia. Asking price: $1,750
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an excellent time to be out here,'' said Tomsa, who
did the paintings for a show during Super Bowl XXX. He said he has
one potential buyer for the Centers picture.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a third Cardinals-related painting that's not for
sale, but it may turn out to be a prediction. In the rendition, a
newspaper gives a final score: Cardinals 35, Cowboys 0. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Keith Brown, who has been the team chaplain for the Cardinals
and Suns for 11 years, will be in Dallas to hold a prayer service _
and he's paying his own way.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first road trip this season for Brown, who is
also the football coach at Phoenix Christian High School, will
conduct the service at the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Metcalf is third all-time in the playoffs with 22 kick
returns for 499 yards. The leader in number of returns is former
Cardinal Kevin Williams, now a member of the Bills. &QL;

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-DEFECTORS (Phnom Penh) _ Hun Sen, the Cambodian leader,
responding to criticism for his statement that defecting Khmer
Rouge leaders should be met with bouquets rather than handcuffs,
said he favors punishing them, but that it is the province of the
courts to decide. Earlier, a Khmer Rouge spokesman suggested
putting the U.S. on trial for its bombing of Cambodia. By Seth
Mydans. (With map)
</P>
<P>
   EURO (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Thursday was a day for champagne and
confetti. Friday began the long weekend of strong coffee and
takeout food as financial institutions in Europe began the daunting
job of re-programming their electronic networks for the euro era
before the markets open for business on Monday. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   EURO-INVEST (Undated) _ Many investment managers believe that
the planned changes from adopting a single monetary policy for much
of Europe will offer opportunities to profit for years to come.
They believe Europe could see a period of prosperity not dissimilar
to what occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s from
U.S. corporations' efforts to downsize and restructure themselves.
By Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-ANNIVERSARY (Santiago de Cuba, Cuba) _ It has been 40 years
since Fidel Castro declared the end of the Batista dictatorship.
For residents here, it has been 40 years of socialism, economic
sacrifice and endless maneuvering in a cold war with the United
States. But on Friday it was hard to find anyone on the streets who
would openly criticize the 72-year-old Cuban leader or his
policies. By James C. McKinley Jr. (With photo)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL _ GENERAL (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   METHADONE-POLICY (New York) _ Methadone frees, but it also
imprisons. It is a wizard at blocking the yearning for heroin, but
much less so the simple craving to get high. It is highly addictive
in its own right, with fiendish withdrawal symptoms. At more than
moderate doses, it can leave some patients in a barely functional
daze. All of which goes a long way toward explaining why methadone
has long been caught in the cross-currents of social policy, though
never more so than right now in New York. By N.R. Kleinfield. (With
photo)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RENAISSANCE (Hilton Head, S.C.) _ President Clinton rang
out his most unusual of years in his usual, if peculiar, way: in
very earnest policy discussion with more than a thousand
acquaintances and fans _ and a few old friends and unimpressed
strangers _ assembled at the annual Renaissance Weekend here. By
James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVE-RETREAT (Phoenix) _ A journal: Conservatives rang
out their year at the Weekender retreat, formerly known as the Dark
Ages Weekend where disgust with the president is so pervasive that
he seems to have replaced the Soviet Union as the organizing
principle around which conservatives can rally. By Katharine Q.
Seelye. (With photos)
</P>
<P>
   MISSOURI-RIVER (Nebraska City, Neb.) _ Big changes are coming to
the Missouri River, America's longest, stretching from Three Forks,
Mont., to St. Louis. The fracas over the river's future is fierce
as environmentalists, farmers, barge operators, recreation
boosters, hydroelectric utilities, Indian tribes and municipal
leaders all try to make sure the river stays _ or becomes _ what
they want it to be. By Pam Belluck. (With photo and map)
</P>
<P>
   SANFRAN-CITY-HALL (San Francisco) _ Not since the 1920s has the
sunlight glinted so brightly from San Francisco's City Hall dome, a
shapely structure taller than the 90-foot dome of the capitol in
Washington. The landmark building and its dome were closed for more
than three years of renovation, but beginning Tuesday, San
Franciscans will once again be able to step inside their Beaux-Arts
seat of government. By Bill Staggs. (With photo)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON _ (Moved in ``w'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-BUDGET (Washington) _ Heeding warnings from the
nation's military chiefs, President Clinton has decided to propose
the first real increase in the Pentagon's budget in nearly a decade
and the largest since the Cold War buildup of the mid-1980s,
administration and defense officials said. By Steven Lee Myers.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MARKETS-FOREIGN (Undated) _ Overseas stocks rebounded sharply in
the fourth quarter, both in developed and emerging markets. But in
some emerging markets even 100 percent rallies were not enough to
make up for the sell-offs that pushed stocks to their lows just as
the quarter began. Many of these markets still ended the year with
declines. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-OIL (Balakhani, Azerbaijan) _ Even after taking into
account the drop in oil prices, the rush of energy development in
the Caspian region is expected to cause cash to pour into the
treasuries of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. All three
nations will probably have more than enough money to guarantee
every citizen a comfortable life. But while oil money has made some
countries prosperous, it has helped destroy others. By Stephen
Kinzer. (With photo and graphic)
</P>
<P>
   CADBURY-STRATEGY (Undated) _ By agreeing to sell nearly all its
international beverage business to the Coca-Cola Co., Cadbury
Schweppes PLC made it clear last month that it was leaving the
global soft-drink field to Coca-Cola and Pepsico Inc. What is less
clear is Cadbury's strategy for its remaining soft-drink business,
which will now be concentrated in its most profitable market, the
United States. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY-STABILITY (Undated) _ Last year's dominant economic
story might be summed up this way: When currencies float, economies
sink. From Thailand to Russia, many nations' currencies floated
when their exchange rates against the U.S. dollar collapsed, often
under pressure from speculators. Now, that currency-induced turmoil
has shaken some core assumptions of modern economics. By Joseph
Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-U.S. (Gillette, Wyo.) _ The lowest oil prices in two decades
are shutting down of vast swaths of the nation's oil industry. Low
prices and foreign competition, which favor the Exxons and Mobils
over the wildcatter mean that the oilman in jeans and boots,
legendary for his enterprise and daring, is giving way to the
oilman in a suit. By Allen R. Myerson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY (Moved in ``k'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (New York) _ Perpetual New Year's Eve anxiety is
officially here. The annual societal pressure that New Year's Eve
be the bubbliest, happiest, most spiritual and yet entertaining
night of the whole year is already rising to a previously
unimaginable pitch for Dec. 31, 1999. By Frank Rich.
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LIBRARIES (Undated) _ It was the year of the library. Last
summer, London inaugurated the new British Library; in October,
Paris witnessed the grand opening of the new National Library of
France; the next month the New York Public Library unveiled its
renovation of the Main Reading Room at its flagship 42nd Street
branch. The great library race: New York vs. London vs. Paris.

   GRAPHIC-NOVELS (Undated) _ Graphic novels, like those done by
Will Eisner and Art Spiegelman get serious attention. By Sarah
Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE-AGES-RETURN (Undated) _ Is it possible that cyberspace
and economic globalization are pushing the modern world back into
the Middle Ages? The idea is that the existing system of nation
states might be replaced, in the words of Oxford's Hedley Bull, by
``a modern and secular equivalent of the kind of universal
political organization that existed in Western Christendom in the
Middle Ages.'' By Paul Lewis.

   FBC-RHODEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sports of The Times column on the

essentially rendered meaningless. By William C. Rhoden.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-ROSE-BOWL (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Now UCLA will not have to
wonder about the national championship that could have been. Not
after Friday, when Wisconsin beat the Bruins, 38-31, in the 85th
Rose Bowl. By Ken Gurnick.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-SUGAR-BOWL (New Orleans) _ The Buckeyes (11-1) were able to
hold on and defeat Texas A&AMP;M 24-14. Now, the Buckeyes must wait for
the outcome of Monday's Fiesta Bowl game between Tennessee and
Florida State to determine whether they can finish campaigning for
a national championship. By Timothy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-FIESTA-SEMINOLES (Tempe, Ariz.) _ Florida State sneaked into
the national championship game in typical college football fashion:
they lost early, surged late and then watched the other contending
teams lose on the last major weekend. A feature about the team as
it prepares for the Fiesta Bowl on Monday. By Joe Drape.

GORDON, `LITTLE E' DOMI NANT PERFORMERS 
</HEADLINE>
 LOOKBACK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A look back at the major developments on the major racing
circuits during the 1998 season: &QL; 
 &QL; 
NASCAR Winston Cup
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champion: Jeff Gordon, No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes
Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: Gordon, 27, nearly was invincible. Boy Wonder
won 13 of 33 races, tying Richard Petty's modern-era record, and
recorded a remarkable 26 top-five finishes. If not for Gordon,
runner-up Mark Martin might have been the unstoppable driver.
Martin won a career-high seven races, had 22 top-five and 26 top-10
finishes, yet still finished a distant second by 364 points.
Chevrolet won the manufacturer's title, but the Ford Taurus,
NASCAR's first four-door stock car, wasn't the lemon so many Ford
teams cried it was before the season's first race. Chevy drivers
won 16 races, followed by Ford (15) and Pontiac (two).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: Records are made to be broken, and rules are
made to be changed. A new test session procedure will go into
effect, possibly reducing a major multicar team advantage. Although
teams still receive seven tests throughout the season, four must
take place at Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway, Talladega
(Ala.) Superspeedway, Charlotte (N.C.) Motor Speedway and
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and all will be run by the Ford and
General Motors manufacturers and monitored by NASCAR officials.
Chevy will debut a new Monte Carlo in May at Charlotte. Team Gordon
is developing the super speedway version of the new hardware. &QL; 
NASCAR Busch Series
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champion: Dale Earnhardt Jr., No. 3 ACDelco Chevrolet
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: The younger Earnhardt, now known as ``Little
E,'' made a dramatic entrance into big time stock-car racing.
Despite a rocky start, it wasn't long before he began to audition
for a future position as Winston Cup king. Earnhardt Jr., won seven
races and edged Matt Kenseth, another emerging star, for the
driving title.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: Earnhardt Jr. will spend another season in the
Busch Series but also will make five Winston Cup starts. And guess
who is scheduled to make five Busch starts? You guessed it, Jeff
Gordon. Unfortunately for Valley race fans, Gordon has said he
won't make one of those Busch starts at Phoenix International
Raceway, which was added to next season's schedule. No word yet on
whether Earnhardt will make PIR's Winston Cup race one of his
starts. But keep your fingers crossed. &QL; 
NASCAR Craftsman Trucks
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champion: Ron Hornaday, NAPA Brakes Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: What a season and what a fierce battle between
Hornaday and defending series champion Jack Sprague. The two
drivers not only delivered some memorable on-track skirmishes, but
also a war of words off the racetrack. In the end, Hornaday (six
wins) won a second championship in four years, edging Sprague (five
wins) by a scant three points.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: Both Hornaday and Sprague are returning, but
at the moment, third-place finisher Joe Ruttman is not. Ruttman was
told to take a walk by his car owner and is being replaced by Mike
Bliss. Tony Raines (three wins), Stacy Compton (two) and Bliss were
the only other drivers to bag more than one trip into victory lane
last year. &QL; 
CART
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champion: Alex Zanardi, No. 1 Target/Chip Ganassi Racing
Reynard-Honda.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: For the second successive season, Zanardi led
all drivers in wins (seven) and points. Jimmy Vasser, Zanardi's
teammate, won three races and finished runner-up in the series.
Up-and-coming Dario Franchitti also won three times and led all
drivers with five pole positions, one more than Greg Moore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: In an effort to reduce downforce and contain
escalating speeds on short ovals, the aerodynamic packages used
this season on intermediate ovals at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Twin
Ring Motegi in Japan and Gateway International (Ill.) Raceway also
will be in effect at Nazareth (Pa.) Speedway, The Milwaukee Mile
and the new Chicago Motor Speedway. Because of on-track incidents
this past season, Paul Tracy is suspended for the March 21 season
opener at Miami. Keep an eye on Franchitti. He may be your next
CART champion. &QL; 
Indy Racing League
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champion: Kenny Brack, No. 14 A.J. Foyt Enterprises/Power
Team Racing Dallara-Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: Five drivers led more laps, but Brack still won
a series-high three races. Eddie Cheever, a native Phoenician, won
the Indianapolis 500, and Billy Boat of Glendale was a qualifying
blur. Boat captured six pole positions, and Tony Stewart had four.
Despite what many fans think of the IRL, it has a loyal following.
And no one can criticize what happened on the racetrack, which
produced several exciting races.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: Tony Stewart, once tabbed as the IRL poster
boy, has departed for the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. Several IRL
racetracks still are struggling at the box office, and one of them
_ New Hampshire International Speedway _ has decided to throw in
the towel and won't return. Texas Motor Speedway, however, draws
well, and will host the season finale instead of Las Vegas. Several
night races have boosted attendance, and Pikes Peak International
Raceway now has two races. Of course, the Indy 500 continues to be
a sellout, with an estimated crowd in excess of 300,000. FOX Sports
and FOX Sports Net have joined the world of motorsports and will
televise 9 of 11 races. ABC will televise the remaining two,
including the Indy 500. &QL; 
Formula One
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champion: Mika Hakkinen, No. 8 McLaren-Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: Michael Schumacher may be not only the world's
greatest driver but its richest one after signing a three-year
contract extension worth an estimated $42 million a year. Maybe the
money will allow Schumacher to rest easier after finishing as
series runner-up for the second straight year. Still, Schumacher
won six races when early on it appeared Hakkinen and teammate David
Coulthard might run the table.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: Can Alex Zanardi do what CART champion Jacques
Villeneuve did two years ago, which is follow up the CART title
with the F-1 crown the next year? Villeneuve has left Williams and
signed with the new British American Racing team, and Zanardi has
replaced Villeneuve at Williams. McLaren and Ferrari still are the
teams to beat. &QL; 
National Hot Road Association
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1998 champions: Gary Scelzi, Team Winston Top Fuel Dragster;
John Force, Castrol GTX Ford Mustang Funny Car; Warren Johnson, GM
Goodwrench Service Plus Pontiac Firebird Pro Stock; Matt Hines,
Vance &AMP; Hines Racing Suzuki Pro Stock Motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reviewing 1998: Scelzi made it two straight, and Force now has
won six in a row and eight of the past nine. Johnson (nine wins)
had a monster season after two straight championship runs by Jim
Yates. And Hines has won two successive titles, this time beating
runner-up Angelle Seeling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Previewing 1999: NHRA officials apparently have decided not to
implement rules to curb escalating speeds, much to the happiness of
Top Fuel and Funny Car drivers, who maintain the 325 mph speeds are
safe. Teams are confident Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. has remained
ahead of the speed game, supplying them with rubber that not only
meets safety requirements, but also tremendous adhesion. &QL;

1998 A SEASON FOR THE BOOKS  
 YEAR SAW BOTH TRAGEDY, TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clearly, it was a season filled with good tidings as well as
dark moments.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeff Gordon, it was a season for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Unser Jr., it was a third consecutive season in which he
failed to crack victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the horrible tragedy in late July at Michigan
Speedway. After a single-car accident, an errant wheel flew into a
section of the Turn 4 grandstands, resulting in three spectator
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy also reared its head during the NASCAR Winston Cup
season, which is nothing new. But this time it involved alleged
cheating by Team Gordon, which was accused by car owner Jack Roush
of doctoring its Goodyear Eagle radial tires with an illegal
softening compound.
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Dale Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500, and John
Force won a sixth-successive National Hot Rod Association Funny Car
championship, yet didn't need to win 9,000 races to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant story of the year, however, had
nothing to do with an on-track event.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George announced the
famed Brickyard would be the site of a Formula One race beginning
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is the ongoing rift that separates Championship
Auto Racing Teams and George's Indy Racing League continued to
cause open-wheel headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were terrific races in both circuits, how many
were watching? Television ratings are poor as fans are left to pick
and choose between the two series. At some IRL venues, attendance
was abysmal; so abysmal that New Hampshire International Speedway
discontinued scheduling IRL races.
</P>
<P>
   The recently concluded season also meant retirement for Bobby
Rahal, who despite going winless over the past six seasons remains
one of the sport's all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk, who moved to Scottsdale eight years ago, also
decided to call it quits. Luyendyk recently announced he will make
next May's Indianapolis 500 the final act of his career, although
he hasn't ruled out future sports-car endeavors at Le Mans and
Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Turn out the lights, the 1998 racing party finally is
over. &QL;

1998 RACING SEASON'S BESTS AND WORSTS 
</HEADLINE>
 AND WORST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Season's best &QL; 
 &UR; Best race: If not for the tragic accident that resulted in three
spectator fatalities, Championship Auto Racing Teams' U.S. 500
easily would be the top pick. Some consider the race the best in
history. Non-stop action. Three-hour, seat-of-the-pants racing.
Yet, three fans died. So the choice goes to the Indy Racing
League's True Value 500K at Texas Motor Speedway.
 &UR; Greg Ray put both left-side wheels in the grass attempting to pass
 &UR; Billy
 &UR; Boat in the final few laps. Boat survived and won by .928 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best moment:  &UR; Dale Earnhardt winning the Daytona 500. If you
believe in the conspiracy theory, then you probably believe NASCAR
officials helped make Earnhardt's win possible. Doesn't matter. He
won. And what a grand moment it was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best ad-lib:  &UR; A.J. Foyt smashing a laptop computer in the pits
at the Indy 500 after his team miscalculated fuel mileage for
 &UR; Kenny Brack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best rags-to-riches story: Dale Earnhardt Jr. Nice guy doesn't
finish last. He finishes first, capturing the NASCAR Busch Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best performance by a runner-up:  &UR; Mark Martin. Do you get the
feeling that whenever Martin talks, you always get the honest
truth? Martin had a career season, yet never sulked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best set of lungs: John Force. Don't ever try to interview this
guy without a tape recorder. He can talk 10 minutes straight
without stopping to take a breath.  &UR; Michael Jordan goes through
several pairs of sneakers a season. Force goes through a year's
supply of Sucrets in seven days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best quote: ``No Chevy is going to win the championship this
year.'' Who said that? Crew chief  &UR; Ray Evernham following the Las
Vegas 400, a race dominated by Ford Taurus drivers. Oh, by the way.
Evernham is  &UR; Jeff Gordon's chief mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best driver you might never have heard of: Indiana teenager
 &UR; Boston Reid. Watch out for this sprint-car driver. He may be the
next Gordon. That's Jeff, not Robby. Runner-up?  &UR; Juan Pablo
Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best driver never to win a major championship: Where do we
start?  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Tracy?  &UR; Mark Martin?  &UR; Cory McClenathan? Why not  &UR; Robby Gordon?
Gordon soon will announce 1999 CART plans, and let's hope it's with
a contending team so he can display those immeasurable talents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best drive: Ageless  &UR; Ivan Stewart winning another Baja 1000
championship. Stewart should move to New York and start a taxi cab
company. No one can negotiate more potential potholes and
roadblocks than Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best television analyst without a job: Derek Daly. Some people
don't like his style. Not me. He should be working somewhere. &QL; 
 &UR; Season's worst &QL; 
 &UR; Worst race: Pontiac ``U''n-Excitement 400. Yawn. Don't forget to
turn out the lights. Come to think about it, the Las Vegas 400
wasn't all that exciting, either.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst crash: A tie between  &UR; Michael Andretti's amazing
non-injury accident at Mid-Ohio and the Formula One race in Belgium
that twice had to be restarted because of opening lap demolition
derbies. How did Andretti escape injury? Although he wound up in
the sand and looked like Pig Pen from the ``Peanuts'' cartoon when
he climbed from the car, Andretti was in one piece. Whew!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst controversy: Car owner  &UR; Jack Roush accusing &UR; Jeff Gordon's
team of illegally tampering with his team's tires.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst cloak and dagger scene: Foyt accusing someone of
illegally entering team's garage in Gasoline Alley. Where's Lt.
Columbo when you need him?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst performance by a former champion: Car owner  &UR; Roger
Penske. What's happened to this once-dominant team?  &UR; Al Unser Jr.
and  &UR; Andre Ribeiro were mostly non-threats. No way that should
happen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst traffic jam: Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix International
Raceway. Except for the race washing away the final 52 laps or so,
there were no problems on the racetrack. But a crowd in excess of
100,000 had to battle aggravating traffic congestion before and
after the race.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst decision: Adding a second IRL race at Pikes Peak
International Raceway. Why?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst decision II: Pairing television analysts  &UR; Buddy Baker
with Dr.  &UR; Dick
 &UR; Berggren. Baker is as good as there is, and Berggren is
terrifically knowledgeable, but when they're together, they just
don't seem to mesh.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst rumor: Gossip that  &UR; Mike Skinner would not return to
Richard Childress Racing in 1999. Guess what? He's back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst memory: The empty section of the Turn 4 grandstands at
Michigan Speedway, which was cleared of spectators after a wheel
flew into the crowd. Shouldn't the race have been stopped?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst financial investment: Come on, now. I don't care
if &UR; Michael
 &UR; Schumacher could put a horse and buggy on the pole at Monaco, no
driver is worth $42 million a season or whatever the ridiculous
amount he is being paid. &QL;

 TEAM-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic's All-1998 Racing Team. The envelope,
please . . . &QL; 
 &UR; DRIVER OF THE YEAR &QL; 
 &UR; Jeff Gordon
</P>
<P>
   Can you spell d-o-m-i-n-a-n-t? Gordon won 13 NASCAR Winston Cup
races and finished outside the top five about as often as A.J. Foyt
wears a tie. Critics maintain any driver could have climbed behind
Gordon's steering wheel and delivered the same performance. Bull. &QL; 
 &UR; 2. Alex Zanardi
</P>
<P>
   There were many secrets falling into the worst kept category
throughout the year, but few could match the rumor of Zanardi's
impending departure to Formula One. Although Zanardi is pulling a
Jacques Villeneuve and leaving the Championship Auto Racing Teams
circuit after seven wins and a second straight championship, at
least he is leaving in style. Zanardi clinched the title in race
No. 15 of a 19-race season. Now that's getting the job done. &QL;  &UR; 3.
Mika Hakkinen
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari's Michael Schumacher easily could be in this position.
In a Formula One season in which McLaren-Mercedes (Hakkinen and
teammate David Coulthard) was a heavy preseason favorite,
Schumacher still won six races and took Hakkinen down to the wire.
But Hakkinen was brilliant. He could have wilted under Schumacher's
constant pressure, but he won eight races, including the season
finale to capture the crown. That's a record worth rewarding. &QL;   &UR; 4.
 &UR; Michael Schumacher
</P>
<P>
   See above. &QL;   &UR; 5. Mark Martin
</P>
<P>
   If not for Gordon, the gritty Martin would have sat at
Waldorf-Astoria's head table during the NASCAR awards banquet.
Martin had a career year by winning seven races and finishing in
the top five almost as often as Gordon. But as Gordon is proving,
banner seasons aren't nearly enough. &QL;   &UR; 6. Dale
 &UR; Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Where in the name of Valvoline did this good-natured kid come
from? Sure, we knew there was an Earnhardt Jr. out there trying to
scratch out a short-track living. But who could have guessed he'd
jump into the NASCAR Busch Series and treat it as if he'd been
around for a dozen years? ``Little E'' won seven races, four more
than anyone else, and also captured the title. Yes, he jumped into
a good seat, replacing Steve Parks on a team owned by his parents.
But the younger Earnhardt still had to produce. He did. &QL;   &UR; 7. Kenny
Brack
</P>
<P>
   Swedish driver won the Indy Racing League title, putting a smile
on car owner A.J. Foyt's face that will last until spring. Although
some might question the overall talent in the IRL, any gearhead
worth his or her salt knows Brack knows how to turn left. En route
to the championship, he won three races. In the end, he won more
than that. He won over Foyt. &QL;   &UR; 8. Warren
 &UR; Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, Bob Glidden, but someone is nearing your
National Hot Rod Association winning record. Glidden, now retired,
has 85 career Pro Stock wins. Johnson, who drove into nine victory
lanes this season, now has 73. But the feisty Johnson also is 55
years old. Time will tell whether ``WJ'' still has enough giddy-up
left in his tank to overtake Glidden. &QL;   &UR; 9. Gary
 &UR; Scelzi
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of giddy-up, how about that Scelzi guy? A newcomer in
1997, Scelzi was hand-picked to replace the late Blaine Johnson,
and he responded with the NHRA Top Fuel championship in his rookie
season. He won another title in '98, which included six wins and
the fastest quarter-mile blip in NHRA history with an astonishing
326.44 mph blast at the Texas Motorplex. Scelzi also delivered the
second quickest pass in history with a 4.525-second run. &QL;   &UR; 10.
Dario Franchitti
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti didn't finish first or second in CART's final
standings _ he was No. 3 _ but he won three races, second only to
Zanardi. Compare those statistics to 1997, his rookie year, when
his best finish was ninth. Franchitti outdrove teammate Paul Tracy.
Give the Scotsman a cigar, but make him smoke it outside. &QL; 
 &QL;  &UR; Honorable mention
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kinser (World of Outlaws champion), Jason Leffler (U.S.
Auto Club Silver Crown and Midget champion), John Force (NHRA Funny
Car titlist), Dale Jarrett (NASCAR Winston Cup third-place
finisher), Ron Hornaday (NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion),
Jimmy Vasser (CART runner-up), Paul Gentilozzi (Sports Car Club of
America Trans-Am champion), Matt Kenseth (Busch runner-up) and Tony
Stewart (IRL third-place finisher). &QL;

ASU COMBINES SWIM PROGRAMS  
 WOMEN'S COACH FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
 SWIMMING-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move most surprising because of the in-season timing,
Arizona State is combining its swim programs under first-year men's
Coach Mike Chasson and firing 14th-year women's Coach Tim Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was placed on administrative &QL; 
leave this week, and his contract will not be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a formal monthlong committee study of
problems with attrition in the women's program that affect
competitive results and graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   When seniors Carrie Anderson and Kelly Wilson quit early this
season, which began in October and continues through March, ASU was
left with one senior, Tiffany Houser, from a class that began with
eight. The junior class that once was 15 now is seven. Staff
turnover also has been high.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's teams had slipped from five top-10 NCAA finishes in the
late 1980s and early '90s to 23rd, 28th and 29th in the past three
seasons. The Sun Devils are ranked 21st in the most recent Speedo
America College Swimming Coaches Association top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ASU athletic department officials are restricted in their
comments about Hill's release because of university policy, but
associate athletic director Sandy Hatfield Clubb said her committee
did extensive research into the issue of combined vs. separate
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial thought was to find another Mike Chasson on the
women's side,'' Hatfield Clubb said. ``We're committed to hiring
women coaches for women's teams when we can do that. But the
(female coaching) pool is very small in swimming, very much like in
track.''
</P>
<P>
   So after studying successful combined programs, including the
University of Arizona under Frank Busch, the 1998 USA Swimming
Coach of the Year, and Southern California, with U.S. 2000 Olympic
men's Coach Mark Schubert, as well as the standout separate
programs at Stanford and Texas, a decision was made to combine.
</P>
<P>
   ASU officially combined its men's and women's track teams under
a single head coach, now Greg Kraft, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield Clubb said positives of a combined program include a
higher-quality training environment, particularly for the women,
and better morale and respect between the men's and women's
swimmers. The biggest negatives for a relatively small staff are
recruiting demands and getting over the top to a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our swimming image is one that needs some rebuilding on both
the men's and women's side to attract that national U.S. kid,'' she
said. ``We believe combining the program will help facilitate that
more quickly since the top prospects all come from combined (club)
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting issue has become especially sensitive in recent
years because local elite high schoolers such as Misty Hyman
(Stanford), Sarah Tolar and Emily Mastin (both UA) are excelling
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Wales, who was working with the men, and Heather
Johnston, Hill's first-year assistant, will serve on Chasson's
staff, along with Derigan Silver, promoted from graduate assistant.
Mark Bradshaw is in his second season as diving coach.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield Clubb said a national search for two assistants will be
held after the season, with Johnston and Silver able to reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Chasson, 46, came to ASU from Harvard after the retirement of
men's Coach Ernie Maglischo. He has coached a combined team (Los
Altos and Santa Barbara swim clubs) and was assistant women's coach
at Stanford before taking the Harvard men's head coaching job in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has a terrific plan moving into this new combined
program,'' Hatfield Clubb said. ``He's already got the guys
swimming faster than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The ASU men are ranked 11th nationally, one spot below their
1998 NCAA finish. At the Texas Invitational in early December,
senior All-America Francisco Sanchez broke meet records in the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles and was part of two record-setting free
relays.
</P>
<P>
   The ASU men (1-2) will return to dual-meet competition Friday
against Brigham Young. The men and women (2-2-1) then will host
Utah on Jan. 9. &QL;

HULL, STARS SINK COYOTES IN BATTLE OF WEST'S BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It has to be destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars simply can't be stopped right now. Heck, they can't
even be slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of swallowing a disappointing tie
with the Phoenix Coyotes, the Stars came up with their first
overtime victory of the season and extended their franchise record
unbeaten streak to 14 games (11-0-3) with a 2-1 victory last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get on a roll, those things tend to go right for
you,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``And right now, things are
going right.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Coyotes tied the game with 32.6 seconds remaining in
regulation on a Deron Quint goal with the extra skater on the ice,
the Stars appeared to have finally had too much hockey in too short
a time. Playing on back-to-back nights against a hungry pack of
Coyotes, a tie seemed a noble defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Modano wouldn't hear of it. The Stars center finished
off a heroic night with a heroic play as he set up Brett Hull for
the game-winner 37 seconds into the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Modano took a pass from linemate Jere Lehtinen and fought
through the check of Coyotes defenseman Keith Carney, falling to
the ice while diving over Carney's stick. But keeping his head
about him, Modano was able to sweep a pass to Hull, who was
trailing down the right wing, and the sniper popped in his
team-leading 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The play sucked the juice right out of an arena bent on making a
point against the league-leading Stars. With the Coyotes playing
without their first line of Keith Tkachuk (broken rib), Jeremy
Roenick (concussion) and Dallas Drake (suspension) _ a trio that
has combined for 37 goals _ the Coyotes wanted to prove something
in a Pacific Division battle matching the teams with the two best
winning percentages in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to make a statement, and I think they did to some
extent,'' Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``They wanted this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   As did the Stars. Despite missing defenseman Richard Matvichuk
with a charley horse and missing New Year's Eve festivities after
having flown after a game in Dallas the night before, the Stars
were in no mood to be charitable.
</P>
<P>
   So, they ran their league-best record to 24-5-6, moved eight
points ahead of the Coyotes (21-8-4) in the standings, and matched
this season's NHL-best 14-game unbeaten streak, ironically enough,
set by the Coyotes earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Stars goalie Roman Turek stayed undefeated at
6-0-2, the Stars set a franchise record for longest road unbeaten
streak (nine games) and the Stars' power play proved itself by
scoring against the best penalty killers in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   That power-play goal appeared to be the turning point in the
game as Modano scored off a smooth pass from Lehtinen at the 4:24
mark of the third period. The game had been dominated by Turek and
Coyotes' goalie Nikolai Khabibulin until that time, but the Stars
scored their league-best 41st power-play goal against a Coyotes
penalty kill that was yielding its 16th.
</P>
<P>
   That goal looked to be the game-winner as both teams played
physical defense for the remainder of the period. But Quint was
able to stuff in the rebound of a Shane Doan shot with 32.6 seconds
remaining, and the Coyotes appeared to have made their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing. You're going against the best team in the
league while you're missing your three big guns, and you have a
chance to win the game,'' Quint said. ``There's no question we were
in there, and we gave them a little scare, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a playoff game,'' he said. ``It's the kind of game we
might have to play against that team in the playoffs, if it comes
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the records say it could.

   MOSCOW _ It was near midnight seven years ago when a vast crowd
gathered outside KGB headquarters here as four cranes hoisted from
its pedestal a statue of a hated man: Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of
the secret police that helped keep the Soviet Union in fear for 74
years.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Russia's Parliament voted to put the statue back.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the two events bookmarks in Russia's story.
</P>
<P>
   One opened an era of almost dizzy optimism about the nation's
prospects for the freedom and economic prosperity that have eluded
it for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The other closed it. The extravagant hopes that a Western-style
capitalism would emerge straight away out of the ruins of the
Soviet empire are gone, buried in the financial collapse and mood
of bitter disappointment that have swept Russia this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over a Dzerzhinsky resurrection pinpoints a
disturbing split in Russian society, which is not only about ways
of looking back on history. After seven years of democracy, and
economic disarray that has passed for capitalism, Russians are more
divided than ever about which direction their country should go:
whether to embrace the West and its models, or to remain apart,
wrapped in the solace of Russia's historical peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure the nation, President Boris N. Yeltsin
insisted in a year-end message that crisis or not, free-market
reforms would continue. Yet many ordinary Russians have to think of
reforms as a sidewalk game of three-card monte. However often the
cards are played, Russians feel there is no way they can win.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, most of them concur: Yeltsin, who promised to lead
them safely out of Communism, has betrayed their trust. Polls show
him with the support of 1 percent of the population _ roughly the
same level as that of his predecessor and nemesis, the former
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling of the widespread disillusionment, the most
popular politician in public opinion surveys is usually ``none of
the above.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russians celebrated the coming of a new year, the jokes and
toasts all hinted at more gloom to come. There was a similar sense
of uncertainty back in January 1992 when Russia made its first leap
into a market economy. But then, at least, there was a hope that
change, however painful, was all for the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pessimism has descended on us,'' said Vasily Rybin, who used
to work in an iron casting factory but now sells stuffed animals
outside McDonald's restaurant at Pushkin Square. ``I am afraid it
will stay for the year. I would like to hope for the best, but I
think things will get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Yeltsin era may be drawing to a close, it is too soon
to write the epitaph for Russian reform. For all of the nostalgia
about the secure days of Soviet rule, when paychecks and pensions
were guaranteed, if meager, few want to re-create the past. The
re-establishment of the Soviet Union's brutal totalitarian controls
and the widespread renationalization of factories and refineries
seem the remotest of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even senior Kremlin aides agree that Russia is exhausted by its
political war with itself. Oleg N. Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief
of staff, says it could be several years before any further attempt
to liberalize the economy is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing very difficult years; stagnation is possible,''
Sysuyev said in an interview. ``But a U-turn is not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick snapshot of Russia today suggests something far beyond
stagnation. The nation's gross domestic product fell 5 percent in
1998 and experts predict a similar drop in 1999. Roughly half the
nation's business is conducted in barter.
</P>
<P>
   Even demography appears to be delivering its harsh verdict on
the new Russia. With the toll of early mortality outpacing births,
Russia's population in 1998 fell to 146.4 million, a drop of more
than 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's distress was summed up when a schoolteacher in
Ulyanovsk, Lenin's birthplace, died after a prolonged hunger
strike, started because of months of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some bad times, but I have never seen people as
panicky as today,'' said Dmitri Maratovich, the editor of labor
newspapers in the Kemerovo coal mining basin in southern Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Such misfortune, however, does not provide a full measure of
where Russia has come from. And by that standard, the nation has
made important _ even fundamental _ progress. For all of its
troubles, the country is in many ways unrecognizable compared with
the hulk of a nation Yeltsin inherited in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has become a noisy, even raucous democracy. Its citizens
can now travel abroad, and millions of them do.
</P>
<P>
   Though often subservient to economic interests, Russian
newspapers, radio and television are uncensored. Virtually any
political opinion can be found at the thousands of newsstands in
Moscow alone.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenal rise of the Internet _ even the Communist Party
has a web site _ seems to insure there can be no retreat to the
days when the state defined reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more from the democrats, but nevertheless they have
not given up on freedom of speech and freedom of conscience,'' said
Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of the nation's most venerated scholars.
``It is essential not to lose those freedoms, especially now when
they are under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the economic news all bad. Moscow's streets, barren 15
years ago, now are jammed 18 hours a day; the number of autos has
tripled in seven years, and the pollution is horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves are no longer bare, but stocked with foreign
consumer goods, although they are often beyond the means of many
Russians. Russians own more home appliances than they could have
dreamed of in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Nadezhda Inshev, her husband, Leonid, and their two children,
are crammed into two rooms of a communal apartment near the Moscow
River. They live off her husband's wages as a truck driver and
whatever she can earn from her knitting.
</P>
<P>
   Times were tough, even before the financial crisis. But the
Inshevs own a Sony color television, bought the other year when her
husband's employer finally paid six months in back wages.
</P>
<P>
   It is the deep disillusionment over Russia's ability to pull
itself out of its quagmire, however, that makes the current period
such a singularly bitter one.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Russia's pro-capitalist reformers were never widely
popular. They inherited a nightmarish burden: labor-intensive
factories that were unable to compete in the world marketplace,
chronically inefficient collective farms and a gargantuan,
money-draining military establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But they proved to be poor politicians. Their guiding assumption
was a kind of economic determinism that held that the public would
be brought along if only the economic software was changed.
</P>
<P>
   And in a calculated exercise in realpolitik, the reformers
forged an alliance with the bankers and other buccaneers of
Russia's wild new capitalism, who acquired billions of dollars
worth of government oil and metal companies at rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   At first, this worked. But, over time, the insider privatization
gave capitalism a bad odor and the public's patience wore out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became disenchanted with the reformers three years ago, when
it became clear that reform is a battle for power, for the division
of property, and that there is no clear economic program,'' said
Nikita Makulov, 69, a retired system programmer whose monthly
pension today is worth all of $20.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reformers insist they were on the right track but
acknowledge that they never got their message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the time it would take to prepare people for
reforms,'' Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the prime minister who was ousted
after the August crash, said in an interview. ``People did not
understand how much needed to be done to carry out the reforms or
the price they would have to pay to achieve them. And the
government maintained the illusion that it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Communists also threw a monkey wrench into the gears. They
used their control over the Parliament to block legislation that
would have provided the legal underpinnings for a new capitalist
order: the right to buy and sell land, protection for foreign
investors and the overhaul of an anachronistic tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The underdeveloped legal system is summed up by a nondescript
stucco building that fronts a narrow street east of the vast,
magnificent Kremlin. Only a tarnished plaque by the door makes
clear that it is the office of the Russian Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, it seemed, Russia's ruling classes mocked the laws
and rules they promised to uphold. The head of the State Tax
Service took lavish Pacific cruises on his modest government
salary, even as tax collection was plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   The coup de grace for the Russian public, however, was the Aug.
17 financial crisis, which robbed the government of its two
greatest economic achievements: a stable currency and, by Russian
standards, relatively low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It also robbed many Russians of their hope. Festooned now around
their gritty capital are a series of patriotic summons: ``Nobody
will help Russia, except ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The placards have been installed by the State Tax Service to
prod tax delinquents to pay up. While there is no indication that
they have accomplished that purpose, the posters have almost
unconsciously tapped the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   Russians no longer believe the West will come to their rescue.
They do not even count on their own government to pay overdue
pensions and back wages or to protect the billions of rubles in
savings that Russians had deposited in banks that collapsed with
the rest of the economy after the August devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A new nationwide survey of 4,800 Russians by the Center for
International Sociological Research captures the sour mood. An
overwhelming majority _ 79 percent _ said the country was stymied
by political paralysis. Asked to name the political figure they
trusted the most, ``Nobody'' won with 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the survey notes, this is a nation in which virtually
everyone _ 97 percent _ agrees that their standard of living took a
turn for the worse in 1998, potatoes are the most common food _ 58
percent _ and slightly more than half _ 51 percent _ think the
coming year will be ``ominous.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's inability to rally around a common standard is
symbolized by the continuing debate over the Dzerzhinsky statue.
Those in the countryside, workers and Communists strongly support
the vote to restore the monument. Most Muscovites remain opposed,
leaving the fate of Parliament's decision in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fiery emotion, the real issue is not the statue but
the political gridlock that makes Russia almost impossible to
govern.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest realization for many Russians is the discovery that
one of the biggest obstacles to change lies within themselves. Even
reformers admit that they are still burdened by a mentality
bequeathed to them by a Soviet regime that squashed initiative,
fostered hypocrisy and taught its citizens to abdicate
responsibility for a government they never thought of as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the only one to blame for our situation, not the IMF
or the G-7,'' Sysuyev said. ``All of us suffer from a Soviet
mentality because we lived almost our whole lives under an
absolutely inhuman system. The first real free person in Russia
today was born in some maternity ward just in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians look deeper into their history, past the 70 years
of Communism, into a society and a culture that has long been riven
by debates over whether Russia does or does not belong in the West.
Echoes of those old debates can be heard again now, as ugly
anti-Semitism and bitter anti-Americanism creep into the political
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But while Russia sometimes seems to revert to its old peculiar
ways, there is also evidence that even if it wants to, it can no
longer afford to shun the club of civilized nations, hemmed in as
it is by MTV on one side and the International Monetary Fund on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their short-term pessimism, many Russians _ known
for their patience _ take a long view. Makulov looks to his son,
Alyosha, a mathematician who develops data bases for a private
company and whose salary supports his parents (even after it was
halved by the summer's financial crisis).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is different from me, of course,'' said the father. ``I
think that the next generation _ or maybe the next after that _
will find a way to make this potentially rich country rich. My
sense is that everything that is happening is movement in the right
direction, albeit by the most mistaken and painful of means. It
just wasn't thought through.''

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BITTER-CAPITALISM (Moscow) _ After seven years of
democracy, and economic disarray that has passed for capitalism,
Russians are more divided than ever about which direction their
country should go: whether to embrace the West and its models, or
to remain apart, wrapped in the solace of Russia's historical
peculiarities. By Michael R. Gordon and Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-DICHOTOMY (Aachen, Germany) _ Europe has two faces, light
and dark, and they are evident on Germany's western and eastern
borders as the continent crowns four decades of integration with
the adoption of a single currency, the euro. By Roger Cohen. With a
graphic and a map.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-MEDIA-CRUSADER (Mexico City) _ The burgeoning media
empire of Alejandro Junco de la Vegais is revolutionizing Mexican
journalism and emerging as one of the most authoritative referees
in the country's democratic transition. By Sam Dillon. With a map.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-ASSESS (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ As two Khmer Rouge
leaders accused of killing more than a million people toured a
balmy seaside town with their military escort and deferential
guides the other day, they drove past the jail where two Cambodian
human rights workers were receiving different treatment. The
workers were being held without bail on vague charges after they
advised protesters who demonstrated recently against the dumping of
toxic waste at the edge of town. Ten of the protesters were also
arrested. It is a contrast that highlights the inequities hobbling
Cambodia's development into a free and democratic state. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-MILITARISM (Tokyo) _ With warnings like its latest threat
to wipe American imperialists ``from this planet for good,'' North
Korea seems to have grown more hard-line and militarized in recent
months, and some experts fear a major security crisis on the Korean
Peninsula later this year. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-ASSESS (Washington) _ Nearly eight years after the
1991 Persian Gulf War started, Saddam Hussein is still shooting at
American pilots and the United States still has no clear strategy
for defeating him. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-MONARCHY (United Nations) _ American officials are casting
their nets wide to find a credible opposition leader or perhaps a
figurehead who might lead Iraq after Saddam Hussein, meeting even
with a man who would be king. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CHILDHOOD-CANCER (Baytown, Texas) _ In the late 1960s, fewer
than one-third of cancer patients under age 15 lived for five years
past their date of diagnosis, the point at which experts consider
them cured. Today, survival is not the exception but the rule.
Roughly three-quarters of all children currently being treated for
cancer are expected to reach the five-year mark. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   OREGON-HEALTHCARE (Portland, Ore.) _ Nearly five years ago,
Oregon began putting an idea to work that seemed both harsh and
humane: In return for health insurance paid by the government, the
poor would be required to join health maintenance organizations and
have their care rationed. But the Oregon Health Plan is hitting
roadblocks. The state has abandoned its promise of universal care.
Doctors routinely find ways to get around the rationing. And
conflicts with federal Medicaid regulators have impeded efforts to
deny more treatments. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   CRUISESHIP-CRIME (Miami) _ The dumping of oil and other wastes
by cruise ships, which can create lasting pollution problems in
oceans and coastal areas, is more common than previously known. And
it reveals an influential industry that has assembled an
international lobbying force to plead its case. Royal Caribbean's
included two former U.S. attorneys general, Elliot L. Richardson
and Benjamin R. Civiletti. An examination of a criminal
investigation of the industry shows how difficult it is for
authorities to police the booming cruise business as it launches
ever larger ships, and how determined the industry is to make
itself exempt from American regulation. By Douglas Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-CORRUPTION _ A wave of union corruption, including a
widening scandal at New York City's largest municipal union, has
thrown the labor movement off stride at a time when it is straining
to improve its image and persuade millions more Americans to join
unions. By Steven Greenhouse. With a photo.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-RURAL-INTERNET (North Adams, Mass.) _ Even unimaginative
futurists predict that some not-so-distant day, geography will
barely matter. Humanity's web of electronic connections will trump
it utterly. But here is the transitional rub: Sometimes the places
that most need to overcome geography have the hardest time doing
it, because they are handicapped by their distance from the nearest
trunk lines of the long-distance carriers that offer Internet
connections. By Carey Goldberg. With a photo.
</P>
<P>
   COSBY-MURDER-APPEAL (Los Angeles) _ Lawyers for the man
convicted of killing Bill Cosby's son have filed a petition to set
aside his conviction, citing testimony in another trial that their
client did not write letters admitting to the murder.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLIMATE-TREATY (Washington) _ Even as a proposed treaty on
global warming faces an uncertain future in the Senate, big
companies are maneuvering to gain legal credit for early actions to
control greenhouse gases. By John H. Cushman.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LOTT (Washington) _ Right after the Republican losses in
November's elections, a disheartened Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, quickly got the hint: Voters wanted a mended Social
Security system, an orderly budget, good schools. They wanted
action, not self-serving brawling about legislation and
impeachment. But Lott can no longer keep impeachment at arm's
length. By Lizette Alvarez. With a photo.
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCE-PROBE (Washington) _ Commerce Secretary William M.
Daley has asked the department's inspector general to expand his
investigation into whether officials systematically concealed and
destroyed documents sought in a lawsuit, after a federal judge made
those charges in a stinging rebuke of the department, officials
said last week. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>

<P>
   In 1994, when a small but influential group of criminologists
and politicians began fixing their gaze on the end of the 20th
century, they saw a crime storm on the horizon, one teeming with a
new breed of superpredators who would soon be reaching their teens.
</P>
<P>
   According to their forecasts, the storm should have hit by now.
Instead, the sky has been clearing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the rate of homicides committed by 14- to
17-year-olds, which leapt from 10 per 100,000 in 1985 to 30.2 in
1993, has gone down every year since, to 16.5 in 1997, said James
Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, statistics released by the Justice Department last
week indicated that robberies by offenders of all ages fell a
staggering 17 percent in 1997, continuing the seven-year drop in
violent crime that followed the crime surge of the 1980s. That
drop, criminologists say, is being driven by the falloff in the
crack market and by concerted efforts by police departments across
the country to seize handguns from juveniles, among other causes.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not exactly what Fox _ along with James Q. Wilson of
UCLA, John DiIulio of Princeton University, and Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., the chairman of the House subcommittee on crime _ foresaw
in their crystal balls several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, for example, DiIulio, a professor of politics
and public affairs, suggested that a dip in crime, already
perceptible then, was ``the lull before the crime storm.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that was the case, said Franklin Zimring, a professor of
law at the University of California at Berkeley, who was skeptical
of such forecasts, ``We should have our umbrellas open right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who doesn't recall using a weather analogy but did
firmly predict rising youth crime, is more blunt than Zimring.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it clearly hasn't happened,'' he said. ``This is a
good indication of what little all of us know about criminology.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pessimistic predictions was a historical
fact: teen-agers commit a lot of crimes. Therefore, it seemed to
follow, more teen-agers would mean more crime.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not too late for the doomsday prognostications to
come true, given that they were projected from now through 2010 and
beyond, it's worth examining why they have not held so far.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most exaggerated factor underpinning the anticipated
youth crime wave has been demographics. In January 1996, the
Council on Crime in America, an organization of prosecutors and
law-enforcement experts, issued a report compiled by DiIulio
describing violent crime as a ``ticking time bomb'' that would go
off as the number of teen-agers soared in the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimring contends that too much has been made of the
anticipated boom in the adolescent population. Consider that the
number of Americans aged 14 to 24 is expected to grow about one
percent a year from 1995 to 2010 _ from 40.1 million to almost 47
million _ a total increase of about 16 percent. By comparison, the
growth in adolescents during the baby boom, from 1960 to 1975, was
50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the correlation between increases in the juvenile
population and a rise in violent crime has been regarded as
conventional wisdom, the link has hardly proven strong in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   During the five years that the homicide rate among teen-age
offenders has been falling, the population of adolescents has
already begun to rise. And when the homicide rate among adolescents
was spiking in the early 1990s, the adolescent population was flat.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a professor emeritus in the school of management at UCLA
who has written extensively about crime, now says that in
foreseeing a youth crime wave, he may have focused too much on
population increases at the expense of intangibles like ``the
perception of young people about the costs and benefits of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Though rates of violent crime have been influenced by a host of
more quantifiable factors _ the availability of guns, the growth in
the economy, the expansion of crime-prevention programs _ Zimring
says he is uncomfortable with trying to predict the criminal
potential of someone who may be just a toddler now, if born at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been weird has been this single focus: we're only
interested in kids four years old now and how many kids they're
going to shoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Snyder, director of systems research for the National
Center for Juvenile Justice in Pittsburgh, a longtime skeptic about
the predicted crime wave, thinks many people, especially
politicians, have an incentive to be pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People naturally have this pessimism about what's going to
happen, especially with kids,'' he said. ``If you predict the
future's going to be terrible, you're in a win-win situation. If it
does happen, you were right. If it doesn't, your raising the flag
of concern helped turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the gloomy oratory has already ``changed the nature of
juvenile justice,'' by enabling many states to pass laws that make
it easier to try and imprison youthful offenders as adults.
</P>
<P>
   DiIulio, one of the most vocal prophets of the coming storm, did
not return telephone calls last week. But Fox, whose analysis
DiIulio has cited, says that a number of signs remain ominous.
</P>
<P>
   He projects, for example, that growth in the population of black
males _ those 14 to 17 years old, as well as to 18 to 24 _ will
grow at a steeper rate than their white male counterparts during
the first two decades of the 21st century. And if history holds, he
said, young blacks will be responsible for a disproportionate share
of violent crimes when compared with whites.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests further that the rate of homicides committed by
youths 14 to 17 years old _ 16.5 per 100,000 in 1997 _ while nearly
half of what it was in 1993, remains nearly double the 20-year low
of 8.5 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that Fox continues to see bad weather on the
horizon, as he did so clearly three years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``We may indeed see a resurgence in youth violence,'' Fox said.
``I say `may.' I didn't say `will.'''

   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate returns to Washington this week to
begin an impeachment trial of President Clinton, the airwaves and
Op-Ed pages are filled with prophecies of doom. A year of scandal
and partisanship on a scale unseen in a generation has, it is said,
left the capital adrift and the president paralyzed no matter how
the senators vote. The White House rarely misses a chance to
exploit that worry, warning darkly about how a prolonged trial,
much less the removal of a president, could unravel this Age of
Prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and fifty miles north, on Wall Street, life looks
different. The Dow's party goes on. It ended the year well above
9,000, after a plunge in September and October that now seems like
nothing worse than a terrifying bungee-jump that punctuated a
delightful vacation. No one is sure exactly what brought it back _
maybe Alan Greenspan's interest rate cuts, maybe new money for the
International Monetary Fund, maybe the hope that 18 months of
global chaos is morphing into something more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are still anxieties about profits, deflation, slow
growth and the gnawing sense that whatever afflicted Asia and
Russia is simply in remission.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the intersection of those views _ Washington's
certainty that what's happening here matters to the government's
ability to manage the nation and its economy, and the markets' view
that the political wars and moral arguments here are irrelevant _
lies a dynamic that seems bound to define 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-proven maxim that in good times, countries can
thrive even when their governments are paralyzed. Japan is perhaps
the premiere example: In the 1980s, Japanese industrialists boasted
that the weakness of the Japanese state was one secret of their
success.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of the past few years in Japan, Russia, Asia
and Latin America suggests that once things go awry, a distracted
or weak government can make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a man who
has lived in both worlds, went out of his way last week to portray
Clinton as a president in full, remarkably undistracted by the
prospect of an imminent trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him a lot lately, and when he comes into our
meetings he is fully there,'' Rubin said. ``He is remarkably
focused on what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the president is engaged or depressed, consumed with his
fate or determined to turn his mind to other things, the question
remains: Are there unforeseen dangers emanating from the ugliness
of the past year?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell, especially at a moment when it is unclear
whether Clinton's trial in the Senate will be long, or as many
suggested last week, could move quickly to the question of censure.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue hardly goes away when the trial ends. Will the
legacy of partisanship end any chance of working out a deal on
Social Security or the range of other issues on the national
agenda?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as many moderates in both parties argue, will there be a
drive to get something done, anything that would enable incumbents
to go to the voters with something more to show than a vote on Bill
Clinton's behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in Washington, which has been wrong at
virtually every turn in this melodrama, sides with the gridlock
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, at least for now, gridlock sounds fine. More
than a few top executives say that a Congress consumed with
impeachment is a Congress too distracted to raise taxes or think up
new ways to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   But that is mostly loose cocktail party talk, the kind of
bravado born of good times. Government action never seems more
useless than when interest rates and unemployment are hovering near
30-year lows, when budgets are in balance, when crime is down and
Internet stocks are trading at levels that seem to defy logic.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember September and October, a time of terror in the
markets, when it seemed as if Asia's troubles and Russia's default
had arrived on America's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The almost-crash of '98 prompted muted talk of a global
recession and fears that the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, a huge hedge fund, presaged big trouble. The big
question was: What was Washington going to do, and how quickly was
it going to do it?
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Washington acted pretty fast. Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, came through with three
interest-rate cuts. Clinton gave speech after speech urging other
nations to focus on growth and forget about inflation fears, and
they cut rates, too. A scared Congress approved new financing for
the International Monetary Fund. The Fed coordinated a private
sector bailout of Long-Term Capital Management. Things settled
down, defying Washington's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Those were largely actions that the Federal Reserve and the
executive branch could execute by themselves. What no one yet knows
is whether Washington's immersion in the impeachment, the culture
wars and the positioning for supremacy at the polls could distract
it from more politically difficult steps needed to sustain
America's boom.

30-year lows, when budgets are in balance, when crime is down and
Internet stocks are trading at levels that seem to defy logic.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember September and October, a time of terror in the
markets, when it seemed as if Asia's troubles and Russia's default
had arrived on America's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The almost-crash of '98 prompted muted talk of a global
recession and fears that the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, a huge hedge fund, presaged big trouble. The big
question was: What was Washington going to do, and how quickly was
it going to do it?
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Washington acted pretty fast. Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, came through with three
interest-rate cuts. Clinton gave speech after speech urging other
nations to focus on growth and forget about inflation fears, and
they cut rates, too. A scared Congress approved new financing for
the International Monetary Fund. The Fed coordinated a private
sector bailout of Long-Term Capital Management. Things settled
down, defying Washington's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Those were largely actions that the Federal Reserve and the
executive branch could execute by themselves. What no one yet knows
is whether Washington's immersion in the impeachment, the culture
wars and the positioning for supremacy at the polls could distract
it from more politically difficult steps needed to sustain
America's boom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   History, an uncertain guide, suggests that the risk is real.
</P>
<P>
   President Andrew Johnson's impeachment in 1868 led to an era of
weak government and, the next year, a Black Friday in which a major
Wall Street firm sought to corner the market for all gold in the
country outside the Treasury. International trade, which was
settled in gold at the time, briefly came to a halt. The next 20
years were marked by forgettable presidents and a succession of
panics and scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But as David Donald, the Harvard historian of the Civil War and
Reconstruction eras, said in an interview recently, what happened
in America in the 1860s and 1870s ``didn't radiate out into the
world, except to confirm the European view that America is a
barbarous and uncouth nation.'' Nor did the economic events beyond
U.S. borders require swift or decisive action in Washington. ``This
time,'' he said, ``it could be different.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is plenty of evidence around the world in recent
years that political distraction in one country can affect the
wealth of other nations. Japan is the most conspicuous example.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese in the late 1980s not only thought they were on top
of the world, they thought the chaos in their own government barely
mattered. Bribery scandals and the political power struggles that
in 1993 resulted in the ouster of the Liberal Democrats after 35
years of increasingly corrupt rule, all seemed like a side show to
an economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is clear that Japan was like a car that had
run out of gas, but had so much momentum that the passengers didn't
notice until the scenery stopped moving.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians didn't notice even then; they raised taxes, making a
bad situation worse. They ignored a trillion dollars in bad debts,
hoping a market upturn would make it all go away. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The story was similar in Thailand, South Korea and especially
Russia, where U.S. officials were warning President Boris Yeltsin
two years ago that a free-market economy did not mean that the
government had no power to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is clear from the financial crises,'' said Stanley
Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund.
``Weak governments have a terrible time putting together sensible
decisions, and rallying market confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly noted that the United States appears to be
different, because the independence of the Federal Reserve and
market confidence in the competence of the Treasury mean that ``the
system seems to work even when it might superficially appear to be
immobilized. It is relevant to Russia and to the Asians and
certainly to Japan.'' The United States, Fischer said, is
different. ``It seems to work even when it would appear
immobilized.''
</P>
<P>
   How well the United States responds to any imminent economic
shocks amid impeachment and its aftermath depends, of course, on
how markets, consumers and world economies weather the next few
months. If the Internet-stock bubble is pricked, if the bailout of
Brazil goes bad, if Russia dissolves or China slows, if another
hedge fund crashes, politics and prosperity are bound to cross
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beschloss, a historian of the presidency, wonders
whether President Richard M. Nixon might have responded differently
to the 1974 energy crisis if Watergate had not been engulfing him
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know how much Nixon was distracted _ that he was
spending 70 to 80 percent of his time on Watergate,'' Beschloss
said. ``If you need to convince Congress and the public that the
moment has come to make a sacrifice, that's when credibility
suddenly becomes important.''

<P>
   When Prudential Insurance Company of America decided in December
to sell its health-care operations to Aetna Inc., it was the latest
example of a company that could not make money caring for sick
people. Despite Prudential's best efforts, the business, mostly in
managed care, had lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Prudential
finally gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have proved enormously difficult for many of
the businesses created to capture the vast sums flowing through the
nation's health-care system _ now more than $1 trillion each year.
In particular, companies designed to oversee the delivery of care,
like HMOs and groups of doctors' practices, are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of HMOs lost money in 1997, accumulating nearly
$800 million in losses, according to Weiss Ratings Inc., a Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla., company that tracks insurers. Several,
including such former industry standouts as Oxford Health Plans and
UnitedHealth Group, formerly United HealthCare, reported sizable
losses in 1998, and a shakeout is underway among the companies that
manage doctors' practices.
</P>
<P>
   Offering some discipline and an entrepreneurial approach, these
enterprises had promised to deliver health care much more
efficiently than some of the traditional players like Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans _ many of which are nonprofit _ or
independently functioning doctors. Investors would share in the
savings, they claimed, and the public would benefit from a respite
from the relentless climb in health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   But a real debate is emerging over whether these businesses can
wring more efficiencies out of the system and therefore make money
over the long haul. While they prospered by taking advantage of
easy one-time savings, like the use of their clout to get doctors
and hospitals to accept less to provide care, their fat profits
could prove ephemeral in the face of medical costs that they, too,
cannot control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term you can make money,'' said Howard Berliner,
the chair of health services and management policy at the New
School for Social Research in New York. ``In the long term, you
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Having rejected costly old-style medical insurance and Clinton
administration proposals for government-supervised health care, the
nation has embraced profit-making managed care companies as the
solution to rising medical costs. The failure of these companies to
work out their problems is more than just bad news for investors;
it raises doubts about the theory that managed care, left to the
forces of the free market, would, within a few years, distribute
resources effectively and keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   If the companies simply keep raising premiums, the government or
business or the consumer will eventually object. Cutting back on
services by limiting benefits or refusing to provide certain kinds
of care is proving equally unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the optimists from Wall Street, who tend to be true
believers about the power of the free market, say that while the
HMOs have achieved tremendous savings, they have not demonstrated
that they can achieve efficiencies that come from knowing which
drugs or treatments work best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured out how to take costs out of the system, but they
need to take care to the next level,'' said Mary Anne Citrino, a
managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. who
specializes in health care.
</P>
<P>
   With profits at many of these companies scarce, investors have
fled the stocks. The number of health-care service companies going
public dwindled last year to the lowest level in a decade,
according to Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J., and the amount of
capital the new companies raised from the public this year is only
a fourth of the amount raised in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, plenty of people _ the executives running these
companies, for example, and the vast majority of physicians _
continue to make very good livings. UnitedHealth chief executive
William McGuire, for example, made about $10 million, including the
value of his stock options, in 1997, according to Graef Crystal, a
compensation expert. Even Oxford's debacle could prove lucrative to
its founder, Stephen Wiggins, who got a $9-million severance
package when he resigned as chairman early last year. That package
is currently under review by the company.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these businesses appear to be running out of
opportunities. After several profitable years during which premiums
were kept in check, HMOs seem to be no match for the inexorable
rise in medical costs. Oxford, whose rapid growth got the better of
it, has accumulated about $900 million in net losses over the last
12 months because it underestimated the cost of delivering care and
failed to charge enough for its popular plans. The company has
sharply raised its prices at the risk of losing some of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth, which is considered among the best managed in the
industry, misjudged how expensive it would be to provide care to
the elderly under the government's Medicare program. The company
reported a $565-million net loss in August and rapidly scaled back
its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even an old hand like Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit pioneer, is
losing hundreds of millions of dollars because demand for care is
increasing and it can do little to check the rising cost of drugs
and medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the managed-care companies were able to
significantly raise their premiums for 1999, they may never be as
profitable as they were five years ago. And the public's
willingness to accept higher prices may be short-lived if people
begin to believe that there is not enough money to go around to
insure that care remains affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cold reality began to dawn on people in the system: Saving
money for employers and making money comes at the expense of public
access to doctors, hospitals and services,'' said Dr. Arnold
Relman, a former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Other attempts to cut costs by being more efficient have also
foundered. When HMOs and other insurers forced doctors to accept
less money for their services, there was little room for the
companies that buy and manage doctors' practices to make money.

because it could not figure out how to deliver care cheaply enough.

   And most HMOs are losing money on Medicare patients, according
to Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. When the
government decided to sharply limit Medicare payments to
managed-care plans beginning in 1999, dozens of HMOs either
abandoned or scaled back their services. Some 400,000 Medicare
patients are being dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current system say it has never offered an
economic incentive to care for sick people. Because the insurers do
not spread the risk of caring for the sick over the entire
population, and are not paid more when they provide more care, the
companies can only thrive by covering those who are healthiest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a health-care system designed to encourage
health plans to treat the sick, and not compete purely on cost,
there will be no winners,'' said Diane Archer, executive director
of the Medicare Rights Center, a New York consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all the elderly could not get health insurance in 1965,
before Medicare, because private insurers would not cover them or
made their policies unaffordable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the profit-making companies believe it is only a
matter of time before business will find a way to make sense of the
nation's health-care system. But companies will first need to
develop the kind of monitoring systems necessary to know exactly
how care is being delivered and what kind of care is, in fact, most
effective, according to Ms. Citrino. Now, she said, it is like
banking before the development of automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Others doubt whether the businesses will ever succeed,
especially if they attempt to provide care for everyone, including
those who cannot afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Wall Street analyst,'' said Relman.``I would have
a no-buy recommendation on them all.''

effective, according to Ms. Citrino. Now, she said, it is like
banking before the development of automatic teller machines.

especially if they attempt to provide care for everyone, including
those who cannot afford it.

GLOOM DESCENDS ON RUSSIANS AS HOPES OF QUICK CAPITALISM FADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A full-length version of this story,
RUSSIA-BITTER-CAPITALISM, has also be transmitted.) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON and CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was near midnight seven years ago when a vast crowd
gathered outside KGB headquarters here as four cranes hoisted from
its pedestal a statue of a hated man: Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of
the secret police that helped keep the Soviet Union in fear for 74
years.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Russia's Parliament voted to put the statue back.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the two events bookmarks in Russia's story.
</P>
<P>
   One opened an era of almost dizzy optimism about the nation's
prospects for the freedom and economic prosperity that have eluded
it for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The other closed it. The extravagant hopes that a Western-style
capitalism would emerge straight away out of the ruins of the
Soviet empire are gone, buried in the financial collapse and mood
of bitter disappointment that have swept Russia this fall.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of democracy, and economic disarray that has
passed for capitalism, Russians are more divided than ever about
which direction their country should go: whether to embrace the
West and its models, or to remain apart, wrapped in the solace of
Russia's historical peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure the nation, President Boris Yeltsin insisted
in a year-end message that free-market reforms would continue. Yet
many ordinary Russians think of reforms as a sidewalk game of
three-card monte: However often the cards are played, there is no
way they can win.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, most of them concur: Yeltsin, who promised to lead
them safely out of Communism, has betrayed their trust. Polls show
him with the support of 1 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling of the widespread disillusionment, the most
popular politician in public opinion surveys is usually ``none of
the above.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I became disenchanted with the reformers three years ago, when
it became clear that reform is a battle for power, for the division
of property, and that there is no clear economic program,'' said
Nikita Makulov, 69, a retired system programmer whose monthly
pension today is worth all of $20.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yeltsin era may be drawing to a close, it is too soon
to write the epitaph for Russian reform. The re-establishment of
the Soviet Union's brutal totalitarian controls and the widespread
renationalization of factories and refineries seem the remotest of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Oleg N. Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, says it
could be several years before any further attempt to liberalize the
economy is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing very difficult years; stagnation is possible,''
Sysuyev said in an interview. ``But a U-turn is not possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A quick snapshot of Russia today suggests something far beyond
stagnation. The nation's gross domestic product fell 5 percent in
1998 and experts predict a similar drop in 1999. Roughly half the
nation's business is conducted in barter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the nation has made important _ even fundamental _ progress.
For all of its troubles, the country is in many ways unrecognizable
compared with the hulk of a nation Yeltsin inherited in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has become a noisy, even raucous democracy. Though often
subservient to economic interests, Russian media is uncensored. The
phenomenal rise of the Internet _ even the Communist Party has a
web site _ seems to insure there can be no retreat to the days when
the state defined reality.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the economic news all bad. Moscow's streets, barren 15
years ago, now are jammed 18 hours a day; the number of autos has
tripled in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves are no longer bare, although the foreign consumer
goods are often beyond the means of many Russians. Russians own
more home appliances than they could have dreamed of in Soviet
times.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the current period such a singularly bitter one is
the deep disillusionment over Russia's ability to pull itself out
of its quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the time it would take to prepare people for
reforms,'' Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the prime minister who was ousted
after the August crash, said in an interview. ``People did not
understand how much needed to be done to carry out the reforms or
the price they would have to pay to achieve them. And the
government maintained the illusion that it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Communists also threw a monkey wrench into the gears. They
used their control over the Parliament to block legislation that
would have provided the legal underpinnings for a new capitalist
order: the right to buy and sell land, protection for foreign
investors and the overhaul of an anachronistic tax system.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Aug. 17 financial crisis robbed the government of
its two greatest economic achievements: a stable currency and, by
Russian standards, relatively low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It also robbed many Russians of their hope.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest realization for many Russians is the discovery that
one of the biggest obstacles to change lies within themselves. Even
reformers admit that they are still burdened by a mentality
bequeathed to them by a Soviet regime that squashed initiative,
fostered hypocrisy and taught its citizens to abdicate
responsibility for a government they never thought of as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the only one to blame for our situation, not the IMF
or the G-7,'' Sysuyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their short-term pessimism, many Russians _ known
for their patience _ take a long view. Makulov looks to his son,
Alyosha, a mathematician who develops data bases for a private
company and whose salary supports his parents (even after it was
halved by the summer's financial crisis).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is different from me, of course,'' said the father. ``I
think that the next generation _ or maybe the next after that _
will find a way to make this potentially rich country rich. My
sense is that everything that is happening is movement in the right
direction, albeit by the most mistaken and painful of means. It
just wasn't thought through.''

   WASHINGTON _ As John McCain gets ready to be sworn in as a juror
in the Senate trial judging the president's sins, he must also
ponder how he will answer questions about his own sins, with all of
America sitting as the jury.
</P>
<P>
   After the Clinton trauma, will voters want to know more or less
about candidates' peccadilloes? Will they care more or less about
virtue in a president? Will they recoil from Republicans for
perceived hypocrisies?
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old senator from Arizona knows he is dropping his
handkerchief into the presidential ring in a weird and virulent
time.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to computer big shots recently, McCain drew an angry
reaction when he said he had a problem with the president's lying
under oath. ``One guy yelled that he'd rather have his daughter
raised by Larry Flynt than Bill Bennett,'' he recalls. ``I almost
fainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Phoenix after a Fiji vacation, the usually
unequivocal Republican equivocated about what should happen to
Clinton. ``One thing I don't believe in is a fine,'' he hedges.
``It would just mean an added tax on Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks
and Steven Spielberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are embarrassed by all this,'' he continues. ``They
want to have somebody straightforward we can rely on not to ever
wag his finger at us on any issue and say something that's not
true. At the same time, they want people's private lives not to be
in the public domain.'' (It's a campaign slogan: I won't wag the
dog or the finger.)
</P>
<P>
   He has admitted that his carousing, after his return from five
and a half years of torture and solitary confinement in a Hanoi
prison, broke up his first marriage. ``I think it depends how you
present yourself,'' he says. ``Are you the missionary from Somerset
Maugham's play `Rain'? Or are you the person who says, `Look, life
is full of mistakes and I've made mine and I acknowledge them'?''
</P>
<P>
   How did he persuade his reluctant wife to agree to a run? ``It
was like pulling teeth,'' he concedes. ``I promised her she does
not have to come to Iowa and New Hampshire. She's nothing along the
lines of the present first lady, whom I respect and admire, but
Cindy's not a lawyer or a political person. She just wants to raise
her family.''
</P>
<P>
   He says she will address her sins. In 1989, after back surgery
and during the Keating Five scandal, she became addicted to
painkillers and purloined some from a medical charity she ran. ``I
think people will understand Cindy's situation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The senator is cherished by journalists for his quixotic fights
on campaign finance reform and tobacco, his scorn for pols driven
by polls or pork, and his loose tongue. He denounced Leonardo
DiCaprio as ``an androgynous wimp,'' and, speaking to
conservatives, trashed Al Gore for his Buddhist fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans resent him because he promotes virtue
without being a member of the Virtue Gang.
</P>
<P>
   How will he raise the millions he needs after preaching so
vociferously on the evils of big money? ``I'll just have to get
14,000 or 15,000 of my closest friends to give in thousand-dollar
chunks,'' he says, adding that he would not _ like Dan Quayle, Gary
Bauer, Lamar Alexander, Jack Kemp and John Ashcroft _ form a PAC in
Virginia where the laws permit unlimited contributions.
</P>
<P>
   How about that famed temper? ``Every time I've lost my temper
I've regretted it,'' he says. ``Those times have reduced in
frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for Phil Gramm in '96, McCain learned, ``Don't spend
all your money early.'' Then, campaigning for Bob Dole, he learned
that being a hero is not enough. ``You've got to be able to
transmit a message you truly believe in.'' From George Bush's '92
run, he learned it was folly to underestimate your opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The current boomer infatuation with war heroes and sports heroes
might give him a boost _ even though he modestly refuses to
acknowledge the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, God, no,'' he says. ``It doesn't take any talent to get
shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   What did he take away from those long years in that dank cell in
Hanoi that would help him as president?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try to do the things you know you should do,'' he
says. ``Personally and politically, I have not always done the
right thing. But I have tried to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, senator, I ask, one final question: Boxers or briefs?
</P>
<P>
   ``None of your business,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   None of your business. It was music to my ears.

COMMENTARY: THE GIULIANI M.O.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Hall is set off from the rest of New York by
metal barriers, concrete barricades, signs that say ``DO NOT
ENTER'' and ``NO THRU TRAFFIC,'' and coils of yellow tape marked,
``Police line _ do not cross.'' It's an ugly and depressing sight.
</P>
<P>
   Cops in patrol cars are prominently stationed inside the
barricades. They are there to insure that none of you give even a
moment's thought to the foolish notion that City Hall is a place
that belongs to you, a place where you might be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   It once was, but that's over. Rudolph Giuliani is the mayor now.
City Hall belongs to him and the changed atmosphere reflects his
personality _ cold and remote and unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the mayor came up with another one of his heartless
and vindictive public-policy moves. He is evicting a successful
state-run psychiatric center from a city-owned building in Brooklyn
in order to open a homeless shelter there. This is not because of a
need for a homeless shelter. It is simply to punish the local
councilman, Stephen DiBrienza, for sponsoring homeless legislation
that the mayor didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of move, carefully and cruelly crafted by the mayor,
no longer astonishes anyone. When Giuliani acts reprehensibly, it
is widely seen as no big deal, just ``Rudy being Rudy.'' Only a
nitwit or an out-of-towner could think that concern for the
troubled individuals helped by the psychiatric center would stop
this mayor from shoving a homeless shelter in the face of the
offending councilman.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Koch is hardly a disinterested observer. But he has a pretty
accurate take on Giuliani, with whom he has frequently feuded.
</P>
<P>
   ``His is an administration where there is no individuality among
the commissioners,'' said Koch. ``You don't even know their names,
because they are in perpetual fear of doing anything that will
bring down the wrath of the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's modus operandi, said Koch, is to ``dehumanize and
demonize'' his opponents. ``If you are a critic, you are not just a
critic, you're a threat to the world. You've gotta be destroyed. Go
for the jugular is what he does on every occasion. So taxi drivers
whose livelihood is involved _ whether you agree with them or
disagree with them, they want to be heard _ they become taxi
terrorists. Food vendors become poisonous.''
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor's opponents want to exercise their right to
peacefully protest his policies, they frequently are stymied. ``He
doesn't allow for any difference of opinion,'' said Koch. ``When he
bars the different groups that want permits, they have to go to
court. They win every time. But nevertheless, it means you have to
hire lawyers. Not everybody has that true grit that will take you
all the way to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Giuliani administration, the Koch
administration of the late-1970s and '80s (which I covered closely)
was a golden era in terms of the openness of City Hall, the
tolerance of peaceful dissent and the flow of information to the
press, the public and other agencies of government.
</P>
<P>
   Koch noted that many government officials have had to sue
Giuliani for information they had a right to see, and that was
provided routinely in prior administrations. Lawyers representing
the Independent Budget Office, the Public Advocate, the City
Council, the comptroller's office and others all had to go to court
against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of them won,'' said Koch. ``Isn't this an abuse of
power? I think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch believes that Giuliani, on balance, is doing a good job,
and a ``brilliant'' job fighting crime. ``I agree with about 80
percent or more, substantively, of what he wants to do,'' said the
former mayor. ``It's the way he wants to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't give Giuliani such high marks, but that's for another
column. The simple fact is that New York closed out 1998 with fewer
homicides than any year since 1964. New York ended the year with
fewer homicides than Chicago, which has four and a half million
fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of statistics are what enable the mayor to get away
with policies and behavior that offend decency, undermine democracy
and ought to be widely denounced and curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Giuliani era is coming. Maybe then the barricades can
be removed and we can show that a safe city can also be a free and
open one.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time not so long ago when the Manhattan
Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on East 64th Street was as chic a
destination for Christmas vacation as St. Barts or Telluride.
</P>
<P>
   That is where many teen-aged girls would disappear during school
holidays to get the ethnic bumps on their noses smoothed out. So
crowded were the operating rooms at this time of year, recalled Dr.
Gerald Pitman, a plastic surgeon, that he would set out 20 sets of
rhinoplasty instruments in the morning and run out before the day
was done.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd is thinning.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of an explosion in cosmetic surgery, the number of
nose jobs has dropped significantly. While the total number of
cosmetic procedures increased 76 percent, to 697,000 from 395,000,
between 1992 and 1996, the numbers of rhinoplasties, as they are
known, fell 8 percent, to 46,000 from 50,000. And the decline was
probably steeper between the 1990s and the 1970s, experts say,
although no statistics are available before this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are partly cultural and partly economic, according
to plastic surgeons who have watched the evolution of a procedure
that was once a benchmark in a young girl's life, especially among
Jewish teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the thing to do,'' said Dr. H. George Brennan, who
practices in Southern California. ``You had your bat mitzvah and
you got your nose done.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday for nose jobs, experts agree, was in the '60s and
early '70s, when the postwar baby boomers were teen-agers. Parents
of Jewish ancestry who knew first-hand of the Nazi atrocities were
ever on the alert for stirrings of anti-Semitism. They wanted their
own children spared discrimination. And to them, that meant fitting
inconspicuously into the Protestant mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish parents at that time didn't want their children to look
Jewish,'' said Dr. James L. Baker Jr., who practices outside
Orlando, Fla. ``They feared a stigma left from the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical characteristic that most set Jews apart was their
noses, and so legions of teen-agers, usually girls, had them fixed.
The technology was primitive compared to today's, and so the
results, through the 1970s, had a cookie-cutter similarity _ little
ski-jump noses with the bony bridge scooped away.
</P>
<P>
   But that was OK with the patients. ``Everybody wanted to look
like a shiksa,'' said Dr. Thomas Rees, a retired plastic surgeon
who trained many of the high-priced doctors at work today along
Park Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The leading practitioner back then was Dr. Howard Diamond of
Manhattan, renowned for standardizing what had been a hit-or-miss
operation. ``Every girl on Long Island had a Diamond nose,'' said
Dr. George Beraka, who said he can still pick them out on women now
deep into middle-age.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion was changing. Ethnic looks were coming into style.
In the mid-'70s, black models appeared for the first time on the
covers of Glamour and Vogue. Blondes were not the only ones having
fun. Lana Turner and Betty Grable were replaced by Barbra Streisand
(who was afraid to have a nose job for fear it would change her
voice) and Cher (who eventually had her nose fixed, along with many
other body parts.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, doctors say, their patients want to maintain their ethnic
individuality, perhaps with slight refinement. Where once the
button nose was the rage, women these days beg for a ``natural''
look. ``They're not trying to erase their ethnic background
anymore,'' said Dr. Darrick Antell, a Park Avenue surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Nanni of Brooklyn agreed: ``There's a much
broader definition of beauty. Not everyone needs to look like
Barbie.'' Nanni noted that the preoccupation has shifted to flat
stomachs and wrinkle-free faces. ``It's youth they're looking for,
not certain facial features.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the decline of nose jobs, doctors say, is the
new health care economics. In the old days, insurance plans covered
the procedure if a patient complained of breathing difficulties.
Now, insurers do not docilely accept that a cosmetic operation
costing between $3,000 and $8,000 is necessary for a deviated
septum. ``They fight and fight,'' Pitman said, and many
middle-class families are ``reluctant to spend the college money.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics available on rhinoplasty do not distinguish
between primary and secondary surgeries, the return trips to the
operating room to fix what was done before. Antell said he sees
older women who have tired of their cute little ski-slope noses and
``want to turn the clock back'' and look like real people. He
complies, transplanting cartilage from the septum to give them back
the bump they once hated.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time not so long ago when the Manhattan
Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on East 64th Street was as chic a
destination for Christmas vacation as St. Barts or Telluride.
</P>
<P>
   That is where many teen-aged girls would disappear during school
holidays to get the ethnic bumps on their noses smoothed out. So
crowded were the operating rooms at this time of year, recalled Dr.
Gerald Pitman, a plastic surgeon, that he would set out 20 sets of
rhinoplasty instruments in the morning and run out before the day
was done.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd is thinning.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of an explosion in cosmetic surgery, the number of
nose jobs has dropped significantly. While the total number of
cosmetic procedures increased 76 percent, to 697,000 from 395,000,
between 1992 and 1996, the numbers of rhinoplasties, as they are
known, fell 8 percent, to 46,000 from 50,000. And the decline was
probably steeper between the 1990s and the 1970s, experts say,
although no statistics are available before this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are partly cultural and partly economic, according
to plastic surgeons who have watched the evolution of a procedure
that was once a benchmark in a young girl's life, especially among
Jewish teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the thing to do,'' said Dr. H. George Brennan, who
practices in Southern California. ``You had your bat mitzvah and
you got your nose done.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday for nose jobs, experts agree, was in the '60s and
early '70s, when the postwar baby boomers were teen-agers. Parents
of Jewish ancestry who knew first-hand of the Nazi atrocities were
ever on the alert for stirrings of anti-Semitism. They wanted their
own children spared discrimination. And to them, that meant fitting
inconspicuously into the Protestant mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish parents at that time didn't want their children to look
Jewish,'' said Dr. James L. Baker Jr., who practices outside
Orlando, Fla. ``They feared a stigma left from the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical characteristic that most set Jews apart was their
noses, and so legions of teen-agers, usually girls, had them fixed.
The technology was primitive compared to today's, and so the
results, through the 1970s, had a cookie-cutter similarity _ little
ski-jump noses with the bony bridge scooped away.
</P>
<P>

TEST-TUBE BABIES: PRIVATE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

<P>
   As New York prepares to become the 34th state to operate charter
schools, the model of the future may be in Chicago. Last week, a
Chicago priest proposed closing down a Catholic parochial school
and reopening it as a charter school, financed by taxpayers.
Religious instruction could be available before and after the
regular classes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago plan came just days after an unusual coalition of
black and Hispanic ministers and wealthy Wall Street businessmen
proposed similar arrangements under a law passed last month
allowing 100 charter schools to be set up in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The first charter school advocates had something else in mind
when they sat around a conference table in a lakeside lodge near
Brainerd, Minn., in 1988 and dreamed up the idea of public schools
freed from the bureaucracy of public schools. Like many parents,
educators and policymakers grappling with ways to improve
education, especially in poor neighborhoods, their agendas were
more personal than political or religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us were deeply frustrated,'' said Joe Nathan, who now
heads the Center for School Change at the University of Minnesota's
Humphrey Institute. Nathan, a former public school teacher,
recalled sitting with Albert Shanker, the president of the American
Federation of Teachers, Seymour Fliegel, a former deputy
superintendent of public schools in East Harlem in New York City,
lawmakers and PTA and community leaders. Several of them had
started small, innovative alternative public schools that thrived
by breaking rules but foundered when the local school district
demanded conformity.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Budde, a retired teacher and administrator, had coined the
term charter in a 1988 government-financed report, ``Education by
Charter,'' to capture the notion of teachers and districts creating
innovative programs. The Minnesota group took his idea one step
further to charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked the term because it talked about mutual
responsibilities,'' Nathan said. The charter school would receive
public money and be independent, but in return it would have to
demonstrate that schoolchildren were learning at least as well as
they were elsewhere in the system. Otherwise, its charter would be
revoked and the school shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Minnesota became the first state to adopt charter school
legislation, which was written by Ember Reichgott Junge, a
Democratic state senator who had sat with Nathan and others three
years earlier. In 1992, the first charter school opened. In less
than a decade, the movement has spread to 1,128 schools across the
country, enrolling about 250,000 children, according to the Center
for Education Reform, an advocacy organization in Washington. About
3 percent of all charters granted have been revoked, center
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these schools are little more than conventional public
schools; others are radically different, with special missions and
innovative, even quirky, approaches, like biofeedback to help
learning disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools receive operating money _ the equivalent of
tuition _ from the public school system. But that doesn't cover
construction, renovation or in many cases equipment, and unlike
public school systems, charter schools rarely have the ability to
issue bonds. To help pay for buildings, desks and computers,
charter schools have teamed with philanthropists, local businesses
and institutions like the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., and
the YMCA in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The need for institutional support has also given rise to a
third model _ charter schools managed by profit-making companies
like the Edison Project, run by the former media entrepreneur Chris
Whittle, or Advantage Schools Co. Whittle estimates that
profit-making companies run fewer than 10 percent of charter
schools in the country. Executives of both companies say they have
yet to run enough schools to make an overall profit.
</P>
<P>
   While charter schools obviously are a long way from taking over
public education in America, their proponents say their influence
has been disproportionate to their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about losing talented teachers to charter schools, local
school superintendents in cities like Boston, Rochester, Minn., and
Flagstaff, Ariz., have permitted innovation that they blocked
earlier, Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you absolutely get out of it,'' Whittle said,
``and I've seen this in city after city, is that competition does
raise all boats, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether clergy join parents and others in the charter-school
movement remains to be seen. The Rev. Michael Pfleger's proposal to
turn the St. Sabina School in Chicago into a charter school has
encouragement from the public schools chief, Paul Vallas.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, legislators have warned that groups that want to
start charter schools must meet a series of tests designed to prove
they are not trying to receive tax dollars by converting an
existing private or parochial school. But ministers like the Rev.
Floyd Flake, a former six-term congressman who is pastor of the
Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Queens, say they can
create secular schools that meet the test of the law.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's Roman Catholic Archdiocese has expressed little
interest in charter schools. But it shares the same goals and
speaks the same language as a political action committee that spent
more than $100,000, much of it raised by Wall Street businessmen,
to prod lawmakers to vote for New York's charter law. The committee
was called School Choice Now. The Catholic Church is still pressing
its plan for vouchers, which it calls School Choice.

   What better moment than the dawn of a new year to start scanning
the horizon for a new job, a new career, a new life?
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later nearly everybody fantasizes about a fresh
beginning. Even the smartest and most accomplished _ executives and
academics, government ministers and department heads _ must
occasionally find themselves wondering what color their parachutes
are.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to picture the power elite in their pajamas,
sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and a pencil,
ready to circle the want ads and massage the resume before taking
it down to Kinko's to be photocopied on vellum stock.
</P>
<P>
   But it must happen, if the following job postings in recent
issues of The Economist are any guide. Why The Economist? With
offices in 19 cities around the world, and its focus on the
what's-really-important _ politics and money _ the magazine is what
every plugged-in global villager is reading. If you were looking to
hire a weapons of mass destruction research fellow, where ELSE
would you advertise?
</P>
<P>
   For many ads the requirements are _ to put it mildly _ obscure,
with the pool of ideal candidates on the planet probably totaling,
oh, seven people. The jobs are real, though, demonstrating that
even globe-trotting wonks and power brokers scan the want ads, and
that the most prestigious-sounding positions can somehow go begging
for applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The ads suggest strongly, too, that after ants, bureaucrats rule
the Earth.

<P>
   What better moment than the dawn of a new year to start scanning
the horizon for a new job, a new career, a new life?
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later nearly everybody fantasizes about a fresh
beginning. Even the smartest and most accomplished _ executives and
academics, government ministers and department heads _ must
occasionally find themselves wondering what color their parachutes
are.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to picture the power elite in their pajamas,
sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and a pencil,
ready to circle the want ads and massage the resume before taking
it down to Kinko's to be photocopied on vellum stock.
</P>
<P>
   But it must happen, if the following job postings in recent
issues of The Economist are any guide. Why The Economist? With
offices in 19 cities around the world, and its focus on the
what's-really-important _ politics and money _ the magazine is what
every plugged-in global villager is reading. If you were looking to
hire a weapons of mass destruction research fellow, where ELSE
would you advertise?
</P>
<P>
   For many ads the requirements are _ to put it mildly _ obscure,
with the pool of ideal candidates on the planet probably totaling,
oh, seven people. The jobs are real, though, demonstrating that
even globe-trotting wonks and power brokers scan the want ads, and
that the most prestigious-sounding positions can somehow go begging
for applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The ads suggest strongly, too, that after ants, bureaucrats rule
the Earth.

GLOOM DESCENDS ON RUSSIANS AS HOPES OF QUICK CAPITALISM FADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to correct Parliament vote to last month. No other
changes.)  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON and CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was near midnight seven years ago when a vast crowd
gathered outside KGB headquarters here as four cranes hoisted from
its pedestal a statue of a hated man: Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of
the secret police that helped keep the Soviet Union in fear for 74
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Russia's Parliament voted to put the statue back.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the two events bookmarks in Russia's story.
</P>
<P>
   One opened an era of almost dizzy optimism about the nation's
prospects for the freedom and economic prosperity that have eluded
it for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The other closed it. The extravagant hopes that a Western-style
capitalism would emerge straight away out of the ruins of the
Soviet empire are gone, buried in the financial collapse and mood
of bitter disappointment that have swept Russia this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over a Dzerzhinsky resurrection pinpoints a
disturbing split in Russian society, which is not only about ways
of looking back on history. After seven years of democracy, and
economic disarray that has passed for capitalism, Russians are more
divided than ever about which direction their country should go:
whether to embrace the West and its models, or to remain apart,
wrapped in the solace of Russia's historical peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure the nation, President Boris Yeltsin insisted
in a year-end message that crisis or not, free-market reforms would
continue. Yet many ordinary Russians have to think of reforms as a
sidewalk game of three-card monte. However often the cards are
played, Russians feel there is no way they can win.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, most of them concur: Yeltsin, who promised to lead
them safely out of Communism, has betrayed their trust. Polls show
him with the support of 1 percent of the population _ roughly the
same level as that of his predecessor and nemesis, the former
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling of the widespread disillusionment, the most
popular politician in public opinion surveys is usually ``none of
the above.''
</P>
<P>
   As Russians celebrated the coming of a new year, the jokes and
toasts all hinted at more gloom to come. There was a similar sense
of uncertainty back in January 1992 when Russia made its first leap
into a market economy. But then, at least, there was a hope that
change, however painful, was all for the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pessimism has descended on us,'' said Vasily Rybin, who used
to work in an iron casting factory but now sells stuffed animals
outside McDonald's restaurant at Pushkin Square. ``I am afraid it
will stay for the year. I would like to hope for the best, but I
think things will get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Yeltsin era may be drawing to a close, it is too soon
to write the epitaph for Russian reform. For all of the nostalgia
about the secure days of Soviet rule, when paychecks and pensions
were guaranteed, if meager, few want to re-create the past. The
re-establishment of the Soviet Union's brutal totalitarian controls
and the widespread renationalization of factories and refineries
seem the remotest of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even senior Kremlin aides agree that Russia is exhausted by its
political war with itself. Oleg N. Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief
of staff, says it could be several years before any further attempt
to liberalize the economy is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing very difficult years; stagnation is possible,''
Sysuyev said in an interview. ``But a U-turn is not possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick snapshot of Russia today suggests something far beyond
stagnation. The nation's gross domestic product fell 5 percent in
1998 and experts predict a similar drop in 1999. Roughly half the
nation's business is conducted in barter.
</P>
<P>
   Even demography appears to be delivering its harsh verdict on
the new Russia. With the toll of early mortality outpacing births,
Russia's population in 1998 fell to 146.4 million, a drop of more
than 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's distress was summed up when a schoolteacher in
Ulyanovsk, Lenin's birthplace, died after a prolonged hunger
strike, started because of months of unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some bad times, but I have never seen people as
panicky as today,'' said Dmitri Maratovich, the editor of labor
newspapers in the Kemerovo coal mining basin in southern Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Such misfortune, however, does not provide a full measure of
where Russia has come from. And by that standard, the nation has
made important _ even fundamental _ progress. For all of its
troubles, the country is in many ways unrecognizable compared with
the hulk of a nation Yeltsin inherited in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has become a noisy, even raucous democracy. Its citizens
can now travel abroad, and millions of them do.
</P>
<P>
   Though often subservient to economic interests, Russian
newspapers, radio and television are uncensored. Virtually any
political opinion can be found at the thousands of newsstands in
Moscow alone.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenal rise of the Internet _ even the Communist Party
has a web site _ seems to insure there can be no retreat to the
days when the state defined reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more from the democrats, but nevertheless they have
not given up on freedom of speech and freedom of conscience,'' said
Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of the nation's most venerated scholars.
``It is essential not to lose those freedoms, especially now when
they are under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the economic news all bad. Moscow's streets, barren 15
years ago, now are jammed 18 hours a day; the number of autos has
tripled in seven years, and the pollution is horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves are no longer bare, but stocked with foreign
consumer goods, although they are often beyond the means of many
Russians. Russians own more home appliances than they could have
dreamed of in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   Nadezhda Inshev, her husband, Leonid, and their two children,
are crammed into two rooms of a communal apartment near the Moscow
River. They live off her husband's wages as a truck driver and
whatever she can earn from her knitting.
</P>
<P>
   Times were tough, even before the financial crisis. But the
Inshevs own a Sony color television, bought the other year when her
husband's employer finally paid six months in back wages.
</P>
<P>
   It is the deep disillusionment over Russia's ability to pull
itself out of its quagmire, however, that makes the current period
such a singularly bitter one.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Russia's pro-capitalist reformers were never widely
popular. They inherited a nightmarish burden: labor-intensive
factories that were unable to compete in the world marketplace,
chronically inefficient collective farms and a gargantuan,
money-draining military establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But they proved to be poor politicians. Their guiding assumption
was a kind of economic determinism that held that the public would
be brought along if only the economic software was changed.
</P>
<P>
   And in a calculated exercise in realpolitik, the reformers
forged an alliance with the bankers and other buccaneers of
Russia's wild new capitalism, who acquired billions of dollars
worth of government oil and metal companies at rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   At first, this worked. But, over time, the insider privatization
gave capitalism a bad odor and the public's patience wore out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became disenchanted with the reformers three years ago, when
it became clear that reform is a battle for power, for the division
of property, and that there is no clear economic program,'' said
Nikita Makulov, 69, a retired system programmer whose monthly
pension today is worth all of $20.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reformers insist they were on the right track but
acknowledge that they never got their message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the time it would take to prepare people for
reforms,'' Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the prime minister who was ousted
after the August crash, said in an interview. ``People did not
understand how much needed to be done to carry out the reforms or
the price they would have to pay to achieve them. And the
government maintained the illusion that it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Communists also threw a monkey wrench into the gears. They
used their control over the Parliament to block legislation that
would have provided the legal underpinnings for a new capitalist
order: the right to buy and sell land, protection for foreign
investors and the overhaul of an anachronistic tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The underdeveloped legal system is summed up by a nondescript
stucco building that fronts a narrow street east of the vast,
magnificent Kremlin. Only a tarnished plaque by the door makes
clear that it is the office of the Russian Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, it seemed, Russia's ruling classes mocked the laws
and rules they promised to uphold. The head of the State Tax
Service took lavish Pacific cruises on his modest government
salary, even as tax collection was plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   The coup de grace for the Russian public, however, was the Aug.
17 financial crisis, which robbed the government of its two
greatest economic achievements: a stable currency and, by Russian
standards, relatively low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It also robbed many Russians of their hope. Festooned now around
their gritty capital are a series of patriotic summons: ``Nobody
will help Russia, except ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The placards have been installed by the State Tax Service to
prod tax delinquents to pay up. While there is no indication that
they have accomplished that purpose, the posters have almost
unconsciously tapped the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   Russians no longer believe the West will come to their rescue.
They do not even count on their own government to pay overdue
pensions and back wages or to protect the billions of rubles in
savings that Russians had deposited in banks that collapsed with
the rest of the economy after the August devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A new nationwide survey of 4,800 Russians by the Center for
International Sociological Research captures the sour mood. An
overwhelming majority _ 79 percent _ said the country was stymied
by political paralysis. Asked to name the political figure they
trusted the most, ``Nobody'' won with 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the survey notes, this is a nation in which virtually
everyone _ 97 percent _ agrees that their standard of living took a
turn for the worse in 1998, potatoes are the most common food _ 58
percent _ and slightly more than half _ 51 percent _ think the
coming year will be ``ominous.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's inability to rally around a common standard is
symbolized by the continuing debate over the Dzerzhinsky statue.
Those in the countryside, workers and Communists strongly support
the vote to restore the monument. Most Muscovites remain opposed,
leaving the fate of Parliament's decision in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For all the fiery emotion, the real issue is not the statue but
the political gridlock that makes Russia almost impossible to
govern.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest realization for many Russians is the discovery that
one of the biggest obstacles to change lies within themselves. Even
reformers admit that they are still burdened by a mentality
bequeathed to them by a Soviet regime that squashed initiative,
fostered hypocrisy and taught its citizens to abdicate
responsibility for a government they never thought of as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the only one to blame for our situation, not the IMF
or the G-7,'' Sysuyev said. ``All of us suffer from a Soviet
mentality because we lived almost our whole lives under an
absolutely inhuman system. The first real free person in Russia
today was born in some maternity ward just in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians look deeper into their history, past the 70 years
of Communism, into a society and a culture that has long been riven
by debates over whether Russia does or does not belong in the West.
Echoes of those old debates can be heard again now, as ugly
anti-Semitism and bitter anti-Americanism creep into the political
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But while Russia sometimes seems to revert to its old peculiar
ways, there is also evidence that even if it wants to, it can no
longer afford to shun the club of civilized nations, hemmed in as
it is by MTV on one side and the International Monetary Fund on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their short-term pessimism, many Russians _ known
for their patience _ take a long view. Makulov looks to his son,
Alyosha, a mathematician who develops data bases for a private
company and whose salary supports his parents (even after it was
halved by the summer's financial crisis).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is different from me, of course,'' said the father. ``I
think that the next generation _ or maybe the next after that _
will find a way to make this potentially rich country rich. My
sense is that everything that is happening is movement in the right
direction, albeit by the most mistaken and painful of means. It
just wasn't thought through.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was near midnight seven years ago when a vast crowd
gathered outside KGB headquarters here as four cranes hoisted from
its pedestal a statue of a hated man: Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of
the secret police that helped keep the Soviet Union in fear for 74
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Russia's Parliament voted to put the statue back.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the two events bookmarks in Russia's story.
</P>
<P>
   One opened an era of almost dizzy optimism about the nation's
prospects for the freedom and economic prosperity that have eluded
it for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The other closed it. The extravagant hopes that a Western-style
capitalism would emerge straight away out of the ruins of the
Soviet empire are gone, buried in the financial collapse and mood
of bitter disappointment that have swept Russia this fall.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of democracy, and economic disarray that has
passed for capitalism, Russians are more divided than ever about
which direction their country should go: whether to embrace the
West and its models, or to remain apart, wrapped in the solace of
Russia's historical peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure the nation, President Boris Yeltsin insisted
in a year-end message that free-market reforms would continue. Yet
many ordinary Russians think of reforms as a sidewalk game of
three-card monte: However often the cards are played, there is no
way they can win.
</P>
<P>
   On one thing, most of them concur: Yeltsin, who promised to lead
them safely out of Communism, has betrayed their trust. Polls show
him with the support of 1 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Even more telling of the widespread disillusionment, the most
popular politician in public opinion surveys is usually ``none of
the above.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I became disenchanted with the reformers three years ago, when
it became clear that reform is a battle for power, for the division
of property, and that there is no clear economic program,'' said
Nikita Makulov, 69, a retired system programmer whose monthly
pension today is worth all of $20.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yeltsin era may be drawing to a close, it is too soon
to write the epitaph for Russian reform. The re-establishment of
the Soviet Union's brutal totalitarian controls and the widespread
renationalization of factories and refineries seem the remotest of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Oleg N. Sysuyev, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, says it
could be several years before any further attempt to liberalize the
economy is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing very difficult years; stagnation is possible,''
Sysuyev said in an interview. ``But a U-turn is not possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A quick snapshot of Russia today suggests something far beyond
stagnation. The nation's gross domestic product fell 5 percent in
1998 and experts predict a similar drop in 1999. Roughly half the
nation's business is conducted in barter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the nation has made important _ even fundamental _ progress.
For all of its troubles, the country is in many ways unrecognizable
compared with the hulk of a nation Yeltsin inherited in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has become a noisy, even raucous democracy. Though often
subservient to economic interests, Russian media is uncensored. The
phenomenal rise of the Internet _ even the Communist Party has a
web site _ seems to insure there can be no retreat to the days when
the state defined reality.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the economic news all bad. Moscow's streets, barren 15
years ago, now are jammed 18 hours a day; the number of autos has
tripled in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Store shelves are no longer bare, although the foreign consumer
goods are often beyond the means of many Russians. Russians own
more home appliances than they could have dreamed of in Soviet
times.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the current period such a singularly bitter one is
the deep disillusionment over Russia's ability to pull itself out
of its quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the time it would take to prepare people for
reforms,'' Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the prime minister who was ousted
after the August crash, said in an interview. ``People did not
understand how much needed to be done to carry out the reforms or
the price they would have to pay to achieve them. And the
government maintained the illusion that it would be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Communists also threw a monkey wrench into the gears. They
used their control over the Parliament to block legislation that
would have provided the legal underpinnings for a new capitalist
order: the right to buy and sell land, protection for foreign
investors and the overhaul of an anachronistic tax system.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Aug. 17 financial crisis robbed the government of
its two greatest economic achievements: a stable currency and, by
Russian standards, relatively low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It also robbed many Russians of their hope.
</P>
<P>
   The harshest realization for many Russians is the discovery that
one of the biggest obstacles to change lies within themselves. Even
reformers admit that they are still burdened by a mentality
bequeathed to them by a Soviet regime that squashed initiative,
fostered hypocrisy and taught its citizens to abdicate
responsibility for a government they never thought of as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is the only one to blame for our situation, not the IMF
or the G-7,'' Sysuyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their short-term pessimism, many Russians _ known
for their patience _ take a long view. Makulov looks to his son,
Alyosha, a mathematician who develops data bases for a private
company and whose salary supports his parents (even after it was
halved by the summer's financial crisis).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is different from me, of course,'' said the father. ``I
think that the next generation _ or maybe the next after that _
will find a way to make this potentially rich country rich. My
sense is that everything that is happening is movement in the right
direction, albeit by the most mistaken and painful of means. It
just wasn't thought through.''

WAR WITHOUT CASUALTIES: AVOIDING LOSSES IS ONE THING, WINNING IS
ANOTHER

<P>
   ``I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying
for his country,'' Gen. George Patton roared in May 1944 to
soldiers preparing to invade Europe. ``He won it by making the
other poor dumb bastard die for his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four years later, that admonition, immortalized by the
movie ``Patton,'' has evolved into a dogma that Old Blood and Guts
would scarcely recognize, one in which avoiding casualties _
``force protection,'' in military-speak _ has been elevated to a
central objective of a military mission, and spilling little or no
American blood has become a primary indicator of success.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the four-day blitz bombing of Iraq last month was
proclaimed a success even before the full extent of damage was
known, because no American got hurt. ``To do this without any
casualties in the environment our forces faced was truly
remarkable,'' Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of the operation,
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was a relief that no American was killed or
wounded. And nobody would disagree that the cruise missiles and
other ``stand-off weapons'' fired so accurately from a great
distance came a long way toward fulfilling the hopes of honorable
soldiers throughout history to achieve military objectives with a
minimum of carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But putting so high a premium on bloodless combat and so much
faith in high technology has also raised some troubling questions.
One is whether the electronic razzle-dazzle creates the
expectation, some would say illusion, in the American public that
the new weapons can accomplish every military mission, and
therefore that the loss of any GIs in a future operation is
tantamount to failure. And does that not in turn encourage
commanders to tailor the goals of a mission to insure minimal
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether America's apparent reluctance to
shed blood leads its enemies to conclude that the way to defeat the
United States is to achieve gruesome and televisable casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Some have already concluded just that, including Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, who made clear in a conversation with the U.S. ambassador
on the eve of the 1991 Gulf war that he saw America's sensitivity
to casualties as an exploitable weakness. He told the U.S.
ambassador then, ``Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000
dead in one battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to technology to reduce carnage is not new. The
introduction of gunpowder 400 years ago, for example, raised
expectations that war would become less gruesome now that men would
not have to hack or bludgeon each other to death. Neither is
America's reluctance to send its boys to die in distant wars new or
surprising, given its geographic insulation from potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Americans went reluctantly into World War II, it was
still an axiom that waging war meant being prepared to die. When
Patton exhorted his men to do in the other guy, he also told them,
``The real man never lets fear of death overpower his honor, his
duty to his country, and his innate manhood.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made bloodless war so much more tempting for generals
and politicians since then is the power that television has had in
bringing carnage home to the general public, and the development of
ever more sophisticated and accurate long-distance weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the Vietnam War, the public was exposed for the first time to
the realities of the battlefield, and movies like ``Saving Private
Ryan'' have followed by portraying aspects of earlier wars that
censors ruthlessly concealed in Patton's time.
</P>
<P>
   It was the televised horrors that seemed responsible for
transforming initial support for the Vietnam war into fierce public
opposition, and instilled a deep wariness of body bags in the
current generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of warfare being broadcast in relatively
unadulterated form into people's lives, and the need to build
political support to sustain military operations, have caused
political and military leaders to become more and more concerned
about casualties,'' said Michael Peters, a retired Army colonel and
now senior vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity has been reinforced by incidents like the failed
mission to save American hostages in Iran, the killing of 241 U.S.
servicemen in 1983 in Beirut in a terrorist bombing, or the images
of the charred bodies of American Rangers killed in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when military commanders launched Operation Desert Storm in
1991, their idea was to hit hard and with minimum casualties,''
said Bernard Trainor, a retired Marine general. ``That was also the
major factor in the decision to end the war.'' Not only were the
commanders wary of losing their men, Trainor added, but for the
first time in history, they also tried to minimize casualties to
the foe, out of reluctance to have the United States appear
needlessly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   By these criteria, Operation Desert Storm was an indisputable
success. Only 299 U.S. servicemen died, out of about a half million
deployed. Less than half of these, 148, were battle deaths.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement, in turn, led to calls for an increased
emphasis on ``stand-off weapons'' and ``force protection'' in
military planning, and thence to a debate that still rages within
the military between advocates of the new, high-tech approach to
warfare and those who believe that trying to make war bloodless was
not really effective, and potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Tilford of the Army War College is among those who argue
that the effectiveness and credibility of an army, and of a
superpower, still ultimately depend on its willingness to send
soldiers into mortal combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new American way of war is being sold by the high-tech
crowd as a nearly bloodless kind of thing,'' he said in an
interview. ``But this is a misinterpretation of what happened in
the Gulf.'' There, he said, America faced an enemy massed in the
open desert with little air cover, and thus easy to spot and hit
from a distance. Yet even there, he said, it took troops on the
ground to finally chase the Iraqis out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Precision, he said, is ``not the answer to all things.'' Though
it can ``degrade'' Iraq's capability, it apparently can not
eliminate the threat of its weapons of mass destruction _ and it
has notably failed to dislodge Saddam, a goal now embraced by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tilford is convinced, moreover, that the American public is more
willing to accept casualties than political and military leaders
believe, if people can be persuaded that the sacrifice is
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the key is to find the balance between maintaining the
credibility of American arms and the constraints American history
and democracy impose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A superpower that doesn't exert its power will lose that power
over time,'' said Robert Ebel, the director of national security
programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``But the problem is that we cannot be seen as a ruthless
superpower. So we've got to continuously use our super powers, but
without turning the world against us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine in theory, military historians would argue, but when
it comes to using a cudgel to make the bad guys fall in line,
history is clear: There's no antiseptic or bloodless way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final analysis,'' said Trainor, ``if you want to
radically change the behavior of your opponent, it takes boots on
the ground to do it.''

NAMELESS IN A KMART LINE, SIGNIFICANT ON JETS' DEFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wherever they are shopping Sunday, enjoying their week off
before joining the playoff battle, the four players on the Jets'
defensive line will hardly be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when you go to the malls,'' said Rick Lyle, who is
among those who toil on one of the National Football League's most
successful yet least-noted units. ``You can walk around with your
family and nobody comes up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that has produced defensive lines with such menacing
nicknames as the Purple People Eaters, the Steel Curtain, the
Fearsome Foursome and the Sack Exchange, the most imposing member
of the Jets' line is named Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one in the history of the N.F.L. to be named
Pleasant,'' right end Anthony Pleasant claimed. And he is almost
correct. He is the only Pleasant who has ever played a full season.
The boast is a rare show of ego for a religious man who wants to be
identified not for whom he throws around on the field, but for whom
he can save off it.
</P>
<P>
   The line's work has been instrumental in the Jets' run to a 12-4
record and the East Division title, achievements that gave them
this weekend off. All they have to do Sunday is wait to see who
they will play next Sunday at Giants Stadium. It will be
Jacksonville if the Jaguars can beat New England Sunday afternoon.
Otherwise, they will play the winner of Saturday's Miami-Buffalo
game.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen are not well known in part because they are not
noted for their attention-getting sacks. Pleasant led the line with
six while the others combined for seven. Still, they were
instrumental in holding together a defense that allowed the
second-fewest points in the league, trailing Miami by only 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   The line was the most unsettled element of the defense in
training camp, when Pleasant, who plays right end, joined forces
with the well-traveled Ernie Logan at right tackle, Lyle at left
end and the second-year left tackle Jason Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Logan and Lyle had arrived a year earlier at bargain-basement
prices, free agents cut by their teams, while Ferguson, from
Georgia, was the Jets' final draft choice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Pleasant joined the Jets he at least had the advantage of
familiarity, having been a teammate of Logan's and Lyle's in
Cleveland. But he was 30, had suffered an ankle injury in Baltimore
in 1996, and was a part-time player in Atlanta last season after
hurting a knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One common thing about them is that they're all clean-living
kids,'' coach Bill Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that each of the three was essentially in a
last-chance situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie knew this was his last shot,'' Parcells said. ``Rick
would have been out of football. Anthony had to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because of that united sense of desperation, but
it became apparent after practices in camp that there was something
different about this group.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant would remain in the summer heat, and he and Logan would
discuss techniques and how to use their hands. ``Some of the other
guys would see us working,'' Pleasant said, ``and they'd just
gravitate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us was a real high draft pick,'' Lyle said. ``It was a
lot like being a walk-on in college. You have to work that much
harder because you kind of had two strikes against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant, who went to Tennessee State and spent six seasons with
the Browns before going to Baltimore and Atlanta, said he did not
mind staying after practice to help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been that way,'' he said. ``My father died when I
was 2 and my mother raised me. I grew up in a small town _ Century,
Florida _ no bigger than a matchbox. But I had good role models _
my uncle, teachers, a professor at college.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother cleaned houses until she got a job working in a
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I was poor,'' he said. ``I thought I was
middle class until I got to college and saw what other people
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant's no-nonsense approach to the game makes perfect sense
considering his philosophy: ``I do not want to be defined by the
sport I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant, who rarely inhabits the locker room during the 45
minutes Parcells allows for interviews, lives in Point Lookout, a
Long Island summer resort all but deserted by tourists in the
winter. There, his wife, Renita, and 2-year-old daughter, Hannah
Denette, rarely go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not known as a core Jet,'' he said. ``I'm not recognized.
But I do a lot of things people don't know anything about.'' He
works with various programs to help children, and talks of becoming
a minister when he stops playing.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Lyle talk about their Christian faith, Logan is a
Muslim who wears a watch with a compass to help him locate the
northeast on road trips, so he can pray every evening.
</P>
<P>
   Logan and Ferguson have enjoyed the group identity the players
have forged.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the year progressed, we started to feel more comfortable in
each other,'' Logan said. ``We had faith that the other guy would
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said: ``I'd describe this like a brother relationship.
Once we got a feel for each other, once we got a `W,' we got going.
They teach me a lot of things. They're all very spiritual, and I've
learned what road to take and what road not to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a quiet way, you understand, the line glories in its
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't come in here and push us around,'' Ferguson
said. ``We thrive on not being known.''

   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia _ As two Khmer Rouge leaders accused of
killing more than a million people toured this balmy seaside town
with their military escorts and deferential guides Thursday, they
drove past the police station where two Cambodian human-rights
workers were receiving different treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were being held without bail on vague charges after
they advised protesters who demonstrated recently against dumping
toxic waste at the edge of town. Ten of the demonstrators were also
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrast that points up the inequities hobbling
Cambodia's development into a democratic state. It also casts a
harsh light on the claim that Cambodia has its own way of dealing
with its crimes and traumas.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge leaders _ Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea _ came in
from the cold on Christmas after three decades of revolution that
included four years of brutal rule from 1975 to 1979. They were
welcomed with flowers and with embraces from Prime Minister Hun Sen
and the former United Nations Secretary- General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, who was in town to promote the French language but
also paid his respects.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali, who praised Hun Sen for his policy of ``national
reconciliation,'' said the mass killings by the Khmer Rouge were
the internal affair of a sovereign state, immune from the
``interference'' of outsiders. Cambodians must find their own route
to resolving their human rights issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody sees it this way. The United Nations is
investigating evidence and possible procedures to bring Khmer Rouge
killers to trial if either the Security Council or the Cambodians
agree to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The process of democratization that the United Nations tried to
initiate in Cambodia at the start of the decade, under
Boutros-Ghali's leadership, has spawned a new cadre of local human
rights workers dedicated to principles of law and justice that
challenge the feudal ways of this politically primitive country.
</P>
<P>
   ``National reconciliation should not be at any cost,'' said Kao
Kim Hourn, head of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and
Peace, a local human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   In freeing the leaders of the Khmer Rouge, which has collapsed
over the past two years, Cambodia is bucking a worldwide trend
toward accountability. Tribunals are addressing mass killings in
Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Truth commissions have examined
the past in South Africa and Argentina. South Korea has convicted,
then pardoned, two former leaders. Japan has been offering grudging
apologies for its war crimes. Spain is trying to prosecute the
former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Even President
Clinton, visiting Africa, expressed regret over America's
participation in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``While much of the rest of the world is moving, fitfully and
problematically, towards ending impunity for crimes of this
magnitude, Cambodia is taking a giant leap backwards,'' said Steve
Heder, a scholar of the Khmer Rouge who is examining records in
Phnom Penh for the War Crimes Research Office of the American
University Law School. ``This cannot be justified in terms of
stabilizing a fragile democracy. This is not an Argentina or a
Chile where a military apparatus left over from a criminal regime
can threaten stability. There is no solid basis on which to base an
assertion that the Cambodians do not want a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The imprisonment of the human rights workers at the time of the
embrace of the Communist leaders suggests that politics rather than
principle is involved _ that Hun Sen finds it in his own interest
to let one party walk free and not the other. It was Khieu Samphan
himself who crystallized what has emerged over recent years as the
Cambodian approach to accountability for political crimes. ``Let
bygones be bygones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors have pointed out for years that no one has
been held to account, or even seriously investigated, for a series
of political killings, including a grenade attack on a political
rally early last year that killed 16 people and injured more than
100.
</P>
<P>
   After their visit to the beach with their families and aides,
the two Khmer Rouge leaders planned a trip to the ancient temples
at Angkor Wat and then a sentimental homecoming to their respective
villages. ``I need to relax a bit,'' Khieu Samphan said, brushing
past reporters who tried to interview him, ``so please forgive
me.'' He seemed a walking advertisement for a problem that human
rights advocates say is dragging Cambodia down: impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People accused of crimes against humanity and mass murder are
allowed to walk free within Cambodia's borders at the same time
that the government is arresting and imprisoning human rights
workers for carrying out their duties,'' said Sidney Jones, Asia
director of the Washington-based group Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights workers, representing Licadho, Cambodia's
leading rights group, were doing what the United Nations intended
and what the Hun Sen government has claimed to support: trying to
assure that public issues were dealt with in a legal way. They had
reportedly advised protesters on how to prepare a petition and
stage a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to trust the justice system, there needs to be some
consistency,'' a Western diplomat said. ``And the arrests of the
Licadho workers are a stark reminder that there isn't this
consistency, that there is a gross disparity between the small and
the big in society.''

BROWSER-BUSTING PROGRAM COULD BOOST US IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. says it's impossible to remove Internet browsing
software from the company's Windows 98 operating system without
crashing the computer. But an Australian biologist, Shane Brooks,
says he's not only written a program to remove the browser, but
that his technique will actually make many Windows machines work
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was simply looking for a way to speed up Win 98 on my slow
computer and remove all the redundant files that I don't use,''
says Brooks, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of
Maryland. Brooks says he's a fan of Microsoft products and wishes
the company well. But his browser-buster, called 98lite, could
provide the US Justice Department with fresh ammunition in its
ongoing antitrust suit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The suit accuses Microsoft of using its near-monopoly in
operating system software to muscle its way into dominance in many
other software markets, including Internet browsers. The government
argues that Microsoft started adding browsing software to its
Windows 95 and 98 operating systems in an effort to crush rival
browser maker Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has responded that browsing software is a logical
addition to the operating system. The company also argued it had
integrated the browser into Windows 95 and 98 in such a way that it
would be impossible to offer a fully-functional version of these
products with the browser removed.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a federal appeals court rejected the government's
arguments, saying Microsoft has a right to add browsing software to
its products if doing so provides a benefit to consumers. But the
Justice Department still hopes to convince Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson that Microsoft can separate the browser from the operating
system and should be forced to do so. The trial resumes Monday
after a holiday recess.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Princeton University computer science
professor Edward Felton testified in the Microsoft case, saying
he'd written a program that would remove nearly all browser
components from Windows 98 without harming the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brooks has weighed in with his own program created for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Necessity was the mother of his invention. Brooks doesn't have a
computer of his own and uses one borrowed from the university _ an
old Pentium-133 laptop that's slow by today's standards. Brooks
tried Windows 98 and found it was less prone to unexpected crashes
than Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But Windows 98 uses the built-in browser to display information
on the monitor. Brooks found that this made his computer run much
slower. In addition, the browser components took up precious space
on his computer's hard drive. So he decided to figure out which
files were related to the browser, and then delete them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the job manually at first,'' Brooks said. ``I then
decided to refine the procedure and package it in a program just
for the hell of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is 98lite, a program that is run by the user during
the installation of Windows 98. It simply prevents certain parts of
the software from being installed. Brooks says the final result
gives him all the usual functions of Windows 98, only without the
browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of the OS (operating system) remains untouched,''
said Brooks. ``It is pure Win 98 and very stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials aren't so sure. Microsoft program manager
Shawn Sanford admitted that owners of Windows 98 can modify it as
they see fit, but warned that Microsoft cannot guarantee the
reliability of a computer modified with 98lite.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sanford noted that 98lite deliberately leaves
behind a few portions of the browser, such as a piece of code that
allows Windows 98 to display files written in HTML, the coding
language of the World Wide Web. Some firms that write software for
Windows 98 use this feature to display information, and these
programs would not work properly if this code were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brooks says that for all practical purposes, 98lite blots
out the Microsoft browser _ and saves about 40 megabytes of hard
drive space in the process. He's now at work on a program to remove
the browser from computers that already have Windows 98 installed.
This version will also allow users to remove a host of Windows 98
features they may not want, such as a movie player, graphics files,
and diagnostic software.
</P>
<P>
   To download a copy of 98lite, go to
http://www.wam.umd.edu/ssbrooks/98lite/. The download is free, but
Brooks requests a donation to cover his expenses.

   OREGON-HEALTHCARE (Portland, Ore.) _ Nearly five years ago,
Oregon began putting an idea to work that seemed both harsh and
humane: In return for health insurance paid by the government, the
poor would be required to join health maintenance organizations and
have their care rationed. But the Oregon Health Plan is hitting
roadblocks. The state has abandoned its promise of universal care.
Doctors routinely find ways to get around the rationing. And

   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Kazakhstan, on the steppe between Moscow
and Mongolia, was only recently a forbidden southern Soviet
hinterland, a synonym for obscurity. But it is rich in oil and
natural gas, recently independent, and in a region that forms a
corridor separating Russia to the north from Iran to the south.
</P>
<P>
   In these geographic facts, the Clinton administration has seen
an irresistible opportunity _ to help American firms share in the
riches, to prevent Russia from expanding dangerously back south
once it is back on its feet, and to help contain Iran.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the White House has declared the Caspian Sea a top
strategic priority. So it is that it is pouring enormous effort
into helping the surrounding nations with the most energy _
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan _ build a pipeline to the
Mediterranean that would get their oil and gas to market without
going through Russia. And so it is that America has become
interested in the niceties of democracy in places as obscure as
these.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem. Call it a perception gap.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it helps funnel in billions of dollars in U.S. contracts
for energy development, the administration has wanted to transform
the societies that will receive it by turning them into democratic
and economically transparent meritocracies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Caspian leaders have a different idea. As they see it,
they have been willing to sign almost any agreement promising
reform, and they have handed over their crown jewels _ their oil
fields. So they want to know why Washington makes a fuss when they
cheat in their elections, rule as autocrats and appoint relatives
(who, after all, are among their most trusted intimates) to senior
government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, this difference of view is causing tension between the
Clinton administration and this republic of 16 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is viewed abroad
as the region's most reasonable leader, has ruled since 1989. Next
Sunday, he is up for re-election to a new seven-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington's view, Nazarbayev would probably win a fair race.
Few expected one, however, and the administration took umbrage when
the fix seemed more flagrant than necessary. First, Nazarbayev's
Supreme Court disqualified a former prime minister, Akezhan
Kazhegeldin, as an opponent. Perhaps more galling, it did so just a
day after Vice President Al Gore phoned Nazarbayev asking that
Kazhegeldin be permitted to run.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 23, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
summoned Kazakhstan's ranking diplomat in Washington to protest the
beating of a local employee of the U.S. Embassy in Almaty who had
represented the embassy in meetings with opposition and human
rights figures. On Dec. 22, three men attacked him, leaving him
with a cracked rib and cuts near both eyes. A State Department
spokesman, Lee McClenney, said the circumstances suggested ``a
politically motivated attack aimed at intimidating the embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the background is a disagreement over Nazarbayev's right to
rule and Kazhegeldin's right to compete. Kazakh officials seem to
have a Soviet-style regard of their leader _ elections or no, they
assume he will govern until he chooses to step down or dies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kazhegeldin, Nazarbayev and his subordinates openly
despise him, and are trying to remove him from the political scene
by leveling corruption charges _ a slippery topic in a nation
where, diplomats say, a third to a half of more than $1 billion in
privatization bonuses from foreign companies to the government in
the last two years have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   So how does this square with the promises of reform?
</P>
<P>
   ``The local governments have learned to talk the talk about
human rights, freedom of the press and democracy. But since they
also are cynical, it is not surprising they believe we don't really
mean it,'' said Adam Smith Albion, an expert on the region with the
Institute of Current World Affairs, a policy study group based in
Hanover, N.H. ``The United States is happy to deal with plenty of
autocratic-led states that have hydrocarbons, and surely this has
not gone unnoticed by the Central Asian leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Kazakh government has acted on the perception gap.
In a full-page ad in American newspapers, including The New York
Times on Dec. 16, it said it wanted ``to celebrate our thriving
nascent democracy as a leader in political and market reforms,
human rights and peaceful policies in Central Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bergne, who teaches about the Caspian region at Oxford
University, thinks the gap can be bridged. ``But it is going to
take much longer than people think,'' he said. ``From the West,
starry-eyed idealists came pouring into the Caucasus and Central
Asia thinking they would persuade the leaders to introduce
pluralist democracy and market reforms. On the other side, the
countries thought these companies would come in with all their
investments and, before you say Jack Robinson, they would have a
modern economy. From both sides it has proved very wrong.''

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Today's maps don't show they ever
existed. The gates and customs posts that supposedly protected
their borders have all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are driving in South Africa and find yourself gazing
at barren stretches of eroded land, clusters of huts without
electricity or absurdly opulent administration buildings rising
from the heart of a shantytown, you are probably in one.
</P>
<P>
   These are South Africa's ``homelands'' _ apartheid's bizarre
scheme for getting rid of black citizens by dividing them by tribe
and forcing them to live on 10 small, remote patches arbitrarily
designated foreign countries. Legally speaking, they evaporated in
1994 when the country held its first nonracial elections. But
experts say they have left a mighty imprint on this society that
may take decades to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1960s, South Africa's white supremacist
government _ often arriving before dawn with trucks and dogs _
uprooted 3.5 million blacks to resettle them in the homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being torn from their livelihoods, these families lost
whatever wealth they had accumulated. Some were given as little as
$10 for their houses. Their furniture and livestock frequently did
not survive the move. They usually arrived at a plot empty but for
a prefabricated outhouse. There was too little land or water to
farm and they were miles from anything like a job.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to get 80 percent of the population onto 13 percent
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these homelands remain islands of dismal poverty. Their
incompetent and corrupt administrations, fostered by the former
government, are a huge burden on the new one. Lavish airports,
stadiums and office buildings were built to stroke the egos of
compliant homeland leaders but the ``citizens'' were left in such
poor conditions that they lacked even clean water, leaving the
grandiose schemes useless. Few of the homelands ever attracted any
industry, which doomed the whole scheme to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of South Africa's blacks stay there because they
have homes and family ties and the system succeeded in nurturing
tribal allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community patterns are so firmly established,'' said Richard
Humphries of the Center for Policy Studies, ``that some people just
won't move. They don't want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The homelands fiction _ which even included passports that were
never taken seriously by other countries _ was expensive to
maintain. But the apartheid government was so intent on it that it
paid the bills and turned a blind eye to theft and faults in the
banana republics it had created.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeland civil servants never had the skills to do their
jobs, so it is no accident that provinces that took over the
administrations of former homelands are unable to deliver services.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report on the civil service warned that special
vigilance was needed in the Eastern Cape and Northern provinces,
which incorporated most of the old homelands. Recently, the Eastern
Cape administration stunned the nation with its callousness. The
province, which is made up largely of the former Xhosa homelands of
Transkei and Ciskei, ran out of money and simply stopped its meager
welfare payments without warning. Elderly people were stranded for
days without food or shelter at welfare payment offices, having
used their last few cents to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The homelands used to employ for the sake of employment and the
new government is now stuck with those people,'' said Xoliswa Hewu,
a researcher with the Institute for Democracy in South Africa.
``Even when they have the money to do something they don't
necessarily have the capacity. They have computers, for instance,
but no one knows how to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of corruption that occurred in the old administrations
is only now becoming clear. The new government says it has already
dropped 60,000 questionable welfare recipients and 20,000
fraudulent disability claimants from its rolls, most of them from
homelands. It has also estimated that it is paying 47,000 ghost
workers, mostly inherited from the former homelands.
</P>
<P>
   And Judge Willem Heath, who heads a new investigative team
looking into corruption, said he is probing 90,000 other cases
involving over $1 billion. Most of the ``rot,'' he has said, is
rooted in the former homeland administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last summer, Lucas Mangope, the former head of the most
successful homeland, Bophuthatswana, (bah-POO-taht-swah-nuh) was
convicted on 103 counts of fraud, theft and contravention of
exchange regulations involving about $1.3 million. The 75-year-old
former leader received a two-year suspended sentence and was
ordered to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the other homelands, however, ``Bop'' has done
well. It had a platinum mine and was home to Sun City, a casino
fantasyland of fake jungle and waterfalls in the middle of a
desert. Since it was near Johannesburg but lacked South Africa's
puritanical laws, whites could drive there to indulge in
pornography, gamble and drink on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Now pornography and gambling are legal all over South Africa.
Sun City survives, though not as profitably. Some of Mangope's
excesses, however, remain simply excesses. For instance, he paid
$10 million for a stadium that is rarely used. With 90,000 seats,
it dwarfs all American football stadiums, but lacks overhangs to
block out the desert sun.
</P>
<P>
   Other former homeland leaders have been absorbed into
contemporary politics, some serving in Parliament. Most of them are
members of the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular holdout is the flamboyant Bantu Holomisa, a
former dictator of the Transkei who came to power by a coup and
then aligned himself with the ANC. He was ousted from the party
after revealing that Nelson Mandela had accepted a huge campaign
donation from Sol Kerzner, the builder of Sun City. But now he has
created a new multiracial party, the United Democratic Movement,
with Roelf Meyer, the former heir apparent of the National Party,
which created apartheid. The new party enjoys wide support in the
former Transkei.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the former homelands may turn out to be more independent
minded than the rest of black South Africa, which continues to
support the ANC overwhelmingly. This is perhaps because life has
improved less in these remote rural areas than it has in the urban
townships.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, there is still talk of creating a new homeland in
South Africa. But it is whites this time who want it for
themselves. The idea is a rallying cry for many of South Africa's
far-right voters. But they are getting nowhere in negotiations with
the ANC.

continent crowns four decades of integration with the adoption of a

to exist. It has become usual for people who work in this western
German city to live in Belgium and play a weekly tennis match in
the Netherlands. The sweet whiff of prosperity seeps from Italian
shoe stores, Spanish tapas bars, French croissanteries and English
pottery shops that line the pedestrian shopping areas on all sides
of the borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a border city, but no longer,'' said Hans
Poth, a spokesman for the Aachen town council who lives in Belgium.
``And once we have the euro, the last barriers will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few hundred miles to the east, in Gorlitz, crumbling
facades testify to decades of Communist rule. The town is split
into two halves, as it has been since 1945 when eastern districts
fell into Poland as European borders were rearranged after World
War II. A single bridge, clogged by long lines of traffic, links
the German and Polish parts.
</P>
<P>
   While Aachen's melting borders symbolize the growing unity of
Western Europe, Gorlitz underlines the continuing division of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Karbaum, mayor of the German part of Gorlitz, gazed out
over a disjointed vista of baroque homes built centuries ago by
German burghers and apartment blocks left by Polish Communists.
``Now we want to be one city again,'' he said. ``But for that, we
need Poland in the European Union and the euro as our currency on
both sides of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Aided by the United States, postwar Europe has risen from the
ruins of 1945 and overcome seemingly perennial rivalries through a
bold vision of union that has brought prosperity and peace to
regions plagued for centuries by instability and bloodshed. The
euro, a single currency for 290 million people that may in time
challenge the dollar, symbolizes a colossal achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it falls short of the original vision of a federal Europe
with a single currency at its heart. Through its 20-year gestation,
the euro appears to have shifted from a political ideal to a more
prosaic economic tool.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, for the foreseeable future, seems set to remain a hybrid
beast, using English as its lingua franca, running its monetary
policy through a federal institution _ the European Central Bank in
Frankfurt _ while control of most other instruments of government,
including budgets, remains at the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such an arrangement _ a new experiment in historical
terms _ is workable remains unclear. Projected slower European
growth in 1999, dragged down by slumps in Asia and Latin America,
will place added strain on the euro's inception.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the economics loom larger questions. With the Cold War's
glue now gone, will the trans-Atlantic bond that buttressed
European growth remain firm as ``Euroland'' takes form?
</P>
<P>
   The 11 nations joining the euro have abandoned an important part
of their sovereignty to the European Central Bank. That probably
will dispose them toward finding multilateral solutions to world
problems, while a wholly sovereign America may choose _ as recently
in Iraq _ to take a unilateral view of its interests.
</P>
<P>
   And does Europe still have the vitality and drive to overcome
the many remaining divisions between its capitalist and former
Communist halves, to fulfill Karbaum's wish of making his wounded
Gorlitz whole again?
</P>
<P>
   Voicing a sentiment common in France, which acutely feels an
end-of-millennium intellectual malaise, Arnaud Jacomet, a French
defense official, considers Europe ``a tired continent, in late
middle age, looking only for a comfortable retirement, with the
United States as its eternal protector.'' In this vision, Europe
may be content to rest on its laurels, leaving the formerly
Communist, still impoverished states in its east on the outside
looking in.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 nations that have adopted the new currency carry
formidable economic heft. They represent about 18 percent of the
world's total output and account for about 20 percent of its
exports. After the United States, ``Euroland'' will be the world's
second-largest trading area with a single currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, if it is successful, will provide enhanced European
capital markets, easier comparison of prices, improved
competitiveness, convenience and the kind of stability that
resisted any European contagion from Asian or South American crises
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the tough fiscal and other criteria set for
qualification for the euro have drawn countries like Spain, Italy
and Portugal toward a low-inflation prosperity they have never
previously known. The euro, and the 15-nation European Union in
general, have amounted to a beneficent magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Some day, many economists believe, the euro may even rival the
dollar as a reserve currency, obliging the United States to abandon
a central assumption: that its deficits will always be financed
because the world wants dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, for example, is certain to take payment for oil exported
to ``Euroland'' in euros rather than dollars, because it imports
principally from European countries. Eastern European exporters may
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking a three-year view, the euro will present a serious
challenge to the dollar,'' said David Hale, chief economist for the
Chicago-based Zurich Group. ``America may have to rethink its view
of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But challenging America in the ether of world financial markets
is far from creating the unified political entity imagined by the
founding fathers of the European Union and very far from any
European emancipation from American military tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, ever since Churchill spoke in 1946 of uniting
Europe in ``the sharing of its common inheritance'' and Jean Monnet
of France laid the first foundation stones of integration, many
Europeans have dreamed of unity. Yet just as the euro is being
introduced, the idea of Europe may have lost its galvanizing
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A difficult decade in Europe has taken a heavy toll on the
European ideal. Slow growth and high unemployment _ more than 10
percent in Germany, more than 11 percent in France _ have been
widely equated with the budgetary rigors imposed as preparation for
the new currency. In many places, Brussels has become a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   Although East Europeans still talk constantly of ``joining
Europe,'' seeing in this mantra the age-old vision that European
unity could banish the continent's demons and bring peace,
``Europe'' has little or no resonance for the millions of young
West Europeans touched by unemployment. No new, forward-looking
message has been found to take its place.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the very words ``idea'' and ``Europe'' seem strangely
paired because intellectual vitality appears to have migrated
elsewhere, and with it the forces now changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Thibault de Silguy is the European Union's top monetary
official and an ardent promoter of the euro. For this energetic
Frenchman, a Paris-to-Potsdam, Berlin-to-Barcelona currency may
eventually make the the nations that have opted to join
``Euroland'' more stable and robust.
</P>
<P>
   But European patriotism _ hearts thumping, even stirring, before
Europe's blue-and-gold flag? Forget it. A quick expansion eastward
to embrace formerly communist Mitteleuropa? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never be an American melting-pot, even with a single
currency,'' de Silguy said. ``People here are firmly attached to
national ideas. They like to live in a big, open European market,
but within their own language and culture. As for expansion
eastward, we need to wait. You have to be a realist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such realism, however, is new at European headquarters. A few
years ago, the dismissal of a United States of Europe _ especially
by a Frenchman _ would have been viewed as Thatcherite Europhobia.
For decades, the 15-nation European Union progressed precisely by
being unrealistic. It embraced far-fetched dreams, like a single
currency, and somehow staggered toward them.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the boldness of a postwar European generation driven by
the desire to banish bloodshed from the continent has given way to
the pragmatism of a more pampered generation for whom America is at
least as resonant as Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This shift of ambition suggests that Europe will long remain
what Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank, calls
``an economic giant and a political dwarf''. While challenging U.S.
supremacy on the currency markets, the dwarf will still desire _
even require _ U.S. military protection and, in times of crisis
such as the recent Balkan conflicts, strategic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody buys the federalist model in Brussels any more,'' said
Andrew Moravcsik of Harvard's Center for European Studies. ``As
governments have started looking beyond the euro, at harmonizing
foreign and defense policy, even at a common tax policy, they have
seen that public opinion is just not with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, de Silguy and other officials said, the euro
will not propel Euroland toward political unity _ a common foreign
and defense policy, a European army, the federal European
government long seen by France as the best escape from U.S.
domination of Europe and by Germany as a refuge from a troublesome
national identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, a shared defense, security and foreign policy looks
unrealistic to me,'' de Silguy said.
</P>
<P>
   In its absence, America, through NATO, will continue to bear the
chief burden of Europe's defense. But already, debates on the
future of the alliance have been marked by differences over how
``global'' NATO should become and whether, as Europeans now argue,
the organization should be bound in its missions by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now the alliance of interests binding Europe and the
United States since the end of World War II has held. The success
of this joint undertaking _ European integration under the umbrella
of U.S. security guarantees _ is evident in Aachen.
</P>
<P>
   Once home to Charlemagne, who governed much of Western Europe
from here in the 9th century, including modern France and Germany,
Aachen was long disadvantaged by the proximity of the Belgian and
Dutch borders _ barriers to trade and economic development that
were as cumbersome as today's German-Polish border at Gorlitz.
</P>
<P>
   But now, on the German-Dutch border, a unique project has begun.
Called ``Avantis,'' it is a 100-acre trans-border industrial zone
that literally straddles the frontier. Dutch and German
letter-boxes, red and yellow, have already been placed side by side
in the sort of act of symbolism that has nonetheless proved
consistently helpful to Europe's construction.
</P>
<P>
   The project is complicated because Dutch and German taxes and
regulations are different. But it is intended to feed off Aachen's
renowned university of technology and engineering to create between
7,000 and 12,000 jobs in the high-tech sector. A brochure describes
the project as a ``European Science and Business Park'' set in a
``win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in many ways, is a good summary of Europe today: A
German-Dutch cross-border project with an English name and American
jargon. Areas of prosperity in places long prone to instability
abound. Alsace-Lorraine, and the French-Spanish border region
between Perpignan and Barcelona are other examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace and freedom are now taken for granted,'' said Jurgen
Linden, the mayor of Aachen. ``So we have to show our citizens that
Europe has advantages by creating jobs in projects like these. With
the euro, we can work on both sides of a border.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced. In the streets of Maastricht, the
Dutch town where European leaders decided in 1991 to tear down
trade barriers and adopt a single currency, Elisabeth Lubbers, a
housewife, said the people of Europe were still different, and its
nations too diverse, to accept the euro. ``There will be trouble,''
she said, ``and with Germany you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is not uncommon in Britain and has contributed to
keeping the country out of the euro for now. Among the 18 million
unemployed in Europe and the continent's ``new poor,'' resentment
against Europe is often virulent.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Europeans _ a clear majority, according to polls _
the euro is now seen as a logical extension of a successful
experiment. What is not clear is whether the will exists to reach
out from the relative comfort of today's western European society
to take that experiment decisively further.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas do exist: the nomination of a ``High Representative''
to coordinate European foreign and security policy; a passage to
majority voting on more European issues, seen as essential if
Europe is not to become too unwieldy; a possible integration of the
Western European Union, Europe's largely dormant defense arm, into
the formal structures of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But such steps _ known as ``deepening'' _ are controversial,
because they may imply further compromises on national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   They may also prove difficult because Germany and France, long
the motors of European integration, have discovered other
priorities. Germany has been absorbed with its costly unification
and, of late, with an attempt to step out from the shadow of its
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are all for a strengthening of Europe, but we no
longer feel this is a historical obligation,'' said Bodo Hombach,
minister of state at the Germany chancellery. ``We want Europe, but
not because we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the new government of Social Democrats and Greens
led by Gerhard Schroder has adopted an almost Thatcherite tones in
demanding a reduction in its huge contribution to the European
budget. It has also suggested that candidates for European Union
membership _ including Poland _ may have to wait a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Rhine, French politicians have been made acutely
aware of the enduring appeal of nationalist slogans by the success
of the National Front, and disgruntlement over unemployment has
made any ringing appeals for united European governance tantamount
to political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Until Europe works out these internal problems, it will not
reach out to address the pressing needs of Gorlitz and all the
once-Communist countries on its eastern flank. Already, with
unemployment running at 21 percent in the area, many Germans
complain about Poles coming to work illegally in Gorlitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took generations to resolve the French-German problem, and
here tensions with Poland have been compounded by almost 50 years
of Communism,'' said Karbaum, the Gorlitz mayor. ``But this is an
artificial border, and we have to overcome it, just as on Germany's
western side.''
</P>
<P>
   Jreneusz Aniszkiewicz, the deputy mayor of Zgorzelec, as the
Polish side of the town is known, agreed: ``The economy can resolve
everything today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men have a project: to rebuild Gorlitz's old bridge,
destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945. But six years of negotiation
have so far failed to resolve various difficulties and the two
banks of the River Neisse _ no more than 30 yards apart _ remain
unbridged in the center of town. The one existing bridge is on the
outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy,'' Karbaum said. ``Young Germans say to me, we
have no work, no hope, nothing to do, and you want to spend
millions of euros on a bridge.''

   BAYTOWN, Texas _ The scrapbook that documents Camelia Cruz's
days as a teen-age cancer patient is yellowing now, its photographs
and newspaper clippings fading with the passage of time. On this
sunny Monday morning, Mrs. Cruz cracked it open, as she does every
now and then, unleashing a flood of memories from what seems like a
former life.
</P>
<P>
   There she is in a wheelchair, bald and frail, her face shielded
by a surgical mask, a white hospital blanket draped over her knees.
There she is, smiling, her head swathed in a blue scarf beneath a
sparkling tiara, on the day she was crowned Miss Periwinkle at a
camp for children with cancer. There's Sandy Cuellar, her best
friend from the hospital; Camelia clutched her hand as she died, at
16. Her newspaper obituary is tucked inside Mrs. Cruz's album,
along with a dried rose petal from the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz, now 22, is a survivor of osteosarcoma, a highly
malignant bone tumor. The cancer was diagnosed when she was 13. At
an age when most girls are worried about pimples and boyfriends,
Mrs. Cruz, the former Camelia Trevino, lost her left leg; doctors
had no choice but to amputate above the knee. Then she endured a
year of sickening chemotherapy that has left her with damaged
kidneys, and received blood transfusions that are probably
responsible for infecting her with hepatitis C, a potentially
lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of cancer treatment, Mrs. Cruz's story is hardly
extraordinary. Yet that is precisely what makes it worth noting.
She is part of a trend that experts describe as a miracle of modern
medicine: the transformation of childhood cancer from killer to
curable disease. But thankful though they and their families are
that they are alive, the growing legion of survivors are
discovering that the miracle has not been without a price.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, fewer than one-third of cancer patients under
age 15 lived for five years past their date of diagnosis, the point
at which experts consider them cured. Today, survival is not the
exception but the rule. Roughly three-quarters of all children
currently being treated for cancer are expected to reach the
five-year mark. And as oncologists continue to refine their
methods, the population of childhood cancer survivors, which stands
at an estimated 250,000, is rapidly growing; the National Cancer
Institute estimates that by the year 2000, one in 900 people
between the ages of 16 and 44 will be a survivor of childhood
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years after former President Nixon declared war on
cancer, this turnabout is often cited as evidence that a cure is
within reach. But as the first large wave of childhood cancer
survivors reaches its 20s and 30s, the word ``cured'' is a misnomer
for many. Though some, particularly those treated more recently,
glide through life virtually unscathed, others are finding that the
two staples of cancer treatment, chemotherapy and radiation, can
bring with them health problems: heart, lung and kidney
dysfunction, memory loss, infertility and even second cancers.
</P>
<P>
   And as they leave their parents' homes to grapple with college,
careers and relationships, they face an array of social
difficulties, as well, from awkwardness in dating to difficulty
finding jobs to an obstacle that can seem as insurmountable as
cancer itself: finding health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Fiduccia, a disability rights consultant in California
who works with survivors of childhood cancer, said, ``The single
biggest part of my job is explaining to people why they are not
going to get health insurance or what will happen when they lose
it.'' When it comes to insurance, he said, former cancer patients
``have a lot of very poor choices.'' If they work for a large
employer, they will usually have health coverage. If not, they may
seek coverage from state high-risk insurance pools or Medicaid, the
federal insurance for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of a person's
health history, companies worried about the cost of insuring their
workers may be wary about hiring someone they know is a survivor of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are able to walk and talk and look like the average
American,'' Fiduccia said, ``but I'm getting more and more calls
about kids who were treated more than 10 years ago for cancer who
are now living at home with their parents and are unemployed. This
is not like falling off your bike and breaking your arm and once
the cast is off, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Mrs. Cruz, who wears a prosthesis and
walks with a pronounced limp, has discovered that her kidneys do
not retain enough magnesium, a disorder she corrects by taking
supplements and medication. More worrisome is the hepatitis C. Her
doctors suspect she contracted it during a blood transfusion;
experts say as many as 10 percent of childhood cancer patients who
received transfusions before 1992, when blood banks began screening
for the virus, may be similarly infected.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, she married Pablo Cruz, a pipefitter. The wedding
took place in a gazebo at the ``Cancer Survivors Plaza,'' a grassy
park not far from Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, where
Camelia was treated. ``It never bothered me,'' Pablo Cruz said of
his wife's cancer. ``I know what she's been through and I respect
her for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple make their home in a modest frame house, flanked on
one side by railroad tracks and on the other by an oil refinery, in
this working-class industrial city about an hour east of Houston.
Health insurance is a big issue; now that Mrs. Cruz is married, she
no longer qualifies for Medicaid, and at times she has skipped
doctors' appointments because she could not afford them. Her
husband has a policy through his new employer, but the couple are
not sure yet whether Camelia is covered. They have been paying $100
out-of-pocket for her medication each month.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mrs. Cruz thought she would never conceive a child,
an impression her doctors say was erroneous. Fourteen months ago,
she and her husband had a baby, a girl. The pregnancy was
difficult; Mrs. Cruz was exhausted all the time from the loss of
the magnesium, and her hepatitis C, at the time still undiagnosed,
fouled the results of a blood test that screens for birth defects.
``They told me, `Either you have an abortion, or the baby is going
to be dead when it is born,''' she said. ``I was a wreck.'' The
baby was born healthy, at 6 pounds 2 ounces. They named her
Milagro, the Spanish word for ``miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of a recurrence of her cancer are slim,
Mrs. Cruz still worries. A bigger threat is the hepatitis, which
could eventually destroy her liver. She is now contemplating an
experimental treatment for the disease; so far, both her husband
and her baby have tested negative. There is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can be sure about what can happen in their future,''
Mrs. Cruz said, casting a glance at her daughter. Over the strains
of ``If You're Happy and You Know It,'' the mother continued:
``What would happen to the baby? How would she grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that about half of all children cured of cancer
experience moderate to severe medical problems years after their
treatment. In the lexicon of cancer survival, these are known as
``late effects.'' Dr. Philip Steuber, the pediatric oncologist who
treated Camelia Cruz, uses another name: ``the cost of cure.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because so few children survived cancer decades ago, doctors are
only just beginning to comprehend how high those costs can be.
Experts know quite a bit about late effects in the first decade
after treatment, but less about the second decade and very little
after that. The issues are complicated; childhood cancer is really
an array of more than a dozen different diseases, each with its
course of treatment and side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with Hodgkin's disease, for example, sometimes require
radiation to the chest; girls who receive this therapy are at high
risk for breast cancer later in life. Patients with brain tumors
almost invariably need radiation to the head; often, their
intellect is impaired, causing problems at school and at work.
Doxorubicin, a mainstay drug of chemotherapy, can cause heart
damage, while another anti-cancer agent, cis-platinum, can harm the
kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Much of today's research revolves around devising new treatments
to minimize late effects, so that the children treated today may
have fewer problems than their predecessors. To that end, Dr.
Leslie Robison, a pediatric cancer expert at the University of
Minnesota, is supervising a study of 15,000 childhood cancer
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute,
involves 26 institutions and more than 100 researchers who are
tracking patients treated between 1970 and 1986. The participants,
whose median age is 26, have answered questionnaires about a range
of issues, from their physical and psychological health to whether
they engage in risk-taking behaviors, such as smoking cigarettes.
The research is important for all cancer survivors, but especially
for children, who could be expected to live an average of 60 years
after they are cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s there was very
aggressive attention and remarkable success in treating childhood
cancer,'' Robison said. ``Now we are putting the focus on looking
at the survivors. We need to know what are the long-term adverse
effects of having had cancer as a child, not just what happens in
the first 10 years after they are treated, but what potentially
could happen 30, 40 and 50 years down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz is ineligible for Robison's study; she received her
diagnosis three years after the cutoff date. But her battle with
osteosarcoma, a relatively rare form of childhood cancer that
afflicts about three out of every million children ages 14 and
under, provides a window into the world of cancer treatment and
survivorship.
</P>
<P>
   Her first sign of sickness was a pain in her left leg; her
family doctor, she said, dismissed it as ``growing pains,'' until
he took an X-ray. The film showed a tumor the size of a misshapen
orange, a lesion so destructive it was clear the limb could not be
saved. In August 1989, one month after her 13th birthday, Camelia
sat in Steuber's office at Texas Children's Hospital. He had the
delicate task of telling her that, the following week, she was
going to lose her leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I remember about her to this day is her
courage,'' Steuber said. ``She was upbeat then, even under the
hardest of circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz, for her part, remembers feeling more scared than
courageous. On the morning of the operation, she didn't want to get
out of bed. ``I remember that I wanted to take small steps
everywhere, because these were my last steps that I was going to
take with both my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her surgery, and the 13 months of chemotherapy that followed,
were part of a controlled experiment. This is routine for children
with cancer. Because there are so few of them, it has been standard
practice at oncology centers to enroll all youngsters they treat in
clinical trials. Hundreds of such experiments, conducted at
academic institutions under the auspices of two large pediatric
cancer research networks, have taken place since the 1970s, and
their results, rather than the development of any new miracle
drugs, are largely responsible for the improved survival
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few new drugs, but that is a minor thing,''
said Anna Meadows, a leading expert in pediatric oncology who
directs the Office of Cancer Survivorship at the National Cancer
Institute. ``We have learned how to use the drugs in a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The osteosarcoma study in which Mrs. Cruz participated, Study
8651 of the Pediatric Oncology Group, was typical. One hundred
children were enrolled; half received chemotherapy before surgery;
half, including Mrs. Cruz, did not. The study found that children
do equally well with either course of treatment; as a result,
Steuber said, oncologists today have greater flexibility in
treating osteosarcoma.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest danger with osteosarcoma is that it will spread to
the lungs. The disease is aggressive, Steuber said, and if it is
going to recur it will usually do so within a year. That Mrs. Cruz
has lived for more than eight years since finishing chemotherapy,
he said, bodes well for her.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mrs. Cruz is followed closely by a kidney specialist and
a specialist in infectious diseases, who keeps tabs on her
hepatitis. She visits the oncologists at Texas Children's Hospital
only once a year, where her progress is monitored along with that
of other long-term survivors. The visits are largely social.
``We've been through hard times together,'' Steuber said. ``It's
nice to have good times together.''
</P>
<P>
   Were she able to rewrite her personal history, Mrs. Cruz would
not leave out her cancer. ``Until you come close to death like I
did,'' she said, ``you don't realize what it is to take another
breath.'' She is grateful for that, yet her days are tempered by
uncertainty, and by the reality of life with one leg. She cannot
hop in the shower and dash out the door. She cannot play volleyball
or ride a bike. She is too modest to wear a dress, and with her
prosthesis, high heels are out. ``I would like,'' she said, ``to
wear high heels.''
</P>
<P>
   At night, however, her body is made whole. ``In my dreams,'' she
said, ``I still dream that I have both my legs.''

   BEIJING _ Last week, while governments and the press abroad
dwelled on the harsh sentences meted out to Chinese dissidents,
exuberant middle-class couples crowded into the newly opened Ikea
warehouse store here, snapping up stylish, modestly priced
furniture and housewares.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chinese and American governments sparred over human
rights, moviegoers rushed to see the season's hit, ``Be There or Be
Square,'' a romantic comedy filmed in Los Angeles that
affectionately caricatures the United States and the Chinese who go
there to seek their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary Chinese people, it would seem, the current
crackdown on democracy activists has registered only faintly, if at
all. Ask even well-educated professionals what they think about
people like Xu Wenli or Wang Youcai, two of the four democracy
advocates who received prison terms of a decade or more, and they
are apt to call them brave but stupid men who sacrificed themselves
with no chance of success. Many Chinese are bewildered by all the
attention outsiders give these cases, asserting, as one lawyer did,
that ``these things just have no affect on our daily lives now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that people are entirely unaware of the virtues of free
speech and politics. But they know that while there is little room
for dissent these days, they can pursue exciting new options in
their own lives. Many of them just assume that the society will
eventually have to liberalize. The biggest threat to their personal
freedoms, many say, would be a souring of Chinese-American
relations that might strengthen conservative forces here.
</P>
<P>
   Though audiences are streaming to see ``Be There or Be Square''
for a good laugh rather than for a sociology lesson, the movie's
popularity and themes are revealing. The film, which is directed by
Feng Xiaogang, deftly plays on Chinese stereotypes about America
and about themselves, and viewers are sophisticated enough to see
past the caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Los Angeles is horrid: Robbers lurk around every
corner and wide-eyed immigrants at first seem destined for drudgery
or jail. But as the two main characters zoom about in their cars,
have amusing encounters with the police and create their own
niches, the essential, refreshing freedom of California shines
through.
</P>
<P>
   The male lead, played by the comic actor Ge You, is an appealing
but shiftless man who has spent a decade living in a trailer,
selling other Chinese immigrants everything from dubious insurance
policies to graveyard plots. When the female lead, played by Xu
Fan, arrives in town, pretty but penniless, he warns her that there
is good news and bad news about America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to China,'' he says. ``This is a terrible place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, so what is the good news?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the good news,'' he replies. Then: ``Do you want to
work as a stripper?''
</P>
<P>
   She declines the offer and after years of perseverance she
achieves a decent living in the promised land and, of course, the
two fall in love. America is a land of opportunity after all.
</P>
<P>
   Americans here sometimes have a hard time understanding how many
Chinese can simultaneously appreciate the freedom of the West _ a
growing number of professionals have studied in the United States _
and readily dismiss the dissidents as foolish idealists. The vast
majority feel they are finally getting a chance to savor freedom in
their personal lives and work, and they want to enjoy the fruits of
modern society. The last thing most of them want is upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Chinese, dissidents like Xu Wenli are devoting their
lives to an abstract cause. The late philosopher Isaiah Berlin
famously said there are two types of intellectuals, the foxes who
know many things and the hedgehogs who know one big thing. Xu and
many of his colleagues in the democracy movement are hedgehogs,
with their minds focused laserlike on their quest and a
determination that transcends bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Xu has already spent 12 years in prison and he assumed, when he
started speaking out again this year, that he would probably be
imprisoned again. In the face of repeated warnings and detentions,
he stepped up the organization of a new political party and other
activities to promote freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And what did he talk about after his sham trial on Dec. 22, when
he was granted a final half-hour with his wife before starting a
13-year prison sentence? ``He said that the charge of subverting
state power made no sense,'' his wife later said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was legally irrational because state power comes
from the citizens,'' she said as she recounted, proudly, the
detailed legal and political analysis her husband gave her in their
final minutes together. He told her his prison term would give him
time to ``think things over very calmly and reflect on what has
happened and what should be done.'' He did, before he was finished,
express concern about their daughter and tell his wife _ a
remarkably dedicated person in her own right _ to look after her
health.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, some of the veteran dissidents sound almost
robotic ticking off their latest analysis of the global forces and
domestic politics that affect the democracy movement. But the
analysis is often brilliant, and the monotone reflects minds that
are wholly concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   What sustains these dissidents is an article of faith: that
freedom of speech and association is central to the good of a
modern society. If a single idea drives them, it is a big idea,
however pushed aside it is in today's China.
</P>
<P>
   As many citizens and even government officials will tell you,
Chinese today can think what they want and say what they want so
long as they do not organize against the Communist Party.
First-time visitors, having read about repression here, are often
surprised at how ordinary things appear: lively newspapers and
magazines, fast-paced television news programs and endless
commercials for cosmetics and electronic gear. Severe repression
singles out a small number of people, and most of the rest accept
the Party's limits, with little apparent pain.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to gauge is the cost to people in terms of cynicism and
even moral corrosion of blanking out certain kinds of thoughts; of
mouthing hackneyed party phrases in some settings while speaking
one's true mind in others, and of taking it for granted that all
news is subtly crafted to serve the interests of the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that social evolution, propelled by economic and
technical change, will eventually bring a free and democratic
China, though there is no sign this will happen any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, people like Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng, who is
now in exile in the United States after spending much of his adult
life in prison, will keep pushing as they can. Only time will tell
whether their countrymen will some day honor them for their
persistence, and their suffering.

   Chinese Got Arms Secrets, House Panel Says
</P>
<P>
   A special House committee concluded that over the past two
decades China obtained, sometimes through theft, some of the United
States' most sensitive military secrets, including designs for
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's findings confirmed recent Clinton administration
assessments that information given to Chinese scientists by two
U.S. satellite companies helped Beijing improve its ability to
launch satellites and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's 700-page report is secret because of the
classified material it covers, but Congress plans to make a
declassified version public in the coming weeks.

administration reported.

   The euro, the currency common to 11 European countries, arrived

There won't even be euro coins and bills until 2002, and local
currency will be good for six months after that.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, euros will exist mainly in the dark recesses of
computers at banks and stock exchanges, though they will show up in
credit-card bills and traveler's checks. But for travelers to
Europe, price comparisons should become easier.

   Fallout From Bus Crashes
</P>
<P>
   The cruel fact is that if people climb into vehicles and hit the
road, some will die. So the question is: What's the safest way to
travel?
</P>
<P>
   A spate of bus crashes in New Jersey on the busy routes to
Atlantic City has politicians calling for new safety measures. But
the statistics show that this is an extremely safe means of travel.

   Of 41,967 highway deaths in 1997, large trucks accounted for

   McCain Tests the Water
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took a big step toward a presidential
candidacy in 2000 by announcing the formation of an exploratory
committee to begin raising money for a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the first Republican to signal his plans, is a war hero
who took on his party's leadership in pressing, unsuccessfully, for
campaign finance reform and anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said one reason for the timing of McCain's
announcement was to upstage his many rivals and draw press coverage
before the White House scandal again dominates the news.

   Woman in Top Swiss Post
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's first woman president _ and the first Jew in the
largely ceremonial top post _ took office Friday. Ruth Dreifuss,
58, was elected in December in one of the narrowest Parliamentary
votes in recent years. Her presidency comes amid recent revelations
questioning Switzerland's cherished myths about its neutrality
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss said she viewed her election as an opportunity for
the nation to come to terms with its ``complex and
conflict-loaded'' wartime history.

   Octuplet Mother Goes Home
</P>
<P>
   The Houston woman who gave birth to octuplets last month left
the hospital three days after the death of one of the infants Dec.
27. Nkem Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, said they were
too busy caring for their seven surviving babies to get involved in
ethical debates over the births.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are suggesting guidelines to help regulate the use
of the advanced fertility drugs that Ms. Chukwu and others have
taken, because too many resulting babies die or suffer lifelong
medical problems. Louis said the family didn't want to rehash its
history of fertility treatments: ``That is in the past. Now all of
our concerns must be for caring for the babies.''

votes in recent years. Her presidency comes amid recent revelations
questioning Switzerland's cherished myths about its neutrality
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dreifuss said she viewed her election as an opportunity for
the nation to come to terms with its ``complex and
conflict-loaded'' wartime history.

   Octuplet Mother Goes Home
</P>
<P>
   The Houston woman who gave birth to octuplets last month left
the hospital three days after the death of one of the infants Dec.
27. Nkem Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Udobi, said they were
too busy caring for their seven surviving babies to get involved in
ethical debates over the births.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are suggesting guidelines to help regulate the use
of the advanced fertility drugs that Ms. Chukwu and others have
taken, because too many resulting babies die or suffer lifelong
medical problems. Louis said the family didn't want to rehash its
history of fertility treatments: ``That is in the past. Now all of
our concerns must be for caring for the babies.''

   A Conductor Has a Coughing Fit
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy is an often overlooked skill among musicians,
something needed to deal both with one another and with audiences.
Under provocation, that diplomacy can break down, as it did at a
New York Philharmonic concert last week. Frustrated by what he
called ``uncontrolled coughing'' during an intense moment in the
third movement of the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony, Kurt Masur, the
orchestra's music director, stopped the performance and left the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who were equally annoyed by their neighbors' unmuted
hacking applauded when he stepped off the podium. The coughers got
the message too: When he returned about two minutes later, Masur
was able to finish the concert in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   Unmuffled coughing has become an unfortunate trademark of New
York audiences. Touring musicians and well-traveled concertgoers
complain about it, and some concert halls now station bins of free
cough drops for ailing patrons who don't want to write off their
sometimes costly concert tickets. Articles in program books
regularly decry coughing, candy unwrapping, page turning, jewelry
rattling and noisy watches, beepers and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   It may always have been thus. When Franz Liszt performed for
Czar Nicholas I in St. Petersburg, the czar, no fan of music,
carried on a loud conversation with a lady friend until Liszt
stopped playing and stepped away from the piano. When the czar
asked what was wrong, Liszt cloaked his anger in diplomacy. ``When
the emperor speaks,'' he said, ``music ought to be silent.''

   Adding a Stitch in Time
</P>
<P>
   Since the time of Isaac Newton, many scientists have maintained
that the solar system is a big clock that keeps perfect time and
never runs down. Alas, celestial goings-on are rarely quite as neat
as the explanations devised by humans, and the solar system now
seems rather creaky compared with the atomic clocks used by the
world's official timekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Compensating for tiny imperfections in the earth's spin and in
the definition of a second in atomic terms, the world's time czars
decreed the addition of a leap second on New Year's Eve, slightly
lengthening 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leap seconds became necessary in 1972 after scientists redefined
the standard second as the time it takes for a cesium atom to
vibrate 9,192,631,770 times. Unfortunately, some finagling is
needed to synchronize the atomic second with the less accurate and
slightly mismatched rotation of the Earth. Were it not for leap
seconds inserted now and then, the sun would rise at noon 10,000
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Earth's rate of spin changes unpredictably, it is
impossible to forecast when the next leap second will be needed.
That decision will be made by the International Earth Rotation
Service, a part of the Paris Observatory that blows the whistle
whenever the difference between solar time and atomic time rises to
9/10 of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's was the 22nd leap second needed to keep timekeeping
reasonably correct. (The last one was added on June 30, 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you will make good use of it,'' admonished Dr. Donald
Sullivan, chief of the Time and Frequency Division of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 3, moved Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ECON-REVIEW (Washington) _ Impeachment vs. the economy.
Somewhere between Washington's certainty that the impeachment
controversy matters to the the nation and its economy, and the
markets' view that the such political wars and moral arguments are
irrelevant, lies a dynamic that seems bound to define 1999. By
David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ Earlier this decade, some
criminologists and politicians predicted that a crime wave teeming
with a new breed of adolescent superpredators would emerge in the
late '90s. But it isn't happening. A look at possible reasons why
the predictions are wrong. By Jacques Steinberg. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A real debate is emerging over
whether HMOs and other managed-care businesses can wring more
efficiencies out of the health-care system and therefore make money
over the long haul. While they prospered by taking advantage of
easy one-time savings, like the use of their clout to get doctors
and hospitals to accept less to provide care, their fat profits
could prove ephemeral in the face of medical costs that they, too,
cannot control. By Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   NOSE-JOBS-REVIEW (New York) _ Amid an explosion in cosmetic
surgery, the number of nose jobs has dropped significantly. The
reasons are partly cultural and partly economic, according to
plastic surgeons who have watched the evolution of a procedure that
was once a benchmark in a young girl's life, especially among
Jewish teen-agers. By Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   CHARTER-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Test-tube babies: private
public schools. A look at the growing focus on proposals for
charter schools. By Anemone Hartcullis.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-OPENINGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at some interesting and
unusual employment want-ads.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' catgeory:
</P>
<P>
   HITECH-WAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Putting a high a premium on
bloodless combat and faith in high technology raises some troubling
questions. One is whether the electronic razzle-dazzle creates the
expectation, some would say illusion, in the American public that
the new weapons can accomplish every military mission, and
therefore that the loss of any GIs in a future operation is
tantamount to failure. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-HOMELANDS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Old scars on the new
South Africa: the homelands, which were designed in the apartheid
era to segregate blacks, were legally abolished in 1994, but many
blacks remain in these economically-depressed areas because of
family ties. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-REVIEW (Sihanoukville) _ Cambodia's choice: neither
truth nor reconciliation. In freeing Khmer Rouge leaders, Cambodia
is bucking a worldwide trend toward accountability. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-U.S.-REVIEW (Almaty, Kazakhstan) _ As it helps funnel in
billions of dollars for oil development, the U.S. has wanted to
transform the Capsian nations into democratic and economically
transparent meritocracies. But as the Caspian leaders see it, they
have been willing to sign almost any agreement and have handed over
their oil fields, so why does Washington makes a fuss about their
corrupt and repressive politics? By Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SANCTIONS-REVIEW (Baghdad) _ The sanctions on Iraq do not
appear to be having the desired effect. What they are doing,
though, is fueling anti-Western sentiment among Iraq's people,
possibly helping keep Saddam in power. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSIDENTS-REVIEW (Beijing) _ Dissonance in China: so many
liberties, so little freedom. While the majority of Chinese are
enjoying unprecedented material and economic freedom, repression of
political freedom continues. BY Erik Eckholm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ From the terrace of his home on the outskirts of
Baghdad, a carpet dealer named Ziad al-Kadhimi watched the
mid-December bombing while sipping a fruit drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke some windows in our house, but we saw it more or less
as a show,'' al-Kadhimi said. ``Bombing is nothing. Maybe it hits a
few military buildings, but it doesn't really affect ordinary
people. The sanctions hurt a hundred times more.''
</P>
<P>
   In much of the outside world, the U.S.-led bombing campaigns
against Iraq that have been launched periodically since the end of
the Persian Gulf war in 1991 are viewed as devastating though
perhaps necessary assaults. Many Westerners assume that when this
country is not being bombed, it enjoys relative tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis assert just the opposite. They say that bombings are
increasingly precise and all but harmless to civilians, while
economic sanctions devastate their entire society.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq eight years ago as
part of an effort to force President Saddam Hussein to curb his
weapons development program, compensate Kuwaitis for his 1990
invasion of their country, and loosen his despotic rule.
</P>
<P>
   As in some other places where sanctions have been imposed, they
do not appear to have had much of the desired political effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say they are steadily weakening Saddam by showing
senior officials and clan leaders that Iraq faces only hardship as
long as he is in power.
</P>
<P>
   Others are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear, however, is that the sanctions have plunged
this once-prosperous country into poverty, and in the process
created deepening anti-Western and especially anti-American
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which is the principal backer of
sanctions, has vowed to use its veto in the United Nations Security
Council to prevent them from being lifted. It has not, however,
ruled out supporting expansion of a U.N. program under which Iraq
is allowed to sell limited amounts of oil and use part of the
income to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials fear that lifting sanctions would allow the Iraqi
government to import an array of products it would use to rebuild
its arsenal. They point to Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 and of
Kuwait in 1990 as evidence that Saddam's regime is incurably
aggressive and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington pride themselves on the pains they have
taken to assure that U.S. bombs hit only military targets in Iraq,
and to keep civilian casualties to an absolute minimum. But at the
same time, they assert that the sanctions, which probably kill more
civilians each month than bombs have killed since 1991, are a
regrettable necessity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, therefore, that many people here and
elsewhere are increasingly cynical about U.S. claims that the
United States has no desire to hurt ordinary Iraqis. Because of
tight censorship, Iraqis know nothing about Saddam's purchases of
luxury items for his palaces over the last few years. They are
acutely aware, however, of their daily hardships, and
unhesitatingly blame them on the United States and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the human cost of sanctions is worth what they may
accomplish in curbing or changing the Iraqi regime is being hotly
debated at the United Nations and in many world capitals. Russia,
France and China, together with several Arab countries, have called
for new approaches that could lead to lifting or relaxation of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. humanitarian workers here are among the most outspoken
critics. Their last chief, Denis Halliday, resigned his post in
protest three months ago and said sanctions ``are starving to death
6,000 Iraqi infants every month, ignoring the human rights of
ordinary Iraqis and turning a whole generation against the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Baghdad office last week, Farid Zarif, deputy director of
the U.N. humanitarian aid program here, held up a pencil as an
example of items that may not be imported under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told that pencils are forbidden because carbon could be
extracted from them that might be used to coat airplanes and make
them invisible to radar,'' Zarif said. ``I am not a military
expert, but I find it very disturbing that because of this
objection, we cannot give pencils to Iraqi schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council in
March that despite the oil-for-food program, which was launched in
1996, about one-fourth of Iraqi children are now malnourished. The
program does not provide Iraqis with protein- and vitamin-rich
foods such as milk, fruit, vegetables, eggs or meat.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. report issued in April concluded that the sanctions
``have had a devastating effect on the majority of the Iraqi
people.'' According to the report, 40,000 more children and 50,000
more adults now die each year in Iraqi hospitals than died before
the sanctions were imposed. Rates of polio, diphtheria,
tuberculosis, malaria and viral hepatitis were said to have sharply
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers like Michel Nahhal, a Lebanese national who has been
living in Baghdad for seven years as a representative of the Middle
East Council of Churches, say they see U.N. statistics vividly
translated into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are the severest thing that can happen to a
country,'' Nahhal said. ``Here in Iraq, the industrial sector is at
a standstill. Agriculture is collapsing because no fertilizers can
be imported and there is no electricity to power irrigation pumps.
The biggest employer was the oil sector, and that has all but
disappeared. Health conditions are terrible because there are no
pumps to flush the sewage pipes and not enough trucks to pick up
garbage. You see children playing in sewage with no shoes and no
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to survive, trying to make ends meet. It's
very hard on them. They do whatever they can. There is a lot of
prostitution. Boys are prostituting themselves at a very young age.
A few bombs landing on military bases every couple of years is
nothing compared to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary Iraqis, sanctions have meant an almost surreal
descent into a poverty they believe they do not deserve.

second. Sanctions kill you every day.''

   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ From the terrace of his home on the outskirts of
Baghdad, a carpet dealer named Ziad al-Kadhimi watched the
mid-December bombing while sipping a fruit drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke some windows in our house, but we saw it more or less
as a show,'' al-Kadhimi said. ``Bombing is nothing. Maybe it hits a
few military buildings, but it doesn't really affect ordinary
people. The sanctions hurt a hundred times more.''
</P>
<P>
   In much of the outside world, the U.S.-led bombing campaigns
against Iraq that have been launched periodically since the end of
the Persian Gulf war in 1991 are viewed as devastating though
perhaps necessary assaults. Many Westerners assume that when this
country is not being bombed, it enjoys relative tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqis assert just the opposite. They say that bombings are
increasingly precise and all but harmless to civilians, while
economic sanctions devastate their entire society.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq eight years ago as
part of an effort to force President Saddam Hussein to curb his
weapons development program, compensate Kuwaitis for his 1990
invasion of their country, and loosen his despotic rule.
</P>
<P>
   As in some other places where sanctions have been imposed, they
do not appear to have had much of the desired political effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats say they are steadily weakening Saddam by showing
senior officials and clan leaders that Iraq faces only hardship as
long as he is in power.
</P>
<P>
   Others are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear, however, is that the sanctions have plunged
this once-prosperous country into poverty, and in the process
created deepening anti-Western and especially anti-American
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which is the principal backer of
sanctions, has vowed to use its veto in the United Nations Security
Council to prevent them from being lifted. It has not, however,
ruled out supporting expansion of a U.N. program under which Iraq
is allowed to sell limited amounts of oil and use part of the
income to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials fear that lifting sanctions would allow the Iraqi
government to import an array of products it would use to rebuild
its arsenal. They point to Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980 and of
Kuwait in 1990 as evidence that Saddam's regime is incurably
aggressive and untrustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington pride themselves on the pains they have
taken to assure that U.S. bombs hit only military targets in Iraq,
and to keep civilian casualties to an absolute minimum. But at the
same time, they assert that the sanctions, which probably kill more
civilians each month than bombs have killed since 1991, are a
regrettable necessity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, therefore, that many people here and
elsewhere are increasingly cynical about U.S. claims that the
United States has no desire to hurt ordinary Iraqis. Because of
tight censorship, Iraqis know nothing about Saddam's purchases of
luxury items for his palaces over the last few years. They are
acutely aware, however, of their daily hardships, and
unhesitatingly blame them on the United States and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the human cost of sanctions is worth what they may
accomplish in curbing or changing the Iraqi regime is being hotly
debated at the United Nations and in many world capitals. Russia,
France and China, together with several Arab countries, have called
for new approaches that could lead to lifting or relaxation of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. humanitarian workers here are among the most outspoken
critics. Their last chief, Denis Halliday, resigned his post in
protest three months ago and said sanctions ``are starving to death
6,000 Iraqi infants every month, ignoring the human rights of
ordinary Iraqis and turning a whole generation against the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Baghdad office last week, Farid Zarif, deputy director of
the U.N. humanitarian aid program here, held up a pencil as an
example of items that may not be imported under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told that pencils are forbidden because carbon could be
extracted from them that might be used to coat airplanes and make
them invisible to radar,'' Zarif said. ``I am not a military
expert, but I find it very disturbing that because of this
objection, we cannot give pencils to Iraqi schoolchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Security Council in
March that despite the oil-for-food program, which was launched in
1996, about one-fourth of Iraqi children are now malnourished. The
program does not provide Iraqis with protein- and vitamin-rich
foods such as milk, fruit, vegetables, eggs or meat.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. report issued in April concluded that the sanctions
``have had a devastating effect on the majority of the Iraqi
people.'' According to the report, 40,000 more children and 50,000
more adults now die each year in Iraqi hospitals than died before
the sanctions were imposed. Rates of polio, diphtheria,
tuberculosis, malaria and viral hepatitis were said to have sharply
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers like Michel Nahhal, a Lebanese national who has been
living in Baghdad for seven years as a representative of the Middle
East Council of Churches, say they see U.N. statistics vividly
translated into daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are the severest thing that can happen to a
country,'' Nahhal said. ``Here in Iraq, the industrial sector is at
a standstill. Agriculture is collapsing because no fertilizers can
be imported and there is no electricity to power irrigation pumps.
The biggest employer was the oil sector, and that has all but
disappeared. Health conditions are terrible because there are no
pumps to flush the sewage pipes and not enough trucks to pick up
garbage. You see children playing in sewage with no shoes and no
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to survive, trying to make ends meet. It's
very hard on them. They do whatever they can. There is a lot of
prostitution. Boys are prostituting themselves at a very young age.
A few bombs landing on military bases every couple of years is
nothing compared to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary Iraqis, sanctions have meant an almost surreal
descent into a poverty they believe they do not deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I sold my television, then my furniture, then my car,
then my house,'' said Mohammed Abdul Razaq, a retired office
worker. ``Everything that I built up over a lifetime is gone. A
bomb is something you hear far away, or at worst, it kills you in a
second. Sanctions kill you every day.''

ANALYSIS: CAMBODIA A LAND OF UNCERTAIN JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ As two Khmer Rouge leaders accused of
killing more than a million people toured a balmy seaside town with
their military escort and deferential guides the other day, they
drove past a jail where two Cambodian human-rights workers were
receiving different treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were being held without bail on vague charges after
they had advised protesters who rallied recently against the
dumping of toxic waste at the edge of town. Ten protesters had also
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrast that highlights the inequities hobbling
Cambodia's development into a free and democratic state. It also
casts a harsh light on the claim that Cambodia might have its own
way of dealing with its crimes and traumas.
</P>
<P>
   This is still a land of arbitrary justice, where neither mass
killers nor rights workers can be quite sure what treatment to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a liberal democratic constitution, a government of equal
branches and a nationwide election five months ago, the key
decisions are in the hands of one man: Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   When he said Monday that Cambodia should ``dig a hole and bury
the past,'' buried it was. And when he said four days later that he
favored a trial, a trial seemed to be in the cards again. Cambodia
is still waiting for his final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The two rights workers, Kim Sen and Meas Minea, are local
coordinators for Licadho, the country's pre-eminent rights group.
Part of their work is to train local officials in basic principles
of justice. Their own students are among their jailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people to trust the justice system,'' a Western diplomat
said, ``there needs to be some consistency. And the arrests of the
Licadho workers are a stark reminder that there isn't this
consistency, that there is a gross disparity between the small and
the big in society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, came in
from the cold on Christmas after three decades of revolution that
included brutal rule from 1975 to 1978. They were welcomed with
embraces from both Hun Sen and the former United Nations Secretary
General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was visiting town to promote
the French language but took time out to pay his respects.
</P>
<P>
   Boutros-Ghali praised Hun Sen for his policy of ``national
reconciliation.'' He said the mass killings by the Khmer Rouge were
the internal affair of a sovereign state, immune from the
``interference'' of outsiders. He said Cambodians must find their
own route to resolving their rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody sees it this way. The United Nations itself is
investigating evidence and possible procedures to bring Khmer Rouge
killers to trial if the Security Council or the Cambodians
themselves will agree to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   The democratization process that the United Nations tried to
initiate here at the start of the decade, under Boutros-Ghali's
leadership, has spawned a cadre of rights workers dedicated to
principles of justice that challenge the feudal ways of this
politically primitive country.
</P>
<P>
   ``National reconciliation should not be at any cost,'' said Kao
Kim Hourn, head of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and
Peace, a local rights group.
</P>
<P>
   If the two recent defectors and perhaps a dozen high-ranking
colleagues are not brought to justice, Cambodia will be bucking a
worldwide trend toward accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunals are addressing mass killings in Rwanda and the
Balkans. Truth commissions have examined the past in South Africa
and Argentina. South Korea has convicted, then pardoned, two former
leaders. Japan has been offering grudging apologies for its war
crimes. Spain is trying to prosecute the former Chilean dictator,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Even President Clinton, while visiting
Africa, expressed regret about American participation in the slave
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has little to fear from a similar process, said Steve
Heder, a scholar who is examining records in Phnom Penh for the War
Crimes Research Office of the American University Law School. The
Prime Minister is in firm control of the nation's politics and
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an Argentina or a Chile where a military apparatus
left over from a criminal regime can threaten stability,'' Heder
said, adding, ``There is no solid basis on which to base an
assertion that Cambodians do not want a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Heder said his examination of material collected by the
Documentation Center of Cambodia, a private local research group,
found strong documentary evidence implicating Nuon Chea and ``a lot
of circumstantial evidence'' implicating Khieu Samphan.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge kept records. Many reports on interrogations and
torture as well as confessions obtained through torture were sent
to Nuon Chea, Heder said. And Khieu Samphan's position close to the
Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, Heder added, makes it hard to imagine
that he was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   At present the two men are embarked on the grand tour that has
been afforded previous Khmer Rouge defectors. After returning from
the beach town of Sihanoukville on Friday, they and their families
traveled today to another tourist spot, Siem Reap, the site of the
ancient temples of Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to relax a bit,'' Khieu Samphan said, eluding reporters
at the beach, ``so please forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a walking advertisement for a problem cited by rights
workers: impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rights monitors have been pointing out that no one has been
seriously investigated for a more recent series of political
killings, including a grenade attack on a March 1997 rally that
killed 16 people and wounded more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   The Licadho workers jailed in Sihanoukville were apparently
doing what the United Nations intended and what Hun Sen's
government has claimed to support: trying to assure that public
issues were being dealt with legally and properly. Colleagues say
they advised protesters on how to prepare a petition and how to
stage a legal protest.
</P>
<P>
   Rights experts said they believed it was the first time that
rights workers had been formally charged with a crime related to
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In six or seven years working here on the evolution of
human-rights movements,'' said a foreign rights adviser who spoke
on condition of anonymity, ``I see this as one of the lowest points
yet. I am concerned that this could be the first step in an attempt
to break the back of the human-rights movement.''  &QL;

NAMELESS IN A KMART LINE, SIGNIFICANT ON JETS' DEFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct 1999 copyright line.)  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wherever they are shopping Sunday, enjoying their week off
before joining the playoff battle, the four players on the Jets'
defensive line will hardly be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when you go to the malls,'' said Rick Lyle, who is
among those who toil on one of the National Football League's most
successful yet least-noted units. ``You can walk around with your
family and nobody comes up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that has produced defensive lines with such menacing
nicknames as the Purple People Eaters, the Steel Curtain, the
Fearsome Foursome and the Sack Exchange, the most imposing member
of the Jets' line is named Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one in the history of the N.F.L. to be named
Pleasant,'' right end Anthony Pleasant claimed. And he is almost
correct. He is the only Pleasant who has ever played a full season.
The boast is a rare show of ego for a religious man who wants to be
identified not for whom he throws around on the field, but for whom
he can save off it.
</P>
<P>
   The line's work has been instrumental in the Jets' run to a 12-4
record and the East Division title, achievements that gave them
this weekend off. All they have to do Sunday is wait to see who
they will play next Sunday at Giants Stadium. It will be
Jacksonville if the Jaguars can beat New England Sunday afternoon.
Otherwise, they will play the winner of Saturday's Miami-Buffalo
game.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen are not well known in part because they are not
noted for their attention-getting sacks. Pleasant led the line with
six while the others combined for seven. Still, they were
instrumental in holding together a defense that allowed the
second-fewest points in the league, trailing Miami by only 1 point.
</P>
<P>
   The line was the most unsettled element of the defense in
training camp, when Pleasant, who plays right end, joined forces
with the well-traveled Ernie Logan at right tackle, Lyle at left
end and the second-year left tackle Jason Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Logan and Lyle had arrived a year earlier at bargain-basement
prices, free agents cut by their teams, while Ferguson, from
Georgia, was the Jets' final draft choice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Pleasant joined the Jets he at least had the advantage of
familiarity, having been a teammate of Logan's and Lyle's in
Cleveland. But he was 30, had suffered an ankle injury in Baltimore
in 1996, and was a part-time player in Atlanta last season after
hurting a knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One common thing about them is that they're all clean-living
kids,'' coach Bill Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Another was that each of the three was essentially in a
last-chance situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie knew this was his last shot,'' Parcells said. ``Rick
would have been out of football. Anthony had to stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because of that united sense of desperation, but
it became apparent after practices in camp that there was something
different about this group.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant would remain in the summer heat, and he and Logan would
discuss techniques and how to use their hands. ``Some of the other
guys would see us working,'' Pleasant said, ``and they'd just
gravitate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us was a real high draft pick,'' Lyle said. ``It was a
lot like being a walk-on in college. You have to work that much
harder because you kind of had two strikes against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant, who went to Tennessee State and spent six seasons with
the Browns before going to Baltimore and Atlanta, said he did not
mind staying after practice to help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been that way,'' he said. ``My father died when I
was 2 and my mother raised me. I grew up in a small town _ Century,
Florida _ no bigger than a matchbox. But I had good role models _
my uncle, teachers, a professor at college.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother cleaned houses until she got a job working in a
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I was poor,'' he said. ``I thought I was
middle class until I got to college and saw what other people
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant's no-nonsense approach to the game makes perfect sense
considering his philosophy: ``I do not want to be defined by the
sport I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant, who rarely inhabits the locker room during the 45
minutes Parcells allows for interviews, lives in Point Lookout, a
Long Island summer resort all but deserted by tourists in the
winter. There, his wife, Renita, and 2-year-old daughter, Hannah
Denette, rarely go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not known as a core Jet,'' he said. ``I'm not recognized.
But I do a lot of things people don't know anything about.'' He
works with various programs to help children, and talks of becoming
a minister when he stops playing.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Lyle talk about their Christian faith, Logan is a
Muslim who wears a watch with a compass to help him locate the
northeast on road trips, so he can pray every evening.
</P>
<P>
   Logan and Ferguson have enjoyed the group identity the players
have forged.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the year progressed, we started to feel more comfortable in
each other,'' Logan said. ``We had faith that the other guy would
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said: ``I'd describe this like a brother relationship.
Once we got a feel for each other, once we got a `W,' we got going.
They teach me a lot of things. They're all very spiritual, and I've
learned what road to take and what road not to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a quiet way, you understand, the line glories in its
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't come in here and push us around,'' Ferguson
said. ``We thrive on not being known.''

   MONTERREY, Mexico _ A red-headed soap opera star startled
mourners at the recent funeral of a senior Mexican governing party
politician by stepping forward, just as the coffin was being
lowered, to proclaim flamboyantly that she had been his longtime
mistress.
</P>
<P>
   The incident went unmentioned in most newspapers in Guadalajara,
where the funeral took place. But a new paper in that city, Mural,
gave details of the dramatic confession in a package of articles
profiling the politician that also noted that he had been accused
of having drug ties.
</P>
<P>
   Many old-line Mexican journalists who specialize in obsequious
reporting on the governing party were incensed. ``You have to lack
all sense of shame to defame a man who has just passed away,''
sniffed one pro-government tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   But Alejandro Junco de la Vega, Mural's publisher, was
delighted. The controversy offered a new opportunity to dramatize
his view that newspapers exist to inform the public, not to
ingratiate themselves with the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   His creed is still exceptional here, so Junco's burgeoning media
empire is revolutionizing Mexican journalism and emerging as one of
the most authoritative referees in the country's democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Mural began publishing on Nov. 20, the fifth anniversary of the
founding of Reforma, Junco's Mexico City paper. Many now consider
Reforma to be Mexico's most influential publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reforma has become crucial to Mexico's new politics,'' said
Federico Estevez, a political scientist. ``I don't read anything
else here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mural, Reforma and El Norte, the Monterrey paper he
inherited from his family, Junco, who is 50, now has a major
broadsheet in each of Mexico's three largest cities. Reforma's
national news section is also reprinted by five independent
regional papers, broadening its reach all across Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where most public business has been shrouded in
secrecy, Junco has, during his 25-year publishing career, fought
freedom-of-information battles with top industrialists, the Supreme
Court, the political parties, even Ernesto Zedillo and several
previous Mexican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   What has enabled him to survive these conflicts while other
publishers who tried his approach have been driven from business or
into exile? He said, in a recent interview, that it has been his
understanding that in Mexican publishing, political independence
depends not only on pursuit of the truth but on commercial success,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for the public's right to information, and that
means developing independent journalism and a healthy, arms-length
relationship with government,'' Junco said during a car trip from
Monterrey to Saltillo, a state capital west of Monterrey where he
owns a fourth newspaper. ``But we can't be quixotic about this; we
have the challenge of surviving. We have to sell newspapers and
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of Junco's media group has been so extraordinary that
some journalists who cheered Reforma's appearance in 1993 now fear
that the group's expansion across Mexico could smother rivals that
have also pioneered quality newspapers in regional cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reforma has been a real renovating force,'' said Jorge Zepeda
Patterson, the editor of Publico, a respected Guadalajara paper
that now competes with Mural. ``There's good journalism going on in
several papers outside Mexico City, and now they've got to defend
themselves against Reforma's national pretensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Robust competition among politically independent newspapers was
unheard of until recently in Mexico. During decades of unbroken
rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI,
most papers acted as servile courtesans to successive presidents.
Especially in Mexico City, dissenting publications were punished by
the withdrawal of state-controlled newsprint and advertising, or
barred from newsstands run by unions loyal to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   When Junco, a 1969 journalism graduate of the University of
Texas, became El Norte's publisher in 1973 at age 25, he was
determined to establish more independence. He broadened El Norte's
advertising base so that no private or government client
contributed a large percentage of revenues. He hired young
reporters and invited one of his Texas professors to Monterrey to
teach the staff everything from copy editing to newsroom ethics.
</P>
<P>
   He barred the news staff from taking bribes and relieved them of
the duty to sell advertising, a practice that continues at many
other papers. Ramon Alberto Garza, who was 17 when hired by Junco,
rose to head El Norte's newsroom at 26 and is now executive editor
of all four Junco papers.
</P>
<P>
   Junco's first major political test came in 1973, when President
Luis Echeverria responded to critical coverage by cutting El
Norte's supply of newsprint. El Norte managed to keep publishing
until the harassment ended.
</P>
<P>
   Over two decades, Junco expanded El Norte's staff from 17
editorial employees to 440. He recruited hundreds of young computer
experts, who turned El Norte into one of the hemisphere's most
technologically advanced papers. In 1988 he founded an electronic
media company, Infosel, which offers online financial and other
information services.
</P>
<P>
   But his most ambitious decision was to launch Reforma; more than
20 newspapers were already publishing in Mexico City, and
journalism in general was so discredited that few people were
reading any of them. But Junco and Garza designed a visually
dazzling paper, unlike any other. In a city in which most papers
propagate the views of one political faction, the two men recruited
dozens of respected opinion columnists reflecting a broad spectrum
of Mexican opinion.
</P>
<P>
   They broadened Reforma's coverage beyond political and economic
news to include entire sections devoted to automobiles, fashion,
sports and other topics that would appeal to Mexico's fledgling
middle class. They signed agreements allowing them to reprint
articles from publications like The Wall Street Journal, Business
Week and, most recently, The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   After a showdown with the PRI-affiliated union that controls
newspaper street sales, they built an independent distribution
system that gets the paper to subscribers' doorsteps hours earlier
than other papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to conquer the breakfast table,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper has built the most important independent opinion
polling unit in Mexico, which does pre-election soundings and
publishes quarterly reports on Zedillo's approval ratings. Estevez,
the political scientist, said that Reforma's polling persuaded many
Mexican politicians to do their own regular opinion samplings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all had a profound impact on Mexican politics,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Reforma has withstood the predictable
political pressure. One of the bitterest encounters came when the
paper published a letter written by Zedillo to Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the PRI's 1994 presidential candidate, four days before
the candidate's assassination. Zedillo was Colosio's campaign
manager, and the letter warned the candidate that president Carlos
Salinas de Gortari appeared to regret having nominated him.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the letter infuriated Zedillo, who attacked
Reforma publicly, contending that it was a ``strictly private''
correspondence. Junco stood his ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the president's point of view, but we were not even
remotely touching the fine line between what is public and what is
private,'' he said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we had the letter,'' he said in the interview, ``we had
not only the right but the obligation to publish it.''
</P>
<P>
   That and other controversies have increased Reforma's
readership, especially among many Mexico City residents who
previously read no paper at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexico City papers were all content to live off government
ads and not hustle,'' said Murray Fromson, director of the
University of Southern California's journalism school. ``Reforma
has forced its competitors to do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   One Mexico City competitor, El Universal, has reacted to
Reforma's success by recruiting several tenacious investigative
reporters who have thoroughly invigorated Universal's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But Reforma has had the opposite effect on many radio and
television stations, encouraging laziness because many now prefer
simply to repeat the news published in Reforma rather than to
sustain independent reporting staffs, Jose Gutierrez Vivo, Mexico's
foremost radio news anchorman, said in a recent magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 newsgathering rule is now: Go buy a Reforma,'' he
said.

INDUSTRIES PRESS PLAN FOR CREDITS IN EMISSIONS CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Conn., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as a proposed treaty on global warming faces
an uncertain future in the Senate, big companies are maneuvering to
push through legislation giving them valuable credits for early
actions to control the waste gases that the binding treaty would
strictly limit.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed treaty, negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, and signed by
the Clinton administration last year, requires steep reductions in
the industrial nations' emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse
gases. If the Senate eventually approves it despite widespread
opposition from major industries, companies want to be sure they
get credit for any reductions they achieve before the treaty takes
force in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would mark a significant shift in the debate in
the Senate over climate change, potentially moderating the
opposition to the treaty among big industry groups and linking
their financial interests to the goals of treaty supporters. And if
it succeeded, it could revive the longstanding efforts of the
administration to persuade industries to cut their emissions
voluntarily, which have met with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a potential winner,'' said Eileen Claussen, executive
director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and a former
treaty negotiator for the administration. ``It helps get the United
States moving. It is voluntary. It is supported by industry. It
seems to me there should be a way to get legislation like that
through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   For some companies, credits earned now could be applied against
strict limits they would face later. Companies able to make even
deeper cuts in emissions now could sell their surplus credits for
billions of dollars under an emissions trading system that the
administration wants to set up.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, big companies, joined by influential
environmental groups and policy analysts, are already lobbying hard
for Congress to guarantee credits for early action.
</P>
<P>
   Three senators, led by John Chafee of Rhode Island, the leading
Republican environmentalist in the Senate, introduced legislation
late in the last session that would assure the companies that their
early reductions would earn credit under any mechanism the
government eventually establishes to limit emissions of greenhouse
gases. The bill is also supported by Sens. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., and Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last month to the National Association of
Manufacturers, Chafee, chairman of the Senate Environment
Committee, said he would make the bill a priority as soon as
Congress reconvened next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the climate debate will indeed continue over the next
few years, we strongly believe that there is a voluntary,
incentive-based approach which can be implemented now,'' he told
the group, which has opposed the Kyoto treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good guys who take action now will be rewarded by having
these actions count,'' Chafee said. ``This credit program may also
make early greenhouse gas reductions financially valuable to the
companies who make them.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean a windfall for companies that have recorded
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions since 1991, a period when
the nation's overall annual emissions ballooned by more than 10
percent despite the administration's voluntary plan to curtail
them.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the bill gives ton-for-ton credits to any of the
more than 150 companies that can document reductions in their
greenhouse gas emissions under various voluntary federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The DuPont company is one example. The biggest chemical producer
in the United States, DuPont has taken steps that will cut its own
emissions of greenhouse gases far more and much faster than the
treaty would require.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said DuPont would cut its annual greenhouse
gas emissions to much less than half of 1991's levels by the year
2000. Under the treaty, the United States as a whole would have to
cut emissions 7 percent below 1990's level between 2008 and 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did not recognize our voluntary work, you would punish
us for stepping out in front,'' said Darwin Wika, director of
safety, health and the environment for DuPont. ``And the laggards
who did not step up to the plate would be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   By DuPont's calculations, by the end of this year it will have
reduced its annual emissions by the equivalent of 90 million tons
of carbon dioxide. Economists' estimates of the value of carbon
credits in an emissions trading scheme vary widely, but depending
on the crediting rules, DuPont's savings alone could someday be
worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some big environmental groups, like the Environmental Defense
Fund, which favors emissions trading and other market-based
pollution controls, have published detailed proposals for granting
credits to companies that move early, and have advised lawmakers on
drafting legislation. There are at least five such proposals
spelled out by various advocates, including one by Niagara Mohawk,
the New York utility company.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists have criticized the bill offered by
the three senators.
</P>
<P>
   John Stanton, legislative director for the National
Environmental Trust, a pro-treaty advocacy group, said the bill
``does not provide sufficient guarantees that emission reductions
credited under it will actually result from reduced emissions, as
opposed to phantom paper reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chafee planning hearings soon, the lobbying is sure to
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are creating a new currency called carbon-dioxide tons,''
said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, another
treaty advocacy group. ``There is a lot of money involved, and
there is going to be a lot of ferocious jockeying to control who
gets the money. It is going to be pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the most active proponents of credit for early action
are a closely knit coterie of former government officials, policy
analysts, environmental advocates, lobbyists, lawyers and corporate
officials who have been working for months to build support for the
credit idea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Environmental Defense Fund and the Pew Center for
Global Climate Change, they include law firms and lobbyists like
Van Ness Feldman and Alcalde &AMP; Fay, both of which represent several
electric utilities, and a number of individual companies, several
of them aligned with the Pew Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies, big and small, could benefit from the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year for which data is available, companies
participating in voluntary reductions of greenhouse gases reported
to the Energy Department that they had reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by the equivalent of 137 million tons of carbon dioxide.
Under the bill, all of them would qualify for credits.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which filed detailed reports about more than
1,200 emission control projects, included 156 participants in more
than a dozen different industries. Most of them are electric
utilities, but other types of companies are increasingly
participating.
</P>
<P>
   Even one individual filed a report in 1995. Carter Lewis III,
who at the time was a consultant for the Energy Department, claimed
to have cut his personal emissions of carbon dioxide by between
three and four tons by never having more than one light at a time
turned on in his house, and by commuting to work outside of rush
hours to save gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to demonstrate what the ordinary citizen could
do,'' he said. ``You don't have to be a gigantic power plant to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions.'' (The reductions he claimed,
however, would have only a trivial market value.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of participants has increased steadily, for
the past few years the amount of reductions in emissions that they
claimed has been falling. In 1996 it was the equivalent of 154
million tons of carbon dioxide, and in 1995 it was 183 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable debate whether actions taken years ago
should be granted credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent the credit is regarded as an incentive to spur
industry to make greenhouse gas reductions that would not otherwise
occur, there is little basis for rewarding reductions already
achieved,'' said the report, written for the Pew Center by Robert
Nordhaus and Stephen Fotis of Van Ness Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they noted, companies that signed onto the
administration's voluntary programs may have relied on the
government's representations that they would be granted appropriate
credits.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, which investigated the Energy
Department's reporting system, found some flaws that suggest that
the claims may be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The agency noted that the Energy Department does not verify that
claimed reductions are actually achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have used many different strategies for reducing their
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, officials said, not only has cut its energy consumption,
but invested millions of dollars changing its processes for making
adipic acid powder, a chemical feedstock. The new approach
eliminates most emissions of nitrous oxides, like carbon dioxide a
potent greenhouse gas that would be controlled by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   American Forests, a conservation group, has filed annual reports
with the Energy Department describing hundreds of tree-planting
projects that could offset carbon dioxide emissions because growing
trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store the
carbon as wood.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the organization has planted more than 8 million trees,
which it calculates will offset 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide
or lock up 634,000 tons of carbon. Credits for those tons could
easily become worth millions of dollars to the organization in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Many electric utilities have argued that they have achieved
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by operating their nuclear
power plants more efficiently, reducing the need to burn coal in
other power plants. Some utilities have filed reports with the
Energy Department claiming millions of tons of reductions of this
kind, even as their total emissions of carbon dioxide have
continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Power Co., for example, reported that its total annual
emissions of carbon dioxide increased from about 24 million tons in
1990 to about 36 million tons in 1996, an increase of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It said, however, that its more efficient use of nuclear power
between 1993 and 1996 prevented an additional 35 million tons of
carbon dioxide from being added to the atmosphere. Credit for those
tons could be very important to Duke if it is told to sharply limit
its emissions between 2008 and 2012 to help comply with the global
warming treaty.

AFTER JUDGE'S REBUKE, COMMERCE SECRETARY EXPANDS INVESTIGATION INTO
COVER-UP  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has asked the
department's inspector general to expand his investigation into
whether officials systematically concealed and destroyed documents
sought in a lawsuit, after a federal judge made those charges in a
stinging rebuke of the department, officials said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Royce C. Lamberth compared the behavior of former Commerce
officials to that of ``con artists'' and ``scofflaws.'' In harshly
criticizing the department in a ruling last month, Lamberth
demonstrated that he had lost patience in trying to supervise a
lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative group, against
the department. Judicial Watch has charged in its four-year-old
lawsuit that the late secretary of commerce, Ronald H. Brown,
favored donors to the Democratic Party in giving out highly prized
seats on government trade missions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth said there was clear evidence that after Brown was
killed in a plane crash on April 3, 1996, during a trade mission to
Bosnia and Croatia, ``there was a flurry of document shredding in
the secretary's office.'' Further, he said, there was ample
evidence that department officials never really conducted any
serious search for the documents sought by Judicial Watch in
requests authorized by the court.
</P>
<P>
   In unusually scathing language, the judge wrote, ``Either out of
carelessness or deliberate defiance, the Department of Commerce
repeatedly and grossly mishandled materials responsive to Judicial
Watch's Freedom of Information Act requests.''
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that some former department officials had
improperly taken official documents with them when they left to go
into the private sector. He ordered those documents returned along
with videotapes and audiotapes of some of the trade missions, which
had been sent to Howard University to become part of a permanent
``Ron H. Brown Jr. Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he complained that the department handed out awards to
some of the very employees who were involved in the delay and
destruction of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   Morrie Goodman, chief spokesman for the Commerce Department,
said last week that Daley would do everything possible to find out
what had occurred. Goodman said it would be improper for the
department to investigate itself, so the secretary has asked the
acting inspector general assigned to Commerce, Johnnie Frazier, to
undertake the investigation. Frazier already was looking into some
aspects of the matter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the officials whose actions were criticized by the judge
are still with the department.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth also noted that Nolanda S. Hill, whom he described as a
business partner and confidante of Brown, has testified that Brown
told her he was ordered by senior White House officials to ``slow
down'' the effort to comply with Judicial Watch's requests.
</P>
<P>
   In her deposition, Ms. Hill testified that Brown had said the
orders came from Leon E. Panetta, then the White House chief of
staff, and John D. Podesta, who is now the chief of staff. James
Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said on Thursday that the
accusations about Panetta and Podesta were untrue. ``Ms. Hill's
allegations are false in every respect,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth singled out Ginger Lew, the former general counsel at
Commerce, saying she had repeatedly tried to avoid being served
with a subpoena. ``Why a high-level government employee like Ms.
Lew would play these games, usually reserved for con artists and
hooligans, is impossible for the court to fathom,'' Lamberth wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Philip Gagner, suggested in an interview that
Lamberth did not understand fully the interaction between Ms. Lew
and Larry Klayman, the chief counsel for Judicial Watch.``Ms. Lew
did not in any way attempt to evade service of the subpoena,''
Gagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Gagner said that Ms. Lew had tried hard to cooperate but that
Klayman was interested only in media attention. Lamberth conceded
that Klayman could be difficult and partly had been responsible for
some of the difficulties during depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lamberth has ordered that new depositions be taken
from Ms. Lew as well as of John Huang, whose earlier testimony he
described as wholly implausible. Huang who was an official at both
the department and the Democratic National Committee remains under
investigation by a Justice Department task force looking into
possible irregularities in campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lamberth's ruling, the new round of depositions will take
place under the direct supervision of a federal magistrate-judge.

NORTH KOREA'S HARDENING LINE RAISES FEARS OF NEW CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With warnings like its latest threat to wipe American
imperialists ``from this planet for good,'' North Korea seems to
have grown more hard-line and militarized in recent months, and
some experts fear a major security crisis on the Korean Peninsula
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions are rising in particular because of North Korea's
missile tests and suspicions that it is secretly developing nuclear
weapons in a constellation of underground complexes around the
country. The result is a stalemate between North Korea and the
West, on top of what appears to be growing mutual distrust and a
disillusionment on each side for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation will be very, very dangerous in the next few
months,'' said Han S. Park, a political scientist and North Korea
specialist at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate is threatening to destroy the 1994 Agreed
Framework, which has been widely touted as one of President
Clinton's major foreign policy successes and has been the
centerpiece of Western efforts to achieve a lasting peace on the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was the culmination of a tense confrontation in
the summer of 1994 that American officials now acknowledge took
them much closer to war with North Korea than was generally
realized, and if it falls apart the danger of war could again loom
on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Agreed Framework, North Korea was to give up its
nuclear program, and in exchange the West was to supply fuel oil
and a kind of nuclear reactor that cannot easily be used to produce
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has a taste for threats and brinkmanship, so it is
entirely possible that last-minute solutions will be found. Still,
if the stalemate continues, then some analysts warn that the United
States could face a confrontation with North Korea similar to the
one it already faces with Iraq, except that North Korea is believed
to have nuclear and chemical weapons and probably has the ability
to kill millions of people in the course of losing a war.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate challenge is the mystery surrounding several North
Korean underground complexes burrowed into hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   There is no conclusive evidence about precisely what North Korea
is doing in those tunnels, near the town of Kumchangri and in
several other spots. But some experts say that the appearance and
organization of the underground sites, chemical analyses of dirt
samples, and signs of testing of the triggers used to detonate
nuclear weapons all indicate a strong likelihood that the
underground complexes are being used to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is refusing American demands to inspect the
complexes, although it has held out the possibility of a deal in
which it would get large amounts of money or food aid in exchange
for allowing visits.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have enacted conditions that will make
it difficult for the Administration to provide fuel oil to North
Korea _ a key United States obligation under the Agreed Framework _
unless the suspicions about the underground complexes are cleared
up. The results of a single inspection may be ambiguous, so
doubters want regular inspections of up to a dozen sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there's a one-time access to the underground site,
that may mean that the temporary crisis is over, but it doesn't
resolve the longer-term issue,'' said Han Sung Joo, who was South
Korean Foreign Minister when the Agreed Framework was reached.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if the stalemate is not resolved, leading the
United States to stop shipping oil and causing the agreement to
fall apart?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our only option will be to go nuclear and do it publicly,''
said Kim Myong Chol, an influential North Korean writer and editor
who lives in Tokyo and serves as an unofficial spokesman for his
country. ``North Korea will fabricate nuclear warheads to target
Japan and America as major targets and will sell nuclear weapons to
any country, to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there will be a new war,'' Kim said after offering
wishes for the new year. ``Maybe you and I will all die in Tokyo!''
</P>
<P>
   It may be in North Korea's interest to emphasize the risks
ahead, to encourage compromise from Washington. But American
diplomats also warn that a breakdown in the Agreed Framework could
lead North Koreans to revive their nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the framework, North Koreans froze operations at its
reactors in the city of Yongbyon and ``canned'' the fuel rods there
to keep them safe. Stephen W. Bosworth, the American Ambassador to
South Korea, said in a speech a few days ago that if the Agreed
Framework falls apart, North Koreans might quickly reverse those
steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could uncan and reprocess the fuel rods, producing enough
plutonium in a matter of months to build several nuclear weapons,''
Bosworth said. ``If they refueled the reactor at Yongbyon, they
could have an ongoing capability to produce plutonium and build
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the problem of the underground complexes, another
challenge is North Korea's missile program. On Aug. 31, North Korea
sent a three-stage rocket hurtling over Japan, perhaps in an
attempt to launch a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that North Korea's missiles can now reach Tokyo and
all other key cities in Japan, and possibly as far as Alaska and
Hawaii. Officials said that some satellite intelligence indicates
that North Korea may be preparing another missile launching,
perhaps by Feb. 16, the birthday of the North Korean leader, Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Another North Korean rocket soaring over Japan would be a major
blow to the Agreed Framework, making Japan more reluctant than ever
to help pay for nuclear reactors for North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A broader problem seems to be that American and North Korean
officials are increasingly disillusioned with each other and with
the prospective benefits of the Agreed Framework.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strong frustration among a lot of people that
North Korea is acting very strangely,'' said Kongdan Oh, a North
Korea specialist at the Institute for Defense Analyses in
Washington. ``It's like North Korea and the U.S. are trying to
dance together, and North Korea is trying to break the legs of its
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has been particularly vehement lately in denouncing
the United States, relentlessly biting the hand that is wondering
whether to feed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will be reduced to ashes and will no longer
exist, if they ignite the train of war,'' the North Korean official
news agency reported last week. And recent headlines in North
Korean official newspapers included ``U.S. imperialist aggressors
will be unable to avoid annihilating strikes'' and ``If U.S.
imperialists dare to pounce upon us, we will wipe them out from
this planet for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the growing militarization was the North Korean
government's New Year's message, which called on citizens to ``love
rifles, earnestly learn military affairs and turn the whole country
into an impregnable fortress.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to figure out what to do and build a more
bipartisan policy, Clinton has called on William S. Perry, the
former defense secretary, to review American policy toward North
Korea and offer suggestions. But unless North Korea shows signs of
conciliation, Perry may have trouble breaking the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have modest hope,'' James T. Laney, a former American
ambassador to South Korea, said of Perry's task. ``It's modest not
because of him, but because of 45 years of troubles we've been
having with North Korea.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It had all the ingredients of a fairy-tale romance.
They are from ethnic working-class families but attended an Ivy
League school, entering Columbia University at the same time, in
the fall of 1989. He becomes a two-time all-Ivy League wide
receiver in football and makes the dean's list; she is an
all-academic Ivy point guard in basketball. They meet, don't
connect, then fall in love after they happen to take a course
together as juniors, History of Ancient Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, he remains in New York to do research at a
local hospital, she travels to Europe to play pro basketball for a
season in Austria. They carry on a long-distance relationship, but
when she returns to New York, he is off to the University of North
Carolina to study for a Ph.D. in biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are bound, as the poets say, in their hearts. They
arrange to see each other with 21-day-advance plane reservations,
for more inexpensive fares. Finally, at age 27, they decide to
marry this July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen, at 5 feet 6{ inches, blonde and blue-eyed, buys a
wedding dress but cannot reveal the details of it (``an old Irish
superstition,'' she says). Mike, dark-haired and a strapping 6-2
and 185 pounds, will wear a black tuxedo, and endure the relatives'
tapping of glasses with silverware, indicating he must kiss the
bride _ an Italian custom.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Mike Sardo and Kathleen Johnson were to be wed in
the backyard of her parents' two-bedroom house in Scarborough,
Maine, but the site was recently switched to a nearby church,
which, among other things, would lend easier access for Mike's
wheelchair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last April, out of the blue, Mike began to feel
weak. On a Saturday afternoon, he had returned home from the gym in
Chapel Hill, N.C., after working out in his regular routine,
lifting weights and running five miles through the streets. In his
apartment, he felt a terrible pain in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like someone twisting something in my spine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At first he was told by doctors that it was probably just a back
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me these huge horse pills,'' he said. ``Didn't
help.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he was admitted to the emergency room. Doctors
decided because of his low blood count to keep him in the hospital
for a battery of tests, including a bone marrow biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   That night Mike spoke with Kathleen by telephone and told her
about the tests. He said he was short of breath, sometimes having
to stop after walking only 10 feet, and the pain in his back was
excruciating. The test results would be learned the next day, May
2.
</P>
<P>
   When Kathleen hung up the phone with Mike from the hospital, she
was puzzled at his condition, and worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike always had such a high threshold of pain,'' she recalled.
``I remember him suffering injuries from football _ like broken
ribs _ and just going on, never complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Kathleen had dreams for the future _ Mike wants to be
on the faculty of a university and teach and do research in biology
or biochemistry, Kathleen hopes to get a Ph.D. in women's studies
and create women's studies courses for high schools. In the
meantime, though, they have been struggling financially in the
early stages of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   So late the next morning, when Mike was wheeled back into his
room in the University of North Carolina Hospital after taking
blood tests, he was surprised to see Kathleen sitting beside his
empty bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing here?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't think I'd let you stay in the hospital by yourself,
did you?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it must have cost you a fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a schoolteacher,'' she said, ``I've got money to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, they got the results of the tests. The
news was not good. ``You have a rare case of acute lymphatic
leukemia,'' Mike was told. ``Cancer in the spine.''
</P>
<P>
   He was stunned, and disbelieving. ``I never imagined something
like that could happen to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he began to sort it out. ``I thought that there'd be
chemotherapy and radiation and I'd get through it,'' Mike said.
``I'd done research in cancer and just realized that it was a freak
accident, that some cells went haywire. I figured I'd be all right
after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen wasn't sure what to think. She knew, though, what she
was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They had planned for Kathleen to move in with Mike, but later in
the year. ``Well,'' he said, leaning forward to kiss her, ``now
we'll be in the same area code again.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter for Mike and Kathleen has been a big part of their
lives together. Which is the way they came to enjoy each other, the
way they get through these days _ and nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was distinctive on campus,'' Kathleen said, ``because
he'd always wear shorts _ even in wintertime. Coat and shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was warm in the classrooms,'' Mike explained. ``She'd
always wear a pretty hat, usually a red or a black woolen hat with
a little brim, but they didn't cover her ears. She'd wear them just
because they'd match her sweater or coat. Wouldn't keep her warm.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the holidays, they returned home from North Carolina to
visit their parents, Kathleen to Maine, Mike to Long Island, and
then met up in Mike's parents' home in Bethpage, where they would
spend the turn of the year, before returning to Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's leukemia is in remission, but early next week he and
Kathleen will go to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan to see if doctors there can unravel the mystery of why
his legs are in their present condition _ of whether cancer is at
the root of it. His legs fill with fluid and are so heavy that _
along with loss of strength in his upper body _ he cannot lift them
to move from bed to chair.
</P>
<P>
   At his parents' home now, Mike, nearly bald after chemotherapy
treatments, lay in a bed under blue covers beside the bay window in
the family living room and adorned with bright Christmas
decorations. Kathleen was seated nearby, her hair longer than
shoulder length, and wore a purple turtleneck sweater, jeans and
thick-soled black boots. The couple banter easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met when we were juniors,'' Kathleen said. ``And I saw him
right after the Harvard game and complimented him on having played
well. He said, `Thanks,' and blew me off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't blow you off,'' he protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he was upset that they had lost,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met when we were freshmen,'' he said, and then turned to a
guest in the room. ``But she doesn't remember. My roommate had
wanted to date her. Didn't happen, though. I remember it because I
remember she was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   In their senior year, Kathleen helped pay tuition by checking
identification cards in the school's Dodge Physical Fitness Center
on weekday mornings. Mike used to watch game films in the mornings
or get his various injuries worked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come by and talk to her before going to class,'' Mike
said. ``She was a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got to know Mike,'' Kathleen said, ``I found him to be
the kindest guy I'd ever met. He never brags, and he's got so much
to brag about. Like when we first started dating, he never talked
about himself. I'd have guys who'd practically read their resumes
to me. Not Mike. And he's funny. Nice looking, too, which doesn't
hurt.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen taught history to inner-city high-school girls at St.
Michael's Academy in the Bronx until Mike became ill. After moving
in with Mike, she managed to get a teaching job at a middle school
in Raleigh, 45 miles from Chapel Hill. Before leaving for work in
the morning, Kathleen prepares breakfast for Mike and puts it at
his bedside, and then leaves school in time to feed him a late
lunch. He uses a catheter. His father, John, a carpenter and
bricklayer who has a small construction crew, has built a ramp into
his Chapel Hill apartment to enable access for Mike's wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Her salary, plus Mike's $14,000 grant from the university, and
as much help as their parents can manage _ they are both
schoolteachers _ has put a drain on all of them financially and
emotionally. They need home nursing care when Kathleen is at work.
Other expenses not covered by insurance are mounting.
</P>
<P>
   A fund was started by John Reeves, the director of athletics at
Columbia; Wally Halas, the former men's basketball coach at
Columbia and current associate director of the Institute for
International Sport, based at the University of Rhode Island, and
Tony Apallaro, a former Columbia baseball player and classmate of
Mike's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the same hometown as Kathleen _ Worcester, Mass.,''
Halas said. (The Johnsons still live part time in Worcester and
teach elementary school nearby.) ``I knew her family _ her dad,
Bob, was a fine basketball player at Fitchburg State. And I got to
know Mike at Columbia. Two wonderful kids, from lunch-pail
families. I mean, they both worked hard to get the grades to go to
Columbia and worked hard every day to improve themselves once they
were there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sardo is the first in his immediate family to attend
college. ``And now,'' Halas added, ``they're in this thing. It's a
tough blow, but maybe they can take something from what they
learned in sports. Coaches always say you have to fight through a
hard situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike's mind drifts periodically to his days as a football
player, remembering the good games with pleasure, such as catching
13 passes against Cornell to set a Columbia record for receptions,
or the following week against Brown making a 40-yard touchdown
catch in the third quarter to put the Lions ahead in a game they
went on to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of some of the bad games, games that we either lost or
in which I didn't do so well, like when we were down by 7 points to
Harvard and had a chance to tie at the end of the game, and there
was a mix-up on a fourth-down pass pattern,'' he said. ``I replay
those. When I do'' _ he smiled _ ``the results always improve. But
I also think how strange it is, how you can be seemingly healthy at
one point, and very quickly it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kathleen says that Mike is good at any sport, he disputes
it. ``I've had to work at all of them,'' he said. ``But this thing
can get very frustrating. When you can't be independent. When you
can't get into the chair from the bed by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   From May to early September last year, Mike was weak and unsure
of his footing, but he was able to be relatively independent. That
changed on Labor Day when, he said, ``my legs stopped working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stand without holding onto something,'' he said.
``It has continued that way since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike almost never gets mad,'' Kathleen said, smiling. ``The
only times he does is when he can't do something he could do even a
week earlier. Like get into a chair by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I curse and scream,'' Mike said. ``I have to vent. It
takes about five minutes. And I'm back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Kathleen do in those moments? ``I leave the room,''
she said. ``When it gets quiet in there, I go back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' Mike said, ``we laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels bad that she has to serve virtually as a nurse,
helping him even in indiscreet moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a good patient,'' she said. ``I want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest things to deal with, Kathleen said, is to see
Mike make some progress, then regress.
</P>
<P>
   ``After solving one problem,'' she said, ``there just seems to
be another one, and another. There's an infection, a blood
transfusion, one leg swells, then the other. And when we're alone
in the middle of the night, and something happens, it's so
maddening because we aren't sure if we're doing the right thing.
And at those points I feel overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the night he began to shake violently and sweat in his
chair. She moved him into the bed, and he continued shaking. She
brought water, applied cold compresses. And then he passed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling so tired, so frustrated,'' she said, ``and I sat
down and began to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   But later, always, she added, ``We're able to laugh again.''
</P>
<P>
   They also argue, which is one of the sustaining elements of
their loving relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposite in so many ways,'' Kathleen said. ``He's from
New York, I'm from Massachusetts. He's a Knick fan, I'm a Celtic
fan. He's Yankees, I'm Red Sox, he's Jets, I'm for the Patriots. He
loves junk food, and I'm into health foods. And our families are so
different. My family is Irish and kind of low-key and quiet. His
family is Italian and, when I first came around, I thought they
were hollering at each other, but I learned that they're just
having a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   And the couple are competitive. ``But I'm super-competitive,''
Kathleen said.
</P>
<P>
   Once they played one-on-one basketball. ``I'm not really a
basketball player, but I won,'' Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him win,'' Kathleen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't having my best day, and besides, I knew you'd be
upset if you lost to a girl. Big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody who majored in history ought to get it straight,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``History has many sides _ it depends on who you talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit I backed you into the basket _ but when we played
shooting games you crushed me,'' he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   And then Mike told a story of when the two went to a bar last
summer in Chapel Hill that has a regulation basket inside. Kathleen
was shooting free throws and two guys came by and called ``next.''
Ground rules are that you relinquish your place when you miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many have you made in a row,'' one of the guys said,
``four or five?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about 68,'' Kathleen said.
</P>
<P>
   And she had.
</P>
<P>
   Mike was watching nearby. ``Then Kathleen hit about five more in
a row and quit,'' he recalled. ``These guys were watching with
their eyes wide.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though the future husband and wife have their rooting and ethnic
differences, the families appear to have no such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathleen's family loves Mike,'' said Tony Apallaro, a former
college roommate of Mike's and still one of his best friends, ``and
the same is true for Mike's family about Kathleen. And Mike's
illness, and how Kathleen has responded, seems to have even brought
everyone closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Kathleen hope that by July the mysteries of his leg
problems will be solved and that he will be walking again, or at
least regain much of his independence.
</P>
<P>
   And their immediate plans after the wedding? ``A honeymoon, of
course,'' Kathleen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Charlotte,'' said Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``More like San Francisco,'' said Kathleen, resisting Mike's
little joke, ``or Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike, after all, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, pulling the blue cover higher on his chest,
``we could use a nice change of scenery.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: U.S. STILL BAFFLED; SADDAM STILL BATTERED BUT UNBOWED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly eight years after the 1991 Persian Gulf War
started, Saddam Hussein is still shooting at U.S. pilots and the
United States still has no clear strategy for defeating him.
</P>
<P>
   Starving Iraq has not subverted Saddam. Striking at his army and
his spies with cruise missiles has not toppled him. Sanctions have
slowed but never stopped his drive to build nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As ordinary Iraqis scrounge for food and medicine, Saddam is
scouring the world for tools to build new weapons. He may be as
close to building a nuclear weapon _ perhaps closer _ than he was
in 1991, U.S. experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the U.N. weapons inspectors gone from Iraq and
unlikely to return, he is free to build biological and chemical
weapons without the world looking over his shoulder. The U.N.
inspectors say he can rebuild his biological and chemical programs
by June. His army, while bedraggled, stands. But the global
coalition arrayed against him in the Gulf War has been badly
frayed. The United States and Britain are its only steadfast
members.
</P>
<P>
   The United States lacks any coherent plan beyond its policy of
``containment-plus'' _ keeping the threat Saddam poses confined
within Iraq's borders, while trying to organize the hopelessly
disarrayed Iraqi opposition. Few in the administration have hopes
that U.S. support can build an Iraqi force capable of attacking
Baghdad. It is increasingly clear that nothing short of a coup, an
all-out war or a popular uprising will end the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton administration officials, all of them speaking on
the condition of anonymity, are now taking a very long view on
Iraq, and suggesting that patience is a strategy in itself.
``Containment doesn't bring about a decisive resolution quickly,''
said one White House official. ``It's unsatisfying and ungratifying
by its nature. But 40 years of containing the Soviets in the Cold
War paid off. You've got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes, Saddam, freed of U.N. weapons inspectors,
can concentrate on building weapons to blackmail, terrorize or even
attack his neighbors or U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, private
analysts and some U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's initial damage assessments after the four-day
bombing campaign it called ``Desert Fox,'' in which more than $400
million in cruise missiles fell on Iraqi targets, suggest that
Iraq's goal of building missiles to deliver weapons of mass
destruction may have been set back by a year.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not show any damage to factories that can produce
the ingredients and components for those weapons. Iraq began
emptying many of those buildings well before the missiles started
falling, U.S. military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the buildings hit seem to have marginal value,'' said
Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said the
initial assertions of significant damage inflicted on Iraq appeared
to be ``an awkward combination of propaganda and complete
rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombardment did nothing to stop Iraq's drive to build
biological and chemical weapons, said Scott Ritter, the weapons
inspector who resigned to protest what he called weak U.S. support
for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say Saddam's pursuit of a nuclear bomb was not
slowed by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is closer now to building a nuclear weapon than he was in
January 1991,'' the month the Gulf War began, said David Albright,
president of the Institute for Science and International Security
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who served as a nuclear-weapons inspector in Iraq, is
now working with a scientist who defected from Iraq's
nuclear-weapons program, Khidhir Hamza. They say they believe that
Iraq could build a nuclear bomb within two or three years _ or two
or three months, if Iraqi spies can obtain highly enriched uranium
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``With less fear of getting caught, Saddam has more incentive to
pursue a bomb,'' Albright said. ``He knows Russian machine tools,
technology, and people can be obtained. I'm increasingly
pessimistic. Without inspectors, I don't see how we can get warning
in time to stop Iraq from building a bomb. Our eyes and ears are so
much reduced, it might take a year or two to detect a nuclear
program. The clock is ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said there still is no coherent U.S.
plan to deal with the Iraqi regime. ``I was hoping we were in the
process of developing a foreign policy toward Iraq,'' he said.
``It's still very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to put a comprehensive plan together and part of
that is building up a legitimate government in exile,'' he said.
``We've got to force them to meet, to gather, to come up with
something. Other countries in the region would rather we go in and
find an Iraqi general. But each country has its favorite
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has found that Iraqi general. So U.S. policy makers are
praying for a spontaneous revolt within the Iraqi army to rid the
world of Saddam. The hope was best expressed last week by Gen.
Anthony C. Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has growing internal problems,'' Zinni said in an
interview. ``I couldn't right now measure that. We don't have
enough insight. But we just see signs that's beginning to fray more
and more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am careful how I say this, because I don't want to
overstate, because I just don't know for sure,'' he said. ``But I
sense that his internal stability is much weaker than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no known evidence that any revolt is brewing. In the
past, Saddam has successfully crushed internal dissent by killing
or jailing his opponents. ``He's always had an iron grip,'' Zinni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni, who would ultimately have to command any U.S. military
action aimed to support an Iraqi uprising, has openly dismissed the
idea of organizing an Iraqi resistance under the ``Iraq Liberation
Act'' signed by President Clinton last month, which seeks to spend
$97 million making the Iraqi opposition a potent force.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, acknowledges that
the opposition is ``weak and divided.'' Brownback, who strongly
supports the liberation act, concedes that the present leaders of
the Iraqi opposition are flawed. ``Every one of them has warts,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military, political and diplomatic force has battered Iraqi
citizens, with whom the United States says it has no quarrel. They
are still suffering the consequences of the Persian Gulf War and
its harsh aftermath. Denis Halliday, former coordinator of U.N.
humanitarian programs in Iraq, said: ``We are losing six to seven
thousand children a month, dying every month, as a consequence of
the sanctions. This is a very severe punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is little evidence that the latest attack punished
Saddam in any way that could change his behavior or alter Iraqi
politics. On the contrary, Cordesman said, he now ``has shown the
Iraqis, the gulf and the world that he can survive another U.S.
attack.'' Worse, he said, ``an end to meaningful inspections and
monitoring probably offsets Iraq's physical losses'' from the
recent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Iraq can go on building weapons in secret, and can
rebuild what it lost, perhaps Saddam's boasts about having won this
latest confrontation are not altogether empty.

ANALYSIS: U.S. STILL BAFFLED; SADDAM STILL BATTERED BUT UNBOWED

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly eight years after the 1991 Persian Gulf War
started, Saddam Hussein is still shooting at U.S. pilots and the
United States still has no clear strategy for defeating him.
</P>
<P>
   Starving Iraq has not subverted Saddam. Striking at his army and
his spies with cruise missiles has not toppled him. Sanctions have
slowed but never stopped his drive to build nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As ordinary Iraqis scrounge for food and medicine, Saddam is
scouring the world for tools to build new weapons. He may be as
close to building a nuclear weapon _ perhaps closer _ than he was
in 1991, U.S. experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the U.N. weapons inspectors gone from Iraq and
unlikely to return, he is free to build biological and chemical
weapons without the world looking over his shoulder. The U.N.
inspectors say he can rebuild his biological and chemical programs
by June. His army, while bedraggled, stands. But the global
coalition arrayed against him in the Gulf War has been badly
frayed. The United States and Britain are its only steadfast
members.
</P>
<P>
   The United States lacks any coherent plan beyond its policy of
``containment-plus'' _ keeping the threat Saddam poses confined
within Iraq's borders, while trying to organize the hopelessly
disarrayed Iraqi opposition. Few in the administration have hopes
that U.S. support can build an Iraqi force capable of attacking
Baghdad. It is increasingly clear that nothing short of a coup, an
all-out war or a popular uprising will end the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton administration officials, all of them speaking on
the condition of anonymity, are now taking a very long view on
Iraq, and suggesting that patience is a strategy in itself.
``Containment doesn't bring about a decisive resolution quickly,''
said one White House official. ``It's unsatisfying and ungratifying
by its nature. But 40 years of containing the Soviets in the Cold
War paid off. You've got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But as time passes, Saddam, freed of U.N. weapons inspectors,
can concentrate on building weapons to blackmail, terrorize or even
attack his neighbors or U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, private
analysts and some U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's initial damage assessments after the four-day
bombing campaign it called ``Desert Fox,'' in which more than $400
million in cruise missiles fell on Iraqi targets, suggest that
Iraq's goal of building missiles to deliver weapons of mass
destruction may have been set back by a year.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not show any damage to factories that can produce
the ingredients and components for those weapons. Iraq began
emptying many of those buildings well before the missiles started
falling, U.S. military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the buildings hit seem to have marginal value,'' said
Anthony H. Cordesman, a military analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said the
initial assertions of significant damage inflicted on Iraq appeared
to be ``an awkward combination of propaganda and complete
rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombardment did nothing to stop Iraq's drive to build
biological and chemical weapons, said Scott Ritter, the weapons
inspector who resigned to protest what he called weak U.S. support
for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say Saddam's pursuit of a nuclear bomb was not
slowed by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is closer now to building a nuclear weapon than he was in
January 1991,'' the month the Gulf War began, said David Albright,
president of the Institute for Science and International Security
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who served as a nuclear-weapons inspector in Iraq, is
now working with a scientist who defected from Iraq's
nuclear-weapons program, Khidhir Hamza. They say they believe that
Iraq could build a nuclear bomb within two or three years _ or two
or three months, if Iraqi spies can obtain highly enriched uranium
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``With less fear of getting caught, Saddam has more incentive to
pursue a bomb,'' Albright said. ``He knows Russian machine tools,
technology, and people can be obtained. I'm increasingly
pessimistic. Without inspectors, I don't see how we can get warning
in time to stop Iraq from building a bomb. Our eyes and ears are so
much reduced, it might take a year or two to detect a nuclear
program. The clock is ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., said there still is no coherent U.S.
plan to deal with the Iraqi regime. ``I was hoping we were in the
process of developing a foreign policy toward Iraq,'' he said.
``It's still very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to put a comprehensive plan together and part of
that is building up a legitimate government in exile,'' he said.
``We've got to force them to meet, to gather, to come up with
something. Other countries in the region would rather we go in and
find an Iraqi general. But each country has its favorite
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has found that Iraqi general. So U.S. policy makers are
praying for a spontaneous revolt within the Iraqi army to rid the
world of Saddam. The hope was best expressed last week by Gen.
Anthony C. Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has growing internal problems,'' Zinni said in an
interview. ``I couldn't right now measure that. We don't have
enough insight. But we just see signs that's beginning to fray more
and more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am careful how I say this, because I don't want to
overstate, because I just don't know for sure,'' he said. ``But I
sense that his internal stability is much weaker than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no known evidence that any revolt is brewing. In the
past, Saddam has successfully crushed internal dissent by killing
or jailing his opponents. ``He's always had an iron grip,'' Zinni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni, who would ultimately have to command any U.S. military
action aimed to support an Iraqi uprising, has openly dismissed the
idea of organizing an Iraqi resistance under the ``Iraq Liberation
Act'' signed by President Clinton last month, which seeks to spend
$97 million making the Iraqi opposition a potent force.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, acknowledges that
the opposition is ``weak and divided.'' Brownback, who strongly
supports the liberation act, concedes that the present leaders of
the Iraqi opposition are flawed. ``Every one of them has warts,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military, political and diplomatic force has battered Iraqi
citizens, with whom the United States says it has no quarrel. They
are still suffering the consequences of the Persian Gulf War and
its harsh aftermath. Denis Halliday, former coordinator of U.N.
humanitarian programs in Iraq, said: ``We are losing six to seven
thousand children a month, dying every month, as a consequence of
the sanctions. This is a very severe punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is little evidence that the latest attack punished
Saddam in any way that could change his behavior or alter Iraqi
politics. On the contrary, Cordesman said, he now ``has shown the
Iraqis, the gulf and the world that he can survive another U.S.
attack.'' Worse, he said, ``an end to meaningful inspections and
monitoring probably offsets Iraq's physical losses'' from the
recent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Iraq can go on building weapons in secret, and can
rebuild what it lost, perhaps Saddam's boasts about having won this
latest confrontation are not altogether empty.

OREGON FALTERS ON A NEW PATH TO HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Nearly five years ago, Oregon began putting an
idea to work that seemed both harsh and humane: In return for
health insurance paid by the government, the poor would be required
to join health maintenance organizations and have their care
rationed.
</P>
<P>
   Most tonsillectomies, infertility treatment, hernia surgery and
removal of bunions would be denied. The program would support
preventive and hospice care and, starting this month,
doctor-assisted suicide, but rule out heroic intervention to
stretch a life for a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the state calculated, it could afford to provide
basic care for all the poor _ the goal of universal coverage that
eluded President Clinton four years ago. With rationing, Oregon
became the sole American outpost of an approach to care that is
routine in most developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oregon Health Plan is hitting roadblocks. The state has
abandoned its promise of universal care. Doctors routinely find
ways to get around the rationing. And conflicts with federal
Medicaid regulators have impeded efforts to deny more treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A requirement that employers insure all their workers or
contribute to a fund to cover them died early on. Spending for the
plan climbed to $2.1 billion in the 1997-to-1999 state budget
period from $1.7 billion in the 1995-to-1997 period. Higher
cigarette taxes have not offset the increase, requiring more money
from the state's general fund, and additional economic pressures
await this year.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``rationing care, not people,'' in the
sloganeering leading up to the plan's start in 1994, has been
ignored by physicians. ``The idea of this being a rationing system
is really bunk,'' said Jim Kronenberg, associate executive director
of the Oregon Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Enrolling participants in HMOs has failed to deliver expected
savings. Moreover, the practice of managed care, with doctors,
clinics and hospitals working together with HMOs to control patient
care, is breaking down in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the poor, access to care has become more difficult.
For many others, eligibility has become harder to establish and to
hold. A program that was once free now charges premiums of $7.50 to
$28 a month for a family of four, and purges from its rolls those
who do not pay.
</P>
<P>
   There are 340,000 Oregonians covered by the plan, and 350,000
still uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In his next budget, Gov. John Kitzhaber is proposing tougher
screening of applicants and stretching the time it takes to approve
applications from a day to at least a month. Members of the
Legislature, controlled by Republicans, are considering lowering
the income levels for eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back and revisit entry-level policy decisions,''
said Kitzhaber, the former emergency room physician who conceived
the program as president of the state Senate and rode it to
election as governor in 1994 after it took effect. He was easily
re-elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a pause to say: `Are the structures right? Are
our incentives right? Is it working?'' said Barney Speight,
administrator of the Office of Oregon Health Plan Policy and
Research, which oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is already clear: Health care for all cannot be
attained. Hersh Crawford, the state's director of medical
assistance programs, said: ``Our goal is to have zero people in
Oregon who are uninsured. I don't think we're going to make that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber said, ``If you could get to 5 or 6 percent'' of the
population, ``you could declare victory.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal, too, looks remote. ``Structurally, the plan is the
right approach,'' said Donald Sacco, president and chief executive
of Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state's biggest health
insurer and HMO company.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it has never provided what's needed to take adequate care
of the population,'' Sacco said. ``To get to the next increment,
we're going to have to spend more money, and to do that is a
question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the nation's health care, policy analysts
still call Oregon's program innovative and promising. From 15
percent, the state says the uninsured population has dropped in
five years to 11 percent. The national average has remained about
16 percent. Other states have looked at the program with interest,
but want to see more results before experimenting with a change as
radical as Oregon's.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the plan's difficulties, groups with special
interests in care support the ideas behind it and in most respects
the way it works. Physicians, while irked about pressures on their
incomes, see no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly better than where we came from,'' said Dr.
Michael Bonazzola, chief medical officer of Physician Partners
Inc., a practice management company owned by physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration set the stage for the program five
years ago in waiving regulations restricting Medicaid coverage to
specific groups, primarily women and children on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   With Oregon's assurance that it could cover more people without
asking the federal government to increase its 60 percent subsidy of
Medicaid coverage, the Health Care Financing Administration
permitted coverage of everyone with income below the federal
poverty line, currently about $16,400 for a family of four and
$8,000 for a single adult.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's rationing begins with a ``prioritized list,'' developed
over years of intense deliberations, of 745 pairs of health
conditions and treatments. Those that save and prolong healthy
lives and prevent disease are at the top and cosmetic surgery,
weight-loss programs, most infertility treatment and conditions
that cure themselves, like colds, are at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature then drew a line across the list, with free care
allowed for conditions above the line and denied for conditions
below. Initially, it drew the line low, at No. 606, and it has
since raised it to No. 574, still low enough to have stirred few
complaints from physicians or consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the line becomes fuzzy in the physician's office. The plan
requires that family doctors admit all patients for diagnoses, and
doctors say they do what they feel they must to treat a patient
during the office visit.
</P>
<P>
   And when a patient is referred to a specialist, doctors can
skirt the rules by changing a diagnosis and moving a patient's
condition from below the line to above it.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Romm, a registered nurse and health services director for
Care Oregon, a nonprofit HMO that specializes in Medicaid patients,
takes the example of fibromyalgia, a chronic condition marked by
diffused bodily aches and pains. The cause is unknown, there is no
cure and it is below the rationing line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of patients who have this condition,'' Ms. Romm
said. In addition to counseling patients to exercise, which can
help, doctors find ways to prescribe physical therapy, which can
also help. ``Physicians game the system,'' she said. ``They want to
get some help for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacco of Regence said, ``If someone comes into the office with a
below-the-line issue, it's going to get treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the unauthorized care, however comforting, is
ineffective or marginal and contributes to the rising costs,
Kitzhaber said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also wants to raise the rationing line 10 more
notches, to No. 564. Among services he would deny are some repairs
of ligament damage to knees, treatment for contact dermatitis _
rashes from poison ivy or spills of household chemicals _ that
cures itself, and treatment for genital warts, which as No. 574 on
the list would be the first to go.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the line, however, he faces intense federal scrutiny
because some procedures typically paid for by Medicaid would not be
covered. The Health Care Financing Administration, he complains,
``would rather have us keep the line and serve fewer people'' and
in that way preserve the practice of rationing people, not care.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, the state's medical assistance director, said
negotiations over changing a single item go on for months.
``There's a lot of suspicion of states like Oregon that want to
deviate from traditional Medicaid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent hours arguing with HCFA about diaper rash,'' he said,
before it was excluded from coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Mim DeParle, administrator of the HCFA, called the
plan ``a very interesting experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised that some other states haven't tried
it,'' Ms. DeParle said.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was no policy favoring conventional Medicaid
coverage over Oregon's approach. ``I think what the state would
like to do is to make these decisions and do it unilaterally,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency is bound by Congress to provide a defined set of
benefits to people who receive Medicaid. ``We have to make sure
that the procedures that are being covered are appropriate and that
they are not leaving out things that should be covered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also has a responsibility for public health, so
discussions over genital warts, a widespread, sexually transmitted
virus that can be treated but not cured, will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes aside, said W. David Helms, president of the Alpha
Center, a health care research organization in Washington, Oregon
has done something unique in tackling the taboo against rationing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we still face that issue, and we've ignored
it,'' Helms said. The Oregon program, he said, ``is how government
at its best ought to work.''

GAPS IN SEA LAWS SHIELD POLLUTION BY CRUISE LINES
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Shortly after 10 a.m. on Oct. 25, 1994, radar and
infrared sensors aboard a Coast Guard jet over the Atlantic off
Puerto Rico detected a possible oil discharge. As the aircraft
swept low, its crew saw a long oil slick trailing a ship entering
the San Juan harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel was the largest cruise ship in the world then, Royal
Caribbean's Sovereign of the Seas, a floating resort the length of
three football fields. When Coast Guard inspectors boarded the ship
in port, its officers denied discharging any oil.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious, the Coast Guard and Justice Department opened what
would grow into a four-year inquiry leading to the discovery of a
fleet-wide conspiracy within Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., to save
millions of dollars by dumping oily waste into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Last June the cruise line pleaded guilty to conspiracy and
obstruction of justice, admitted that its ships had rigged pipes to
bypass antipollution equipment, agreed to pay a record $9 million
in fines and promised the dumping would never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the next month it did. The Nordic Empress,
another Royal Caribbean ship, was discovered discharging oily waste
and creating false records to cover it up. Moreover, the new
dumping incident occurred even though the company knew it remained
under federal investigation for other discharge incidents.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the criminal investigation, plus new details
about the latest incident, shows how difficult it is for
authorities to police the booming cruise industry as it launches
ever larger ships, and how determined the industry is to make
itself exempt from American regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The review offers strong evidence that the dumping of oil and
other wastes by cruise ships, which can create lasting pollution
problems in oceans and coastal areas, is more common than
previously known. And it reveals an influential industry that has
assembled an international lobbying force to plead its case. Royal
Caribbean's included two former U.S. Attorneys General, Elliot L.
Richardson and Benjamin R. Civiletti.
</P>
<P>
   In defending itself, Royal Caribbean, a Liberian corporation
with its headquarters in Miami, made what the Justice Department
described as an unprecedented claim: that a private company doing
business in the United States was immune from criminal prosecution
because its ships fly foreign flags.
</P>
<P>
   All major cruise ship owners _ including Disney, which launched
its first ship, the 2,200-passenger Magic, last summer _ sail their
ships under foreign flags. By registering with so-called flag
countries in exchange for substantial fees, the owners avoid
American corporate taxes and can pay lower wages to foreign crews.
Financial documents show that Royal Caribbean saves approximately
$30 million a year in U.S. taxes by registering its ships in Norway
and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the savings come at the price of muddied
jurisdiction and lax enforcement by the flag countries, one of the
most prominent of which, Liberia, has been devastated by ethnic
warfare and divided government most of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   One federal study found that foreign countries took action in
only two of 111 dumping cases referred to them by the United
States. Generally, flag countries have jurisdiction over ships in
international waters and the United States asserts jurisdiction in
its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   These questions are raised just as concern is deepening that the
industry's explosive growth is posing new threats to the
environment, from the popular Caribbean to the pristine coastline
of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean officials said the company has instituted tough
new environmental compliance procedures. But the company did not
succeed in having the case against it closed with its guilty plea.
Instead, the company's discharge practices remain under
investigation by federal grand juries in New York, Los Angeles,
Miami and Anchorage, according to a senior company official and its
own recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the country's biggest ocean pollution
investigation have been public since the company's admission of
guilt. But the full extent of the dumping scheme, and the existence
of the lobbying effort, was pieced together from court records in
San Juan and Miami and from interviews with federal officials and
current and former Royal Caribbean employees.
</P>
<P>
   The newest cruise ships carry 2,000 or more passengers and up to
1,000 crew members. Disposing of the waste they generate costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year per ship, which is one
reason, authorities say, that crews sometimes disregard pollution
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years other cruise lines have been fined at least six
times for dumping oil and refuse. Last summer the Holland America
Line, a division of the Carnival Corp., pleaded guilty to
discharging oily waste in Alaska's Inside Passage and paid $2
million in penalties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word that the Sovereign of the Seas had discharged oily waste in
October 1994 reached the Justice Department in Washington the day
after the incident. In three inspections that October day, the
Coast Guard had seen oil in pipes and elsewhere indicating that
oily waste had been sent directly overboard. Most convincingly, lab
tests matched oil from the ship to a sample taken from the slick by
a Coast Guard boat.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean argued that the discharge was an isolated
oversight. But Richard A. Udell, a career prosecutor in the Justice
Department's environmental section, found indications to the
contrary in Coast Guard databases.
</P>
<P>
   The records showed that more than a year before, on Feb. 1,
1993, a Coast Guard jet had spotted an oil slick behind the Nordic
Empress, off the Bahamas en route to Miami. A videotape taken from
the jet showed a slick that appeared to be a perfect match to the
videotaped discharge from the Sovereign of the Seas. The Nordic
Empress' officers had also denied discharging anything.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, 1994, inspectors had videotaped the engine room of
the Sovereign of the Seas in San Juan; four days later, when the
ship arrived in Miami, a second videotape was taken. Comparing
them, Udell noticed that a set of pipes present on Oct. 25 was gone
on Oct. 29. Government experts determined that the pipes had
bypassed a critical antipollution device known as an oily water
separator.
</P>
<P>
   On any ship, oil drips from machinery and collects along with
sea water in the bilges. The separator filters out oil so the water
can be discharged and the oil stored for disposal in port. Each
time the separator is operated, the event must be noted in the
ship's oil record book. The Coast Guard relies on the books to
monitor compliance with pollution laws.
</P>
<P>
   The oil record book of the Sovereign of the Seas contained no
record of a discharge. Later, a ship's engineer testified before a
federal grand jury that there had been none. The officers of the
Nordic Empress had made the same claim in 1993, supported by their
oil record book.
</P>
<P>
   It took several months, but Coast Guard investigators eventually
discovered similar bypass systems on the Nordic Empress and other
Royal Caribbean ships. They began to doubt the authenticity of the
oil logs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by the evidence, witnesses changed their stories.
They testified that Royal Caribbean ships regularly bypassed
pollution devices and dumped oily waste overboard, usually at night
to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer from the Song of America testified that the oily
water separator was operated so infrequently that it did not work
when he did try to use it. They also admitted that the oil record
books were falsified so routinely that they were known among many
engineers as Eventyrbok, which means fairy tale book in Norwegian.
</P>
<P>
   As for the disappearing pipes on the Sovereign of the Seas,
engineers said they had been ordered to cut them up on the voyage
from San Juan to Miami and drop them in a Dumpster, according to
court records.
</P>
<P>
   Oily water separators are notoriously troublesome to operate.
But company engineers testified that the bypass systems, which had
been in operation on some ships since 1990, were partly the result
of the company's bonus incentives. Membranes for the separator cost
as much as $80,000 a year per ship and disposing of waste oil in
port can cost $300,000 a year. By saving this money, a ship's
officers could receive bigger year-end bonuses for staying under
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The savings was the government's strongest evidence that senior
management may have known of the conspiracy, said government
officials involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators were stymied in following the trail because
crucial witnesses, all foreign employees of Royal Caribbean, had
left the company and either returned home or taken jobs with other
cruise lines outside the United States, the officials said. No
senior company officials were charged.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence mounted, Royal Caribbean's lawyers tried to reach a
deal. People involved in the negotiations said that in the fall of
1996 the company offered to plead guilty to some charges and pay a
substantial fine. But the department rejected the offer and within
weeks prosecutors told company lawyers to expect a 35-count
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Civiletti, who was attorney general under President Carter, and
two of his law partners, Judson W. Starr and Joseph G. Block, both
former Justice Department environmental chiefs, had tried to
negotiate the plea bargain. Other former government officials
working for the company had lobbied the State Department and
Pentagon in an effort to persuade the Justice Department not to
file charges.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the lobbying and legal arguments was not to
refute the accusations, which would prove irrefutable, but to
dispute the authority of the United States to bring charges. The
former officials argued that asserting American jurisdiction
undermined international Law of the Sea and could lead other
nations to interfere with American vessels, particularly military
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior State and Pentagon officials agreed with the
international law argument, but in a later legal brief, the Justice
Department accused unnamed former government officials on Royal
Caribbean's payroll of providing incomplete and inaccurate
information in those private sessions, something company lawyers
deny.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-indictment review is not unusual in a major case, and in
this instance the Justice Department approved an indictment reduced
to 10 counts. On Dec. 11, 1996, the grand jury in San Juan indicted
Royal Caribbean and two engineers from the Sovereign of the Seas.
The indictment accused the company of conducting a fleet-wide
conspiracy to discharge oily waste illegally, but restricted most
of the counts to the Sovereign of the Seas. The inquiry into the
1993 Nordic Empress discharge was shifted to a federal grand jury
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Royal Caribbean's lobbying
played no role in reducing the number of counts. ``Like every other
case, the appropriate charges were based solely on the facts and
the law,'' said Myron Marlin, the department's chief spokesman.
``In the end, the prosecution produced two criminal convictions, a
record fine, and the case has had a ripple effect throughout the
industry, not to mention that the investigation is still
continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal maneuvering intensified after the indictment. The
company's team expanded beyond Civiletti and Richardson to include
four retired admirals, a former acting assistant attorney general,
a former Coast Guard commandant and a former deputy assistant
secretary for oceans at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these former officials filed affidavits saying the
United States could not charge the company under international law.
Some contacted former colleagues in a continuing effort to settle
the case, according to court records and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who was attorney general under President Nixon and
held other top government posts, sought meetings with high-level
administration officials and acknowledged raising the issue with
Thomas R. Pickering, the Under Secretary of State and an old
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned it briefly to Tom Pickering,'' Richardson said.
``The conversation was brief because the matter was in
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort was international. An influential Norwegian family
owns a large share of Royal Caribbean and its members helped enlist
the Norwegian government, people involved said. On March 12, 1997,
a delegation from the Norwegian Embassy delivered a diplomatic note
to the State Department seeking jurisdiction because the Sovereign
of the Seas flies a Norwegian flag. They met with Pickering and
other officials, people involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the prosecutors' steadfast contention that the United
States had jurisdiction, they believed another reason not to cede
authority was the poor record of flag countries on previous
pollution referrals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the State Department had reviewed 111 cases in which
accusations of cruise ships dumping garbage overboard had been
referred to flag countries. The study found that the countries
acknowledged receipt of the referral in only 35 cases and that the
only penalties were small fines in two cases. As a result, the
State Department halted referrals on dumping in U.S. territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic Empress had been in international waters when it was
discovered discharging oil in 1993, so the matter was referred to
Liberia because the ship flew a Liberian flag. Liberia accepted the
company's claims that no dumping occurred and asked the Coast Guard
to expunge the incident from its records, according to Liberian
records.
</P>
<P>
   Even two year later, after Royal Caribbean admitted lying about
the Nordic Empress discharge last June, Liberia decided no action
was necessary. The investigation was completed and closed, said
David Crede, chief of investigations for Liberian Services Inc., a
private company in Reston, Va., that is Liberia's agent for vessels
flying its flag. In the case of the Sovereign of the Seas, the
Norwegian Embassy said its officials had looked into the case and
decided that no action was warranted.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic Empress had discharged its waste in international
waters, but the ship had presented the Coast Guard in Miami with an
oil record book that omitted the discharge. So, on Feb. 19, 1998,
Royal Caribbean was indicted in Miami, not for dumping but on a
single count of making a false statement to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22 and 23, a pivotal hearing took place in federal
District Court in Miami in which the cruise line asked Judge Donald
M. Middlebrooks to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge in the San Juan case, Juan M. Perez-Gimenez,
had already rejected the company's claim that the United States
lacked jurisdiction and had ordered the case to trial in June.
</P>
<P>
   At the Miami hearing, Civiletti argued that the United States
had overreached its authority. He said that Liberia had
jurisdiction and that that country had determined there was
insufficient evidence of a crime. He also produced a surprise
diplomatic note from the Liberian Embassy in Washington to the
State Department asking that the case be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Udell countered that Royal Caribbean's false statement to the
Coast Guard, plus its extensive presence here, subjected the
company to American law. Although its ships fly various flags of
convenience, he said, ``Royal Caribbean is as much a part of Miami
as the Miami Dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   The company called Richardson as an expert witness, because he
had been the chief American negotiator at the UN conference that
led to the Law of the Sea treaty. He testified that only Liberia
could prosecute the discharge, and warned that the case would
undermine the navigational freedom established by the UN
convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson seemed less certain when the prosecutor, Thomas
Watts-Fitzgerald, asked whether his view would change if the ship
had produced a record required by the Coast Guard that contained a
misrepresentation. It might well, Richardson replied.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Judge Middlebrooks rejected the motion to dismiss,
ruling that the United States had authority to press charges
because of the false statement to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Losing on the law and faced with indisputable evidence, the
company had no choice. On June 3, Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty in
both cases and agreed to pay $9 million in fines. The government
called the violations so pervasive and longstanding that the
criminal conduct amounted to a routine business practice.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most plea bargains, this one did not end Royal
Caribbean's criminal liability. The company refused to yield to
government demands that it turn over the results of an internal
inquiry, citing fears that employees would refuse to cooperate in
future internal investigations. As a result, the company
acknowledged, additional grand juries are contemplating similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line struggled to put the episode behind it. ``We
deeply regret our role in polluting the marine environment and we
are particularly sorry for the attempts to conceal that
pollution,'' Jack Williams, the company president, said in a
statement. ``These acts were inexcusable, they were wrong and we
accept full responsibility for these violations.''
</P>
<P>
   But that effort hit a stunning shoal. On July 15, the company
notified the Coast Guard that engineers aboard the Nordic Empress
had tampered with pollution devices and discharged oily waste into
the ocean. The company said a junior engineer had reported it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Coast Guard questioned engineering personnel the next
day, it was like stepping back in time. The chief engineer, Michael
Psomadakis, a Greek citizen, denied that there had been a discharge
and presented an oil record book that supported him, according to
court records and a Coast Guard agent's affidavit. Psomadakis was
served with a grand jury subpoena on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the company held its own hearing and dismissed
Psomadakis and another engineer. On July 19, company personnel
escorted him to a Miami hotel to pick up his belongings for the
trip home to Greece. He was given his passport and plane ticket and
then simply walked out another exit, evading agents from the FBI
who were waiting to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy J. Wheatley, who was hired by Royal Caribbean last June as
senior vice president for safety and the environment, and William
K. Reilly, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, who joined the Royal Caribbean board last January, said in
interviews that the company had implemented a vigorous new
environmental compliance program under government supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he believed the company's management was committed
to cleaning up its past problems. ``Obviously everyone is chagrined
about what has happened and somewhat stunned by the seriousness of
the allegations,'' Reilly said. ``The Justice Department set out to
get Royal Caribbean's attention, and they got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wheatley said the latest incident showed that the system is
working, because a junior officer came forward and was supported by
management. ``We know we don't have a business if the oceans aren't
a beautiful place to go,'' Ms. Wheatley said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors were shocked. At a court hearing in September,
they said the conduct, which was under investigation, demonstrated
the difficulty in changing a pervasive culture of ingrained
criminal conduct.

U.S. JOB POSTING:   A KING TO OPPOSE SADDAM HUSSEIN
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-U.S.-ASSESS) 
(DW) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.S. officials are casting their nets wide to
find a credible opposition leader or perhaps a figurehead who might
lead Iraq after Saddam Hussein, meeting even with a man who would
be king.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent U.S. and British bombing of Iraq, State
Department and Pentagon officials met with Sharif Ali bin
al-Hussein, the 42-year-old heir to the throne of a short-lived
modern Iraqi monarchy that ended 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who leads the Constitutional Monarchy Movement, survived a
revolution in 1958 that toppled his cousin, the last king, Faisal
II. The king was killed, along with the crown prince, Abdullah.
Ali, then only 2 years old, was taken out of Iraq by his parents,
both of whom were also related to the royal families of Saudi
Arabia and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Ali's grandfather, the Emir of Mecca, was the uncle of Iraq's
first modern king, Faisal I, who had been handed the throne of Iraq
by the British in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, given a mandate to rule Iraq after the collapse of the
Turkish Ottoman Empire in World War I, quickly set about
establishing a parliamentary system in Iraq (also short-lived) and
decided to crown it with a constitutional monarchy. This, after
all, was Mesopotamia, home to some of the greatest monarchies of
ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, whose family went to Lebanon from Iraq and who now lives in
London, commands only a small movement, other Iraqi exiles say. But
he thinks nonetheless that the idea of a constitutional monarchy
still has resonance in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi monarchy would be a symbol around which all parts of
Iraq would be able to rally because we're not based on any single
constituency, nor are we a political party,'' Ali said in an
interview. ``What we look forward to is establishing democratic
institutions that would guarantee that all players in politics
would be able to participate as they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali, whose education was largely Western, has produced a plan
for a future Iraq that he calls a National Covenant. It would
restore an Islamic monarchy pledged to protect the human rights of
followers of all religions and create a free-market economic
system, a multiparty democracy and an independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the monarchy that achieved independence for Iraq from
the League of Nations mandate,'' he said. ``Iraq was the first Arab
nation to have independence. The legacy of the monarchs compared to
the republics that followed _ all of them dictatorships _ have made
people much more aware of the positive roles of the monarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Ali said, he sees his mission as helping to
bring a fractured exile opposition together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition is united on the goals of removing Saddam
Hussein and his regime and of bringing him to justice in front of
an international tribunal,'' he said. ``What we have to do is to
make our efforts more coordinated and more cooperative. The
political environment is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali said he left Washington believing that the Clinton
administration is serious about giving the Iraqi opposition
substantial help, but he agrees with other exiles that the job of
removing Saddam will have to be done by Iraqis inside Iraq. They,
Ali said, have often had unrealistic expectations about how much
the United States and Britain can or will do for them.
</P>
<P>
   History is littered with broken U.S. promises to Iraqis,
particularly to the Kurds in the north and Shiites in the south,
whose uprisings Washington often encouraged and then stood back and
watched be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When President Clinton says that he is looking forward to the
day of a new regime in Iraq, it is very encouraging to the
opposition to know that the only superpower in the world is now
willing to help to establish a democratic regime in Iraq,'' Ali
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Iraqis are in the opposition, basically,'' he said.
``From even the highest echelons, they are looking for a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he remains wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi people have the ability to overthrow the regime but
they need to know that if they carried this out, they would have
the support of the international community and that obstacles
wouldn't be put in their path,'' he said.

OHIO STATE STANDS READY IF NO. 1 SLOT IS AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The legendary Louisiana politician Huey Long could
have picked up a few pointers on politicking from Ohio State coach
John Cooper. Shortly after his team had beaten Texas A&AMP;M, 24-14, in
the Sugar Bowl at the Superdome on Jan. 1, Cooper was pushing his
team for the national championship in the event that Tennessee
falters against Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any argument if Tennessee wins and runs the
table,'' Cooper said. ``But if Tennessee plays sloppy and Florida
State wins, I think Ohio State can lay claim to being the best team
in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, part of Cooper's argument had been that Ohio State
(10-1) needed to dominate Texas A&AMP;M (11-3). Like a good politician,
he backed away from that part of his argument after the victory.
However, Cooper's position is strong. The Buckeyes will have
finished the season as strong as any other team if Tennessee loses.
</P>
<P>
   They were dominant against the Aggies for the first half Friday
night, scoring 21 points in six and a half minutes (one touchdown
was scored on a blocked punt that was returned 16 yards), before
lapsing into a stupor in the second half (1 for 3 on field-goal
attempts).
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mental mistakes,'' said Ohio State's Joe
Montgomery, who had nine carries for 96 yards and a touchdown.
``You look at the number of times that we could have scored and
it's very frustrating. But we still got the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close scoring opportunities came in the first half on
passes that quarterback Joe Germaine threw in the end zone to David
Boston _ the game's most valuable player with 11 catches for 105
yards. One of 25 yards was tipped away at the last second by the
Texas A&AMP;M cornerback Jason Webster; another of 36 yards was batted
down by cornerback Sedrick Curry. If those plays had gone for
scores, Ohio State would not have been worried about the Aggies
coming back in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   At the half, the Buckeyes were thinking about how they had led
Michigan State and appeared to have that game in hand, only to have
the Spartans come back and win, thereby ruining a perfect season
and derailing a clear path to the national championship. Cooper
reminded them that Texas A&AMP;M had stormed back against Kansas State
in the Big 12 Conference championship game, erasing a 27-12 deficit
in the last 9:20 to tie the score, 27-27, and win it, 36-33, in the
second overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper left his team with these words: ``Play as well as you're
capable of playing and if you're the better team then you'll win
the game. If they're the better team, they'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes went out and soon began the first stage of their
second-half folding act, missing field goals of 49 and 47 yards
and, committing 3 penalties worth 40 yards on an 11-play, 68-yard
scoring drive that pulled A&AMP;M to within 24-14 with 5:24 to play in
the third quarter. The Aggies' defense clamped down on the Buckeyes
in the second half, thanks in large part to linebacker Dat Nguyen,
the Lombardi Award winner who had 14 tackles (13 solo).
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing for the Buckeyes that Texas A&AMP;M's offense
was just as error-prone as they were. Most costly was a lateral by
quarterback Branndon Stewart to fullback Ja'Mar Toombs, which was
recovered by Ohio State linebacker Jerry Rudzinski at the Aggies'
48 with 9:15 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're far too talented a team to try and play catchup
football against, and it just took us too long to get going,'' said
Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum. ``It's disappointing to end the season
with a loss, but I can't say enough about my team. We were Big 12
champions, we won 11 games this season and played eight Bowl teams
and a loss tonight doesn't take away from a tremendous season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes left here thinking there was still some life left
in their season, even though they had played their final game. ``I
don't think we'll be any worse than No. 2 in the country,'' Cooper
said. ``Depending upon what happens Monday night, we can make the
claim that we're as good as anybody in the country.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the Republican losses in November's
elections, a disheartened Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott quickly
got the hint: Voters wanted a mended Social Security system, an
orderly budget, good schools. They wanted action, not self-serving
brawling about legislation and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his leather armchair speaking to reporters, Lott, of
Mississippi, promised the ``American people'' results, plumping up
his wish list for the new year, being careful to stay away from the
scandal enveloping President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He had been watching from afar, with a bit of trepidation, as
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's political career disintegrated over
his choice of strategies for capitalizing on Clinton's problems.
And then Lott saw how Rep. Bob Livingston, Gingrich's designated
successor, got ensnared in the impeachment web.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott, a strait-laced, starched-shirt Southern conservative,
can no longer keep a safe distance from impeachment, even holed up
in Mississippi, where he has spent the holidays. Instead, he will
play a pivotal role in shaping the way the Senate will handle two
articles of impeachment sent over by the House, one charging
perjury by Clinton, the other, obstruction of justice in the
investigation of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   And already Lott, who colleagues say is keenly aware of the
historical import of his actions, is being jostled by traditional
political crosswinds from the right and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he has an awesome responsibility,'' said Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who spoke to Lott on the telephone
last week. ``It's difficult because I know he wants to be fair to
the president and he has a caucus of 55 Republicans, all of whom
have very different views on how this should unfold, and all of
whom are convinced they are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans, of which he is one, are pushing Lott
to hold a full trial, with testimony from witnesses, followed by a
vote on the articles of impeachment. Many of them disapprove of
censuring Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, the
second most important figure in an impeachment trial, are lobbying
for a swift proceeding and a vote on censure. Lott is said to be
considering a proposal that would serve as a compromise between the
Democratic position and that of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of that tug-of-war is the fact that convicting and
removing Clinton from office requires a two-thirds majority, or 67
senators. Even if all 55 Republicans stuck together and voted to
convict, 12 Democrats would have to break with their party to do
the same, something that most senators concede is next to
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is constrained by the fact that he has to get `X' number of
votes to do anything,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., a
conservative. ``He may not have the support within his own caucus
and with Democrats to proceed the way he wants. He's the leader,
not the dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this mathematical calculation, and Lott's desire to avoid
a drawn-out trial in the face of public opposition to Clinton's
impeachment and removal, that is governing the majority leader's
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Senator Lott is doing is acting as majority leader of the
entire Senate,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., an influential
senator who has been in close touch with Lott as he formulates his
plan. ``He views this not as a partisan exercise and not as a fight
between Democrats and Republicans, but a carrying out of the
Senate's constitutional responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been involved in widespread consultations with members
on both sides of the aisles,'' McConnell added.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats say Lott appears to be resisting the squeeze from
his conservative backers, the people who helped elect him to the
Senate and who have at times signaled their discontent with him,
most recently after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is classically conservative on many levels, and his more
extreme views have sometimes alienated the more moderate members of
his own party. Last year, he triggered a firestorm of protest when
he likened homosexuality to a disease, like alcoholism, and called
it a sin.
</P>
<P>
   His past has also been intertwined with pro-Confederacy groups
and an organization whose leaders have espoused white supremacist
views. Lott addressed the Sons of Confederate Veterans and spoke to
a magazine that extols the virtues of the Confederacy, Southern
Partisan. And he spoke in 1992 to members of the Council of
Conservative Citizens, although he later renounced the organization
and the racial views of some of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lott drew the ire of many senators when he sharply
criticized Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq, calling it an
orchestrated maneuver to stall the House's scheduled vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But for now at least, Lott appears to be clutching the center
and the Constitution, focusing more on consensus than on anything
else.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal Lott is considering will attest to his
desire for compromise, and seems to contradict the harder line he
appeared to be taking early on that called for a swift but complete
trial, and a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would provide for a test vote of sorts in the
Senate, requiring a two-thirds majority, on the two articles of
impeachment. If 67 senators vote to approve the test resolution,
after hearing a summation of the evidence by the House and the
White House, the Senate will go forward with a full trial. If the
resolution fails, the Senate will turn to a censure proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews, several of Lott's Republican colleagues
responded to the compromise proposal with displeasure, saying they
would like witnesses to testify and believe that 67 votes to move
forward with a trial is too steep a cut-off. Democrats approved of
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has not commented on the proposal and declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lott has proceeded professional and in the best
traditions of the Senate,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a
liberal who leads the Senate Democratic campaign committee. ``I
don't think he will succumb to pressure because there is a common
interest. We want to deal with issue and don't want the president
to be crippled, and Republicans realize they are acting against
public desires and at great political risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Lott's philosophical differences with Daschle, and their
past skirmishes over issues like managed care and education, the
majority leader has kept in close touch with his Democratic
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders speak daily, trading ideas about how to manage
the trial and sharing concerns about the obstacles that the Senate
needs to overcome to see impeachment though will little turbulence.
The Senate's complicated rules, and its deference to individual
members, make it easy for one dissenter, either Democrat or
Republican, to tangle up the process.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has also reached out to moderate Republicans and Democrats
in his party in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is reaching out and talking to all of us is a
good sign,'' Senator Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who is close to the negotiations between Lott and
Daschle called them as ``productive and cooperative as one could
expect given the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is determined to do the right thing here,'' said the
Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``And he
realizes that he will be judged more by history than by his
peers.''

<P>
   Lott's colleagues also say he has paid close attention to the
partisan quagmire that nearly subsumed the House impeachment
proceedings. Much of that partisanship can be avoided in the
Senate, where the process is not governed by a single committee
rife with rock-hard conservatives and unflinching liberals, as it
was in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work as well as anyone would have liked it to work
in the House,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has also been
in close consultation with Lott. ``One hopes that Lott and the
minority have learned from that.''

UNION CONCESSIONS HAVE IMPLICATIONS AS NBA TALKS ENTER FINAL WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When players and lawyers from the National Basketball Players
Association sat down last week and devised their final proposal to
management, they finally gave up on the notion of a luxury tax and
gave in to the owners' desires for an absolute maximum salary
limit.
</P>
<P>
   As concessions in the league's labor dispute go, the $15 million
figure was much higher than the league's offer of $12.25 million;
privately, league officials wondered whether that nearly $3 million
gap _ and several other economic differences _ could be closed in
time for Thursday's deadline for canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a feeling that dramatic changes could be
ahead for the league's salary structure.
</P>
<P>
   The players had previously agreed to capping the salaries of
players with less than 10 years of experience. Billy Hunter, the
union executive director, said the two sides are less than $500,000
apart on players with less than six years of experience and players
with seven to nine years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done something that no other major professional sports
league has done,'' Hunter said. ``We've said, in effect, you can
only make so much for what you do in this game. Even with some
players grandfathered in under their previous deals, it's an
unprecedented concession.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a compromise in exchange for the owners' letting the
players keep the Larry Bird exception rule, the clause that allows
teams to compensate their own free agents above and beyond the
team's salary cap. It is also a compromise that may have a
wide-ranging effect on salaries the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, for example, a player such as the San
Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan _ perhaps the preeminent big man for the
next 10 years _ could never approach the riches of a Kevin Garnett,
whose $126 million deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves last season
set off widespread alarms. The most Duncan could make under the
proposed plan would be about an $11 million average _ $3 million
less than what Garnett will make this season. Players such as the
Portland Trail Blazers' Damon Stoudamire and the Philadelphia
76ers' Allen Iverson, who have a lot to do with the fan bases in
their respective cities, could make no more than about $9 million
in the first year of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   With 12.5 percent annual raises, there will be an occasional
$100 million contract signed. But the plethora of exorbitant deals
that the owners claim has crippled their ability to make profits
should be reduced significantly over the next six to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   With market value having already been predetermined and only a
set of numbers to be plugged in, there is also concern among the
NBA agents. The bidding wars may be just as fierce and negotiations
tense for the most prominent free agents, but general managers will
no longer be frightened off by what another team can pay a player.
They will already know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of going to an agent with more clout because he can
somehow help you get the best deal may not be as prevalent
anymore,'' said one league official, on condition of anonymity.
``If you know there is only so much you can get, well, how much
more is that special agent going to get you?''
</P>
<P>
   The maximum salary proposal is still at least a few days away
from being tinkered with, along with several other economic issues
that are unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   A standoff between lawyers on each side late last week over how
the union's proposal would be delivered to the owners _ the union
requested a meeting, the league officials said they would not
guarantee one until they had seen the proposal _ characterized the
stare-down state of negotiations entering the expected last round.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is expected to quell the recent skirmish and have the
proposal delivered to the league's office early this week, a person
familiar with the negotiations said Saturday. It may not stop the
last-minute campaigning by each side and may not immediately get
the two sides closer to salvaging perhaps a 45-game season that
would begin the last week of January at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, the NBA deputy commissioner, has said the chance of
a settlement is remote given the union's reported concessions.
</P>
<P>
   And limiting what each player can make is only half the battle.
The most important negotiation may be over shared revenue
percentages over six years.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth year of a proposed six-year deal, the union wants
55 percent of revenues to go to player salaries while the owners
have proposed a figure no higher than 53 percent. In the fifth year
of the deal, the union wants 56 percent and the owners want to pay
out only 53.5 percent. The last year, the union wants 57 percent
and the league wants to pay only 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because each percentage point is roughly equivalent to $20
million, the gap is only $40 million in the fourth year. But with
more revenue, a three percent gap in the final year of the year
could represent anywhere from $75 million to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from several other sticking points, with less than four
days before Stern and Granik recommend to the board of governors
that the entire season be scrapped, they have a long way to go. &QL;

<P>
   A wave of union corruption, including a widening scandal at New
York City's largest municipal union, has thrown the labor movement
off stride at a time when it is straining to improve its image and
persuade millions more Americans to join unions.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders assert that the current wave of corruption pales
in comparison with labor's past, noting that mob influence has
largely been rooted out and that hundreds of corrupt officials have
been punished or expelled through union and government efforts to
clean house.
</P>
<P>
   But the scandals, which have involved the laborers, hotel
workers, Teamsters and other unions, have caused some labor experts
to question the widely held perception that union corruption has
fallen markedly since the 1950s era of ``On the Waterfront,'' when
organized crime dominated many unions.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement among union leaders that the
current surge of accusations _ including embezzlement, vote rigging
and associating with mobsters _ is an embarrassing setback because
it focuses attention on labor's seamy side when its leaders are
pushing the message that a revived labor movement is going to bat
for working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the
United Federation of Teachers. ``It clearly gives a very negative
image, and we have to overcome it. But the fact of the matter is
the overwhelming majority of unions are good unions.''
</P>
<P>
   The current wave of corruption involves some of the nation's
most prominent unions.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Coia, the president of the Laborers International Union
of North America, may face expulsion over internal charges that he
associated with organized crime figures and acquiesced in their
running parts of the union. An internal union judge is to rule this
month on whether to uphold the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, a scandal has rocked a union representing
120,000 municipal workers, District Council 37 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The president
of one of the union locals in the district council was ousted after
an internal union panel found that he embezzled more than $1.7
million, while several top officials have admitted to engaging in
vote fraud to insure ratification of a deeply unpopular contract.
</P>
<P>
   And the Manhattan District Attorney's office is investigating
whether the same district council's officials received kickbacks
from caterers, lawyers and travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a federal monitor forced the longtime president of
the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union to step down
because of extravagant spending and other wrongdoing. The union
president, Edward Hanley, had the union pay for his office and
secretary in Palm Springs; bought a union-leased Cadillac sports
car at a bargain rate, and set up a phantom local in a Wisconsin
resort town to help union officials charge their vacation costs as
union expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago a Minnesota-based official with the operating
engineers union pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $200,000 for
gambling, drinking and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And many labor leaders voice fears that the recent election of
Jimmy Hoffa's son, James P. Hoffa, to head the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters could open the door to more corruption in
the union, although Hoffa insists that he will fight corruption.
Already a court-appointed review board has charged three officials,
elected as vice presidents on the Hoffa slate, with wrongdoing that
could lead to their expulsion from the union.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's predecessor, Ron Carey _ who was originally elected as a
corruption fighter _ was ousted from the union's presidency because
three of his aides siphoned more than $700,000 in Teamster funds
into his campaign treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What with the Hoffa victory and this District Council 37
scandal, my impression is the gloss is off the refurbished labor
movement,'' said Herman Benson, the founder of the Association for
Union Democracy, a New York-based group that has long fought union
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans and other critics of the labor
movement have seized on the scandals to argue that unions have
little moral leadership and are hardly better than in the '50s and
'60s, when Jimmy Hoffa led the Teamsters. Back then, organized
crime figures embezzled tens of millions of dollars from the
Teamsters' pension funds, while many Teamster locals were run by
and for mob leaders, who occasionally had their union opponents
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union corruption hasn't changed that much since the '50s,''
said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, a
conservative research group that publishes a biweekly newsletter,
the Union Corruption Report. ``The cast of characters may have
changed. Some of the corruption is more sophisticated, but it
continues to be a very serious problem. If there's any distinction,
it's that there's less organized crime than there was.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor's supporters maintain that there is far less
corruption now, largely because of government efforts to eliminate
mob influence in what were long considered the four most corrupt
unions: the Teamsters, laborers, hotel and restaurant employees and
the International Longshoremen's Association. In addition, several
unions have worked side by side with the government to clean house.
Over the past decade, the Teamsters' union and a court-appointed
review board have punished or removed from office more than 400
Teamster officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor movement is much better off than 40 years ago,''
Benson said. ``Even though we're always criticizing and
complaining, that's a real fact. This stuff was festering all the
time in unions. What's new is they're getting rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the AFSCME, agreed that unions are
far cleaner. ``When you go back to the '50s and '60s and Bobby
Kennedy chasing after Hoffa and all those kinds of things _ the
longshoremen, the laborers _ you had corruption that went to the
very core of so many of those unions,'' McEntee said. ``I think all
that has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntee has gotten serious about corruption by taking direct
control of District Council 37 in New York and by naming a trustee
to run the union and to clean house.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor leaders play down today's seeming surge in
corruption, insisting that it is merely the exposure of wrongdoing
that has gone on for years and has been brought to light by union
reformers or government officials on cleaning up unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform sometimes works like a washing machine _ it agitates
the dirt to the top,'' John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president,
said in a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney took pains to assert that the current wave of corruption
did not suddenly happen during his three years at labor's helm,
noting that much of the corruption was uncovered recently, after
lengthy investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think there is much less corruption in unions than in
past years,'' Sweeney said. ``I firmly believe there's no more
wrongdoing in unions than there is in business. But the bottom line
is there is no room in the labor movement for corruption or
wrongdoing of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of suggestions about how to clean up unions.
Boehm called for legislation requiring unions to have independent
annual audits and to disclose more financial information to
members.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gilberg, a former general counsel to the Teamsters, said
not enough unions had adopted serious anticorruption measures.
Noting that many defense contractors hired compliance officers
after several companies were found guilty of bribery, he said few
unions had established similar programs to combat corruption
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got organizations with tens of millions, hundreds of
millions in assets, and there ought to be procedures in place to
make sure it is handled properly,'' Gilberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If labor figures out a strategy to hire competent people to
take a look at where the money is going, and do things like develop
new bylaws or set up an in-house ethical practices committee, that
would be a big help,'' he said. ``There are a lot of things unions
can do if they think more than a week or a month ahead.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HOLMGREN COMES HOME TO SAN FRANCISCO, POSSIBLY FOR
GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is this where Mike Holmgren's heart really
resides? Is his dream job to coach the San Francisco 49ers, where
he coached under Bill Walsh and helped win championships before
traveling to Green Bay seven seasons ago?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Holmgren comes home Sunday afternoon, back to his
hometown, back to where he left his heart long ago. Holmgren brings
his Green Bay Packers here one more time, in the National Football
Conference wild-card playoff clash against the 49ers at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   If Holmgren wants to come home and stay, he is setting the
proper foundation. He has used a sly formula: if you can't join
'em, beat 'em. Holmgren has won five consecutive games over the
49ers and has kicked them out of the playoffs in each of the past
three seasons. He left for Green Bay in 1992, missed the playoffs
that first season and has since gained a franchise record string of
six post-season berths. He has the best record among active coaches
who have coached at least 100 games _ a 75-37 regular-season
record, a .670 percentage. He won Super Bowl XXXI over the New
England Patriots. He reached Super Bowl XXXII last year but lost to
the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren, 50, has one year left on his current contract. The
49ers already have a head coach in Steve Mariucci. But so what, on
both counts. Holmgren has a clause in his contract that says he can
leave to accept a general managing/head coaching job with another
team. Mariucci? Nice job in two seasons. But if the 49ers want to
make the move, they will make the move. Easily. Ask guys like Tom
Landry and Jimmy Johnson and Don Shula. Or even George Seifert,
whom Mariucci replaced. Super Bowl winners all, and all
unceremoniously booted for a new twinkle in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the five head coaches all dumped in one day last week.
</P>
<P>
   And that is another indication that even if Holmgren does not
wind up here, he is still all but gone from Green Bay. There are
seven head coaching vacancies in the National Football League. The
Carolina Panthers like Holmgren. Seattle has long flirted with him.
Holmgren has said he will wait, that he will see. But it appears
that the door is shut, that the book is closed, that this man is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Could be a seven-year itch.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren came to Green Bay because Ron Wolf, the Packers'
general manager, liked his manners and fondness for football and
quick offensive mind. They formed a partnership: Holmgren coached
the players, Wolf picked them. Through the past seven years this
tandem has worked as well as any duo in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, both say their relationship remains strong. But
this could also be a case of familiarity breeding boredom and more.
Holmgren has looked around and seen Bill Parcells picking and
coaching his own players with the Jets. Mike Shanahan picks 'em and
coaches 'em with Denver. Dan Reeves picks 'em and coaches 'em with
Atlanta. Holmgren would like to try that. Be your own boss. Build
your own thing. Is it ego? Sure it is. Is it the new challenge, the
new drive? No doubt. Could be that Holmgren also thinks the best of
this current group of Packer players is behind them.
</P>
<P>
   We can look back to the Nov. 29 Philadelphia-at-Green Bay game
to see how the current situation in Green Bay may be wearing on
Holmgren. Ahead by 10-6 as he and his team walked off at halftime,
Holmgren became embroiled in a shouting match with a fan.
Frustration, no doubt, over the way the Packers had played in the
first half. Frustration with injuries and a taxing season in which
the Minnesota Vikings were supplanting Green Bay as the dominant
team in the NFC Central Division. All season, Holmgren has heard
critics say that he is simply playing out the string. That he is
jockeying for position to move and that his coaching has suffered.
That he wanted to leave last year and could not. For Holmgren, that
hurts.
</P>
<P>
   He has always loved the Green Bay franchise and its fans, but
familiarity, again. What is it breeding?
</P>
<P>
   He could not have been happy over the shots he took after last
year's Super Bowl loss for forgetting the count on downs in
Denver's late drive, when Holmgren decided to let Terrell Davis
walk into the end zone from the 1-yard-line with under two minutes
left. Holmgren conceded the touchdown because he wanted the ball
back for a final drive with as much time as possible for Brett
Favre. The strategy did not work. And the fact that Holmgren took
so much abuse for it at home in particular has not warmed his heart
toward staying in Green Bay. Especially after all he has
accomplished there.
</P>
<P>
   And here is another thing: Holmgren's leaving the Bay Area for
the head coaching job in Green Bay was a wonderful career move
seven years ago, but to do it, he drastically changed environments,
his roots, for himself and his family. Might be time to get back to
those roots for the same reasons, for himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   On the table from Wolf is a contract extension for Holmgren. He
has not signed it. He will wait until after the season, he said, to
make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. This is Holmgren's last hurrah, his final playoff
tour with Green Bay. This goose looks cooked. Mike Holmgren is
ready to fly the coop.
</P>
<P>
   The question is where he will land. So many options. But there
is no place like home. Home is where the heart is for most,
including Holmgren. And that gives this playoff tangle here Sunday
a pinch more spice.

SPORTS COLUMN: GREEN'S SUCCESS LIFTS BLACK COACHES' STATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Green doesn't deserve the burden of being a beacon. He
has been too successful for too long. But the more games that Green
and his Minnesota Vikings win in the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs,
the more visible other black candidates should be in the fog that
seems to surround most National Football League club owners when
searching for a new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The shame of pro football is that black players represent
roughly two-thirds of the NFL's 30 rosters, but Green and Tampa
Bay's Tony Dungy represent the league's only two black head
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   From around the time that the Buccaneers hired Dungy three years
ago, other club owners have hired 18 head coaches, all of them
white. And with at least seven new vacancies, including five from
last Monday's massacre in Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Seattle
and Carolina, that embarrassing streak could hit 25.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, it will prove that some pro football club owners
have not checked this season's final standing or glanced to see
who's in charge on the Vikings' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Only three NFL teams have had a 15-1 record _ the 1984 49ers
(under Bill Walsh), the 1985 Bears (under Mike Ditka) and now the
1998 Vikings. And if the Vikings win the Super Bowl, Dennis Green
will be the first black head coach to caress the Vince Lombardi
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then some pro football club owners will realize that more
black head-coaching candidates should be considered and hired.
</P>
<P>
   Green suddenly has an opportunity to do for other black coaches
what Doug Williams did for other black quarterbacks. Until Williams
threw four touchdown passes in the Redskins' 42-10 rout of the
Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXII, a black quarterback was
considered a novelty, a curiosity. Witness one question during the
Super Bowl inquisitions in San Diego that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long,'' one interrogator asked Williams, ``have you been a
black quarterback?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody laughed,'' Williams has said, ``but I knew what the
guy meant. I answered, `Since I've been in the NFL.' At Grambling,
I'd just been a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Williams earned the Pete Rozelle Trophy as that Super
Bowl's most valuable player, he was just a quarterback again. And
ever since, an African-American football player who happens to play
quarterback is considered just a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The same situation could occur for black coaches if Dennis Green
and the Vikings win Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami on Jan. 31. Maybe
then all those black head-coaching candidates will be considered
just head-coaching candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Vikings get knocked off, Green's success in
Minnesota has established his stature as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Over his seven seasons there, Green has a 71-41 record with
three National Conference Central titles and three wild-card berths
despite constant changes at quarterback: Sean Salisbury, Jim
McMahon, Warren Moon, Brad Johnson and now Randall Cunningham. Most
of those quarterback changes resulted from Green's 1-5 playoff
record, which this explosive Viking team should rectify.
</P>
<P>
   Green agreed that a Vikings victory in the Super Bowl would
create more visibility for black coaching candidates, but he
preferred to discuss why the Bucs hired Dungy off his Viking staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bucs knew exactly what they were looking for in Tony, and
they got it,'' Green said. ``He took them from last place to the
playoffs a year ago and almost to the playoffs this year. He
represented a coach who knew the Central Division and had the
ability to coach against it. Tony's 3-3 against us in his three
seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy, who had been the Vikings' defensive coordinator,
choreographed the Buccaneers' 27-24 victory at Tampa Bay on Nov. 1,
Minnesota's only loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look around for the best guy for that job; that's what teams
should do when they need a new head coach,'' Green said. ``That's
what the Bucs did.''
</P>
<P>
   Green endorsed two black assistant coaches in particular:
Sherman Lewis, the Packers' offensive coordinator, and Willie Shaw,
the Raiders' defensive coordinator. Green and Lewis were together
on the 49ers' staff; Shaw was the defensive coordinator at Stanford
when Green was the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think Sherman is too old at 56, but he acts like
he's 40,'' Green said. ``If Sherman was in my job the last seven
years, he'd have done as good. Willie took that Oakland defense,
which ranked next-to-last in the league a year ago, and moved it up
to third in the AFC this season.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more playoff games the Vikings win, the more Dennis
Green will lift the club owners' fog for all those black coaching
candidates who just want to be considered coaching candidates.

WORLD-CLASS BASS TREASURE IN THE SIERRA MADRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TECHOBAMPO, Mexico _ There are as many people in this remote
village in the Sierra Madre _ about 240 _ as live in some apartment
buildings in many cities in the United States. Most are Indian
descendants whose previous houses are now under water. All of
Techobampo was relocated in 1994 when a dam on the Rio Fuerte was
completed and a new impoundment, called Huites and built for
irrigation and hydroelectric purposes, started to fill.
</P>
<P>
   That dam backs up the Chinipas River, a serpentine watercourse
that flows into Huites from rugged peaks near Copper Canyon, or
Barranca del Cobre, Mexico's larger and deeper version of the Grand
Canyon, with a maximum depth of more than 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest of canyon country on the outskirts of the Sierra Madre
Occidentals, Lake Huites is 22 miles long and covers 30,000 acres
when full. It is so remote that most of the guides employed at Ron
Speed's fishing camp there had never seen a boat or outboard motor
before 1994, and the nearby villages got electricity only four
years ago. The nearest telephone is an hour away in the city of
Choix.
</P>
<P>
   The drive from Los Mochis takes more than three hours, 18 miles
of which are on a winding, rutted, neck-wrenching burro trail. It
took 22 days to bring in the two mobile trailers that serve as
sleeping quarters for anglers, and each had to be cut in half
lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   But adventurous North American anglers, showing the tenacity of
burros themselves, are flocking here for unparalleled
largemouth-bass fishing action. Florida-strain largemouth bass _
which grow quickly and have been exported by fisheries managers to
many states in the southern United States _ were brought here in
1994, and already specimens 11 pounds and up have been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   This exceptional growth rate produces football-shaped bass that
have small heads and a large girth, plus a hot chili pepper
disposition. Landing these dynamos is a 50-50 proposition, and
always a challenge. Huites is completely loaded with trees and
brush, and the bass are amidst this protective cover. When the fish
strike a lure, they dive for the nearest wood, often a multi-limbed
cactus, and either break the line or achieve freedom when an angler
is unable to extract them.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many bass, and so much opportunity, that losing
half the fish that strike is no problem. In fact, the bass often
congregate in spots, usually off points near deep water, that
produce so much action that anglers do not have to search all over
this expansive water, a rarity in most U.S. bass fishing lakes.
</P>
<P>
   One morning I was paired with Kris Leistritz of Woodland, Wash.,
whose employer, the fishing rod manufacturer G. Loomis, sent her
and two colleagues to Huites to test new equipment. Our guide,
Racindo Rodriguez, took us up the Chinipas River, past steep
canyons, red rock cliffs and narrow passageways, stopping at a
rocky section that was loaded with bass. Once, having just cast a
plastic worm to the sharply sloped rock, I watched Leistritz hook a
large bass and laid down my rod momentarily to take a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez deftly netted the fish, posed, then yelled and pointed
behind me. My rod was out of the boat and heading toward the lake
bottom. I fell on the rear deck, reached into the water, and barely
snatched the end of the handle. A bass had taken my motionless lure
and pulled the $300 rod, plus reel, out of the boat. Still hooked,
it jumped out of the water while I scrambled to my feet, and a few
moments later a potbellied fish was in Rodriguez's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing was seldom that easy during a three-day visit, as an
unusually extreme cold front had made the bass less active and sent
them deep. The norm here is shallow-water angling, with so much
activity that even a poor caster or first-time bass angler can have
success.
</P>
<P>
   That action has been drawing people to Huites since fishing
first began in October, when Speed, of Malakoff, Texas, got the
trailers in place and the boats, equipment and services
established.
</P>
<P>
   This is never an easy job in Mexico, and even more difficult in
such a remote location. It is also risky in the long term, because
virtually all other new bass fishing lakes in Mexico have been
damaged within five years of opening by legal and illegal
commercial fishing. The illegal fishing has already begun on
Huites, Speed said, but the Sinaloan state government has been
patrolling the lake and confiscating illegal nets, shooting holes
through the bottom of more than a dozen boats.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there's a conflict between the state government
and local communities, which want to promote tourism and maintain
the quality of this resource, and the Mexican government, which
issues permits to commercial fishermen and does little to curb
illegalities. Commercial interests have won out at other lakes.
</P>
<P>
   In Techobampo and throughout this rugged region, the people earn
very little from modest farming efforts; a laborer makes about $4 a
day. Fishing guides earn a daily salary of $12, plus an average tip
of $20. They are eager to assist, and many serenade their clients
while guiding.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to be extremely still in the narrow sections
of the lake, especially on the Chinipas. Boats travel through
chasms so steep that the sun doesn't penetrate until midmorning.
Overhead, huge boulders hang on precipices hundreds of feet up, and
every osprey that flies by has a fish in its talons.
</P>
<P>
   Below, the tips of 40-foot-tall trees barely make it to the
water's surface, and the bass might pull your fishing rod into the
water if you don't hold on to it.

STORM PUMMELS MIDWEST AND GULF COAST STATES 
 (DW)

(ATTN: Ark., Ill., Ind., Iowa, Mo., Neb., Texas)   By JO THOMAS

<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ A giant storm howled across the Midwest Saturday
, from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico, grounding most
flights in Chicago and St. Louis, knocking out power, and
threatening a foot of snow or more in northern states.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 25 miles an hour or more have created near-blizzard
conditions in Chicago, making it difficult even to cross the
street. Motorists seemed to heed the advice of highway officials to
stay off the roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secondary roads are shut down, but the Interstates are
still open,'' said Sgt. Kenneth Dicken of the Illinois State
Police. ``We've had very few accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said parts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Missouri
could get 15 to 20 inches of snow by Saturday night, with high
winds bringing the wind chill well below zero. On Saturday, the
snow covered parts of Iowa and the Dakotas and was moving into Ohio
and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago's O'Hare Airport, most of Saturday morning's flights
were canceled, and airport personnel provided hundreds of cots for
travelers who may be stranded by the storm. All 140 Trans World
Airline flights into and out of Lambert Airport were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies in Texas said tornadoes injured at least seven people
and destroyed three mobile homes east of Huntsville. None of the
injuries were life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, freezing rain toppled power lines and cut service
to more than 100,000 utility customers.
</P>
<P>
   The storm has been blamed for at least seven deaths. Six of
these, including two in Arkansas, two in Nebraska and two in
Missouri, occurred in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the snowstorm was on the way swept the Midwest before
New Year's Eve, and shoppers jammed stores to buy food, shovels,
and firewood _ and party supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Mittman, office manager at the County Market grocery store
in Urbana, Ill., said: ``Yesterday I had one customer buy 18 loaves
of bread, 20 pounds of hamburger, 6 bags of sugar, a whole case of
macaroni and cheese, 6 boxes of cereal, 4 gallons of milk. He said
he didn't plan on coming back in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Henson, a dispatcher at Tatman's Towing in Urbana, said:
``We started getting calls yesterday afternoon. It was `Pull me out
of here,' `Pull me out of here.' As the night went on, the snow got
deeper, and people stopped calling,'' she said. ``Some of the
businesses are now coming in to plow. If they can't get through, we
can't get through.''

A CLOSE BUNCH OF CHARACTERS HAS GIVEN TENNESSEE ITS CHARACTER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Their quarterback says with soulful eyes that
football is just a sport to him and has nothing to do with what he
is about. Their captain, once a boxer, now a linebacker, calls the
game war and plays through injuries that would sideline others.
</P>
<P>
   Their place-kicker is president of the Tennessee chapter of the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes, but also gets evangelical about
calling converts to the altar of Southern football. Their center
has a long, jagged scar on each arm, an unruly mountain-man beard
and, once you get past his salty language, old-fashioned opinions
about respect.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing them and the other Tennessee Volunteers is a coach
who makes sure he is home for family time on Wednesday and Thursday
evenings and who fought the school's administration until his
daughters were allowed on the sideline during games as ball girls.
</P>
<P>
   All are characters who together have developed enough character
to win all 12 of their games, capture the No. 1 ranking in both
national polls and play Florida State (11-1) for the national
championship here Monday night. Still, they are relative no-names,
suspect because four of their victories were pulled out in the
fourth quarter, and significant underdogs to a team with an
inferior record.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't care about any of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather earn respect than have anyone give it to us,''
said the center, Spencer Riley, his voice booming through his beard
and seeming to jiggle his 295 pounds. ``That's fine with us. It's
been like that all year. We will earn your respect.''
</P>
<P>
   How this bunch became a team has everything and nothing to do
with the departed Peyton Manning. Now the Indianapolis Colts'
starting quarterback, Manning became the most beloved Vol of all
during a four-year career in which he set nearly every Tennessee
passing record.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the state, a certain skepticism developed when his
won-loss record never seemed to catch up to his lineage (son of
Archie from Ole Miss) and all-American billing. He did indeed put
up a one-loss season and a couple of two-loss seasons, but never
got the Volunteers where they were picked to be in three of his
four seasons: the national title game.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone except this season's freshmen suffered for it _
especially the head coach, Phillip Fulmer. That he and Manning
failed to beat Florida in their four years together obscured the
fact that Fulmer's 66-11 career record, an .857 winning percentage,
is best among active college coaches with five or more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the reputation of underachievers and he got the rap of
not being able to coach,'' the senior linebacker Al Wilson said of
Fulmer. ``We had Peyton and Leonard Little and all these big-name
stars, and people didn't understand why we didn't put it all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is the Volunteers' captain _ the ``heart and soul'' of
the team, according to Fulmer. He was named first-team all-American
despite playing through excruciating shoulder and groin injuries
that forced him out of two games near the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson learned as a teen-ager in the boxing gym to identify
weaknesses and then attack them. Last August, he called the
Volunteers together and told them what he felt was their weakness:
the lack of big names. They didn't have any stars, he said. Manning
was gone and the defense had lost seven starters. Then Wilson told
them how the team was going to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects anything from us,'' he said he told them. ``The
only way we would prove anyone wrong was to be a team, for
everybody to contribute. I loved Peyton, and he was a team guy. We
played hard for him, but sometimes we relied on him to make a big
play to bail us. When he couldn't, no one else was prepared to step
up. Now everyone is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Manning is gone, he is hardly forgotten. In a corner of
the Tennessee Football Hall of Fame exhibit on campus in Knoxville,
next to the original manuscript of the school's anthem, ``Rocky
Top,'' is a life-sized, lifelike mannequin of Manning in his letter
jacket. Outside Neyland Stadium, a 105,000-seat monument to college
football, is a street named Peyton Manning Pass. Who could possibly
step out of that shadow?
</P>
<P>
   His name is Tee Martin. He is a soft-spoken, 6-foot-3-inch
junior from Mobile, Ala., from the dark heart of its toughest
neighborhood, Birdsville. When 12 friends and family members have
died in the past three years by murder, accident, or illness,
football truly becomes just a game.
</P>
<P>
   When you have escaped death in a drive-by shooting because you
happened to go inside a building to fill up some water balloons,
only to find your playmate dead on the street because he didn't, it
is not that big a deal to succeed a football folk hero. ``I'm not
Peyton, but I can do some good things,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is to give the Vols what Manning could not: a shot
at the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Only the fifth-ranked passer in the Southeastern Conference? And
only seventh in total offense? His favorite target, Peerless Price,
said those facts do not measure an undefeated quarterback. These
do: fourth-quarter game-winning drives against Syracuse, Florida,
Arkansas and Mississippi State. ``There's a calm about him that
lets us know we're going to do it,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this season, Martin has driven the Vols into scoring range
only to cede the spotlight to a 182-pounder place-kicker who is as
manic and talkative as the quarterback is serene and stoic. Jeff
Hall beat Syracuse with a 27-yard field goal to open the season on
the road, then booted a 41-yarder in overtime the following week to
beat Florida and end the Gators' five-year domination. He doesn't
drink, doesn't smoke, and takes his faith seriously _ as he does
the tradition of Southern football.
</P>
<P>
   Hall grew up in Winchester, Tenn., a town of 6,700 where Fulmer
also was raised. He signed with Tennessee in September of his
junior year in high school, a 16-year-old who had never even been
on an official recruiting trip to Knoxville. He said he knows that
Florida State has won 12 of its last 13 bowl games, captured the
national title in 1993 and is among the most dominant football
programs of the 90's.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we got something going, too,'' he said. ``We play in big
stadiums across the South where the great multitudes gather on
Saturday afternoons to celebrate loyalty and passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall stopped to catch his breath. ``I mean, really,'' he said,
``don't you think we have some destiny on our side?''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteer faithful thought so on Nov. 14, when Arkansas
quarterback Clint Stoerner fell down and fumbled while the
Razorbacks were trying to run out the clock on a 24-21 victory. In
less than a minute and a half, Martin drove his team for the
game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley, the rugged center, has no use for magic. He rubs the
scar on his right arm, where he tore his triceps last year against
Nebraska on the second series of the Orange Bowl. It was the most
pain he ever felt, he said, worse than when he broke his other arm
as a kid, and worse than his back surgery. The pain was n0t helped
by the 42-17 beating the Cornhuskers gave the Vols on the way to
their co-national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what's going to help us,'' Riley said. ``We got beat
bad. We know now what a big game is.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding all these emotions together now is Fulmer. The coach who
couldn't coach was recently voted coach of the year by his SEC
colleagues. Last week, he signed a six-year contract worth $1
million a year. His wife, Vicky, and daughters Courtney, 15,
Brittany, 13, and Allison, 12, have joined him here. He said
Monday's game was rivaling what until now has been the highlight of
his football life: being voted captain of the Vols as a senior
offensive lineman in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer prides himself on his consistency, his levelheadedness.
He said this group embodies those characteristics, though he has
had far more talented teams. There's something else, too. ``At
practice all year, you would hear this chatter on the field, '' he
said. ``You'd look around and see the older players with their arms
around the younger guys, trying to explain things to them. You try
to attain that every year, but sometimes you can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a close bunch. They're a team.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ Even unimaginative futurists predict that
some not-so-distant day, geography will barely matter. Humanity's
web of electronic connections will trump it utterly. That will be
particularly nice for isolated spots like this long-depressed
former mill and factory town, cupped in the Berkshire Mountains in
the remotest corner of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the transitional rub: Sometimes the places that most
need to overcome geography have the hardest time doing it, because
they are handicapped by their distance from the nearest trunk lines
of the long-distance carriers that offer Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, words used by members of Berkshire Connect, an
unusual task force formed by local civic and business leaders with
state help to address the problem, high-speed Internet connections
like T-1 lines are too expensive here. Connections often cost
double, triple or more what a user would pay in Boston or even
Springfield, Mass., because of the high local telephone charges to
reach the big carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies say that with the region's sparse
population, local demand is not sufficient to justify laying new
lines that would cut the cost. So the electronic road to the rest
of the world can sometimes seem as annoyingly narrow as the winding
local Mohawk Trail.
</P>
<P>
   That gets in the way of the region's hopes, just beginning to be
realized, to replace its dead mills with engines of the new
information economy: high-tech start-ups, new media businesses and
other companies that project their presence using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire County is not alone in its connection problem, said
Donald Dubendorf, a Williamstown lawyer and head of Berkshire
Connect's action committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of rural counties find themselves disconnected and
presenting too small a demand profile'' to prompt telephone
companies to improve and therefore cheapen Internet connections,
Dubendorf said. ``There are parallels in history _ rural
electrification in the 30's, 40's and 50's.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubendorf also found a parallel in history for what local
politicians and business leaders are trying to do with Berkshire
Connect: It is something like the cooperatives that Western farmers
formed when the new intercontinental railroads asked too much to
bring their goods to market, he said. They pooled their produce and
sought ways to buy or build railroad spurs. About a century later,
Berkshire Connect appears about to settle on information-age
equivalents to the farmers' tactics. The group is about to issue
business and technological plans, and though details have not been
released, members say they are expected to involve some laying of
fiber optic cable. In a 90's version of economic development
tactics _ what some are already calling tele-development _ the
group is expected to call for drawing the millions needed from
public and private money.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Berkshire County residents have been at odds over
how and where to make the road improvements they need to connect
them better to the Massachusetts Turnpike and the rest of the
world. With no consensus over routes, nothing has been done. But,
task force members say, there is no not-in-my-back-yard attitude
about better telephone lines. Everyone seems to want them.
</P>
<P>
   Especially two forces: a handful of tech upstarts, most of whom
have come from Williams College and into Williamstown, down the
road from here, in the last five years; and the high-tech
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, a mammoth museum
scheduled to open its first phase in May in North Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The young founders of Tripod, one of the most visited sites on
the Web, do not complain about the high telephone rates. The
machines that handle their Internet traffic are based in New Jersey
anyway, at a company that specializes in baby-sitting for such
servers. And the higher connection cost for their Williamstown
office is offset by their rent on a sprawling former factory floor:
$2.50 a square foot. Per year.
</P>
<P>
   Bought by Lycos last year for $58 million, Tripod is not
hampered by connection costs and has been increasing its staff from
40 last year to 80 now, to perhaps 150 by the end of the fiscal
year, said Bo Peabody, 27, Tripod's president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Kara Berklich, 26, Tripod's director for
communications, it is cheering on the push for better connections
because one of its goals is to help bring jobs and development to
the region where stagnation so struck its founders when they were
Williams students in the early 90's.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew C. Harris, a classmate of Peabody and Ms. Berklich at
Williams and a venture capitalist who seeks to lure more
information-age companies to the region, said the price of Internet
connection was not a deal breaker when he tried to bring companies
here, but it was a liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is for marketing, that it labels us a backwater,''
said Harris, managing director of The Berkshires Capital Investors
in Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disadvantage, Harris said, of about the same magnitude
as high property or electricity costs. He said he tried to counter
it by saying, ``You're going to pay more than in Boston, but your
rent will be 10 percent what it would be there, and your salaries
20 percent lower because cost of living is lower.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem looks more serious, and the hunger for better
connections seems sharper, in neighboring North Adams at the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, the long-awaited
institution called MASS MoCA that will offer performing arts as
well as exhibitions, and aims to be a ``creative campus'' with an
emphasis on the intersection of art and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The museum already offers a technology center that allows people
to use computers and take courses on them free; it also plans to
devote some of its space in a 700,000-square-foot abandoned mill
complex to rent offices to technology-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to offer prospective tenants as ``smart'' a building as
possible, with video teleconferencing and more. But to put in a
big-bore T-3 connection, said Brett McDowell, the museum's
information and media technology director, would cost perhaps
$35,000 a month, compared with less than half that in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When a company reaches the point that it needs a T-1 line here,
McDowell said, its manager often ends up protesting: ``You're
telling me that just to access the Internet at the rates I need is
five times more expensive than my rent?'' That, McDowell said, ``is
when the six-man new media company moves to Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   One MASS MoCA tenant, Kleiser-Walczak Construction, a film
special-effects and animation company, knows the connection problem
firsthand. Keeping in T-1 touch with the company's other offices in
New York and Hollywood costs about $7,000 a month, said its
president, Jeff Kleiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be here, we have to pay the price,'' Kleiser said. Still,
he added, the price brings admission to a ``once-in-a-lifetime
experience:'' watching the museum and economic changes help North
Adams metamorphose ``from a post-industrial wasteland to a new
high-tech-connected art community.''

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Anyone lethargic enough to spend time in front of
the tube this past week is no closer to enlightenment than when
this long and trivial clutter of bowl games began.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, they finally play a meaningful game, when
undefeated Tennessee takes on Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl. The
ticket scalpers are getting killed out here because of the lack of
enthusiasm, but that's the way it goes in the old capitalism game.
</P>
<P>
   This Fiesta Bowl is for the national championship, and not a
moment too soon. There has not been a significant act in college
football in a month, since the lords of the bowls buried a very
large pickax in the back of Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Poor arriviste Kansas State was foolish enough to lose a double
overtime game to Texas A&AMP;M on Dec. 5 for its first loss of the
season, thereby becoming terminally disqualified from the
new-fangled Bowl Championship Series game, No. 1 vs. No. 2, here.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State understood that part well enough, but the school
had not understood just how out of the mainstream it was until the
four major bowl games finished gobbling up their eight favored
teams _ based on potential ticket sales, advertising glamour,
glorious histories and general pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing for around $12-million in a major bowl _
which would have enabled it to buy even better student-athletes for
its ``program'' _ Kansas State was relegated to something like a
$1-million payoff in a bowl game whose name I cannot remember.
</P>
<P>
   Looking (in vain, as usual) for a good movie on the tube one
night in late December, I happened upon Purdue overcoming benumbed
Kansas State just before the final whistle of the Alamo Bowl, a
self-fulfilling prophecy if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Kansas State truly did not belong in anybody's top
eight, but every bowl season needs one team barking annoyingly on
the doorstep, against all hope of getting inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to bowl officials who raised ticket prices and
speculators who invested in them like Internet stocks, UCLA was
supposed to be Tennessee's opponent here, but UCLA was stunned by
Miami on the same strange day that Kansas State fell to earth,
while Bobby Bowden of Florida State sat in front of the television
in stunned gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA promptly died in the irrelevant Rose Bowl on Friday,
leaving Ohio State to play the role of the pretender, albeit mostly
for comic relief. Ohio State went into Friday night's Sugar Bowl
wanting to prove something by thumping Texas A&AMP;M, and thereby
setting up some scenario by which it could slip into the top
position while Florida State was staggering past Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very wobbly theory, but it was the best thing we had
going during the interminable wait. (How much alcohol or school
loyalty does it take to trek to a bowl game that means absolutely
nothing?)
</P>
<P>
   After all, the coaches who vote in the ESPN poll are already on
record that they will vote for the team that wins the Fiesta Bowl.
Otherwise, what is the whole silly business about, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   After a decent 24-14 victory over the Aggies Friday night, John
Cooper, the Ohio State coach, said, ``This was not a perfect
season, but there's no question it's a good, solid season. I don't
think we're going to be any worse than No. 2 in the country. And
depending on what happens Monday night, we might make a strong
argument that we're as good as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was trying to influence the writers who vote in the
Associated Press poll to somehow have a change of heart late Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In this bizarre vision, the writers would say to themselves,
``Oh, man, this was one dog of a game. I have wasted my valuable
time for the better part of a week, and therefore I am voting for
Ohio State.'' That doesn't sound like human nature to me, or even
sportswriter nature, and it is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of hapless Kansas State, drummed out of the enriched
eight, and the pipe dreams of Ohio State are going to be used as a
rationalization for a three-week system of playoffs _
quarterfinals, semifinals and finals _ producing a real
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy into it. The traditional bowl system, tying certain
powerhouse conferences to major bowls, was a delightful Marx
Brothers conclusion for a generally ludicrous sport that invokes
the aura of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, you had significant bowl games on New Year's
Day, the coaches voted, the writers voted, even President Nixon
chimed in with his opinion one year, and everybody argued for years
to come. Schools carried grudges, boosters provided voluminous
foolscap with comparative scores to prove that Slippery Rock could
still beat Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Michigan and Nebraska split the honors, and that was
fine, too. America was built on the democratic principle, and what
is more American than football, right?
</P>
<P>
   Even this new Bowl Championship Series does not work too badly.
Tennessee is the only top-level team in the country to go
undefeated, unless you count Tulane, which beat Brigham Young in
some bowl game a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, nobody counts Tulane. Take a hike, Tulane. Come on,
get out of here. Time for the big boys to play. Everything else on
television last week was just a communist plot to rot your mind.  &QL;

MAN SEEKS TO HAVE CONVICTION IN COSBY SLAYING SET ASIDE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lawyers for the man convicted of killing Bill
Cosby's son have filed a petition to set aside his conviction,
citing testimony in another trial that their client did not write
letters admitting to the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The client, Mikail Markhasev, was found guilty of first-degree
murder and attempted robbery in the death of Ennis W. Cosby, 27,
who was fatally shot while changing a flat tire here on Jan. 16,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, David Gomez, a witness in an unrelated murder
case, testified that he had forged confession letters attributed to
Markhasev, and acknowledged having a forgery conviction on his
record.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, which prosecutors said Markhasev wrote to Gomez
while they were inmates in the Los Angeles County jail, were the
only direct evidence linking Markhasev to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a petition filed on Dec. 23 with the California Court of
Appeals for the Second District, lawyers for Markhasev said he
should be granted a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ingalls, the Deputy District Attorney who prosecuted
Markhasev, said through a spokeswoman that her office stood by
Markhasev's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a prosecutor's question in the unrelated trial,
Gomez testified: ``At the time, I was in the process of forging a
case against Markhasev, the Cosby case. I had three or four guys I
was forging cases on at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same examination, Gomez said, in response to a
question about fooling handwriting experts: ``There ain't too much
you can't give me that I can't forge. When you read my rap sheet,
you forgot the felony conviction, forgery. I was just involved in
the Markhasev case.''
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor in that case said that the statement by Gomez was
undermined in court by other witnesses and that he might have made
it to protect himself from developing a reputation as an informer.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was testifying in a murder case against Billy Joe Cornejo,
who was accused of fatally shooting a rival gang member. Deputy
District Attorney Michael Camacho, who prosecuted the Cornejo case,
said in an interview that Gomez had turned over jail letters in
which Cornejo implicated himself. But Gomez said he would refuse to
testify at the trial, Camacho said, possibly to protect his safety
among other inmates who would target him if he was known to
cooperate with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev was sentenced to life in prison without parole last
August for the killing of Ennis Cosby, who was on vacation from his
studies at Columbia Teacher's College in New York when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   The case was not straightforward. Nearly two months after the
shooting, a witness with Cosby at the time of his death failed to
identify Markhasev in a police lineup. Prosecutors used the letters
to buttress circumstantial evidence tying Markhasev to the murder
weapon and witness testimony about his statements and demeanor
after the killing was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gomez and another witness, Chris So, separately approached
The National Enquirer with offers of evidence before they went to
the police in the hopes of reaping financial rewards from the
tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are full of vague statements in a mixture of English
and Spanish. Markhasev emigrated from Ukraine but associated with
Hispanic gangs as a teen-ager. Apparently the letters carried some
weight with jurors; during about six hours of deliberations, the
only question they asked was how prosecutors obtained the writing
sample from Markhasev that was used for comparison. In them, the
writer called the Cosby killing a robbery gone bad, and wrote, ``I
went to rob a connection but obviously found something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev's lawyer, Henry Hall, sought to undermine the letter
evidence at the trial by saying that the handwriting varied within
each letter and that the letters contained inaccuracies. He said
Cosby was killed by a friend of Markhasev's who was with him that
night.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday, Hall said the judged barred
evidence he tried to introduce of Gomez's purported forgery. In the
petition, Hall said that Gomez made up the letters to get a $10,000
reward from The National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the letters were originally provided to the tabloid,
which then notified the authorities of their existence. The letters
themselves were seized from several places, including the backyard
and the trash at the home of Gomez's wife, Dawn. Handwriting
experts testified to their authenticity at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was convicted in March of several felonies, including
robbery, forgery and rape, and sentenced to 91 years in state
prison; at the time of the trial in the Cosby murder he was serving
time in a Texas Federal prison for bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho, the prosecutor in the Cornejo case, said Gomez
testified that he had forged the letters in that case and the
Markhasev case, and that he had a conviction for forgery. That
testimony was later challenged by a bailiff, who testified that he
had overheard Gomez and Cornejo colluding to undermine the case
while they were in a courthouse holding cell, Camacho said. Cornejo
was convicted of second-degree murder last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was trying to throw in something else to bolster
his credibility that he was a forger,'' Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge must determine whether to hold a hearing on Markhasev's
petition or rule on it without argument.

VIKINGS REFLECT GREEN'S BOLDNESS AND SAVVY ;  OTHER MVPS;   THE JOB
FAIR 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days before last April's draft, Minnesota Vikings Coach
Dennis Green was on the telephone, predicting that if the Vikings
were able to draft wide receiver Randy Moss, their offense would be
practically unstoppable and the Vikings and Denver Broncos would be
the two best teams in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out for the Vikings,'' Green said then. ``We could be
very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is doing better than those psychics on late-night
television.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of solid candidates for coach of the year in the
National Football League this season, but because of Green's
boldness in taking Moss, his motivational skills and his smart
free-agent pickups, the Vikings were able to cruise to the best
record in the NFL at 15-1. Minnesota also set a single-season
scoring record with 556 points.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Green leads our second annual awards _ trumpets,
please _ for excellence in the regular season. No one did a better
coaching job than Green.
</P>
<P>
   He orchestrated a number of moves that were scoffed at by other
teams when they were made but proved to be brilliant. First he
lured quarterback Randall Cunningham out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stuck to his guns on picking Moss. Green also kept the
Pro Bowl defensive end John Randle, who had 10{ sacks this year,
the most by any interior lineman this season, from leaving by
matching a huge offer made by the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   But Green's best move may have been the one people know the
least about. After picking Moss, Green traded a third-round pick to
New England for cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots Coach Pete Carroll did not think Hitchcock could play.
But with the Vikings, Hitchcock returned seven interceptions for a
team-record 242 yards, breaking Charlie West's mark of 236 set in
1971. Hitchcock scored three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've built something special here,'' Green said.
``But no one will be satisfied until we win a Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   With regards to: Dan Reeves, Atlanta. The Falcons won their
first division title since 1980. Bill Parcells, Jets. New York won
the American Football Conference East for the first time since the
merger.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, Jets. He made one mistake, sending linebacker
Hugh Douglas to Philadelphia, where Douglas had 12{ sacks. But look
at Parcells' acquisitions: linebacker Bryan Cox, right tackle Jason
Fabini, center Kevin Mawae, running back Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget what he did with quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   With regards to: A.J. Smith, Buffalo's director of pro
personnel. He pushed to sign Doug Flutie.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOST VALUABLE PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Randall Cunningham, Minnesota. He and Moss actually practice
those bombs Cunningham throws Moss' way. Cunningham finished the
regular season with 34 touchdown passes and just 10 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel like I'm the mvp?'' Cunningham said recently. ``I'm
just a humble guy, man. Hopefully, things will work out that way.
But a Super Bowl would be even more awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   With regards to: Doug Flutie, Buffalo. He saved the Bills'
season. Terrell Davis, Denver. He rushed for 2,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, Denver. He joins Eric Dickerson, Barry Sanders
and O.J. Simpson as the only players to rush for more than 2,000
yards in a season. Because of Davis, the Broncos are the favorites
to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With regards to: Vinny Testaverde, Jets.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Michael Strahan, Giants. It is not an overstatement to say that
Strahan has a chance to become one of the best defensive linemen of
the decade. This season, if he had not been playing, the Giants
might have won only four games. He had 15 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   With regards to: Reggie White, Green Bay. He had 16 sacks. Ty
Law, New England. He had nine interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Randy Moss, Minnesota. He finished with 17 touchdowns, a
startling number, displaying the kind of explosiveness the NFL has
rarely seen from a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   With regards to: Charles Woodson, Oakland. He had five
interceptions. Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor and New
England running back Robert Edwards each had more than 1,000
rushing yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROWNS' MERCHANDISE MART
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft of veterans, coming next month, is as
important to the Cleveland Browns as the rookie draft in April. The
Browns could pick up some good players who are either too expensive
for their original teams to keep, or are backups and deserve a
chance to start.
</P>
<P>
   Each team must expose five players, and the league is
strengthening several rules to keep teams from cheating. The main
one has to do with exposing injured players. Only one player of the
five can have been on injured reserve this past season or have had
a post-season operation. Either way, doctors must certify that the
player will be able to play in 1999.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A VOTE FOR THE BRONCOS
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville Jaguars played both the Broncos and Vikings
this season. They lost at Denver, 37-24, on Oct. 25 and lost at
Minnesota, 50-10, on Dec. 20. So which team is better in
Jacksonville's opinion, the Broncos or the Vikings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Denver is a stronger team,'' Jaguars linebacker Kevin
Hardy said. ``The Vikings have a lot of weapons, but I think Denver
is stronger because they can really pound the ball with Terrell
Davis. The Vikings rely more on the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville's Pro Bowl offensive tackle, Tony Boselli, wouldn't
voice an opinion, but he said he would rather play at Denver than
at the noisy Metrodome, which is one of the loudest stadiums in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   When Jacksonville played Minnesota, the Jaguars' linemen could
not hear the calls of quarterback Jonathan Quinn several times.
Boselli and other linemen had to turn around to hear the cadence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling him to yell louder,'' Boselli said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE JOB FAIR
</P>
<P>
   If Green Bay Packers Coach Mike Holmgren leaves Green Bay to
become general manager and coach of another team, the team he joins
must give the Packers a second-round pick. Holmgren could end up in
San Francisco or Seattle. . . . Stanford Coach Tyrone Willingham
continues to be discussed as a potential head coaching candidate in
the NFL, but friends say Willingham has no intention of leaving
Stanford this year unless something extremely attractive comes
along to change his mind. . . . The Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive
coordinator, Jim Haslett, interviewed last week for the
Philadelphia Eagles' head coaching job and remains the
front-runner. If Haslett does get it, look for him to secure Norv
Turner as his offensive coordinator _ if Turner is fired as
Washington's head coach. Haslett is also interested in the Giants'
defensive backs coach, Johnnie Lynn, as a defensive coordinator.  &QL;

SYDNEY-HOBART HORROR REMINISCENT OF FASTNET TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN ROUSMANIERE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Storms at sea may seem the stuff of romance to some, but not to
the sailors who desperately endure them.
</P>
<P>
   A horrific, unseasonal summer storm stretched over 900 miles
from Australia to New Zealand last week, and brought with it
30-foot waves and hurricane-strength winds that pounded the 115
sailboats in the 630-mile race from Sydney, Australia, to Hobart,
Tasmania. Six sailors died and 55 had to be rescued in a heroic air
and sea effort that included night helicopter sorties to pull
people out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to form settled conclusions about this recent
yachting disaster, but perhaps a look back at a similar tragedy can
shed some light on what happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 Fastnet Race between England and Ireland, 15 sailors
died, 74 were rescued and 24 boats were abandoned in conditions
akin to those in last week's Australian race.
</P>
<P>
   I sailed in the Fastnet, in an American 47-foot boat that
finished the race. The experience was terrifying. The wind was so
strong that it took our breath away. Holding on against the boat's
violent rolling and pitching, even making ourselves heard over the
oppressive roar, were harsh challenges. The waves, like three-story
breakers, threw tons of water on boats half their weight, rolling
many of them over and crushing their masts. And all this was at
night.
</P>
<P>
   When the wind and waves were on the bow, as they were for the
few boats that kept racing in the Fastnet and last week in the
Sydney-Hobart, the violent pummeling was constant. And it was not
much more secure with the wind on the stern for the many boats that
had dropped out of the race and had run for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Another similarity between the two events is unfortunate: as the
storms died, finger-pointing thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Some people contend that the organizers should have called off
the races when the storm hit. This is an irrelevancy. Canceling the
race would not beam the boats and sailors up from their dangerous
circumstances. Racing or not, they still had many miles and many
hours to sail in horrendous conditions before they reached shore.
Most of the fatalities in the 1979 Fastnet and at least one in the
1998 Sydney-Hobart were on boats that abandoned racing.
</P>
<P>
   Should the starts have been postponed or canceled because of
threatening weather? The Fastnet storm was a major surprise in
1979, when relatively primitive meteorological systems were
available (many weather maps were still compiled using reports from
ships at sea).
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the satellite pictures that were available before
the start showed a large low-pressure system building and moving
slowly toward the race course. After the start, it sped up and grew
rapidly. Meteorologists were tracking the storm, and their
forecasts for gale-force, 55-knot winds were heard by the race
organizers and the sailors before and during the race.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures to start on time are always tremendous.
Several years ago, the Cruising Club of America postponed the start
of a Newport-Bermuda Race because of a hurricane threat and
received little appreciation from the 2,000-odd sailors and their
families whose schedules were thrown into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In yacht racing, the tradition is to start the race, then rely
on the individual crews to decide whether to carry on based on
their on-the-spot evaluation of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sensible approach. Boats vary greatly in size and
seaworthiness, and weather can change dramatically every few miles.
For all these reasons, the racing rules specify that the ultimate
authority to enter and finish a race lies with the captain. In both
the Fastnet and the Sydney-Hobart, most boats stopped racing as
soon as their crews sensed they were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   While such risks may seem unacceptable on the rare occasions
when a fleet encounters a storm, thousands of amateur sailors will
continue to go out in ocean races. Almost all these 700-mile ocean
races are about as risky as a summer five-day camping trip in the
White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   If racing 35- to 80-foot sailboats on the ocean has come to seem
more risky, it's partly because of the appearance of a number of
highly publicized, supremely macho professional round-the-world
races sailed directly into harm's way in wild boats. In extreme
events like this, the risk is comparable to that of an attempt on
Mount Everest, where the weather is always life-threatening. These
events, like the Around Alone single-handed race which,
coincidentally, took boats into the Tasman Sea a few days after
last week's storm, provide entertainment to those of us who follow
them on the Internet. They are not relevant, however, to the
sailing that most people do.
</P>
<P>
   But while judgment can be suspended on the Sydney-to-Hobart
race, we should not be blind to two real concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the type of boats going out on the ocean in these
races. In a trend that began before the 1979 Fastnet, racing
sailboats have become faster and also less stable. They are built
for racing in bays, sounds and other protected waters, not on the
ocean, where heavier boats are more seaworthy and seakindly. Yet
these racy, new designs are still raced in deep water.
</P>
<P>
   As the yacht designer Olin J. Stephens 2d has observed, ``It
seems that two types of racing and two types of boats have become
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the Sydney-Hobart fleet will indicate whether this
confusion may have resulted in more catastrophe than this really
frightful storm may have warranted.
</P>
<P>
   My second concern is that, as in most sports today, the stakes
of sailing competition are being raised and misdirected by
commercial interests. Sponsorship, coverage by the news media and
professionalism used to be the tail of the sporting dog. Now they
often are wagging it, even in sailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is notably true in the round-the-world events and the
America's Cup, all of which are wholly sponsored and with
professional racers. Other races, including the Sydney-Hobart,
still include thousands of amateur sailors, most of them skilled,
but even they participate under the demands _ implicit and explicit
_ of corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would intentionally compromise safety, yet a number of
land-bound commercial considerations will inevitably distract
competitors from focusing on seamanship. Prizes are larger,
publicity is wider and winners today gain far more attention than
mere runners-up. To make the corporate sponsors happy and to
guarantee their return to cover the event's expenses the next time,
finishing the race is expected of participants.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to win has always been at the core of every sport,
but it was also always tempered by reasonable concerns about the
competitors' safety. Today, the decision to keep competing in
dangerous conditions may have to take into account concerns far
distant from the boat's and crew's immediate situation. Therefore,
safety may lose its priority. In the 1979 Fastnet, almost all crews
that I know of either dropped out or kept sailing based solely on
their own evaluation of their safety. Almost 20 years later, let's
hope that was the case in Australia.

RUTGERS RELISHES CHALLENGING TENNESSEE IN THE GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last two years, the Rutgers women's basketball program
has been rising steadily, like a mountain climber striving to reach
new heights. Last season, the Scarlet Knights reached the Round of
16 in the NCAA tournament. This season Rutgers is 10-2 and ranked
No. 15 in the Associated Press poll, and the Scarlet Knights are
expected to challenge Connecticut and Notre Dame for the Big East
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday afternoon, Rutgers will take another significant
step. In the first women's college basketball game at Madison
Square Garden since 1981, Rutgers will face Tennessee, the
defending national champion and the most dominant women's team this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a showcase for both teams, the type of event that can
help a program's reputation and recruiting. For the players, it
will be a memorable experience. And for Rutgers, it will be another
chance to show how far the program has come, and how far it has the
potential to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great game not just for us, but for women's college
basketball,'' said C. Vivian Stringer, now in her fourth season as
the Rutgers coach. ``I understand the historical significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer was also part of the last women's game at the Garden,
as the coach of Cheyney State in 1981, when her team played Rutgers
as part of a doubleheader. Louisiana State played Old Dominion in
the other game. More than 17 years later, Stringer is ready to do
Manhattan again, and according to Garden officials, about 11,000
tickets have already been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been so many years since there has been a women's game
at the Garden, and it could open the door for other games to
follow,'' Stringer said. ``I want us to look good. If we can play
the way we need to, we can come out of there with a win. But we'll
have to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers was eagerly looking ahead to Sunday following
Wednesday's 79-67 victory over Georgetown, which extended the
Rutgers winning streak to four games. It was a typically balanced
offensive performance by the Scarlet Knights, who have five players
averaging at least 9 points a game. The 5-foot-10-inch junior
forward Shawnetta Stewart is a versatile scorer and solid defender,
the senior guard Tomora Young is the team's main 3-point shooter
and forward Linda Miles is coming off a splendid 19-point
performance against Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers is talented and deep, dominated by sophomores and
juniors who keep improving. Key players like Stewart, Miles, Tasha
Pointer, Davalyn Cunningham, Usha Gilmore, Tammy Sutton-Brown and
Coko Eggleston will all return next season, and the foundation for
a consistent top 20 team has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all measurements, our program is probably ahead of
schedule,'' said Stringer, the only women's coach to take two
different schools (Cheyney State and Iowa) to the Final Four. ``But
I don't tell our kids we're ahead of schedule. I'm not satisfied,
and I fully expect us to reach another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing Tennessee, which has won three consecutive NCAA
championships, will show Stringer exactly where Rutgers stands. The
No. 2-ranked Lady Vols (10-1) will enter the Garden riding a
nine-game winning streak, and the dynasty built by coach Pat
Summitt looks as strong as ever. Sunday's game will be a homecoming
for Chamique Holdsclaw, the 6-2 senior forward from Queens who is
the nation's best player, averaging 21.6 points and 8.5 rebounds.
Holdsclaw, the sophomore forward Tamika Catchings and the sophomore
guard Semeka Randall give Tennessee three all-Americans from last
year in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   A 78-68 loss to Purdue is the only blemish on the Lady Vols'
record, and they have looked extremely impressive since then. In
their last game, they dominated Mississippi, 92-51.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would not play Tennessee at this time of year,
but I'm happy,'' Stringer said. ``They're a great team with a great
coach. Just to have the opportunity to play in that great arena is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. These young women may not
appreciate it now, but when they walk in that great arena, they'll
know. I think they'll step up and rise to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the challenge of facing Tennessee was too much for
Rutgers. It was the Lady Vols who ended the Scarlet Knights' season
by whipping them, 92-60, in the NCAA tournament. The Rutgers
players have not forgotten, and they insist Sunday will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no intimidation,'' Gilmore said. ``We learned a
lot last year, but it's also just a game, a regular-season game.
This is not the Sweet 16 or the Final Four. We're going to try and
take care of business, and if we win, thank you, Lord. But if
something else happens, we're not going to drop our heads. The
season is still going to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   But as regular-season games go, they do not get much bigger.
Stringer said that for weeks, part of her practices have focused on
Tennessee. It is an opportunity that Stringer and her players
relish, a chance to shine on center stage. And no matter what
happens, Stringer knows the game itself is another milestone for
the Rutgers program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many players can walk around saying they had a chance
to play at the Garden,'' Stringer said. ``Thirty years from now,
it'll be something they still remember.''  &QL;

REMEMBERING '94, SOME ARE TAKING PLEASURE IN NBA'S PAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   People in baseball wouldn't wish their 1994 experience on their
worst enemy, but David Stern isn't their worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   As the National Basketball Association enters its do-or-die
week, baseball officials know the feeling. But all they did was
kill the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Stern, the
NBA commissioner, is on the brink of wiping out an entire season.
If he and the team owners take that fatal step, they will go from
history of one sort to history of another, from having been the
only league never to have lost a game to a work stoppage to being
the only league ever to lose a whole season.
</P>
<P>
   No one in baseball will say it publicly, but some officials have
acknowledged privately that they have enjoyed watching Stern
plummet from one stage toward the other. The perfect commissioner
of the perfect league could use some soiling, they have long felt,
and now, even if a jury-rigged season is salvaged, the stains will
be indelible.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has an economic stake in the NBA's
problems as well. The NBA has been perceived in recent years as the
sport of the moment. Sports fans do not have unlimited money to
spend, so if more becomes available to spend on tickets to baseball
games or on baseball merchandise, so much the better for major
league teams, which desperately seek increased revenue.
</P>
<P>
   As a labor dispute, the NBA's problem is no different from the
one baseball endured in 1994. It's all about the division of
revenue between owners and players. The only difference is that the
baseball dispute prompted the players to strike, while the
basketball fight resulted in an owners' lockout.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the players walked out Aug. 12, and after a few more
futile bargaining sessions, Bud Selig, then the acting baseball
commissioner, set Sept. 9 as the day on which the rest of the
season and the World Series would be canceled if no agreement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the deadline, the union presented a new proposal
to the owners centered on a tax that would be levied on the
revenues and the payrolls of the 16 higher-revenue clubs. More than
a year later, it was a luxury tax on the five highest payrolls that
brought an end to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the deadline, however, the owners' negotiators
rejected the tax plan, sticking instead to their quest for a salary
cap. As a footnote to baseball labor history, one member of the
seven-person contingent that presented the new proposal to
management was Kevin Brown, who recently became the sport's
highest-paid player and whose $105 million contract should put the
Los Angeles Dodgers firmly in the tax-paying group.
</P>
<P>
   Selig let the Sept. 9 deadline pass. Five more days went by
before the owners voted by 26-2 to cancel the rest of the season
and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has set Thursday as the NBA deadline. If the two sides
have no agreement, he has said, he will recommend to the owners
that they call off the season. Taking an even harder position,
going into the weekend the commissioner had refused to meet with
union officials to receive their latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The union responded by saying no meeting, no proposal. But
details were leaked to the news media, so the league knew the union
was willing to place a cap of $15 million on individual player
salaries. No such limit exists in any major sports league.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Stern has lobbied heavily with the players,
twice mailing them details of league proposals and urging the union
to allow the players to vote on the league's latest proposal. Even
more aggressively, he has called the union's 19-player negotiating
committee a runaway group that is holding the rest of the players
hostage, has accused some agents of destructively influencing
negotiations and has suggested that players who express opposing
views are disciplined by the union.
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, Stern's No. 1 target among the agents, has said
Stern's words and actions are those of a desperate man. Indeed, an
outsider watching and listening to the commissioner could
reasonably conclude that he is desperate to save the season his
lockout has jeopardized and wants the players to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been more noise than substance to the
complaints about agents' influence on the talks, in the baseball
strike, three agents were instrumental in helping lay the
groundwork for an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball union's use of a negotiating committee, for which
it has been criticized, is routine. In each baseball labor
negotiation, the union's executive board has appointed a
negotiating committee that has had the authority to make a deal.
The dissenting comments of a handful of rank-and-file players do
not demand a major change in the committee's position.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any reason for a union to listen to a commissioner
when he calls for a vote of the membership. These negotiations have
been far different from those of 1995, when Stern had a friendlier
union head, Simon Gourdine, to bargain with.
</P>
<P>
   If the season is canceled, the NBA and the players face a risk
of unknown proportions. Once the season is lost, the incentive for
an agreement lessens greatly and positions harden. After the World
Series went down in 1994, negotiators did not meet for two months,
and it took a judge's ruling, not collective bargaining, to enable
the 1995 season to begin.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA does not have a 1998-99 season, no one can guarantee
1999-2000.

<P>
   YOU'VE BEEN TRADED, SON
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boone remembers the time Al Campanis, then the Los Angeles
Dodgers' general manager, traded his own son, Jimmy, to the Kansas
City Royals. Boone never thought he would have a similar
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange emotional feeling,'' Boone said. ``I've had the
opportunity in the course of my career to do some pretty unusual
things and be around some special things. I never had the
opportunity to trade your kid. It's pretty unique.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Cincinnati Reds' front office, Boone
participated in the November trade that sent his son Bret Boone to
the Atlanta Braves for Denny Neagle. Did Bob, a former major league
catcher, feel any guilt?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm pretty analytical,'' he said. ``My wife is a little
upset at me. I tend to look at things and say what's the best for
all parties here. This is a good deal for him. He lives right by
the complex in spring training. He doesn't have to move. He and his
wife are building a home in Orlando. When he goes on the road, if
she wants to go home, it's an easy plane flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone was the Reds' second baseman. His younger brother,
Aaron, could be the Reds' third baseman next season. ``Aaron's his
own man,'' their father said. ``He and his brother are very good
friends. You don't like to see your friend leave, but it'll have no
effect on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone the elder is not completely void of feelings when he
watches his sons play. Explaining that he looks at them from two
perspectives, father and baseball appraiser, Boone said: ``I
probably get a little more nervous for them when they're in
situations. `Come on, you gotta get a hit here, show off a little.'
I managed against Bret a couple years in the coast league and I
coached him when I was a bench coach in '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around it more than most. I don't know if it's
easier, but you get used to it. You get used to watching them with
a daddy's eye and a professional eye. My job is to evaluate, so you
have to be analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   WHEN $15 MILLION ISN'T ENOUGH
</P>
<P>
   If a pitcher is paid $15 million a year, he should reasonably be
expected to be one of the best pitchers in the league, certainly
among the top five. But the Dodgers apparently don't think $15
million is enough for Kevin Brown. His contract calls for award
bonuses, including for his placement in the Cy Young award voting.
If he finishes as low as fifth, he receives $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   That $15 million a year isn't enough for other expenditures,
either. Much has been made of the 12 round-trip flights in a
private jet for his family to selected games _ he will make enough
to buy his own plane _ but the Dodgers will also pay for ground
transportation and eight premium season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are not alone in their eagerness to force
unnecessary bonuses and payments on players. Along with $13 million
a year, the Mets will give Mike Piazza bonuses for certain awards
and the use of a luxury box at Shea Stadium for regular-season and
post-season games.
</P>
<P>
   On top of his $13.1 million a year and award bonuses, Randy
Johnson has the use of a luxury box at the Arizona Diamondbacks'
park and also gets two season tickets for the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles aren't giving Albert Belle tickets for
basketball games, their games or plane flights, but they will give
him $1 million on top of his $13 million salary if he wins the most
valuable player award. If he finishes 10th in the voting, he gets
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Bernie Williams missed out in his $12.5 million-a-year
contract with the Yankees. No plane flights, no luxury box, no
bonuses for being 12th in the MVP voting. Just his salary.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the daily parade of giant container ships and
tankers negotiates the twisting inner channels of New York Harbor,
the waves pushed by the bows of the computer-guided vessels wash
through the rotting oak ribs of a ghost fleet.
</P>
<P>
   All along the shores, particularly in the passages between
Staten Island and New Jersey, hundreds of hulks of sailing ships,
side-wheelers, tugboats and other craft lie sunken in the mud. They
are the last vestige of a bygone era of wood, sail and steam, when
maritime trade was not tucked away at the modern terminals near
Newark International Airport, but instead bustled broadly in the
waters around the piers of Manhattan and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The skeletons of this old fleet are vanishing under the press of
shoreline redevelopment and wood-eating organisms that were
deterred by pollution but now flourish in cleaner water.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of surveying the harbor, the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, which is responsible for keeping channels clear, has
drawn up a list of 75 historically significant vessels to be
studied and possibly salvaged before all the hulks are cleared to
prevent drifting timbers from threatening passing ships.
</P>
<P>
   The boats contain no treasure, but to a small group of maritime
historians, archeologists and artists, they represent a trove of
information about the days in the late-19th and early 20th
centuries, when New York was the biggest seaport in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's living history, just lying there,'' said Peter Eagleton,
61, a retired ship broker who spends spare hours in the harbor,
sketching the remains of the old craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This harbor holds a whole century of American maritime
architecture and ship types,'' Eagleton said after a tour of the
Kill Van Kull, the channel separating Staten Island and Bayonne,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In a studio in his home in Yonkers, he turns his sketches into
paintings and pastel drawings. On his living room wall hang more
than a dozen portraits of ships that had once been grand and
graceful but were now disintegrating, or gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a ship is finished, it's like a biography,'' Eagleton
said. ``She's been all over the world or the local harbor. To paint
one is like painting a story.''
</P>
<P>
   If each shipwreck is a biography, then the half-mile-long marine
scrap yard owned by the Witte family on the west side of Staten
Island is a library.
</P>
<P>
   Ships of every description lie there, some rusted so thoroughly
that their iron decks are as thin and weak as old cardboard. There
are steam-powered tugs and ferries, navy vessels, wood barges that
once carried rail cars across the Hudson and more.
</P>
<P>
   The air is filled with the groaning of cranes lifting piles of
scrap iron and the hiss and pop of cutting torches wielded by crews
of ``burners,'' the men who dismantle the vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The yard provides a genealogy of the last 70 years of harbor
traffic, with the vessels unintentionally arrayed chronologically.
The ones salvaged earliest are those beached on the mud flats
closest to shore where marsh grass now grows through their frames.
</P>
<P>
   Those towed there most recently lie farthest from the beach in
the middle of the Arthur Kill, the waterway separating New York
from New Jersey. On the opposite shore, there is a constant flow of
modern ships to oil terminals and container piers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one side, you've got the working port, on the other side,
it's like going through someone's attic,'' said Lynn Rakos, one of
two archeologists for the Corps of Engineers who have been
surveying the wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden amid the heaps of hulls is PC 1217, a 173-foot patrol
craft that escorted convoys in World War II to deter submarine
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, seven former crew members traveled to Staten Island
from as far as Minnesota and California for a reunion. They went to
the scrap yard, but could only stare at their old vessel from afar,
because a gaggle of rotting craft, loosely connected by gangplanks,
lay between it and the shore.
</P>
<P>
   PC 1217 was a rusty shadow of the vessel that in 1944 carried
them safely through a monster hurricane near the Bahamas that
cracked the hull of a destroyer, the U.S.S. Warrington, drowning
248 seamen. ``It was hard to see her like that,'' recalled James
Riss, 73, the ship's sonar man and now a retired IBM employee in
Bethlehem, Pa. ``This was a ship of the Navy. We scrubbed the decks
and took care of her, and now she sits rotting in the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most historically significant wrecks in the harbor,
the Occidental, lies in a cove below the humming traffic crossing
the Bayonne Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's ribs only break the surface of the water at high
tide, still hinting at the graceful curves of its bow. But the
remains provide the barest sketch of the three-masted sailing ship
that was launched with much fanfare in Bath, Me., in 1874.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500-ton square rigger spent its first years carrying grain
from California to Europe, pounding its way through Cape Horn gales
and Atlantic hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1906, steam was supplanting sail. The great vessel's
topmasts were removed, and it spent its last years as a barge,
toting coal to New York Harbor and other ports along the East
Coast. In the 1930s, the Occidental and seven other old sailing
ships were towed into Port Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Harbor historians still cringe about an incident in Port Johnson
in 1984, when construction crews cut off the sterns of three of the
sailing ships lying next to the Occidental to make way for an oil
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the demolition work
without any public hearings or review, said Nancy Brighton, the
corps archeologist. Now the corps is paying more attention to
determining the value of each derelict ship before it is removed,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Brouwer, a historian at the South Street Seaport Museum,
had once clambered in the water-filled holds of those ships with a
measuring tape and notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Most ships in the last century were built without paper plans,
he said, so the details of its construction are lost when the ship
is destroyed. Their hull shapes were extrapolated from small wooden
models, whose measurements were translated into templates laid out
in giant lofts where beams and ribs were cut.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, he tried to persuade the corps to rescue
parts of the Jane Moseley, also called the Minerva, a steam-powered
side-wheeler that in the late 1800s carried passengers from Newark
to Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-foot ship, built in Brooklyn in 1873, had a rare
walking-beam engine, a design that employed a single piston 11 feet
long and 4 feet across.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry lay rotting in the shallows off the north side of
Staten Island, with the tall A-frame apparatus that held the piston
jutting above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions dragged on. The Seaport Museum offered to preserve
the relic and planned to build a working model of the engine, but
no money ever became available, Ms. Brighton said.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, on a tour of the area, there was no sign of
the old ship's engine. ``Things float away and disappear,'' Ms.
Brighton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Crull Baade, a scholar of the classics, a teacher and a
co-author of a widely used Latin textbook series, died on Dec. 15
at his home in Rockport, Mass. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said a spokeswoman for the
Brooks School in North Andover, Mass. Baade taught and headed the
classics and theater departments at the college preparatory school
until his retirement eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Fort Wayne, Ind., he graduated in 1949 from Yale
University, where he also earned his doctorate degree in 1956. In
the intervening years he served as an Army Intelligence analyst and
operations chief in the Korean War from 1951 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He first taught at the Brooks School from 1949 to 1951, and he
returned in 1964. Over the years he also taught the classics at
Yale, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., Columbia University and
St. Stephen's School in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author or co-author of six books on Greek and Latin
writers. His scholarship was recognized early in his career when he
was awarded the Prix de Rome for 1956-57 by the American Academy in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a co-author with Charles Jenney and Rogers Scudder
of ``Jenney's First Year Latin'' and ``Jenney's Second Year
Latin.'' First published in 1968, both texts went to seven
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Baade is survived by his wife, Isobel Milne Baade; a daughter,
Anne C. Baade of Larchmont, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard to near-blizzard conditions will rage across the
western Great Lakes and upper Mississippi Valley on Sunday as a
sluggish, but still formidable, low pressure system grinds slowly
northward across Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Bands of moderate to heavy snow will develop across parts of
eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and the upper peninsula of
Michigan. The heaviest snow will likely fall over the latter
region, where moisture gleaned from Lake Superior plays an
important role.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the north-northwest will average 20 to 40 mph, with
gusts exceeding 50 mph in some areas. Visibility will be reduced
below one-quarter mile in snow and blowing snow. Drifting snow is
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the seeds of an ice storm will burgeon across
interior New England as moisture streaming inland from the Atlantic
glides over cold air holding tenaciously near the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing rain or sleet are possible over inland valleys across
southern Maine, interior New Hampshire and Vermont, where, Saturday
morning, temperatures bottomed out near minus 15 degrees. Upstate
eastern New York will also be at risk for icing. Precipitation will
change to rain near the coast from southeast New York to southeast
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will accompany a cold front associated
with the storm system from southeast Virginia to Florida. In the
wake of the front, winds gusting to 40 mph are more will buffet the
Middle Atlantic and Southeast seaboards.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: GUESSING GAME
</P>
<P>
   Measuring snowfall is fraught with error. Inserting a measuring
stick into a snowpack is not reliable, given the rather rapid
compaction of accumulating snow. Moreover, variable winds can cause
snow to pile up deeper in some areas, making a representative
snowfall more difficult to assess. Some observers melt snow
captured in a precipitation gauge and then take an educated guess
of the ratio of meltwater to snow. On average, one inch of
meltwater is equivalent to 10 inches of snow. But this ratio varies
with temperature, rendering the task of determining snowfall a
guessing game.

MARY ANN UNGER, 53, A NOTED SCULPTOR AND CURATOR, IS DEAD
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Ann Unger, a sculptor and curator, died last
Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York in 1945, Ms. Unger began making sculpture as a
child in classes at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1967, she received
a bachelor's degree in art at Mount Holyoke College, where she
learned to weld, cast bronze and carve marble. After a year of
graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, she
spent several years traveling, including a trip alone through North
Africa. She then received a master of fine arts degree in 1975 from
Columbia University, where she studied with Ronald Bladen and
George Sugarman. The playful, undulating shapes of the pieces she
started exhibiting in the late 1970s reflected Sugarman's
influence.
</P>
<P>
   These evolved into tensile structures whose repeating arcs
evoked both Islamic architecture and boughs of trees. The style
served Ms. Unger well in numerous public commissions, mostly
recently in 1991 with ``Ode to Tatlin,'' a pair of tall, crisp
colonnade-like curving forms that face each other, forming a kind
of elliptical gateway, at the Aaron Copland School of Music at
Queens College.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Unger's breast cancer was diagnosed in 1985, she
exhibited a more expressionistic side in her art. That year, she
organized an exhibition titled ``The Figure as an Image of the
Psyche'' at the Sculpture Center on East 69th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years she became known for dark, bulbous,
beamlike forms that she often laid out or propped up in clusters.
Made of hydrocal, a lightweight plaster, over steel armatures, with
surfaces that appeared to be scarred and scorched, these pieces
could suggest giant twigs, human limbs or sausages, as well as the
aftermath of some mysterious ritual or catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to conjure the body without actually depicting
it, these works occupied a territory defined by Eva Hesse and
Louise Bourgeois. But the pieces combined a sense of mythic power
with a sensitivity to shape that was all their own, achieving a
subtlety of expression that belied their monumental scale.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Unger's work is in the collections of the Hirschhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and
the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her most recent solo show was at
the Trans Hudson Gallery on West 13th Street in Manhattan in 1997.
She had recently completed a series of works that are to be shown
at Trans Hudson in May.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Geoffrey Biddle, a photographer
and assistant chairman of photography at the Parsons School of
Design; a daughter, Eve; her parents, William and Dorothy Unger of
Tenafly, N.J., and a brother, Christopher Unger of Milwaukee.

DAVID MANNERS, 98, FILM ACTOR MENACED ON SCREEN BY LUGOSI 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Calif., Ill.)   By ERIC PACE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Manners, who starred in Hollywood films in the 1930's and
played the hero in Tod Browning's 1931 ``Dracula'' and other
classic horror movies of that day, died on Dec. 23 in the health
center of a retirement community in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was
98.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade ago, Manners modestly told a film historian that
horror films were his ``only claim to movie fame.'' But horror
films were only a fraction of the more than three dozen movies in
which he appeared during that era, often in romantic leads.
</P>
<P>
   In Browning's ``Dracula,'' which starred Bela Lugosi in the
title role, Manners played the role of John Harker, the sturdy
fiance of the heroine, Mina, played by Helen Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1932 film ``The Mummy,'' which starred Boris Karloff in
the title role, Manners and Zita Johann portrayed a terrified pair
of lovers. In Edgar G. Ullmer's ``Black Cat'' (1934), Manners,
playing a young American novelist, got third billing after Karloff,
as the leader of a cult of devil worshipers, and Lugosi, as the
husband of one of Karloff's victims.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his romantic roles, Manners played the fiance of
Katharine Hepburn in her film debut in ``A Bill of Divorcement''
(1932). His other partners in on-screen romances included Barbara
Stanwyck in ``The Miracle Woman'' (1931) and Loretta Young in
``Kismet'' (1930), in which he played the caliph.
</P>
<P>
   Manners was born far from Arabia or filmland, in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, the son of George M. Acklom and the former Lillian Manners.
His original name was Rauff de Ryther Duan Acklom, but he evidently
felt that plain David Manners would look better in lights.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the University of Toronto. After training in acting
at the Hart House Theater in Toronto, he made his stage debut there
in 1924 in the title role of Euripides' ``Hippolytus.'' He also
performed in plays in New York and Chicago before moving on to
Hollywood and in the 1940's made further appearances on the New
York stage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Hollywood successes, a friend recalled, Manners came
to dislike the pressures and pretensions of the film world and left
Hollywood for a ranch in the Mojave Desert of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   A book of excerpts from the journals he kept during those years
was published with the title ``Awakening From the Dream of Me.''
His writings in his later years also included the novels
``Convenient Season'' and ``Under Running Laughter'' and a
nonfiction work, ``The Soundless Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage ended in divorce. He leaves no immediate
survivors.

   AUS-Y2K-DOOM _ From their extravagantly untidy goat farm hidden
in the Texas cedars, Kerry and Prisca Wooster are trying to jump
start America's survival instincts. The Woosters are self-anointed
messengers of the millennium. From this remote and unlikely nerve
center, where rusted ghosts of cars and scrap metal outnumber the
15 goats, they send high-tech warning sirens to the Internet. The
message: The Year 2000 computer bug will push life so far off-line
that only the well-prepared will survive. (Gamino, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   w/AUS-Y2K-ELPASO _ The gravity of the year 2000 glitch became
clear the day the lights went out in El Paso. At 4:30 p.m. on
August 21, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental
Retardation lost power at a facility where 123 people with mental
disabilities live. No contingency plan was in place for a major
electric failure. The year 2000 computer problem had nothing to do
with the crisis in El Paso. But state officials say incidents just
like it _ or worse _ could occur in Texas if state agencies do not
conquer the Y2K bug. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   AUS-Y2KARE _ Depending on which expert you listen to, the Y2K
problem could be as unnoticeable as a minute tick on a seismic
flatline or a cacophonous pre-Apocalyptic roar shattering our
otherwise Zen-like calm. Where the differing opinions on the
computer bug from Hell meet is that we should all, to some degree,
be prepared. While most caution going overboard on the food
hoarding and money withdrawal, others say you can never do too
much. (Kallenberg, Austin American-Statesman)

   RIVER-RESTORE _ HABERSHAM COUNTY, Ga. _ Severe erosion along the
Soque River was causing the loss of100 tons of soil a year on
Justin Savage's farm in Habersham County in North Georgia. The soil
was washing into the Soque, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River,
making the stream unfit for fish and destroying its natural beauty.
Now, an intensive project by EPA and environmental groups is
restoring the natural flow of the river and the native vegetation
to bring the stream back to life. Already, native brown trout have
returned to the stream. Seabrook. The project is being watched
closely by water experts around the Southeast as an example how a

   WEST WINDSOR, N.J. _ It is the week after Christmas, schools are
out and in towns everywhere grandparents and grandchildren, cousins
and uncles, sleepover friends and just moms and dads are flocking
to the local movie house. Then, the minute they sit down, a giant
with hair up to here sits down in front of them and blocks the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   To hear moviegoers tell it, that universal gripe is becoming
less common thanks to the latest in theater design: stadium-style
seating that puts patrons head and shoulders above the row in
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a theater closer to us, but it seems that every time
Kerianne sits down there someone blocks the view, and that just
ruins the experience for her,'' said Nancy Watlington, who with her
husband, Don, was just then sitting down in the Regal Town Center
Cinema here to see ``The Rugrats Movie'' with their 3{-year-old
granddaughter, Kerianne.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a grown-up seated in front of her, the little girl's
view of the screen was clear.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when entertainment technologies are converging _ car
stereos sound like home systems, televisions act as computer
screens and a combination of multichannel home sound and high
definition television promises to mimic the real movies _ theater
owners are striving to offer more of the comforts of home,
including an unobstructed view of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going to the movies on the old slab floors for
nearly 100 years, and in a way it's amazing that it hadn't changed
earlier,'' said Phil Zacheretti, Regal's senior vice president of
marketing and advertising. But since the movies' modern competition
includes not just broadcast television but also videotape, digital
video discs and cable, ``our thought is that you have to give
customers extra value to bring them out,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium seating started in Dallas in 1994, and it still tends to
be found mainly in new suburban multiplexes. But Regal Cinemas,
United Artists, Loews Cineplex and other theater chains have plans
to bring the design to more city movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every theater we build now is stadium, and I think you'd be
hard-pressed to find any theater company that isn't doing it,''
said Marc J. Pascucci, senior vice president of Loews Cineplex,
which has 2,800 screens at 450 locations worldwide. ``Not only is
the sight line better but you also get increased legroom.''
</P>
<P>
   And because stadium seating theaters have to have higher roofs
to accommodate the 8- to 14-inch rise between each row, the new
theaters can have bigger screens in relation to their seating
capacity. ``You get a bigger wall for your screen because you're
building a higher box,'' Pascucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Loews plans to open two new stadium seating multiplexes in
Manhattan in the spring and summer, including a 13-screen building
in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The big movie chains are also busy converting some of their
conventional theaters to stadium seating, although Pascucci of
Loews said such retrofitting was difficult to do in any but the
most recently built spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium seating costs about half again as much to build as
conventional seating with a sloping floor, theater officials said,
and the design reduces the number of seats in a given space by 10
to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since conventional theaters are still far more numerous,
theater owners dare not charge much more for the new seating,
Zacheretti said. Regal's $4.75 matinee admission is the same as
what conventional theaters charge in central New Jersey, and its
evening rate of $7.75 is only 25 to 50 cents higher than most of
its competition.
</P>
<P>
   So with school out and the afternoon free, Bonnie Gagnon of
Allentown, N.J., took two children to a matinee at the Regal
specifically to take advantage of stadium seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be so hard to go to the movies with little kids because
a lot of times they just can't see, unless you sit way down in
front,'' Ms. Gagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, they sat only a few rows back _ and up _ because
the children wanted to sit in one of the double-wide love seats,
another feature adapted from home television-viewing by many
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The love seats are actually designed for parents with small
children, Zacheretti said, but love finds a way to use them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit in them with my husband,'' said Ann-Marie Adamko, of
East Windsor, ``because you can, you know ...'' She made a cradling
motion with one arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in one once, with a girl,'' said Kevin Perdoni, a
freshman at Rowan College. ``It was her idea.''

SALE OF A LAVISH HOTEL IS MIRED IN LEGAL FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Four Seasons, whose lavish rooms and panoramic
views of the New York skyline make it one of the world's most
expensive hotels, is not an easy sell.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the sleek 52-story hotel, on 57th Street east
of Madison Avenue, has trouble filling its 370 rooms, where the
limestone, onyx and beechwood interiors feature bedside switches
that operate the window blinds and bathrooms with color televisions
and tubs that fill in 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But only two years after buying the Four Seasons _ where the
3,000-square-foot presidential suite goes for $10,000 a night _ a
Hong Kong company that needs to sell the prized hotel to pay
mounting debts finds itself unable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Lai Sun Hotels, recently became ensnared in a legal
battle with Gene E. Phillips, a Dallas real estate operator, and a
company he controls, American Realty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who said in court that he signed a purchase deal with
Lai Sun, has brought the sales effort to a virtual halt, even as
three other wealthy buyers are clamoring to snap up the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It is only the latest evidence that New York real estate is not
for the fainthearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is perceived as the capital of the world and the Four
Seasons is one of the top hotels in the city,'' said Daniel Lesser,
senior director of the hotel group at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a real
estate broker. ``But in New York, real estate deals can be a
full-contact sport.''
</P>
<P>
   With a financial crisis sweeping Hong Kong and much of Asia, Lai
Sun has been forced to raise cash by selling the Four Seasons, as
well as the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles. The Four
Seasons, which has no connection to the Four Seasons restaurant in
New York, is considered a world-class trophy by hoteliers. It has
the highest average room rates in the country, at more than $600 a
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lai Sun owns a 50 percent stake in the hotel through a complex
web of foreign companies that, according to the lawsuit, were set
up to avoid income taxes, a not uncommon real estate practice. The
other owners are also based in Hong Kong, and real estate
executives say that each one has tried to tinker with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not able to speak as a unified group,'' said one real
estate banker who negotiated unsuccessfully with Lai Sun in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   American Realty Trust contends in a lawsuit filed earlier this
month in New York State Supreme Court that it made a $2 million
down payment and signed a letter of intent in October to buy the
Four Seasons for $270 million, $80 million more than Lai Sun paid
for it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of closing on the deal in November, the lawsuit
says, Lai Sun fraudulently used the offer ``as a stalking horse to
generate other offers for the hotel.'' American Realty is seeking
$80 million in damages and an injunction barring Lai Sun from
selling the hotel to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   In response to American Realty's complaints, the lawsuit says,
Lai Sun promised to abide by the preliminary deal but then demanded
an additional $15 million down payment, which the Dallas company
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives and rival bidders said that in November
and December at least three other investment groups, including
Apollo Real Estate Advisers, reviewed financial documents in what
is referred to as the war room at the Four Seasons and were
interested in buying the hotel. Several real estate bankers
complained that American Realty tied up the hotel and then tried,
unsuccessfully, to secure financing for the acquisition. Lawyers
for both American Realty and Lai Sun in New York declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, whose family trust is the largest single shareholder
of American Realty, once headed the Southmark Corp., a large real
estate company that fell into bankruptcy court in 1989 after losing
$1 billion in nine months. Angry investors waged a legal war
against him that continues to this day. Still, companies controlled
by Phillips bought many of Southmark's assets at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel analysts contend that the longer it takes to sell the Four
Seasons in New York, the less money Lai Sun will make on the deal.
They said that the market in New York had peaked, with sale prices
having retreated since the spring.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Strategic Hotel Properties of Chicago walked away from
a deal to buy the Four Seasons for $370 million, or about $1
million a room. Five months later, American Realty signed a letter
of intent to buy the hotel for $730,000 a room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hotel should have been sold a year ago,'' said Arthur
Adler, a partner at the Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp., a real estate
investment bank. ``It's a little bit tougher now.''

INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON USELESS SPRINKLERS IN FATAL FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ky.)  (dw) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators may never find out who turned off the
sprinkler system in a Brooklyn high-rise building where three
firefighters died in a fire last month. But an equally troubling
mystery is how the system's uselessness could have gone
undiscovered _ probably for years.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance workers at the 10-story residence for the elderly,
which is run by the New York City Housing Authority, have told
investigators that they never knew the sprinkler system had been
turned off, because they did not know about several closed valves
hidden in a drop ceiling on the first floor. These valves were
critical because they controlled the flow of water to the
sprinklers on the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Fire Department records and interviews with
city officials, several of the workers responsible for the system
were required as part of their city training to review schematic
plans of the sprinklers that should have disclosed the location of
those valves.
</P>
<P>
   Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the Housing Authority, said three
employees at the building had been tested on the intricacies of
sprinkler networks before being certified by the Fire Department to
inspect the system. Given that training, Gross said, he could not
explain why these employees later could not pinpoint the sprinkler
system's basic components.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are valid questions, and they are the same questions
that the inspector general is asking,'' said Gross. ``But we just
have to wait until the inspector general completes his report.''
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority's inspector general is conducting the
investigation with other officials at the New York City Department
of Investigation, the Fire Department and the Brooklyn District
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials have said that working sprinklers might have
saved the firefighters, who were engulfed by flames as they
struggled to save a tenant on the top floor. Their deaths on Dec.
18, and a second fatal high-rise fire in Manhattan five days later,
have pushed city officials toward considering requiring sprinklers
in new apartment towers.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance workers at the Brooklyn building have told
investigators that they had thought the only control valve to worry
about was a main valve in the basement, which was open during the
fire. But the system failed because five other valves, behind
separate panels in the first-floor ceilings, were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe those valves had been closed for
years, because the panels do not appear to have been opened since
the hallway was painted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since sprinkler systems come in many different configurations,
the city fire code requires that the person responsible for
maintaining a system knows how it works. That person must pass an
exam on that particular type of system before the Fire Department
will give him a certificate of fitness to maintain the system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, applicants must bring to the test a blueprint or
drawing of the sprinkler system that is detailed enough to show the
location of critical components like control valves, fire officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said three Housing Authority workers assigned to the
building at 17 Vandalia Ave. had received the proper certificate of
fitness to inspect its sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   But Gross said it was possible that the plans they reviewed as
part of the test did not show the critical valves. ``Maybe they
didn't appear on the drawings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach the three workers were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they could not clarify the issue because all
drawings and plans are returned to the applicant. The Housing
Authority already has acknowledged that it cannot find a second set
of records, the required inspection reports for the sprinkler
system that its certificate holders should have been filing each
month.
</P>
<P>
   The building's superintendent and manager were transferred after
the fire because of the lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Given the absence of inspection records, investigators are now
going through 12 years' worth of maintenance records that catalog
repairs to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Regan, a Fire Department spokesman, declined to comment
on the sprinkler issue, citing the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is ahead of many other places, sprinkler
contractors said, in that it requires some training and a
certificate of fitness for people who maintain and inspect
sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
   The fire codes in many other places require only that the
responsible person be someone considered ``qualified,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   But several states, including Tennessee and Kentucky, require
that annual inspections be performed only by licensed sprinkler
contractors, according to Claude Chafin, the president of Security
Fire, a sprinkler contractor in Tennessee.

A BELL ATLANTIC AND AIRTOUCH CELLULAR UNION SEEMS DESTINED
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For at least a year, the main question on Wall Street
and in the telecommunications industry about a potential
acquisition of Airtouch Corp., one of the world's biggest wireless
telephone carriers, by the Bell Atlantic Corp. has been not ``if''
but ``when?'' Partners in a national joint venture since 1994, Bell
Atlantic and Airtouch have seemed like natural, if not preordained,
corporate mates.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last six months or so, the reasons for the two
companies to become one have evolved from convenient to compelling;
the communications industry has continued its headlong
consolidation, and the companies' joint foe, AT&AMP;T Corp., has used
its financial and technological might to rewrite the rules of the
wireless business, fueling consumers' desire for seamless national
wireless service and simple flat-rate pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bell Atlantic, the nation's No. 1 local phone company,
appears poised to announce an acquisition of Airtouch for at least
$45 billion in stock. The financial details of a deal remained
unclear Saturday afternoon and the companies' boards had not yet
given final approval, but executives close to the negotiations said
an agreement could be announced as soon as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main reasons why Bell Atlantic and Airtouch would
want to merge. The first is that their existing joint venture,
Primeco, has not lived up to expectations, has suffered from
serving two corporate masters and is already threatened, or at
least complicated, by Bell Atlantic's pending merger with GTE
Corp., another big local telephone company that also has a sizable
wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   The second and perhaps more important reason is that as the
wireless market has come to be driven by national players led by
AT&AMP;T, regional operators like Bell Atlantic and Airtouch are
suffering _ or are afraid of suffering soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AT&AMP;T introduced a new pricing plan that has turned
the wireless industry on its head. Called Digital One Rate, the new
AT&AMP;T plan offers customers flat calling rates of as low as 10 cents
a minute, including all roaming and long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, wireless customers have had to pay additional
surcharges for each minute when they used their phone in an area
served by the network of a different company. Under the new plan,
AT&AMP;T still has to pay those fees to other carriers when AT&AMP;T
customers ``roam'' onto those other companies' systems, but to the
customer, the price remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan has not yet proved to be wildly profitable for
AT&AMP;T, it has had a major psychological impact within the industry
and, at least by some anecdotal accounts, with customers. AT&AMP;T can
afford to offer the plan because it has an extensive national
wireless network, meaning that it does not have to absorb the
roaming fees too often. Sprint PCS and Nextel offer calling plans
that are similar in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has responded with a wireless plan called
Singlerate, but it is financially difficult for regional companies
like Bell Atlantic and Airtouch, which offers service on the West
Coast and in other pockets around the nation, to compete. Because
their networks are not as extensive, they would have to pay much
more in roaming fees to other companies. By joining their networks,
they would be able to battle with AT&AMP;T, Sprint and Nextel more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bell Atlantic and Airtouch have experience working
together, though not always smoothly. In 1994, the companies formed
Primeco as a joint venture to develop digital wireless service in a
swath of frequencies that the Federal Communications Commission was
putting up for auction.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Primeco deal, Bell Atlantic and Airtouch agreed
not to compete in each others' home markets. The problem is that
GTE, which Bell Atlantic has agreed to acquire, already competes
against Airtouch, especially on the West Coast. By Bell Atlantic's
acquiring Airtouch, that complication is removed.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the FCC raises its limits on how much wireless
spectrum any one company can own in a given market, Bell Atlantic
would have to put billions of dollars worth of wireless licenses up
for sale after acquiring Airtouch and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are not the only ones who may have pointed
questions about a merger between Bell Atlantic and Airtouch,
however. A price of $45 billion for Airtouch would represent only
about a 10-percent premium over Airtouch's closing share price on
Thursday, and that would be sure to rankle many of Airtouch's
shareholders, who may want to hold out for a better deal.

AS VISITORS SWARM INTO NEW YORK, RESIDENTS FEEL CROWDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARBARA STEWART    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Waiting in line at the 47th Street Starbucks last
Thursday afternoon, Denise Vasquez and Georgia Locko took a break
from sightseeing to assess their first 12 hours in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Up early, they had found their way to the No. 1 line and pushed
into a train at rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Packed,'' Ms. Locko said. ``Jam-packed, like sardines _
people's shoulders were in my face.''
</P>
<P>
   At Times Square, they made their way to TKTS, where discounted
theater tickets are sold, dodging pedestrian traffic on the
sidewalks of Broadway. At the TKTS booth, a few thousand people,
covering Duffy Square and spilling onto the street, were standing
in line. Ms. Vasquez and Ms. Locko took places at the far end. It
took them an hour to move up close enough to discover that all the
shows were sold out.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did they like New York City so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really exciting,'' said Ms. Locko, 20, from Nacogdoches,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely fun,'' said Ms. Vasquez, 36, from Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of city residents, though, would consider a
day of pushing through crowds and waiting in line to be hellish.
They may appreciate the boost that outsiders bring to shops,
restaurants and other businesses, but as private citizens, their
feelings tend to range from irritation to sheer hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, many visitors are straying from the tourist sights
and venturing into territory that residents more or less consider
their own: the sidewalks of Greenwich Village; the lesser-known
museums, like the Frick and the Asia Society, and the quiet
neighborhood restaurants. They are crowding the already crowded
subways and flagging the empty taxis.
</P>
<P>
   All this is making some of the city's already grumpy residents
even grumpier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate these crowds,'' said Sid Schneider, a research
psychologist in line at the TKTS booth. ``Where do they come from?
There must be nobody at home in places like Kansas City. They're
all here. I've never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, New York probably hasn't, either. There is no official
count of visitors in the city this holiday season, which stretches
from late November to the first Monday of the new year. But several
markers indicate that more visitors are in New York than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the number of passengers arriving at La Guardia
and Newark Airports this season has risen by almost 5 percent over
a year ago, according to estimates by airport officials.
</P>
<P>
   Radio City Music Hall expects to sell 30,000 more tickets than a
year ago to the 206 performances of its Christmas Spectacular.
There has been a 10 percent increase in the number of people
touring the Empire State Building. Big Apple Greeters, a nonprofit
organization in which resident volunteers guide visitors around
various neighborhoods, has given twice as many tours as a year ago.
This season, 100 guides have given tours of Brooklyn Heights,
Harlem, Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there were the New Year's Eve crowds at Times
Square. With a half-million people covering 40 square blocks, it
was the biggest New Year's Eve gathering ever, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The event is one of the times that residents willingly join the
enormous crowds, enjoying the energy that tens of thousands of
people can generate together _ the way they do at the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade and at a baseball game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists _ some of them, anyway _ think crowds are fun,
especially multicultural ones. ``A menagerie of people,'' as one
Wyoming college student put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what New York is,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of
media studies at New York University. ``That's how they know
they're not in Texas. The tall buildings in lots of places, the
press of human flesh _ they feel they're getting the New York
essence, which is congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   While city residents generally do not feel that joy in the
everyday crowds, academics say there are benefits that suburbanites
are missing out on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've discovered that all the suburbanization and shopping
malls are boring, boring, boring,'' said Marshall Bermen, a
professor of political studies at the City College of New York.
``Crowds are good. Crowds make the city safer. People come here to
be part of New York's conviviality.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this freeze, crowds are warmer, said Ann Douglas, author
of ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 20's.'' Shopping at
Macy's, she found herself in ``an ocean of bodies, moving in two
directions. There were so many people on the streets, it was like
an outdoor heater. Everyone was a little furnace. It felt festive _
New York as a mecca.''

   ST. LOUIS _ Defenders of hockey's fistfighting subculture often

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this is true, but most fights are calculated affairs
between cool-headed specialists. Such was the case in the Rangers'
game at Colorado last Thursday, a 6-3 victory for the New Yorkers,
who Saturday night were to play the Blues here on the last stop of
a four-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   The fight between Darren Langdon of the Rangers and Scott Parker
of the Avalanche was scripted before the opening face-off when
Ranger Coach John Muckler put Langdon in his starting lineup and
Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley countered with Parker. Both are
part-time players known primarily for fisticuffs. Anyone familiar
with the National Hockey League knew what would quickly occur.
Twelve seconds after the puck dropped, without any contact between
the two, Langdon and Parker exchanged words, dropped their sticks
and gloves and raised their clenched fists to begin a lengthy
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Both gave as much as they received and Langdon sat down in the
penalty box with a deep, red gash on the small finger of his right
hand and ice bags over both sets of knuckles. He has appeared in
only 18 of the Rangers' 34 games but has accumulated 41 penalty
minutes. Parker has 43 minutes in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fighting, you've always got confidence until you get
knocked out or something like that,'' Langdon said. ``Then you lose
a bit and you want to get back at it. That didn't happen yet, knock
on wood.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Canadian author Roy MacGregor once noted, hockey fights
are ritualistic, with a series of moves as precise as those of a
minuet. When Langdon and Parker squared off, the linesmen did not
try to break them up. Instead, they moved the sticks away so no one
would be injured.
</P>
<P>
   Apologists and advocates for hockey fights, including the
Canadian commentator Don Cherry, often say that baseball has more
bench-clearing brawls than hockey. While this is true, it is also
true that baseball teams, unlike hockey teams, do not decorate
their rosters with one or two players whose best skill is punching.
The consensus around the league is that Tony Twist of the Blues is
the best in the business. Langdon is in the top echelon, with a
workmanlike style that is effective but not especially
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, these warriors are like gunslingers from movies
about the old West, with their own code of the hills. Elite
fighters rarely battle outside their class; it would be bad form to
pick on someone who does not aspire to their level. Parker is a
rookie with a reputation from his days as a junior with Kelowna of
Canada's Western League. Last season, Parker had 243 penalty
minutes in 71 games. Like many fighting specialists, he studies
videotape of future foes. This helped him in a recent tiff with
Vancouver's Donald Brashear. ``I've watched a lot of his fights,''
Parker told The Rocky Mountain News. ``I knew what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this decade, there was serious momentum to ban
fighting in the NHL by ejecting those who fought. Critics said
fighting gave hockey a bad image in the United States and would
make it hard to expand in cities of the Sun Belt. Wayne Gretzky,
now a Ranger, was among the anti-fighting advocates, as was Mario
Lemieux, the retired Pittsburgh Penguin.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Stein, the league's acting president in 1992-93, used an
anti-fighting plank in his platform during his unsuccessful
campaign for the newly created title of commissioner. But the
anti-fighting movement was defeated when Glen Sather, the Edmonton
Oilers' general manager, persuaded his fellow team officials to
instead support a watered-down rule that called only for the
ejection of instigators. Even that penalty, called only
occasionally, has been diluted from a game misconduct to a
10-minute misconduct. In a standard fight, each man gets only a
five-minute major penalty and their teams continue to play with the
full complement of five skaters each.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is often said that players are rarely injured in
fights, there are now more injuries than ever, partly because the
specialists have become such experts. Last season, the career of
Toronto's Nick Kypreos ended because of a concussion from a fight
in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Campbell, the former coach of the Rangers who is the
league's senior vice president and chief disciplinarian, often
praised certain fighters as ``honorable tough guys.'' Among them,
in Campbell's estimation, was Stu Grimson, now with Anaheim.
Grimson, a born-again Christian known as the Grim Reaper, is the
type of fighter who will tell linesmen to break up a battle if he
feels he has hurt his opponent so badly that the foe can no longer
defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has also harshly criticized fighters like Buffalo's Rob
Ray, who used to take advantage of foes by shedding his jersey and
fighting bare-chested. This gave Ray an extra edge because
opponents could not clutch his jersey for balance while swinging
with the clenched fist of the other hand _ the standard style.
Because of Ray's innovation, the league passed a rule calling for
the ejection of players who shed their jerseys in fights. The
Devils' Lyle Odelein was recently ejected for this.
</P>
<P>
   It is acceptable for a fighter to rip the helmet from a foe's
head, as Parker did to Langdon. This exposes his skull while saving
wear and tear on the knuckles of the puncher. However, it is taboo
to sucker-punch a foe from the blindside during the flow of play.
Matt Johnson, the Los Angeles Kings tough guy, was suspended for 12
games by Campbell after Johnson knocked out Jeff Beukeboom of the
Rangers with a thundering blow to the back of the head. To live
outside the law, as someone once sang, you must be honest.

<P>
   MONTVALE, N.J. _ Thomas C. Colt III is not what you might expect
in the great-great-great grandson of a president, even an impeached
one like Andrew Johnson. At 63 years old, he lives on Bergen
County's northern rim with a cat named Sheena in what he blithely
describes as a hovel, orderly and booklined as his weather-beaten
bungalow is. He makes his living delivering pizza for $5.25 an hour
and selling hardware at Sears. His rusting 1970 Opel has notched
500,000 miles, he says, and he spends hours fixing it.
</P>
<P>
   He is something of a Herzog, compulsively writing letters of
complaint to presidents and editors. On a snowy day, he likes to
grab a cup of coffee and settle himself near the wood-burning
furnace that sits idiosyncratically on an outdoor porch, instead of
indoors where most of the human race would expect to find it. He
enjoys watching the snow swirl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 63 going on 15,'' he likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   But pixilated as he seems, he is also a cultivated man and has
made a thorough study of his ancestor's impeachment. He has
concluded that Andrew Johnson was railroaded by zealous Republicans
who despised his opposition to their Reconstruction policy toward
the South, a policy Johnson inherited from Lincoln. Colt is sure
the nine other living Johnson descendants feel pretty much the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a legacy of shame,'' he said ``We knew him
and he was very true to his standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt, who has the rough white beard and stout build of a Burl
Ives, does not blame his ancestor's history for his own modest
station. He met descendants of other presidents on ``The Joan
Rivers Show'' years back and found them an assorted lot, ranging
from distinguished Roosevelts to a humble heir of Calvin Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of their own accomplishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, his father was a Virginia museum director, but the
family broke up and his mother _ the Johnson descendant _ moved the
children to New Hampshire. In college, he majored in broadcasting
but grew disillusioned after deciding that television had become a
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business did not satisfy my standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he lived like a beatnik in San Francisco, enjoying
good times ``in a rooming house filled with fellow travelers'' and
adopting Kerouacian philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do anything unless it's worth doing, and by `worth' I
don't mean money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that his resume proceeds in fits and
starts, like his Opel on a bad day: reporting for the Bergen
Record, editing a trade newspaper, public relations at Bergen
Community College, driving a taxi, delivering pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little bit slower than the rest of my crew, who are
mostly college and high school kids,'' said his boss, Gary Sernak
at Natale's Pizza. ``But he is willing to do anything. He has no
qualms doing dishes or sweeping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks about the arc of his life, Colt sees
everything he does with a tenderfoot's wide-eyed cheerfulness.
Selling hardware? ``You potentially have the opportunity to make a
new friend every day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He never married, never had children. He is a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any prospects sufficient for supporting a family,
so I just didn't,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While others dismiss Johnson as incompetent, Colt sees him as
principled, a president who stuck to his guns in the face of a
mutinous Congress. Still, he suggests that a legacy of such
resolution has been a handicap in a world that requires a certain
amount of calculation and accommodation for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, it's been a limiting factor in my life,'' he said.
``Johnson set the standard for our conduct, and all of us pretty
much adhered to it. There're just certain things I don't feel I can
do.''

REGION BUNDLES UP AS IT BRACES FOR SNOW, SLEET AND RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the bone-piercing cold that ushered in the new
year set to give way to snow, sleet and ultimately freezing rain,
emergency crews across the New York metropolitan region were on
alert Saturday, watching the forecasts as they prepared to salt
hundreds of miles of roadways and respond to downed power lines and
other weather-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m. in Central Park, the thermometer measured a trifling 9
degrees _ above the record of 2 degrees set in 1918 but cold enough
to keep many people in bed on a Saturday morning and to remind
those who dared to venture out that, after two years of atypical
warmth, there still is a season called winter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a colossal storm rampaging across the Midwest, not
the cold, that sounded the warning siren for this region's
sanitation departments, utility companies, transportation officials
and other emergency workers. The forecasts predicted an inch or
more of snow, followed by sleet and rain.
</P>
<P>
   Officials predicted widespread delays at the airports for today
and Monday, with hundreds of flights canceled and thousands of
travelers stranded at the end of the holiday weekend as the storm
paralyzed airline hubs throughout the Midwest. In New York, the icy
rain predicted to last through Sunday morning was expected to slow
traffic on the runways.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the city's Sanitation Department loaded its 353
huge salt-spreading trucks and readied more than 1,000 snowplows,
said Paula Young, a department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready,'' proclaimed Nick Calabrese, a superintendent at
a garage on the West Side Highway in Manhattan, where there were
trails of sand-colored rock salt on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our spreaders loaded and plows on our trucks, just in
case,'' Calabrese said, adding that extra personnel had been called
to work in anticipation of the storm. ``We have got it down to a
science, when to start preparing and when to send the trucks out.
They train for this all year round.''
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest precipitation was expected to hit late Saturday
night. Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State
University, said that New York City would probably see a steady
transition from snow to sleet to rain, possibly leaving a fine
glaze of ice on power lines and roads by this morning. After that,
temperatures were expected to climb into the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The interior regions north and west of the city were expected to
be hit hardest by snow and ice, Gadomski said, with temperatures
not expected to rise much above freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison said it expected to receive the greatest
number of emergency calls in Westchester County, where the company
maintains its largest number of overhead power lines. The ice and
heavy precipitation were expected to down numerous lines, said Jim
Larkin, a spokesman. Larkin said the company spent two days
preparing its trucks and that 32 additional crews were called to
work Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Public Service Electric &AMP; Gas doubled and, in
some areas, tripled the number of people on duty Saturday night,
with extra attention paid to the southern and western portions of
the state, said Mark Capalbo, a company spokesman. ``With the storm
coming, we put everybody on call,'' he said, adding that a major
problem would be tree branches knocking down power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Fleischer, a spokesman for the New York State
Department of Transportation, said officials would make use of
high-technology sensors built into the pavement of major roadways
as well as weather satellite systems to monitor conditions and
coordinate anti-icing efforts. ``It's a pretty sophisticated
system,'' he said. ``We gear up for these type of events. We are
prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The state had readied an arsenal of antisnow equipment,
including 1,300 plows that weigh 25 tons each, and about 500 pieces
of other equipment, including bucket loaders, graders and large
snow blowers. An army of 3,400 equipment operators and another 600
support staffers would come in to put it all to work, Fleischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the emergency crews prepared for the worst, many
people throughout the region said they were glad to experience
winter again. ``It's never too cold,'' Bill Arsell and Fred Pudash
exclaimed in unison as they hunted for ducks Saturday on Long
Island. Wearing long johns and a camouflage coat and hat, Pudash
set off on an aluminum skiff into Oyster Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the cold weather because it pushes some of the birds
from their nests,'' Pudash said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, many people said they were unfazed by the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not cold, it's winter,'' said Bruce Temkin, 35, as he
went to buy groceries at a supermarket in Greenwich Village
Saturday morning. ``I am praying for snow,'' Temkin added. ``It's
beautiful, it blankets the city, and it's peaceful and it doesn't
ruin your day like rain.''

ANALYSIS: THE UNEASY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATAKI AND GIULIANI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In struggling to describe the curious relationship between Gov.
George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, people who are
close to the two men sum it up this way: It's nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to ring true. No matter how often the state's top two
Republicans smile and praise each other before the cameras, the
governor is not likely to invite the mayor for a heart-to-heart
chat during one of his periodic strolls through the leafy woods
near his home in Garrison. Politics and politics alone defines
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   So then what is one to make of the broadsides that Pataki has
aimed at the city since his re-election in November?
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging volley came when the governor ignored the
mayor's protests and signed a bill that could lead to much higher
pay raises for the city's police officers and firefighters. Given
that Pataki vetoed a similar bill in 1996 _ earning Giuliani's
gushing gratitude at the time _ his action smacked of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also has blocked the city's efforts to collect more
money from a settlement with tobacco companies, vetoed a bill to
give nearly $100 million to the city's Health and Hospitals Corp.,
and gave a costly pension-related concession to the United
Federation of Teachers. The mayor and the governor also have been
at odds over how much money the state will provide for housing the
homeless mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani has continued to sing Pataki's praises, but
through gritted teeth. Although he usually does not hesitate to
criticize and even ridicule those who cross him, the mayor has good
reason to hold his tongue. First, he knows that the city will need
the Pataki administration's assistance with scores of other
matters; second, the governor controls the state Republican Party,
whose endorsement Giuliani may someday seek in a possible campaign
for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani-Pataki relationship has a troubled past and a
competitive future. Giuliani famously cast his lot with the
Democratic incumbent, Mario M. Cuomo, rather than with Pataki in
the 1994 election, and has been self-flagellating ever since to
mollify those Republicans who see him as a traitor. Now, both men
are rising stars in a national Republican Party thought to have the
intestinal fortitude for only one New York hotshot at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no wellspring of affection, no predisposition to be
pleasant,'' said Gerald Benjamin, dean of the College of Liberal
Arts and Sciences at the State University of New York at New Paltz
and a close observer of state government. ``And as they pursue
their ambitions, the less positive elements of their relationship
come forward. You tend to remember the last fight, even though in
between you had some good times together.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pataki and Giuliani say they get along better than most of
their predecessors, which is saying something. Because of their
competing interests, mayors and governors often quarrel, even when,
or especially if, they belong to the same party (see
Lindsay-Rockefeller and Koch-Cuomo). Still, the subtle distrust
between the two men has risen close to the surface since the
beginning of last year's campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani volunteered to campaign for Pataki in the city and
in the suburbs, the offer was politely declined. When the governor
fared poorly among city voters in his decisive re-election, some in
the mayor's camp complained that Pataki's anemic showing had
contributed to the defeat of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   When a Giuliani adviser said publicly that the mayor might
someday challenge the governor in a primary, some in Albany took
quiet note, despite Giuliani's convincing pledge that the adviser's
musings were flat-out wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some state Republican leaders wondered whether the
mayor could have done more to help Dennis C. Vacco, the attorney
general, in his failed quest to challenge voter registrations in
New York City. Vacco, who was ousted in a close election, wanted
the mayor to dispatch police officers to knock on doors to check
registrations. The mayor said he would do so, but only if a judge
ordered such action. Vacco failed to obtain such an order, and the
whole drama left some Republicans with the sense that Guiliani did
not do enough for a mortally wounded Republican colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not surprised by our glorious Republican mayor,'' said a
senior Republican official who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
referring sarcastically to the Vacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Since his re-election, Pataki has made several decisions that
have benefited the city. But from the city's perspective, the bad
has far outweighed the good.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious blow was the governor's decision to sign a bill
that gives the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and other police
and firefighter unions the right to ask that a state panel _ rather
than a city one _ arbitrate wage impasses. The union believes that
the bill will create higher salaries for city officers who make
less than their suburban counterparts; the city believes that it
will create budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki vetoed the earlier version of the legislation in 1996,
but the state Legislature embarrassed him by overriding the veto.
The Giuliani administration succeeded in having the law overturned
in court, but the episode left Pataki smarting, according to a
person close to the Pataki administration who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That person said that Pataki had hoped Giuliani would resolve
his differences with the police union and instead has aggravated an
already strained relationship. The governor, who received the
endorsement of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association last year,
saw the matter in a different light this time.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani would say only that the governor's decision was a big
mistake and vowed to challenge it again in court. His aides point
out that it affects the city more than it does the Giuliani
administration, whose term, limited by law, will be close to an end
when the next police contract is scheduled for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   One Giuliani aide attributed Pataki's recent decisions on police
arbitration and other city matters to the governor's poor showing
among city voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few weeks before the election, they were talking about
winning New York City with a certain amount of bravado,'' said the
aide, who insisted on anonymity. ``I think they realized that they
lost in New York City worse than two-to-one, and this is what
happens. Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, however, said that he was not convinced that Pataki's
decisions reflected any pattern of anti-city, anti-Giuliani
sentiment. Rather, he said, Pataki's behavior has to be seen in
terms of Pataki's goals.
</P>
<P>
   It's not personal; it's politics. As Benjamin said, ``It's
nuanced.''

DISTRIBUTOR OF ARAB PAPER GOT THREAT BEFORE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SUSAN SACHS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days before an attack on the Queens company that
distributes the influential international newspaper Al Hayat and a
number of other Arabic-language newspapers, an unidentified caller
left a vague but threatening message in Arabic on the company's
answering machine, Yazid A. Mourani, its president, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the holidays, the company, Media Marketing Research
Inc., discovered the message only after an attack on its
distribution center in Queens in which a car was driven through a
steel gate in front of the building and set on fire on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was someone cursing, but there were no specifics, no
nothing,'' Mourani said.
</P>
<P>
   The caller did not mention any of the newspapers handled by the
company, he added, and the poor quality of the tape makes it
difficult to make out either the Arab dialect or the nationality of
the caller.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the car, a stolen 1992 Mitsubishi, did not contain
explosives, but was gutted in the fire. No one was injured at the
warehouse building, at 25-25 51st Ave., and the burning car caused
only minor damage to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokesman said Saturday that the
investigators had not determined a motive for the attack or its
specific target.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Terrorist Task Force, which includes local law
enforcement agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
responded to the 4:30 p.m. fire. A spokesman for the New York City
office of the FBI said the agency had not decided whether it would
stay involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the sorting-out process is still continuing
here, as to what happened and who is responsible,'' said the
spokesman, Joseph Valiquette. ``Our interest is, obviously, to see
if those events would warrant a federal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Hayat, which is printed and distributed in the New York City
area by Media Marketing Research, was the target of a letter bomb
campaign at several of its overseas offices and its London
headquarters two years ago. One of the bombs exploded in the mail
room at the London office, injuring two workers. The other bombs,
including those sent to the Washington and New York bureaus of the
paper, were discovered before they blew up.
</P>
<P>
   Mourani said his company has been threatened before because of
its association with Al Hayat. In May, he said, a caller threatened
to blow up the distribution company's building but nothing came of
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has not received any threats recently, a
spokeswoman for Al Hayat in London said Saturday. Reporters in the
paper's bureaus in Washington and New York also said they had
received no threats.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hayat, owned by a relative of the Saudi royal family, is
widely considered the world's most prestigious Arabic-language
newspaper. It prints a broad spectrum of political opinion and
recently covered the activities of Islamic fundamentalist groups in
Egypt and the dispute between leaders of Iraq and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Al Hayat, the Queens company distributes another
Saudi-owned international daily newspaper, Asharq Al Awsat, the
semiofficial Egyptian daily Al Ahram, the independent Palestinian
daily Al Quds, and a variety of New York City publications in
Arabic.

SCHOOL SAFETY OFFICERS BRIDLE AT TRANSFER TO POLICE CONTROL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Police Department took control of
security in the city's schools on schedule on Dec. 20, police
officials said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 3,200 school safety officers who used to report
to the board of education said they were unhappy with the change in
their supervision, complaining that as their responsibilities were
changing significantly, their status and pay were not. They will be
called safety agents, not officers, to avoid confusion with police
officers, and will not have guns or badges.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the guards learned for the first time last week that
they would be subject to some of the rules that affect police
officers, including the one that prohibits officers from
moonlighting for other city agencies. Many of the security agents
frequently rely on such second jobs to supplement their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials informed the agents of the new regulations last
week at two two-day orientation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're changing everything but the color of our skin and our
salary,'' Marva Grant, a school safety officer said Thursday. ``We
need second jobs to feed our families. Were we considered in any of
these decisions? Show us what we get for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The police official making the presentation was silenced by the
outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Other guards also expressed disatisfaction, although others
still were sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Samuels, 32, who has worked as a school safety guard for
nine years and has a second job as a school custodian for a private
company that works for the board of education, said he was unsure
whether he would be able to keep his custodial job.
</P>
<P>
   Another guard, who refused to give her name, saying she feared
reprisal, complained after attending an orientation meeting that
``they beat around the bush about everything. They are not telling
us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Constance Middleton, a school safety officer for 20 years,
did not oppose the change. ``I'm all right with it,'' she said. ``I
don't think we're being asked to do more. We're not police officers
so we're not going to get everything they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Mancuso, secretary-treasurer of Local 237 of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents the
agents, said that in March the workers would receive a minor
increase in retirement benefits and a raise of 4.75 percent,
bringing their salaries to about $24,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mancuso said that some of the workers' concerns related to
holidays, which are still under negotiation. The police department
has refused to recognize days such as Christmas Eve and the day
after Thanksgiving, as holidays, he said. Another unresolved issue
is whether agents will be given bullet-proof vests, a move that
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has resisted, Mancuso said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeking is no diminishment in benefits and we're
seeking equality with all school-safety officers,'' Mancuso said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the board of education voted unanimously to
transfer control of security in the city's public schools to the
police department. The vote came despite pleas from parents and
civil libertarians that the presence of quasi-police officers would
interfere with the learning atmosphere in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many objections to the plan came from black leaders, who argued
that many black children have strained relations with the police.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 safety officers will remain at the board of education,
19 of them in a new Division of Student Safety and Prevention
Services, which will track student absenteeism and tardiness. The
others who remain at the board of education will continue to
provide security at the board's headquarters on Livingston St.
Police officers will continue to patrol 128 of the city's schools
to which they have previously been assigned.
</P>
<P>
   A police official who spoke at the orientation meetings warned
all the officers to document everything they do in case
revenge-seeking students file false complaints against them.

EDITORIAL: PATAKI'S NEW YEAR CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York must be looking at 1999 with
particular curiosity. Pataki was sworn in for a second term on New
Year's Day, following a comfortable re-election victory last
November. The state's economy is still strong and the upcoming
legislative season does not seem to hold any dramatic challenges.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki has never been a politician who likes to nest in a
safe place. His risk tolerance is very high for a New York elected
official, his career marked by an eagerness to move up the ladder
even if it meant taking a chance. If the governor could look into a
crystal ball and see a long stretch of serene prosperity that left
him still occupying his current job in 2004, he might be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   If Pataki has national ambitions, however, he needs to bulk up
his reputation for substance. He has a good record as an
environmentalist and a tax-cutter, but the woods are full of
ambitious Republican governors, many of them even better
vote-getters with stronger records for innovation. This year offers
Pataki the chance to prove that he has the strength and will to put
forth his own path-breaking agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The governor can do this by tackling New York's scandalous
campaign-finance system. As a recent New York Times story by
Clifford Levy pointed out, the campaign-finance regulations that do
exist are riven with loopholes and enforced by an understaffed
bureaucracy. During his recent campaign, Pataki declared the status
quo ``dreadful'' and promised major, though undefined, reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the governor to show his hand and make his
proposals. State Comptroller Carl McCall has already said he will
offer a series of reforms, including public financing for
campaigns, a ban on the monster loophole called soft money and
restrictions on campaign contributions by people doing business
with the state. But the reality of politics in New York is that for
real reform to succeed, it must be championed by a Republican like
Pataki, since it is the Republican Party that has been the chief
obstacle to change.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki knows better than anyone in New York what a wreck the
state's political system is. The Legislature is perpetually divided
between a Republican Senate and Democratic Assembly, and most
members are in seats so safe they are virtual lifetime sinecures.
The legislators respond mainly to the importuning of lobbyists who
control campaign contributions, not the public. None of those
things will change until the flow of money through the state's
porous campaign-finance regulations stops.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party in New York is struggling right now. Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, its leader and heart, lost his re-election bid.
Pataki is not only the logical head of the state's Republican
forces, he is now the only member of his party, other than the
lieutenant governor, holding statewide office. This is the right
time for him to direct his party and his state in a different
direction, toward a political world in which policy is no longer
made on the basis of campaign donations.

EDITORIAL: THE LIMITS OF TECHNOLOGY  
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Amusing as it is simply to sit back and watch the calendar of
the Western world flip over, it is reasonable to expect that 1999 _
prologue to a new millennium _ will yield some themes that ask for
real reflection. Here is one. In the blizzard of commentary already
blowing in, it is becoming apparent that we are nearly blinded by
technology. Trying to gauge the meaning of a new millennium, we
almost instinctively do so by marveling at the rate of
technological change, which we cannot help believing will only
increase. It seems like the most salient feature of human culture
during the last 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate at which technology has been changing probably
masks the underlying stability of human nature. The rate of change
in our world is simply dizzying, and it is only natural to wonder
whether humans who live in 1999 are different somehow, given the
explosion of technological innovation in their lifetime, than
humans who lived 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Material conditions in the richest societies are certainly
different now than they were in the richest societies in the year
1000, and they are more different from 1000 than 1000 was from the
year 1. The way we explain human nature is radically different too,
thanks mostly to Darwin. Yet there is no evidence that human nature
has altered in that time or, indeed, since human history began.
Life has always been as complex as it could possibly be. Humans
have always admired their own adaptability and lamented the
peculiar complications of the times they live in. There is no
burying the past because the past _ to the extent that it was
determined by the raw potential of human nature _ is reborn in
every generation.
</P>
<P>
   We are caught, in a sense, between two kinds of evolution.
Biological evolution works on a nearly geological time scale, which
suggests that human nature, as a partial product of our genes, is
basically constant. Cultural evolution works with shocking
swiftness, and so we assume that it is mainly a propulsive,
liberating, even revolutionary force. But human culture has always
usefully constrained human behavior as well as expressed it. No
human society has ever tolerated the entire range of instinctive,
``natural'' human behavior. That selective intolerance is among the
things we mean by civilization.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the fundamental tensions we will carry into the
new millennium. For most of history humans have shaped
civilizations commensurate with the level of their material
technology. In some cases, like ancient Athens, the former far
outstripped the latter. Startling new technologies will inevitably
proliferate in the years to come. We need to remember that the
measure of a civilization is not the tools it owns but the use it
makes of them.

 &HT;    Survivalists getting ready for collapse of computers
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXAS HILL COUNTRY _ From their extravagantly untidy goat farm
hidden in the Texas cedars, Kerry and Prisca Wooster are trying to
jumpstart America's survival instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The Woosters are self-anointed messengers of the millennium.
From this remote and unlikely nerve center, where rusted ghosts of
cars and scrap metal outnumber the 15 goats, they send high-tech
warning sirens to the Internet. The message: The Year 2000 computer
bug will push life so far off-line that only the well-prepared will
survive.
</P>
<P>
   They fully intend to be on the safe side of the silicon brink _
far from what Kerry Wooster calls ``the advancing Twinkie-starved
hordes'' who will be scavenging for food next year. They are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Medicinal herbs? Check. Whole grain in storage? Check. Windmill?
Check. Kerosene lanterns? Check. Wood stove? Check. Nonhybrid
garden seeds? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Gun? Slingshot? Check, check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just the common people of America, desperately
scrabbling for what we perceive to be a chance of survival,'' said
Wooster, 53, who cleans houses with his wife for poverty-level
wages. ``What is wrong with preparation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's virtually no doubt we're going to be dropping back to
pre-1800s lifestyle,'' he said as he sat in the cluttered cottage
he built years ago as an add-on to the beached 40-foot refrigerator
trailer he used to haul as a trucker.
</P>
<P>
   As the Woosters prepare for the worst, they're not alone. A
small but growing number of people are becoming consumed by the
doom of a possible disaster on Jan. 1, 2000. They are stockpiling
food, water, toilet paper and even generators. Some suppliers of
freeze-dried food already report being sold out.
</P>
<P>
   And while government officials believe the Woosters'
all-or-nothing attitude is excessive, they are beginning to warn
the public that making some emergency preparation would be wise. In
Austin, some mainstream families are converting garages into Y2K
caches.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials expect the Y2K bug to cause something
abnormal, but they predict it will remain in the inconvenience
category. They acknowledge that not everything that runs on a
computer chip will be fixed by Jan. 1, 2000, and say there is a
potential for disruptions in electricity, telephones and public
transportation. Contingency plans are in place, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudent precautions are really all that's necessary,'' said
Gary Chapman, director of the 21st Century Project at the LBJ
School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends storing supplies for a week, including food,
water, cash and flashlights or candles.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium approaches, surveys show Americans are divided
on the Y2K issue, Chapman said. The Woosters in the Hill Country
are millennial pessimists, fiercely lined up on the extreme edge of
the one-third of Americans worried about computers going haywire on
Jan. 1, 2000. Another third know nothing about a potential Y2K
problem, and another third are sure things will be corrected in
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Woosters are trying to alert people by running the Texas
Hill Country Christian Survival List on the Internet. The messages
range from what type of garden seeds to buy (open-pollinated; they
reproduce) to fears about airplanes falling from the sky if
computers seize up.
</P>
<P>
   Although their Internet messages connect them with scores of
people, their face-to-face dealings with people have suffered
because of their absorption with the Y2K issue. They have lost
friendships and even a job because people tire of their gloomy talk
and ask them not to return. Church doesn't offer a regular link to
society because they don't belong to one. ``We home-church,''
Prisca Wooster said.
</P>
<P>
   Their shrinking world saddens them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot even get our friends and families to listen to us
and begin to prepare for the disaster that we fear is about to
happen,'' Kerry Wooster said. ``It is heartbreaking that we are
having to leave them behind, when it could all be so easy if they
would just help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we try, the more we find we are really completely
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woosters do not want the exact location of their 27 acres
revealed, because they fear desperate looters will arrive to look
for water and food after Jan. 1, 2000. Their farm is west of
Kerrville.
</P>
<P>
   The clutter inside their stone-floor cabin is nearly as thick as
the rubbish that dots their farm. Outside are tin cans, used tires
and odd piles of scrap metal. Inside the house are magazines, jars,
two computers and even an old Navy siren that doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The wall calendar says March 1972, but they are too busy with
their day jobs and the added burden of preparing for Y2K to even
notice. The only date they care about is Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They gladly offer a tour of their gardens, where they grow
herbs, peaches, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, strawberries, squash and
assorted other organic food. Prisca makes yogurt from the goat milk
and also makes soap. They have stored several hundred pounds of
whole grains but do not plan to save more than is necessary for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not purchasing all of the Twinkies that we can get our
hands on,'' Kerry Wooster said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woosters haven't kept track of how much they have spent to
prepare for the Y2K bug. She says $15,000, but he says far less.
</P>
<P>
   Adequate preparing for the Y2K bug shouldn't cost that much,
said Chapman, the UT lecturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that is available to people like (the Woosters) is
certainly an advantage, but it's not worth spending a tremendous
amount of money to provide or to take it up as an entire
lifestyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling people to have enough cash and emergency supplies
for a week,'' said Chapman, who is organizing a town hall meeting
on Y2K with local and state officials who want to raise public
awareness of potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   People also should obtain paper copies of important financial
and legal documents such as savings account balances and birth
certificates in the event of computer shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling people to be somewhere safe on Jan. 1, 2000,''
Chapman said. ``I personally wouldn't want to be in a airplane, an
elevator or a subway.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Sam Loy or Kevin McConnell. They are computer
professionals in Austin who are worried enough about the potential
for Y2K problems to store food, water and other supplies for their
families. They both were inspired by Y2K warnings published by Ed
Yourdon, a national computer expert who wrote ``Time Bomb 2000,'' a
book about possible calamities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're basicaly preparing as reasonably as we can for a
worst-case scenario,'' Loy said. ``We're not counting on a worst
case-scenario and don't go around trying to scare people. At the
same time, we're not hiding'' their preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Loy, a software engineer at Interphase, plans to spend about
$1,500 laying in a year's worth of emergency supplies for himself,
his wife and their two teenage daughters: 400 pounds of whole grain
that can be milled by hand. 3,000 gallons of water. Canned food.
Candles. Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Loy has been trying to get the Shady Hollow neighborhood
interested in the Y2K problem and formed the Shady Hollow Community
Coalition for Preparedness. But he was met with overwhelming
indifference from his neighbors and has scaled down his direct
alert campaign to the people on his block. Loy isn't sure what will
happen on Jan. 1, 2000, but he wants to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be somewhere in the middle,'' he said.
``It's going to be one extreme or another. It's probably going to
be either very easy or very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If one bad thing does happen, I think it will be a ripple
effect,'' he said. ``My gut feeling is it's going to be pretty
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McConnell, who designs and coordinates computer network
systems for IBM, also foresees trouble. His family of four is going
to stockpile a month's worth of food, water and supplies, he said,
just as if they were preparing for a blizzard or mammoth ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our Y2K storage cabinet we're stashing stuff in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other employees at IBM are making similar preparations, he said.
But he finds most people still have a complacent attitude toward
the Year 2000 glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are, `Well, someone else will take care of it,' but
when you start understanding all the implications of what happens
if we lose power for so long or if small businesses have issues
getting supplies from a supplier because they have a Y2K problem
...
</P>
<P>
   ``The snowball will get created. It's just a matter of how
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowball, ripple effect, dominoes _ whatever you call it, those
who are preparing say taking precautions doesn't erase the worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we are scared to death,'' Kerry Wooster said.
``We are damned if we do and damned if we don't. The truth is, we
have the guts and the vision and the faith to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to survive.''

 &HT;    Power outage in El Paso a hint of what could be
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The gravity of the year 2000 glitch became clear
the day the lights went out in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 p.m. Aug. 21, the Texas Department of Mental Health and
Mental Retardation lost power at a facility where 123 people with
mental disabilities live. The staff had no contingency plan for a
major electric failure.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 computer problem had nothing to do with the
problem in El Paso. But state officials say incidents just like it
_ or worse _ could occur if state agencies do not conquer the Y2K
bug.
</P>
<P>
   The staff wrote purchase orders by the light of flashlights to
get oxygen tanks for residents who could not breathe on their own.
Food was taken to nearby homes so it could be put in a blender for
residents who could not eat solids. Residents were taken to
air-conditioned shopping malls to protect them from the summer
heat. Coin laundries kept linens fresh. Ice chests stored
medications.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a kind of bucket brigade was formed to fuel an
emergency generator with gasoline from local service stations.
</P>
<P>
   The power outage lasted more than three days, and it took
another three days to get the computers working. The electric
problems were traced to a faulty cable.
</P>
<P>
   The El Paso outage is ``similar to what might be expected from
Year 2000 failures,'' says a recent report by the Texas Department
of Information Resources, which is overseeing the Y2K corrections.
</P>
<P>
   The El Paso emergency would have been worse if it had been
caused by Y2K, say mental health officials. ``In the event of
power-related problems due to failures brought on by the year 2000
event, the outages will be regional in nature and not isolated to
one facility,'' said an agency report on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, the power grid in this area extends into and
connects with power suppliers in Mexico,'' the report said of
concerns that any Mexican failure could quickly affect Texas power
grids.
</P>
<P>
   In a regional power failure, malls would have been without
power, emergency generators would have been grabbed by others, and
local frozen-food storage facilities could not have saved the food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency in El Paso prompted the Texas mental health agency
to start drawing up contingency plans for each medically fragile
resident in its two dozen institutions, and to plan other backup
measures. The agency also plans to ask for emergency money for each
institution.

 &HT;    Generators, seeds on shopping list
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Depending on which expert you listen to, the Y2K
problem could be a minute tick on a seismic flatline or a
cacophonous, pre-Apocalyptic roar.
</P>
<P>
   Where the differing opinions on the computer bug from Hell meet
is that we should all, to some degree, be prepared. While most
caution against going overboard on the food hoarding and money
withdrawal, others say you can never do too much.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things alarmists say will go, as the computer
clocks change from 1999 to 2000, is the power. Therefore, a
generator is at the top of most hyper-Y2Kers' lists. Home Depot is
selling 5,000-watt generators for $499. Salesman Bob Kotell said
they're far from flying off the shelves. He has only sold a few
generators all year, and never has Y2K been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of doubt this whole thing,'' Kotell said. ``I think
everything will be OK. I know I'm personally not doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2Kaphobes are also calling on the masses to withdraw all of
their money. Computer glitches, they warn, will erase bank records
and leave people penniless.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sort of ridiculous,'' said Bill Stewart, a customer
service representative at a local bank. ``As far as I know, we
totally have it under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he knew of no one who had taken money out of an
account to prepare for Y2K. He did say a man entered the bank and
asked how to withdraw all of his money. But the man _ who Stewart
said ``looked the part of a guy that's not all there'' _ didn't
want to make a scene and left without making a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, the Y2K isn't that scary to me,'' Stewart said.
``To prepare, I'll probably take some cash out on December 30 and
order a couple of pizzas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin-area Gardenville is seeing some of the Y2K fervor.
The nursery promotes organic, self-sustaining gardening. This sort
of gardening is the type the Y2Kers are preaching to the masses.
The idea is to set up a constant source of food. As a result, there
has been a small run on open-pollinated fruit, grain and vegetable
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Beal is a nursery manager at Gardenville. She said the
open-pollinated seeds enable fruits and vegetables to reproduce.
Most seeds on the market are sterile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every three or four weeks I'll get a customer that's talking
about Y2K,'' Beal said. ``Usually that person will buy about $200
worth of seed, which is a tremendous amount. ... Because they are
so specific on what breeds they want, I assume they know what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardenville has also sold an unusually high number of fruit and
nut trees. Beal said she has run into people who have wanted to
plant entire orchards of peaches, apples, pears, plums and pecans.
</P>
<P>
   But after seeing all of this buying for the Y2K Apocalypse, does
she believe in the impending horror?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not really,'' Beal said. ``I just know I don't want to
be in a plane or anywhere like that. When the year 2000 comes
around, me and my husband will be on a mountain or in a park.''

 &HT;    Litigation could also be a Y2K problem
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Don Summers, whose small company repairs
emergency generators in more than 200 Austin-area buildings, could
be a popular guy on New Year's Eve 1999: If electric utilities are
affected by the Y2K computer bug and power goes out, all those
generators will kick in, and some may need quick repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, dozens of Summers' customers have
asked him to guarantee that Y2K, or year 2000, problems won't delay
service. But while Summers has upgraded his own computers, he
worries about his suppliers. A lawyer has advised him not to make
any promises: Many of the customers are afraid they'll be sued as a
result of Y2K mishaps _ when computers may erroneously interpret
the two-digit date ``00'' as 1900, not 2000 _ and they want to
include Summers in their ``line of liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Because computers play a part in the delivery of nearly every
product and service, the potential for Y2K lawsuits stretches the
imagination. Some say litigation costs could approach $1 trillion,
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has asked Congress to set up an ad
hoc Y2K court to handle all of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a deluge of lawsuits that could paralyze the state's
economy, Texas lawmakers have proposed limits to Y2K liability.
Summers, who says he and most other small-business men wouldn't be
able to hire high-priced lawyers to defend themselves, heartily
endorses the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like ripples on a pond _ a gigantic pond with no limit to
the expansion of those ripples,'' Summers said. ``We could be
destroyed, and I don't think that's proper.''
</P>
<P>
   But others warn that far-reaching immunity from Y2K lawsuits
will leave consumers _ and small-business men such as Summers _
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly concerned about granting the computer and
software industry complete immunity or cutting off the legal right
of small-business owners when we don't know the extent of the
problem,'' said Richard Hile of the Texas Trial Lawyers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``These industries have known for years about the Y2K problem,
but have continued to sell computer products with embedded chips as
recently as the last couple of years,'' Hile said. ``Now they're
seeking to shift the burden of any financial losses to the consumer
and take it off the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K legislation
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, has filed a bill that would allow
plaintiffs in Y2K lawsuits to recover damages ``resulting from
personal injury or wrongful death, excluding mental anguish.'' The
bill also would enable plaintiffs to recover the cost of
reprogramming or replacing computer systems, but not financial
losses related to computer breakdowns or work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   State agencies and local governments, which already enjoy
``sovereign immunity'' from most lawsuits, would get more extensive
protection from Y2K lawsuits. Shannon Porterfield of the Department
of Information Resources, which is monitoring the Y2K preparations
of 200 state agencies and universities, said the state has
completed more than half of its Y2K remediation plans.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts aide Reggie McElhannon said the ``spirit'' of the
legislation is to protect people or entities that have made a
``good faith'' effort to correct their Y2K problems. But the
language is imprecise, and McElhannon said the bill is likely to be
altered and folded into more comprehensive Y2K legislation being
drafted by Rep. Brian McCall, R-Plano, and Sens. Robert Duncan,
R-Lubbock, and Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The broader bill includes incentives for people to fix their Y2K
problems ahead of time and is designed as a ``blueprint'' for
solving Y2K disputes, Duncan said. For example, if a defendant can
prove that pre-2000 testing of a computer system suggested that it
would pass Y2K muster, but then it fails anyway, the defendant
would not be liable.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would bar lawsuits involving equipment or software
older than 10 years, and would require that claimants give
defendants 90 days to correct a Y2K problem before filing a
lawsuit. The seller of faulty equipment or software would have to
fix it for the cost of delivery and installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all responsible for Y2K problems,'' Duncan said.
``You've got to take steps no matter where you are in the stream of
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive bill also would protect governments' sovereign
immunity. Four other states _ Florida, Georgia, Hawaii and Virginia
_ have passed laws limiting government Y2K liability, according to
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be like El Nino _ everything that goes wrong will be
blamed on computer date failure,'' Duncan said. ``The taxpayers of
this state will be much better off if we continue government
immunity, or sovereign immunity, for the state and political
subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the federal level, a new law seeks to encourage companies to
disclose their potential for Y2K problems by ensuring that such
information won't be used in a lawsuit against them.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting liability
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Austin attorney Bill Hulsey has been helping
local high-tech companies draft contracts and agreements that won't
expose them to Y2K lawsuits. Hulsey argues that even computer
manufacturers, programmers and software companies _ those who would
appear to be most at fault for Y2K problems _ deserve some
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people who knew (about the Y2K problem) probably thought
the software would be replaced before it became an issue,'' said
Hulsey, who works in the Austin office of Gray, Cary, Ware and
Freidenrich, a California-based firm with mostly high-tech clients.
</P>
<P>
   Hulsey also pointed out that many software programs designed for
one purpose have been dropped into other applications, making it
difficult to trace blame.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Texas insurers, who would end up footing the
bill for many Y2K damages, also support some liability limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be some way that we can keep this national
problem from becoming a lawsuit bonanza. These type of things can
get out of hand in a hurry,'' said Rick Gentry of the Texas
Insurance Organization, which represents small to medium-sized
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers stand to gain the most from Y2K litigation, and their
opposition to liability limits comes as little surprise. At one of
several Y2K panels at the American Bar Association's annual
convention in Toronto this past summer, Atlanta lawyer Evelyn
Ashley proclaimed that ``the bug finally provides lawyers the
opportunity to rule the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But trial lawyers aren't the only ones who are concerned about
granting immunity from Y2K liability. If the Y2K bug erases health
records or causes medical equipment to fail, patients may sue
doctors or hospitals. But the Texas Medical Association, realizing
that doctors are likely to be on both ends of Y2K lawsuits, hasn't
yet taken a position on liability limits. Last month, an Illinois
gynecologist filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status on behalf
of health-care providers who bought Y2K-infected software and
hardware from IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Summers says he has no intention of suing anybody, even if Y2K
problems that are no fault of his own prevent him from doing his
job on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would I sue? Would I sue the telephone company for not
having the lines up? Would I sue suppliers for not having enough
stock nearby?'' Summers said. ``I'm not experienced with
litigation. We've never been sued. We've never sued anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Howden of the Texas branch of the National Federation of
Independent Business says his group is still polling its members on
their views on liability limits. Howden said small-business men
generally favor less litigation but ``still need to have an option
to go the courthouse if they absolutely think it's necessary.''

<P>
   Computer experts recommend preparing for potential Y2K power
outages much as you would get ready for a winter storm or a
hurricane. They suggest these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Store a week's supply of bottled water and food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arrange to have on hand enough cash for a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you require regular medication, be sure to have more than a
few days' supply.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make copies of important financial documents, such as recent
bank deposits, account balances, mortgage payments and credit card
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy batteries for flashlights, radios and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep blankets and coats handy in case of cold weather.

EDITORIAL: A TURN FOR THE BETTER AT THE U.N.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan has brought renewed idealism and strengthened
management to the United Nations since taking charge as
secretary-general two years ago. He has also improved relations
with Washington from the sorry level they had sunk to under his
predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. But the United Nation's
diplomatic credibility continues to erode, especially with regard
to Iraq. Most of the blame lies with a Security Council divided by
Saddam Hussein's endless provocations. But Annan's own efforts at
dialogue with Baghdad have complicated matters.
</P>
<P>
   A good secretary-general must combine the skills of a smooth
diplomat, deft organizational politician and unsentimental budget
cutter. The job comes with enormous prestige but limited power. The
United Nations has no army to enforce its resolutions and must
pester its members to pay their dues. Annan's job has also been
made harder by the breakdown of the broad consensus between
Washington and Moscow that enabled the Security Council to function
smoothly in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's strength has been his articulate advocacy of the United
Nation's humanitarian and internationalist ideals. He has pressed
for new programs to educate the world's poor and to ease Third
World debt. He worked hard for a strong international criminal
court, only to be frustrated when the Clinton administration
deferred to unfounded Pentagon fears and kept America from joining.
</P>
<P>
   Though he made his own career as a U.N. official, Annan has
usefully challenged the organization's clubby and ingrown culture,
bringing in fresh thinking from humanitarian organizations and
business executives. He has raised the quality of top U.N. staff,
appointing Mary Robinson as high commissioner on human rights and
Jayantha Dhanapala as undersecretary-general for disarmament
affairs. But he has not consistently backed his appointees against
resistant bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The critical test of Annan's five-year tenure will be whether he
helps define a constructive new relationship between the United
States and the United Nations. As the world's only military
superpower, Washington is capable of intervening on its own in
world crises should it grow frustrated with the weakness of U.N.
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Washington would like U.N. decisions to mirror
American policy goals. But sometimes it better serves the United
States to sacrifice some immediate objectives in order to build a
broader international consensus and uphold international rule of
law. Annan cannot hope to persuade any country to act counter to
its own interests. But it is his role to encourage Security Council
members to rise above narrow national considerations and focus on
compelling international threats, like Iraq's secret production of
biological and chemical weapons. The more he can do so, the more
seriously Washington will take the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, with long U.N. experience and a deep affinity for the
United States, has the background to create a strong working
partnership between Washington and the United Nations. But it is
still not clear whether he will succeed in doing so. Some of his
efforts to avoid armed conflict with Iraq through unwarranted
diplomatic concessions have justifiably irritated the Clinton
administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was right to fly to Baghdad last February and negotiate a
deal allowing U.N. weapons investigators to inspect Iraqi
presidential palaces. But he followed that up by appointing his own
diplomatic representative to Baghdad. Iraq exploited the
arrangement to undermine the authority of the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, and heighten Security Council divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also remains at odds with the United Nations over the
scandalous arrears of American dues and the need for continued U.N.
cost-cutting. There has been progress on both fronts, but not
enough. America's back dues remain unpaid and Annan must cut the
U.N.'s bloated staff and budget more deeply.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, Annan's tenure has begun promisingly. He must learn
from his mistakes on Iraq and work even harder in the next three
years to create a leaner and more vital United Nations ready to
meet the challenges of the new millennium.

CHICAGO BETS ON THEATER TO REVIVE THE LOOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBERT SHAROFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an effort to revive the downtown Loop commercial
district as an entertainment area and add a substantial new tourist
attraction, Chicago is betting heavily on live theater.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the plan is a theater district along Randolph
Street that includes the newly renovated Oriental Theater as well
as two projects that are currently under way _ restoring the
historic Palace Theater and building a two-theater complex for the
Goodman Theater, the city's oldest and largest nonprofit ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city recently finished an elaborate streetscape
improvement project along eight blocks of Randolph Street. It
includes new sidewalks and streetlights &UR;  &LR;  as well as colorful
banners and signs ballyhooing the district.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the city has put about $60 million into the project,
much in the form of tax-increment financing. ``The idea is to make
the Loop a 24-hour neighborhood, and we think theaters will do
that,'' said Christopher Hill, the city's planning commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything is in place, people will be buying upwards of
15,000 tickets a day on Randolph Street,'' said Daniel P. Coffey,
president of Daniel P. Coffey &AMP; Associates, the architecture firm
renovating the Palace Theater. Coffey's firm also did the Oriental
Theater, which reopened this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The theater district is the crest of a sudden wave of new
live-theater development downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Two other theaters  &UR; _ &LR;  the Chicago Theater on State Street and
the Arie Crown Theater at the McCormick Place convention center  &UR; _ &LR; 
were recently renovated. A third project, construction of a home
for the nonprofit Shakespeare Repertory Theater, is under way at
the nearby Navy Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the downtown projects are partnerships that involve both
private developers and the theater companies or managers and
producers that will eventually be the tenants. An example is the
renovation of the Palace, which is part of a hotel and office
building that dates from 1926.
</P>
<P>
   The entire complex was acquired early last year by Pal/Met
Venture, a real estate partnership of the developer Michael Moyer
and the VanKampen family. The hotel _ formerly the Bismarck and now
called the Allegro _ reopened earlier this year. The Palace, a
2,350-seat former vaudeville house that has been closed many years,
will follow this summer, and the office building sometime in 2000.
The total cost of the project is $75 million, including $21.5
million for the theater. Fox Theatricals, the Palace's tenant, is
putting up $4 million, and the whole project received $17.6 million
in tax increment financing from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a locally based production firm that began in the early
1980s and has been a major player in the Off-Loop theater scene,
the Chicago parallel to Off Broadway. The company has also done
several productions on Broadway, including the current musical
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has the theater for 98 years. ``We structured it as two
49-year leases,'' said Michael Leavitt, executive producer of Fox.
``Effectively, it's like owning the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said the Palace would be used for Fox productions as
well as for touring Broadway shows. ``We've designed the house so
that it can hold just about any production,'' he said. ``We've
expanded the stage depth to 45 feet and added three &UR;  &LR; loading docks.
It's very presenter friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two projects under way are the Goodman and the
Shakespeare Repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodman, which occupies a half block at Randolph and
Dearborn streets, has been in the works many years. Its cost is $44
million, of which $18.8 million is coming from the city. The rest
is being raised in a fund-raising campaign. Half the site is
vacant; the other half is occupied by two small historic theaters,
the Harris and the Selwyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Selwyn is being renovated into a 400-seat studio theater,
while all but the Beaux-Arts facade of the Harris has been torn
down. The rest of the project consists of a new 800-seat main
auditorium as well as a lobby and administrative space. The complex
will also include about 50,000 square feet of rentable retail space
on three levels.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the site was once occupied by the Garrick Theater, which
was designed by Louis Sullivan in 1892. The theater was razed in
the 1960s over the protests of preservationists and eventually
replaced with a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roche Schulfer, managing director of the Goodman,
the theater will own the building and have a 99-year lease on the
land. The architects for the project, which is expected to be
finished in the fall of 2000, are Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg
Architects of Toronto and Decker Legge Kemp Architecture of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Shakespeare Repertory project is the final piece of the
redevelopment of Navy Pier, which began several years ago. The
pier, which extends into Lake Michigan, is just northeast of the
Loop and has been turned into an urban amusement park with numerous
shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The pier is controlled by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition
Authority, which has proposed several plans over the years to bring
live theater to the Pier before signing a deal with the Shakespeare
company in 1997. Shakespeare Repertory, which was founded 12 years
ago but has never had a permanent home, is Chicago's third-largest
nonprofit theater.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new complex, which will open next fall, will have a 550-seat
main auditorium and a 350-seat studio theater. The cost is $26
million. In exchange for a 90-year lease, Shakespeare Repertory is
putting up $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect model of the public and private sectors working
together,'' said Criss Henderson, executive director of Shakespeare
Repertory. ``Metropolitan Pier is building the shell, and we're
doing the interior.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dust finally settles at the turn of the century,
Chicago will have added 10,000 live theater seats downtown to an
existing base of about 15,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   According to the League of Chicago Theaters, a trade group that
runs several half-price ticket booths downtown, the Chicago area
currently has about 54,000 live theater seats.
</P>
<P>
   Can the city support the new activity? It depends on whom you
talk to. There is little consensus, even among theater
professionals. ``New theaters coming on line do not scare me,''
said Dulcie Gilmore, general manager of the Oriental Theater, which
is also known as the Ford Center for the Performing Arts and is
owned and managed by Livent. ``What scares me is the availability
of product. It's almost totally tied to what gets produced in New
York. If New York dries up, it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to performing-arts centers anywhere in the country
that rely on blockbuster Broadway shows, you can hear the panic in
their voices,'' said Douglas Kridler, president of the Columbus
Association of Performing Arts, based in Columbus, Ohio, which
recently took over the Chicago Theater.  &UR; ` &LR; `I don't think &UR;  &LR; Broadway
is going to go into free &UR;  &LR; fall, but there is a drought in
mega &UR; - &LR; musicals. &UR; '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Kridler added that the Chicago plans to sidestep this problem
with a booking philosophy that stresses  &UR; `` &LR; a wide variety &UR;  &LR; of arts
and entertainment events, &UR; '' &LR;  including theater, dance, music
and &UR; , &LR;  possibly &UR; ,  &LR;  film.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, see it differently.  &UR; ` &LR; `If you pick up the
weekend entertainment section in New York, how many good or great
plays are being presented at any one time? It's a lot more than
three or four, &UR; '' &LR;  said Robert Wislow, chairman of U.S. Equities
Realty, a real estate firm that worked with the city to devise &UR;  &LR; the
plan for the theater district.  &UR; ` &LR; `Up until now, Chicago has never
had the houses to support this level of activity. Now we do. I
don't really understand what we're worried about.''

FORMER GOTHAM HOTEL RENOVATED IN LUXURY STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the time it opened in 1905, the Gotham Hotel at
Fifth Avenue and 55th Street _ now the Peninsula New York _ played
second fiddle to the 1904 St. Regis across the street. But the
former Gotham _ bankrupted in 1908 after it failed to get a liquor
license _ has reopened after a gut renovation and is aiming for
parity with its more famous neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, while the St. Regis was still under construction, a
group headed by Henry Hoyt bought the plot across from it, the
southwest corner of 55th and Fifth. The initial concept for what
became the Gotham was a residential hotel for those New Yorkers who
were tired of maintaining a city house.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Hiss &AMP; Weekes, the Gotham was arranged in the shape
of a C, with the light court facing south over the University Club,
insuring a protected view. The facade of limestone and granite, in
the Italian Renaissance style, was reserved, where the French-style
St. Regis was opulent, even showy. The architects carefully placed
the decorative stonework to line up with the new University Club
next door.
</P>
<P>
   The Gotham was arranged with single rooms at the core and suites
of apartment scale on the outside. The spaces on the ground floor
were typically of double height, like the main dining room along
Fifth Avenue. In warm weather, large French doors opened to an
enclosed terrace on Fifth Avenue for a summer restaurant, although
the awnings were carefully drawn down to the shrubbery to screen
diners from the view of passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church is at the northwest corner
of 55th and Fifth and the St. Regis had just barely won permission
to serve liquor _ it was in technical violation of a restriction
prohibiting liquor sales within 200 feet of a church. The Gotham,
directly across 55th Street from the church, was unequivocally in
violation of the law. Several newspaper accounts state that U.S.
Sen. Thomas Platt and other influential politicians were silent
partners on the original Gotham team, and in 1905 and 1907 bills
were introduced in the state Legislature exempting hotels from the
liquor provision if they had more than 200 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the bills, which were clearly fashioned for the
Gotham, passed. In 1908 the Gotham went into foreclosure over a
$741 butcher's bill, and the Real Estate Record &AMP; Guide said that
the failure was due solely to the liquor restriction, which it
denounced as ludicrous. The hotel, which had cost $4 million to
build, was sold for $2.45 million.
</P>
<P>
   A new operator said that the emphasis would shift to more
transient occupancy, and that the summer restaurant would be
converted to a Japanese restaurant with cherry blossoms, dwarf
trees and bamboo furniture. But in a campaign to clear the
sidewalks the city swept away stoops, storefronts, bay windows and
other projections beyond the building line _ including the terraced
restaurants of the Gotham and the St. Regis.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. had taken over
the Gotham, and in 1938 stores were installed along the Fifth
Avenue front. To gain the maximum commercial floor area, the
palatial public rooms were ripped out, which explains the hotel's
curious entrance: the check-in desk is one flight up from the
entrance foyer.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s the Gotham had a cocktail lounge. Maris Hart, a
spokeswoman for the New York State Liquor Authority, says that the
200-foot law is still in effect, but that court cases have allowed
the measurement to be made from the point of sale. In this case,
the hotel's cocktail lounge is up a flight of stairs and down a
long hallway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the Swiss hotel owner Rene Hatt took over the hotel for
a long renovation project, which added the distinctive rooftop
health club and pool. The hotel did not reopen until 1987, after a
$200-million revamping. In 1988 the Peninsula Group bought the
building, and closed it in early 1998 for a $45 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The Peninsula New York reopened last month. Teresa Delaney, a
spokeswoman for the hotel, said the 241 guest rooms were gutted and
rebuilt to a new standard, which she said would compete with the
most expensive hotels in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few elements of the original Gotham remain inside, like the
heavily figured lobby ceiling and rear fire stairs, but almost
everything else is new, including sumptuously spacious bathrooms
with televisions over the tubs. A representative room is No. 1600,
with a spectacular view north up Fifth Avenue _past the brownstone
spire of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church _ at $650 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Delaney says one of the most distinctive elements of the new
Peninsula New York is the technological equipment: an ISDN
telephone line for fast Internet access in each room, plus a single
master console on the bedside table that controls the television,
lights, temperature and room request messages.
</P>
<P>
   John Fox, a senior vice president at the hotel-consulting firm
of Pannell Kerr Foster, says that the Peninsula is now at the top
end of hotels in price, in part because ``it's the only one of its
class with a pool,'' and on a par with luxury hotels like the Four
Seasons and, across Fifth Avenue, the St. Regis.

DEVILS, VISITING OTTAWA, TRY TO FORGET THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ The last time the Devils saw the inside of the Corel
Center, they were trudging off the ice, cloaked in disbelief and
disappointment, seeing the seconds tick down on their season and a
celebration they were not a part of beginning in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa Senators ended the Devils' season last year in the
opening round of the playoffs with a surprising 4 games to 2 upset.
As they returned for Saturday night's game, they tried to remember
that it was a new season, a new year, and to focus on the present
rather than past. With the Senators lingering just above the .500
mark and the Devils occupying the top spot in the Eastern
Conference, they hope to avoid an upset again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go in with the attitude that you're going to
win, just like you're walking into Washington, Toronto, or any
building,'' said Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek. ``You're New Jersey
and you're going in there with that attitude. You can't think about
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you can do about the past, just learn and go
ahead. If you're thinking about the past, you're already behind the
eight ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Ottawa actually helped bring Ftorek to his current
position with the Devils, with Jacques Lemaire's five-year tenure
ending after the disappointing finish to the season. Ftorek was an
assistant to Lemaire, but chooses not to linger on the problems
that the Devils ran into, instead concentrating on the team's
current success. They won the first two games on the three-game
road trip that ended here Saturday night, and entered the game
unbeaten in their last eight road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that we didn't play well enough to win and
they played better than we did,'' Ftorek said of last season's
playoff series. ``So we've just got to play better. It's not a
question of whether you lose a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play against a team, you've got to be 100 percent
focused on what you have to do. If an individual gets motivated by
reliving a past occurrence, so be it. That's everybody's individual
prerogative. You can't dwell on things like that. If you have
emotion, it's got to be a controlled anger or emotion. You've got
to go out and play and focus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have done that of late, still playing the solid,
defensive style that is their trademark. But they have also been
far more successful on the offensive end of the ice than the team
was under Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that has been the play of Bobby Holik, who had 12
goals and 18 points in December, both figures leading the National
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ftorek stressed that it is not the Devils' new-found
flash that will change the result of last year's series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jacques Martin always plays a disciplined, position-oriented
counterattack,'' Ftorek said. ``His teams play a solid,
hard-working game. That's Jacques' style. He's always played that
way, although he's modified it and enhanced it. To play Ottawa, you
have to be on your game. Seldom do they give you anything and they
take all that you give them.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay, still feeling the effects of the flu that sidelined
him for the last three games, did not make the trip. McKay
practiced with the team the last two days, but showed fatigue as a
result of having lost about 10 pounds due to the illness, and
having missed 10 days of skating because of a cut to his elbow and
an infection that preceded the flu. Bob Carpenter, nursing a
bruised toe, also remained in New Jersey, and missed his seventh
consecutive game.

DOLPHINS STOP LATE THREAT BY FLUTIE AND THE BILLS

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Buffalo Bills' magical season is over, but things
are just getting started for the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   But this was close, very close, thanks to an incredible comeback
effort by Bills quarterback Doug Flutie in one of the best games of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   A strong Miami defense overcame a stubborn Flutie and a
playoff-record day by wide receiver Eric Moulds, who had a 240
receiving yards, and the Dolphins hung on to beat the Bills, 24-17,
Saturday before 72,698 at Pro Player Stadium in the opening round
of the American Football Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will most likely play the Bronocs in Denver next week if
the New England Patriots lose to the Jacksonville Jaguars on
Sunday. A Patriots victory would mean they would play the Broncos
and the Dolphins would play the Jets at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Miami took a 14-7 lead early in the third quarter after a great
offensive series led by Marino's passing and solid running by Karim
Abdul-Jabbar, who scored on a 3-yard run. Fullback Stanley
Pritchett converted the 2-point conversion on a run up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Flutie and Moulds, one of the most unstoppable tandems
in the National Football League this year. One key play came on a
third down deep in Miami territory. The Dolphins, which had blitzed
Flutie all afternoon with mixed success, did so again. They sent a
defensive back from the corner and just seconds before Flutie got
hit, he lobbed a perfect pass to Moulds, the ball landing on his
finger tips for a 32-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins took a 17-14 lead after an Orlindo Mare field goal
from 23 yards. Then the Miami defense, scorched in the season
finale against Atlanta, came up with a huge play. Bills wide
receiver Andre Reed made a first-down catch but was stripped of the
ball by defensive back Jerry Wilson. The fumble was recovered by
Terrell Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was able to convert that turnover into a touchdown after
Marino threw a 12-yard bullet to wide receiver Lamar Thomas. That
helped the Dolphins to a 24-14 lead with just under 4 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was thrown out of the game after bumping an official in the
final minutes, angry he was ruled short of the goal line when he
thought he got in. So instead of having the ball at the 1-foot
line, the Bills were penalized 15 yards and later had to kick a
33-yard field goal with 1 minute 33 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it looked like the game was over. But an onside
kick was recovered by the Bills at the Buffalo 31-yard line. The
Bills worked their way to the Miami 22 with 57 seconds left. Then
Buffalo, as the crowd grew silent, worked its way to the 5 with 15
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Flutie was sacked by defensive end Trace Armstrong, who
pounded Flutie, and knocked the ball loose. It was recovered by
Miami's Shane Burton.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last of the Bills' five turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The game was intense, which is understandable, considering the
week that led up to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One bit of news had to do with Marino, who was approached in
practice by Johnson this week about redoing his contract, according
to CNN/SI. Marino is scheduled to earn more than $7 million next
season, and Johnson wants to make more room under the salary cap.
So the Dolphins and Marino's agent began contract talks just 48
hours before the game.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that Johnson, who has had a civil though
not warm relationship with Marino, has told the quarterback he will
be back next season. And it is no coincidence that Johnson, the
master motivator, told Marino so soon before a big game. No doubt
Marino felt good this week knowing that he no longer had to worry
about his future.
</P>
<P>
   The other bit of news involved Flutie and Miami's cornerbacks.
Flutie said that Miami's defenders could not cover Buffalo's
receivers one on one. Dolphins cornerback Sam Madison responded
that the short quarterback should keep his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out Flutie was right. On the Bills' first play, the
beginning of an incredible flurry of activity in the opening
minutes, Flutie went deep to wide receiver Eric Moulds. It is rare
to see a receiver beat a cornerback as badly as Moulds beat Terrell
Buckley, who was in man-to-man coverage. Moulds ran by Buckley in
the blink of an eye, caught the ball about 30 yards downfield and
streaked for the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 15 yards short of the end zone, the football came loose _
either the trailing Buckley knocked the wet ball out of Moulds'
hands, or Moulds simply dropped it. Buckley wisely pinned Moulds on
the ground to prevent him from recovering the ball, as safety Brock
Marion picked it up and ran to the Miami 29. A sure scoring
opportunity had turned into a devastating turnover.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami did not take advantage of the momentum. Their first
two drives were long and pretty, 16 and 11 plays, respectively, but
each stalled inside Buffalo territory, ending in Olindo Mare field
goals of 31 and 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills did not waste time getting back into the game after
their early mistake. Flutie again went to Moulds, who burned Miami
on a 37-yard catch to the 5. Two plays later, running back Thurman
Thomas, who has punished the Dolphins over the years, scored on a
1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Then came some bizarre moments. After forcing the Dolphins to
punt, the Bills were again driving to score. Flutie had taken the
Bills to the 6 and faced a third down when he made a rare mistake.
He tried to squeeze the football to a double-covered Reed in the
end zone, and the pass was intercepted by Marion.
</P>
<P>
   There were just 15 seconds left in the first half and Marino
lobbed the ball deep, taking a long shot at a catch, and it paid
off. The ball bounced off the chest of Oronde Gadsden and was
caught by O.J. McDuffie for a 56-yard gain to the Buffalo 9 with
three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Easy field goal, right? But Mare missed it, sending the 27-yard
kick off the right upright.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of moments that give coaches ulcers.

VOLS SAY DUE RESPECT IS LACKING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ One team is undefeated and ranked No. 1. The
other team has one loss and is ranked No. 2. And according to the
oddsmakers, the team favored to win tomorrow night's Fiesta Bowl is
... the one-loss, second-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't particularly please Tennessee, which is 12-0
and ranked No. 1 in both polls. The Volunteers are avoiding the
tired phrase ``we don't get any respect,'' but they're obviously
chagrined at being the higher-ranked underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has made us a little upset,'' Tennessee wide receiver
Jermaine Copeland said. ``We're the ones undefeated and ranked No.
1 in the nation. Everybody is doubting, which has pumped us up. We
have a lot to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, winning close games against Syracuse, Florida and
Arkansas plus a late rally to defeat Mississippi State has
convinced the oddsmakers that Florida State should be the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I surprised we're the favorite? Yes and no,'' Florida State
coach Bobby Bowden said. ``I'm not surprised because we only seem
to be favored.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's recent history _ at least 10 victories and a
ranking of No. 4 or higher each of the past 12 seasons _ has
established the Seminoles as a dynasty. Tennessee is still a
wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been underdogs all year,'' Tennessee linebacker Al
Wilson said. ``That's kind of the motto going around this team:
Tennessee doesn't get the job done, they're not a good football
team. It's just one more challenge for us to prove to everybody
that we can be one of the elite teams in college football.''
Simon's perseverance The Atlantic Coast Conference awards the Brian
Piccolo award each season to a player who has displayed courage.
Piccolo is the former Wake Forest and Chicago Bears running back
who died of cancer and was immortalized in the movie ``Brian's
Song''.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State defensive lineman Corey Simon won the award this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the epitome of persistence,'' Florida State defensive
coordinator Mickey Andrews said. ``He's accepted his misfortune,
and rather than let that be a dead end street, it was just kind of
a detour.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, a 6-foot-4, 275-pound junior, has undergone two surgical
procedures on each shoulder and one to his left knee. He also has
overcome a neck sprain and a knee sprain. This season, he led
Seminoles' interior linemen with 65 tackles, including 16 for
negative yardage. Signs of aging Florida State coach Bobby Bowden
misses his tower. About five years ago, he started conducting
practices from a tower. However, at the Seminoles' practice
facility here at Mountain Pointe High School, there is no tower.
Bowden is having the practices taped from a camera position on a
portable hydraulic lift.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who is 69, also uses a golf cart to motor from his
office to the practice field in Tallahassee. The tower and cart are
concessions to age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give them to you in sequence,'' he said. ``There's the
tower, then you go to the golf cart. Then next is the walker. I'm
at the golf cart and the tower stage. The next one is the walker.''
Briefly Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy Sanders, on the
Florida State defense: ``They have a lot of tendencies. They have a
tendency to make people punt.''
</P>
<P>
   Local ticket scalpers say the fact the game doesn't match
undefeated teams and that Florida State is a bit of a surprise
participant is hurting their business. Seats on the 50-yard line
that ticket brokers expected to sell for nearly $1,000 are going
for $375. Tickets are $100 apiece.

   BAYTOWN, Texas _ The scrapbook that documents Camelia Cruz's
days as a teen-age cancer patient is yellowing now, its photographs
and newspaper clippings fading with the passage of time. On this
sunny Monday morning, Mrs. Cruz cracked it open, as she does every
now and then, unleashing a flood of memories from what seems like a
former life.
</P>
<P>
   There she is in a wheelchair, bald and frail, her face shielded
by a surgical mask, a white hospital blanket draped over her knees.
There she is, smiling, her head swathed in a blue scarf beneath a
sparkling tiara, on the day she was crowned Miss Periwinkle at a
camp for children with cancer. There's Sandy Cuellar, her best
friend from the hospital; Camelia clutched her hand as she died, at
16. Her newspaper obituary is tucked inside Mrs. Cruz's album,
along with a dried rose petal from the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz, now 22, is a survivor of osteosarcoma, a highly
malignant bone tumor. The cancer was diagnosed when she was 13. At
an age when most girls are worried about pimples and boyfriends,
Mrs. Cruz, the former Camelia Trevino, lost her left leg; doctors
had no choice but to amputate above the knee. Then she endured a
year of sickening chemotherapy that has left her with damaged
kidneys, and received blood transfusions that are probably
responsible for infecting her with hepatitis C, a potentially
lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of cancer treatment, Mrs. Cruz's story is hardly
extraordinary. Yet that is precisely what makes it worth noting.
She is part of a trend that experts describe as a miracle of modern
medicine: the transformation of childhood cancer from killer to
curable disease. But thankful though they and their families are
that they are alive, the growing legion of survivors are
discovering that the miracle has not been without a price.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, fewer than one-third of cancer patients under
age 15 lived for five years past their date of diagnosis, the point
at which experts consider them cured. Today, survival is not the
exception but the rule. Roughly three-quarters of all children
currently being treated for cancer are expected to reach the
five-year mark. And as oncologists continue to refine their
methods, the population of childhood cancer survivors, which stands
at an estimated 250,000, is rapidly growing.
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout is often cited as evidence that a cure is within
reach. But as the first large wave of childhood cancer survivors
reaches its 20s and 30s, the word ``cured'' is a misnomer for many.
Though some, particularly those treated more recently, glide
through life virtually unscathed, others are finding that the two
staples of cancer treatment, chemotherapy and radiation, can bring
with them health problems: heart, lung and kidney dysfunction,
memory loss, infertility and even second cancers.
</P>
<P>
   And as they leave their parents' homes to grapple with college,
careers and relationships, they face an array of social
difficulties, as well, from awkwardness in dating to difficulty
finding jobs to an obstacle that can seem as insurmountable as
cancer itself: finding health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Fiduccia, a disability rights consultant in California
who works with survivors of childhood cancer, said, ``The single
biggest part of my job is explaining to people why they are not
going to get health insurance or what will happen when they lose
it.'' When it comes to insurance, he said, former cancer patients
``have a lot of very poor choices.'' If they work for a large
employer, they will usually have health coverage. If not, they may
seek coverage from state high-risk insurance pools or Medicaid, the
federal insurance for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of a person's
health history, companies worried about the cost of insuring their
workers may be wary about hiring someone they know is a survivor of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are able to walk and talk and look like the average
American,'' Fiduccia said, ``but I'm getting more and more calls
about kids who were treated more than 10 years ago for cancer who
are now living at home with their parents and are unemployed. This
is not like falling off your bike and breaking your arm and once
the cast is off, that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Mrs. Cruz, who wears a prosthesis and
walks with a pronounced limp, has discovered that her kidneys do
not retain enough magnesium, a disorder she corrects by taking
supplements and medication. More worrisome is the hepatitis C. Her
doctors suspect she contracted it during a blood transfusion;
experts say as many as 10 percent of childhood cancer patients who
received transfusions before 1992, when blood banks began screening
for the virus, may be similarly infected.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, she married Pablo Cruz, a pipefitter. The wedding
took place in a gazebo at the ``Cancer Survivors Plaza,'' a grassy
park not far from Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, where
Camelia was treated. ``It never bothered me,'' Pablo Cruz said of
his wife's cancer. ``I know what she's been through and I respect
her for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple make their home in a modest frame house, flanked on
one side by railroad tracks and on the other by an oil refinery, in
this working-class industrial city about an hour east of Houston.
Health insurance is a big issue; now that Mrs. Cruz is married, she
no longer qualifies for Medicaid, and at times she has skipped
doctors' appointments because she could not afford them. Her
husband has a policy through his new employer, but the couple are
not sure yet whether Camelia is covered. They have been paying $100
out-of-pocket for her medication each month.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mrs. Cruz thought she would never conceive a child,
an impression her doctors say was erroneous. Fourteen months ago,
she and her husband had a baby, a girl. The pregnancy was
difficult; Mrs. Cruz was exhausted all the time from the loss of
the magnesium, and her hepatitis C, at the time still undiagnosed,
fouled the results of a blood test that screens for birth defects.
``They told me, `Either you have an abortion, or the baby is going
to be dead when it is born,''' she said. ``I was a wreck.'' The
baby was born healthy, at 6 pounds 2 ounces. They named her
Milagro, the Spanish word for ``miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of a recurrence of her cancer are slim,
Mrs. Cruz still worries. A bigger threat is the hepatitis, which
could eventually destroy her liver. She is now contemplating an
experimental treatment for the disease; so far, both her husband
and her baby have tested negative. There is no cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can be sure about what can happen in their future,''
Mrs. Cruz said, casting a glance at her daughter. Over the strains
of ``If You're Happy and You Know It,'' the mother continued:
``What would happen to the baby? How would she grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that about half of all children cured of cancer
experience moderate to severe medical problems years after their
treatment. In the lexicon of cancer survival, these are known as
``late effects.'' Dr. Philip Steuber, the pediatric oncologist who
treated Camelia Cruz, uses another name: ``the cost of cure.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because so few children survived cancer decades ago, doctors are
only just beginning to comprehend how high those costs can be.
Experts know quite a bit about late effects in the first decade
after treatment, but less about the second decade and very little
after that. The issues are complicated; childhood cancer is really
an array of more than a dozen different diseases, each with its
course of treatment and side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with Hodgkin's disease, for example, sometimes require
radiation to the chest; girls who receive this therapy are at high
risk for breast cancer later in life. Patients with brain tumors
almost invariably need radiation to the head; often, their
intellect is impaired, causing problems at school and at work.
Doxorubicin, a mainstay drug of chemotherapy, can cause heart
damage, while another anti-cancer agent, cis-platinum, can harm the
kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Much of today's research revolves around devising new treatments
to minimize late effects, so that the children treated today may
have fewer problems than their predecessors. To that end, Dr.
Leslie Robison, a pediatric cancer expert at the University of
Minnesota, is supervising a study of 15,000 childhood cancer
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute,
involves 26 institutions and more than 100 researchers who are
tracking patients treated between 1970 and 1986. The participants,
whose median age is 26, have answered questionnaires about a range
of issues, from their physical and psychological health to whether
they engage in risk-taking behaviors, such as smoking cigarettes.
The research is important for all cancer survivors, but especially
for children, who could be expected to live an average of 60 years
after they are cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s there was very
aggressive attention and remarkable success in treating childhood
cancer,'' Robison said. ``Now we are putting the focus on looking
at the survivors. We need to know what are the long-term adverse
effects of having had cancer as a child, not just what happens in
the first 10 years after they are treated, but what potentially
could happen 30, 40 and 50 years down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz is ineligible for Robison's study; she received her
diagnosis three years after the cutoff date. But her battle with
osteosarcoma, a relatively rare form of childhood cancer that
afflicts about three out of every million children ages 14 and
under, provides a window into the world of cancer treatment and
survivorship.
</P>
<P>
   Her first sign of sickness was a pain in her left leg; her
family doctor, she said, dismissed it as ``growing pains,'' until
he took an X-ray. The film showed a tumor the size of a misshapen
orange, a lesion so destructive it was clear the limb could not be
saved. In August 1989, one month after her 13th birthday, Camelia
sat in Steuber's office at Texas Children's Hospital. He had the
delicate task of telling her that, the following week, she was
going to lose her leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I remember about her to this day is her
courage,'' Steuber said. ``She was upbeat then, even under the
hardest of circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cruz, for her part, remembers feeling more scared than
courageous. On the morning of the operation, she didn't want to get
out of bed. ``I remember that I wanted to take small steps
everywhere, because these were my last steps that I was going to
take with both my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her surgery, and the 13 months of chemotherapy that followed,
were part of a controlled experiment. This is routine for children
with cancer. Because there are so few of them, it has been standard
practice at oncology centers to enroll all youngsters they treat in
clinical trials. Hundreds of such experiments, conducted at
academic institutions under the auspices of two large pediatric
cancer research networks, have taken place since the 1970s, and
their results, rather than the development of any new miracle
drugs, are largely responsible for the improved survival
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few new drugs, but that is a minor thing,''
said Anna Meadows, a leading expert in pediatric oncology who
directs the Office of Cancer Survivorship at the National Cancer
Institute. ``We have learned how to use the drugs in a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The osteosarcoma study in which Mrs. Cruz participated, Study
8651 of the Pediatric Oncology Group, was typical. One hundred
children were enrolled; half received chemotherapy before surgery;
half, including Mrs. Cruz, did not. The study found that children
do equally well with either course of treatment; as a result,
Steuber said, oncologists today have greater flexibility in
treating osteosarcoma.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest danger with osteosarcoma is that it will spread to
the lungs. The disease is aggressive, Steuber said, and if it is
going to recur it will usually do so within a year. That Mrs. Cruz
has lived for more than eight years since finishing chemotherapy,
he said, bodes well for her.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mrs. Cruz is followed closely by a kidney specialist and
a specialist in infectious diseases, who keeps tabs on her
hepatitis. She visits the oncologists at Texas Children's Hospital
only once a year, where her progress is monitored along with that
of other long-term survivors. The visits are largely social.
``We've been through hard times together,'' Steuber said. ``It's
nice to have good times together.''
</P>
<P>
   Were she able to rewrite her personal history, Mrs. Cruz would
not leave out her cancer. ``Until you come close to death like I
did,'' she said, ``you don't realize what it is to take another
breath.'' She is grateful for that, yet her days are tempered by
uncertainty, and by the reality of life with one leg. She cannot

INDUSTRIES PRESS PLAN FOR CREDITS IN EMISSIONS CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as a proposed treaty on global warming faces
an uncertain future in the Senate, big companies are maneuvering to
push through legislation giving them valuable credits for early
actions to control the waste gases that the binding treaty would
strictly limit.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed treaty, negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, and signed by
the Clinton administration last year, requires steep reductions in
the industrial nations' emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse
gases. If the Senate eventually approves it despite widespread
opposition from major industries, companies want to be sure they
get credit for any reductions they achieve before the treaty takes
force in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would mark a significant shift in the debate in
the Senate over climate change, potentially moderating the
opposition to the treaty among big industry groups and linking
their financial interests to the goals of treaty supporters. And if
it succeeded, it could revive the longstanding efforts of the
administration to persuade industries to cut their emissions
voluntarily, which have met with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a potential winner,'' said Eileen Claussen, executive
director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and a former
treaty negotiator for the administration. ``It helps get the United
States moving. It is voluntary. It is supported by industry. It
seems to me there should be a way to get legislation like that
through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   For some companies, credits earned now could be applied against
strict limits they would face later. Companies able to make even
deeper cuts in emissions now could sell their surplus credits for
billions of dollars under an emissions trading system that the
administration wants to set up.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, big companies, joined by influential
environmental groups and policy analysts, are already lobbying hard
for Congress to guarantee credits for early action.
</P>
<P>
   Three senators, led by John Chafee of Rhode Island, the leading
Republican environmentalist in the Senate, introduced legislation
late in the last session that would assure the companies that their
early reductions would earn credit under any mechanism the
government eventually establishes to limit emissions of greenhouse
gases. The bill is also supported by Sens. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., and Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last month to the National Association of
Manufacturers, Chafee, chairman of the Senate Environment
Committee, said he would make the bill a priority as soon as
Congress reconvened.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the climate debate will indeed continue over the next
few years, we strongly believe that there is a voluntary,
incentive-based approach which can be implemented now,'' he told
the group, which has opposed the Kyoto treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good guys who take action now will be rewarded by having
these actions count,'' Chafee said. ``This credit program may also
make early greenhouse gas reductions financially valuable to the
companies who make them.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean a windfall for companies that have recorded
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions since 1991, a period when
the nation's overall annual emissions ballooned by more than 10
percent despite the administration's voluntary plan to curtail
them.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the bill gives ton-for-ton credits to any of the
more than 150 companies that can document reductions in their
greenhouse gas emissions under various voluntary federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   The DuPont company is one example. The biggest chemical producer
in the United States, DuPont has taken steps that will cut its own
emissions of greenhouse gases far more and much faster than the
treaty would require.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said DuPont would cut its annual greenhouse
gas emissions to much less than half of 1991's levels by the year
2000. Under the treaty, the United States as a whole would have to
cut emissions 7 percent below 1990's level between 2008 and 2012.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did not recognize our voluntary work, you would punish
us for stepping out in front,'' said Darwin Wika, director of
safety, health and the environment for DuPont. ``And the laggards
who did not step up to the plate would be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   By DuPont's calculations, by the end of this year it will have
reduced its annual emissions by the equivalent of 90 million tons
of carbon dioxide. Economists' estimates of the value of carbon
credits in an emissions trading scheme vary widely, but depending
on the crediting rules, DuPont's savings alone could someday be
worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some big environmental groups, like the Environmental Defense
Fund, which favors emissions trading and other market-based
pollution controls, have published detailed proposals for granting
credits to companies that move early, and have advised lawmakers on
drafting legislation. There are at least five such proposals
spelled out by various advocates, including one by Niagara Mohawk,
the New York utility company.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists have criticized the bill offered by
the three senators.
</P>
<P>
   John Stanton, legislative director for the National
Environmental Trust, a pro-treaty advocacy group, said the bill
``does not provide sufficient guarantees that emission reductions
credited under it will actually result from reduced emissions, as
opposed to phantom paper reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chafee planning hearings soon, the lobbying is sure to
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are creating a new currency called carbon-dioxide tons,''
said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, another
treaty advocacy group. ``There is a lot of money involved, and
there is going to be a lot of ferocious jockeying to control who
gets the money. It is going to be pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the most active proponents of credit for early action
are a closely knit coterie of former government officials, policy
analysts, environmental advocates, lobbyists, lawyers and corporate
officials who have been working for months to build support for the
credit idea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Environmental Defense Fund and the Pew Center for
Global Climate Change, they include law firms and lobbyists like
Van Ness Feldman and Alcalde &AMP; Fay, both of which represent several
electric utilities, and a number of individual companies, several
of them aligned with the Pew Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies, big and small, could benefit from the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest year for which data is available, companies
participating in voluntary reductions of greenhouse gases reported
to the Energy Department that they had reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by the equivalent of 137 million tons of carbon dioxide.
Under the bill, all of them would qualify for credits.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which filed detailed reports about more than
1,200 emission control projects, included 156 participants in more
than a dozen different industries. Most of them are electric
utilities, but other types of companies are increasingly
participating.
</P>
<P>
   Even one individual filed a report in 1995. Carter Lewis III,
who at the time was a consultant for the Energy Department, claimed
to have cut his personal emissions of carbon dioxide by between
three and four tons by never having more than one light at a time
turned on in his house, and by commuting to work outside of rush
hours to save gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to demonstrate what the ordinary citizen could
do,'' he said. ``You don't have to be a gigantic power plant to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions.'' (The reductions he claimed,
however, would have only a trivial market value.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of participants has increased steadily, for
the past few years the amount of reductions in emissions that they
claimed has been falling. In 1996 it was the equivalent of 154
million tons of carbon dioxide, and in 1995 it was 183 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable debate whether actions taken years ago
should be granted credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent the credit is regarded as an incentive to spur
industry to make greenhouse gas reductions that would not otherwise
occur, there is little basis for rewarding reductions already
achieved,'' said the report, written for the Pew Center by Robert
Nordhaus and Stephen Fotis of Van Ness Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they noted, companies that signed onto the
administration's voluntary programs may have relied on the
government's representations that they would be granted appropriate
credits.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, which investigated the Energy
Department's reporting system, found some flaws that suggest that
the claims may be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The agency noted that the Energy Department does not verify that
claimed reductions are actually achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have used many different strategies for reducing their
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, officials said, not only has cut its energy consumption,
but invested millions of dollars changing its processes for making
adipic acid powder, a chemical feedstock. The new approach
eliminates most emissions of nitrous oxides, like carbon dioxide a
potent greenhouse gas that would be controlled by the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   American Forests, a conservation group, has filed annual reports
with the Energy Department describing hundreds of tree-planting
projects that could offset carbon dioxide emissions because growing
trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store the
carbon as wood.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the organization has planted more than 8 million trees,
which it calculates will offset 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide
or lock up 634,000 tons of carbon. Credits for those tons could
easily become worth millions of dollars to the organization in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Many electric utilities have argued that they have achieved
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by operating their nuclear
power plants more efficiently, reducing the need to burn coal in
other power plants. Some utilities have filed reports with the
Energy Department claiming millions of tons of reductions of this
kind, even as their total emissions of carbon dioxide have
continued to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Power Co., for example, reported that its total annual
emissions of carbon dioxide increased from about 24 million tons in
1990 to about 36 million tons in 1996, an increase of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It said, however, that its more efficient use of nuclear power
between 1993 and 1996 prevented an additional 35 million tons of
carbon dioxide from being added to the atmosphere. Credit for those
tons could be very important to Duke if it is told to sharply limit
its emissions between 2008 and 2012 to help comply with the global
warming treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Heidi Lehman was always an academic achiever. She finished high
school a year early, went through college in three and a half years
and then earned a law degree. But nothing in those 18 1/2 years of
formal education prepared the 36-year-old lawyer for her daughter
Carly's first-grade homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers said it should take just 20 minutes,'' Ms. Lehman
recalled. ``Right! These are little kids _ they get frustrated,
they're tired, they're working hard all day in school. It'd stretch
out for an hour, easy. We'd have tears, screaming, kicking the
table. Then there'd be lots of hugs and kisses and I'd say, `Don't
do it, Carly. It's not worth it.' I never had homework myself in
elementary school. Carly would scream, `I have to do it, Mom!' ''
</P>
<P>
   And if Carly didn't do it? Shame and scorn. The mother has saved
Carly's first spelling test from first grade with the words unable
to spell at this time written in large letters at the top by the
teacher. First graders in Millburn, N.J., don't just have regular
spelling lists for homework; they also get a challenge list and a
superchallenge list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told only the boys and girls who want to do it should do
it,'' Ms. Lehman said. ``Is that pressure or what?'' Among the
first-grade superchallenge words: ``experiment,'' ``observation,''
``measuring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First grade!'' Ms. Lehman said. ``And there are kids who can
do this. You say to yourself, `Is that natural or not?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carly survived first grade, is now a third grader and has grown
used to the homework life. One recent day, she came home from
school at 3:05, hoisted her backpack onto the kitchen table and by
3:10 was doing her homework. ``You want a snack?'' her Mom asked.
``You want to watch a little TV first?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' Carly said. ``I have to do my homework!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carly has a notebook for all her homework assignments,'' Ms.
Lehman said. ``I don't remember being so organized like this at
this age _ they have to be organized!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lehman is right when it comes to measuring the gross tonnage
of today's homework: American schools are giving more and more to
younger and younger children. A national survey by the Institute
for Social Research at the University of Michigan showed that in
1981 6- to 8-year-olds spent an average of 44 minutes a week on
homework (about 9 minutes a school night). By 1997, homework for
first to third graders had nearly tripled, to 123 minutes a week
(or 25 minutes a night).
</P>
<P>
   While Millburn has long been a high-powered suburban district,
ranking at the top of national academic surveys, it has not always
been a heavy homework district. Pat Romano is one of the
first-grade teachers at Deerfield Elementary School in Millburn
assigning the alleged 20 minutes of homework each night.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1970s, when Ms. Romano's two children attended
elementary school in Millburn, they had no homework until fifth or
sixth grade, she said. And they did just fine: her son graduated
from Brown University in engineering; her daughter got a master's
degree from Johns Hopkins University. So it seemed natural to ask
her, ``Do you really think it's necessary for first graders to have
so much homework?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say a lot,'' Ms. Romano said, ``but I don't want to
comment.'' She felt that mandatory homework was too controversial
to discuss on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Burne, the principal of Deerfield, said the school really
has no choice _ it must assign homework. ``This is what's demanded
to stay competitive in a global market,'' he said. ``There's a
feeling that somehow all of this extra work and early discipline
builds up to give us an edge in standardized testing.'' But there
is a trade-off, he acknowledged. ``To do this, we are taking away
some of the years of adolescence and childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Lehman keeps wondering if this generation of
little children will burn out by high school. She remembers a
second-grade homework assignment that required Carly to pick a
country and write a report on it. Then parents were invited to
school to hear the reports and sample foods from the various
countries. ``This kid did his report on France,'' Ms. Lehman said.
``Then he put it down and said, `I did a second report on another
country.' My reaction was, `Would you just shut up!' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is an assumption that the trend today to give more
homework sooner is a return to traditional values, but that is not
the case. As Brian Gill and Steven Schlossman pointed out in their
1996 article in the American Journal of Education, for much of this
century leading educators have deplored assigning homework at a
young age. As early as the 1890s, a muckraking doctor, Joseph Mayer
Rice, attacked the homework ``spelling grind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not our duty to save the child from this grind?'' he
wrote in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, U.S. Education Commissioner William Torrey Harris
testified before Congress that there should be no homework before
age 12. In the 20 years before World War I, The Ladies' Home
Journal led a national crusade against homework. Teachers wrote the
magazine to thank the editor, Edward Bok, for speaking out, saying
they were afraid if they criticized mandatory homework practices
they would lose their jobs. Newspapers like The New York Times
editorialized against homework, and in 1930, the American Child
Health Association classified homework as a form of child labor.
During the 1920s and '30s, New York City public schools banned
homework until fourth grade; San Diego banned it through eighth
grade; and Sacramento had a prohibition on elementary-school
homework for 45 years, until 1961. In extreme cases, homework was
seen as causing crooked spines, night terrors and nervous
breakdowns in children. ``Drill and kill,'' they called it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But whenever the nation has felt an external threat, said Gill,
a researcher at the Rand Institute in Santa Monica, Calif.,
educators have manned the barricades by piling on homework.
Homework grew in popularity in the '50s, after the Russians
launched Sputnik, and continued in favor until the late '60s, but
lost ground in the anti-Vietnam War counterculture years. Then, in
the early '80s, with the U.S. economy in recession, the Japanese in
ascent and the publication of the study ``A Nation at Risk,''
maintaining that our educational system was lagging behind other
industrialized nations', homework returned to fashion and has kept
its popularity right through the global economy years.
</P>
<P>
   In these last 15 years, the biggest increase in homework has
fallen mainly on the youngest citizens; at the high-school level,
homework has stayed fairly constant. University of Michigan
researchers have found that the amount of homework the typical
high-school senior does has remained virtually unchanged since 1976
_ between six and seven hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Once the pendulum swings one way, it takes a long time to
reverse direction, but there are signs that heaping on homework for
young children is taking its toll, at least in the supercharged
suburban districts. Dee Shepherd-Look, a psychologist with a family
practice in suburban Los Angeles, said that in her 28 years as a
therapist she has never treated so many young children for
homework-related anxieties. It started 10 years ago, she said, but
has become pronounced in the last five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of school phobias,'' she said. ``I just got off
the phone with the mother of a 9-year-old who's a wreck because he
can't remember his Shakespeare lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shepherd-Look does not blame the schools. ``I think it's the
parents who push the schools,'' she said, adding that more parents
are working longer hours, they are on call in the evenings and
weekends for their jobs and they are doing the same thing to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   I had a 5-year-old, she didn't want to go to school,'' Dr.
Shepherd-Look added. ``But it wasn't just school _ every day she
had some different activity after school. They are what I call
resume kids.''
</P>
<P>
   This generation's parents are caught in a trap of their own
making: they are pushing their children and their schools to be
more competitive, even as they have less time to help with homework
and activities.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on the homework angst, Newsweek did a cover story
last spring headlined ``Why Homework Doesn't Help.'' The article
was based in part on the research of Dr. Harris Cooper of the
University of Missouri, considered a leading homework scholar. In
1989, Cooper did a landmark survey of more than 100 homework
studies and concluded that, while children who do substantial
amounts of homework perform better on standardized tests at the
junior-high and high-school level, it does not seem to make a
difference for elementary-age students.
</P>
<P>
   ``For elementary-school students, the effect of homework on
achievement is trivial, if it exists at all,'' Cooper concluded.
</P>
<P>
   This would be of great comfort, of course, to all those
overwrought parents of young children tormented by superchallenge
words, but others question his theory. If scores on standardized
tests are going to be used to measure performance _ and such
testing has never been more important in American society than it
is today _ the proper headline, sadly, may be ``Why Homework Does
Matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Epstein, a professor of education at Johns Hopkins
University and also a leading expert on homework, has done studies
showing that elementary-school homework improves school
performance. She also suspects it improves performance on
standardized tests. And it may be that Carol Huntsinger, an
education professor at the College of Lake County in suburban
Chicago, has produced a new study that demonstrates just that.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Dr. Huntsinger was running a nursery school in
an upper-middle-class North Shore suburb. She noticed how parents
of her Chinese-American students began formal home study earlier
than Euro-American parents did. This was not just creative play;
this was sitting at the kitchen table each night doing exercises in
phonics and math.
</P>
<P>
   And so she devised a research project contrasting the home-study
habits of 40 well-educated Chinese-American North Shore families
with the habits of 40 similarly prosperous Euro-American families.
The typical Chinese-American parents came to this country from
Taiwan in their early 20s to attend graduate school, became
citizens and had children here. All Euro-American parents, except
one, were American-born.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Huntsinger did her first assessment of the children in the
early '90s, when they were in pre-kindergarten or in kindergarten,
and has revisited the families every two years since. The
Chinese-Americans, she found, brought the cultural practice of
doing more homework earlier from their native land.
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Hsiao, a chemist born in Taiwan, would sit with her
4-year-old son, Ronald, each night doing exercises she had devised.
She taught numbers and then moved on to addition and subtraction by
using objects like playing cards and dice. Before Ronald was in
first grade, Ms. Hsiao spent 10 to 15 minutes a day with him on
math and the same on phonics. ``He'd count with his fingers and
toes,'' she recalled. ``One time I gave him a problem, the answer
was more than 10 _ he had to take off his shoes, his fingers
weren't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Before first grade, the Chinese-American children were spending
an average of 54 minutes a day in this formal home study, while
Euro-Americans spent 6 minutes. The difference continued as the
children got older and the homework was provided by schools. At
first and second grade, the Chinese-American families averaged 31
minutes on homework versus 11 for the Euro-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The result was a substantial difference in standardized test
results, Dr. Huntsinger found. Typically in math, the
Chinese-Americans scored a grade level ahead of the Euro-Americans.
But the effect of the home-study habits was even more substantial
regarding tests measuring English vocabulary skills. Typically, the
Chinese-American children started behind _ their parents spoke
Chinese at home. But Dr. Huntsinger found that parents did things
like assign an extra 15 English vocabulary words to master each
week. Over time it got results. While the children were a year
behind the Euro-Americans on the English test in kindergarten, they
were a year ahead by fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Dr. Huntsinger think the results can be explained by
ethnic differences. There were a few Euro-American families who had
a similar approach to homework, and their children had test results
similar to the Chinese-Americans'.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has not seen this new study, but says that the
Chinese-American kindergarteners were not technically doing
homework because the parents were initiating it. But Dr. Huntsinger
countered that American schools could give such exercises for
homework at this earlier age, if that were society's priority.
</P>
<P>
   And while this may sound like cruel and unusual punishment for
little people, consider that 20 years ago it would have seemed
equally harsh to assign first graders homework. Today it is
standard practice. The more homework is assigned at an earlier age,
the more the parent is forced to get involved. ``The kids are
supposed to do it on their own,'' Ms. Lehman of Millburn said.
``Then they come home with pages of homework sheets with
instructions that are full of huge words.''
</P>
<P>
   As Karen Sokoloff, a Millburn parent of two elementary-school
children, said: ``They don't just disappear into their rooms to
emerge an hour later with everything done, their backpacks zipped
up. My husband, Andy, and I split up _ I say, `You take Eric, I'll
take David.' '' Ms. Sokoloff's least favorite homework was
second-grade spelling; the children were supposed to write the
words three times, using a different-colored marker every time.
``They'd have 20, 25 words, picking up the marker, putting it down,
picking up the marker,'' she said. ``It was torture to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   So-called creative homework may be even worse. Foods from around
the world _ you think second graders are cooking up those Hungarian
goulashes? All over America at this moment, mothers are frantically
digging through old shoe boxes to find nine photos of their child,
one from each year, so they can begin their third grader's
time-line project.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the boy or girl who doesn't have that support at
home? The more important that homework becomes in school, the more
a child can fall behind. Etta Kralovec, the director of teacher
education at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine,
worked on a state-financed study there in the early '90s,
interviewing dropouts about why they quit school. She was amazed
that every single person in her survey mentioned the inability to
keep up with homework as a major factor. ``These were children from
poor families who got no help at home,'' Ms. Kralovec said. ``They
fell farther and farther behind until they gave up and dropped
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Courchene, 23, was one of those students interviewed in
the survey. He now lives in Oklahoma, where he works in a coffee
factory. Growing up, he said, his father didn't live with the
family, and his mother didn't have time to help. ``She was too busy
or she was working,'' he said. ``There's no one you can ask
questions. You can't get the answers you need.'' By sixth grade, he
said, he was lost. ``To hide it, I turned myself into a class
clown. Teachers felt I was a lost cause.''
</P>
<P>
   To make up for such inequities, Ms. Kralovec proposes getting
rid of homework altogether, and she is writing a book, ``Clearing
the Kitchen Table: Homework and the American Dream,'' with that
message. Sounding very much like the reformers from the first half
of this century, she complains that homework creates a long workday
for children, robs them of playtime and cuts into important
creative time with the family.
</P>
<P>
   Given the highly competitive spirit of the nation at this
moment, however, Americans may not be ready for such a radical
change.
</P>
<P>
   But there are efforts under way to counter some of these
inequities. Dr. Epstein of Johns Hopkins has developed a series of
interactive homework assignments with clearly written instructions
for parents and children. The worksheets are meant to insure the
tasks can actually be done by a child, and they are being used in
schools nationwide. Other school systems have returned to a popular
1930s reform _ supervised study within school. Children who may not
get support at home are given help with their homework at school.
</P>
<P>
   In Quincy, Mass., a blue-collar suburb of Boston, middle schools
have before- and after-school programs where children get homework
assistance from local college students volunteering their time.
Teachers like Eileen Sadof in Quincy are aware that many of her
students won't get help at home, so she often starts homework
projects in class. Ms. Sadof, who teaches English at Broad Meadows
Middle School, said: ``I tell them, `You can have free reading time
now.' They think they're taking advantage of me, but a lot don't
have a quiet place at home to read. I'm just trying to hook them on
the book in class so they'll be more likely to find a way to do it
at home on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore schools are applying this approach even earlier.
Eight elementary schools have a three-hour after-school program
geared to helping children with their homework and preparing them
for the state standardized tests. At Dr. Bernard Harris Elementary,
a school where 90 percent of the children receive free lunches,
nearly half the students attend the after-school program. It is
costly to run, $135,000 a year, which mainly pays the salaries of
the 14 teachers who spend the extra three hours at school each day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The program is highly structured; an hour is spent doing a
creative project (during a recent session, Claude Morris, a third
grader, correctly calculated that it would take 8 centimeters of
root-beer soda to make ice cream in an ice cream float, float); an
hour of club time (for geography, reading or board games); and a
half-hour reviewing homework. At the homework session, the teacher,
Denise Norfleet, had the children go over that night's reading
assignment, a story about Violet Hill Whyte, Baltimore's first
African-American police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I want you guessing?'' Ms. Norfleet said at one point.
``Where do you go for the answer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to the story!'' they called out.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brown, who has custody of her grandson Christopher, says
the program has been a godsend. It is divided into three sessions a
year. ``Last year, he took one,'' she said. ``This year, we're
going to take all three.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher smiled. ``Good news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore program has melded two of the major trends in
American education today _ more homework and more standardized
testing. At Dr. Bernard Harris, there is no subtlety about it _
teachers are now spending the entire school year teaching for the
standardized tests: the California Achievement Tests that the
children are given each fall, and the Maryland School Performance
Assessment Program, or MSPAP, test they take in the spring. There
are lists of MSPAP vocabulary words posted in all the classrooms,
along with lists of MSPAP test hints. And weekly homework packets
have been written specifically to drill the children on what is on
each test. The homework packets geared for the California test
require the children to answer questions by filling in the right
bubble, just as they will have to do on the actual test. The MSPAP
homework uses MSPAP vocabulary words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have MSPAP on the brain,'' said Mae Williams, a Baltimore
third-grade teacher. ``But their scores went up this last time, so
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to measure a successful school _ the
creativity of the students, their happiness, their hunger to learn
new things, their love for reading. But at this point in American
history, the most important measure, the one that gets printed in
all the newspapers, the one that individual schools and entire
school districts are measured by and all the politicians talk
about, is performance on standardized tests. And as long as that is
true, those backpacks are likely to be full each night starting in
grade 1 and maybe earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What the pendulum will swing back on homework is certain, but to
change things it will likely take a major cultural shift impossible
to envision right now.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the Millburn schools were giving too much
homework too soon, a parents' group helped pay to fly Cooper, the
University of Missouri expert, to New Jersey in October. Cooper
explained to 150 parents and teachers that little children have a
limited attention span, and he recommended just 10 minutes of
homework a night starting in first grade and adding 10 minutes to
that time each year after, through high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a different type of community,'' he said, meaning a
high-pressured suburban district, ``I would raise it to 15
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper has found that despite his recommendations, most suburbs
don't lighten their homework load after he visits, and, indeed,
Deerfield Elementary still assigns the alleged 20 minutes of
homework to its first graders. Parents in places like Millburn may
feel in their hearts that their children have too much homework,
but as long as everyone else is doing it, there's pressure to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   When Phyllis Catz, the assistant superintendent of Millburn
schools, was asked during an interview whether she felt elementary
students had too much homework in her district, she said no, that
it built good study habits and discipline for future years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said Dr. Catz, who has been an educator for 35
years, ``if you talked to me in the 1970s, I'd have given you a
different answer.''

<P>
   The car is littered with empty plastic bottles of spring water,
granola bar wrappers and CDs by the Dave Matthews Band, Live and
the Grateful Dead. That last band name takes on fresh resonance as
we drive west on Interstate 90 toward Utica, N.Y. It is the fourth
day of a five-day, 1,383-mile car journey, which pushes the
odometer past 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   My companion is a buff young woman, a month shy of 17, who is
sleeping curled up in the shotgun seat, direct from rebuilding
trails in the Idaho wilderness. She is the firstborn, Kate, in
T-shirt and cutoffs. The dashboard is scored with the dusty tread
marks of her running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   We are visiting colleges. Five days, five campuses _ a
mini-marathon beyond brochures, a road trip to the future. We need
a guide. Five of them, in fact. They turn out to be Dave, Kurt,
Kirsten, Anna and Sarah. They are campus tour guides, the first
tenuous link between campus and prospective undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   We're on a tight schedule but hardly a record setter. Along the
way _ was it Colby? Bowdoin? _ we have encountered Amanda from
Chappaqua, N.Y., who is doing 10 schools. On our last day, a
Thursday, we meet up with her again at Hamilton College, in
Clinton, N.Y., about 12 miles south of Utica. She and Kate, both
lacrosse players, confer.
</P>
<P>
   Each has seen Colby, Bates, Bowdoin and Middlebury on this trip.
Amanda has also stopped at the University of Vermont, Cornell,
Colgate, Skidmore and Union. The girls look bright and stylish, but
their glazed eyes betray them. Too much college _ their normally
acute teen-age sensors are nearing overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't know where she wants to go, either,'' Kate says
sullenly, standing in the entry hall of Hamilton's admissions
office, which, by the way, is a house that was once occupied by
Elihu Root, Theodore Roosevelt's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   We are stuffed with facts, exotic and otherwise. But they
quickly lose their distinctive flavor as one verdant college
quadrangle morphs into the next. Rewinding our brain tapes, we
realize we know everything and nothing. For example: Each school
has dormitories and classrooms, swimming pools, hockey rinks and
professors. The dining halls are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., or 7
a.m. to 8 p.m., or 6 a.m. to midnight, or all night. The snack bar
delivers pizza until 2 a.m. Or not. Freshmen live separately from
upperclassmen. Or not. Substance-free dorms are available for those
who don't smoke and don't want to be around those who do.
</P>
<P>
   The big mudholes we walk past are being dug for a new
multimillion-dollar science hall or a field house or a library. The
president is friendly. And each year, the entire junior class
leaves campus for someplace like Europe.
</P>
<P>
   You could get all this from the official video, catalog or view
book. But you can't really get it unless you take the tour.
</P>
<P>
   So we do, walking and shuffling across acres of private,
nonprofit country club. We stroll among vast exhibitions of
architecture and ideas, and we get museum feet _ that mildly achy
feeling in soles and calves that comes from wandering without
knowing where you're headed, or why.
</P>
<P>
   But there is help from our guides. All are well versed in campus
lore, with a knack for sounding both genuine and honest.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: A travel day, to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Monday: We meet our first guide of the week at Colby, in
Waterville. He is Dave Famiglietti of Windsor Locks, Conn., a
German major entering his junior year. He has a girlfriend in
Toronto and a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Like his counterparts at other schools, Dave is casually
dressed, wears sandals and walks backward for an hour, talking
almost nonstop, breaking for questions, greeting friends with a
wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I volunteered to give tours because I wanted to make Colby
stand out in people's minds,'' he says. ``I went on so many tours
during my search, and so many were dry, boring.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls one: ``She kept telling us little dumb facts about
the school: `This building was built in 1874 by three green men
from Mars, who at first didn't like their life here on Earth, but
then grew to like it, so they moved to Minnesota.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dave, who chooses what to say and the route to take, says he
always tries to be honest about the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families only remember about 10 percent of what I talk
about,'' he says. ``Of that 10 percent or so, I would guess that 7
percent is something they asked the tour guide about. So I am
always careful to pause for questions, and sometimes really try and
drag questions out of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions tend to be routine, including those about drug and
alcohol use, which Dave fields confidently. Students in the wilds
of small-town Maine can still have fun, he says, but they don't
want to get thrown out of school. So they make their own fun. He
cites the Mr. Colby contest last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite part,'' Dave says, ``was the swimwear and
evening-wear competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, we're at Bates College, in Lewiston. Our
guide, Kurt Eilhard, has just finished his freshman year. It
drizzles, but he pushes on valiantly, explaining the electronic
dorm cards, praising the debating team and noting that construction
of the new social-sciences building is ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Kate likes the tour, but my thoughts drift. Waiting for her to
emerge from an hourlong interview in the admissions office, I gaze
across the waiting room. There are people with gray hair and liver
spots, women with flabby arms, men who should be barred from
wearing form-fitting knit polo shirts. And it hits me: I am one of
these people.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: Bowdoin. Kirsten Partenheimer, another German major,
from Haddonfield, N.J. Long skirt, sandals. We watch her walk
backward, into Druckenmiller Science Hall. Its lobby is open all
night for study, she says, and it's especially good if you're not a
science major: there's nobody to talk to, so your time isn't
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten calculates she did more than 125 tours last summer.
(Most guides are paid between $5 and $6 an hour, with tours given
year-round.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always comments on how well we walk backward,''
Kirsten says. ``And we usually hear the same old jokes, but one of
the guides thought it was cute when a father offered to have
everyone on the tour walk backward so the guide could walk forward.
Actually, the only time I fell on the tour was when I was walking
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Middlebury, Vt. Anna Tiven, from Williamstown, Mass.,
a Latin American studies major entering her junior year. Another
big, beautiful campus; the Adirondacks on one side, the White
Mountains on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Backward she walks, into a seminar classroom, past small dorms
that look like ski chalets, into a larger dorm.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, buildings are beginning to resemble tombstones in
a cemetery. We walk among them, looking at the dates on
cornerstones and hearing about who came before us.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Final day. Hamilton. Sarah Lamont, political science,
Cobleskill, N.Y. Many in her family attended Hamilton before her.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows everybody else, she says. Professors are your
friends. Fraternities no longer have hegemony over the social
whirl.
</P>
<P>
   Recent visitors: Colin Powell, F.W. de Klerk, B.B. King.
</P>
<P>
   We do the library, we pass the theater, we enter a chapel.
</P>
<P>
   And toward the end of the tour, Sarah recalls the day she
watched a visiting performer in the Beinecke student center. He was
billed as a regurgitationist. Apparently, he was able to swallow
bits of this and that and then regurgitate them. Sarah asks for our
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever see him, would you ask him two questions for me?''
she says. ``One, `How did you discover you had this talent?' And
two, `How did you find a market for it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   I am thinking about Sarah's questions on the drive back to New
Jersey later that afternoon, preparing to point out to Kate that a
good liberal arts education, besides still sounding like a lot of
fun, sometimes means deconstructing the meaning of an apparently
meaningless vaudeville act. But Kate, her sneakers off for the
first time in days, is fast asleep.

Postcards from the ledge ... 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Franchione stood there on the Sun Bowl turf in El Paso
Thursday afternoon, shivering after the traditional icy Gatorade
shower, his silver hair still somehow neatly combed, his smile
broad, his voice resonant and firm, articulately telling the TV
cameras how proud he was of his Frogs' 28-19 victory over Southern
Cal, and who couldn't help but think:
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, somebody in a bigtime athletic program _ no
disrespect to TCU intended, but you know the kind I'm talking about
_ is sitting there, watching this, and saying to himself, ``Why
isn't this guy coaching for us?''
</P>
<P>
   I predict one more year, and then some school's Tom Hicks is
going to swoop in with an offer Coach Fran can't refuse and TCU
can't match and he'll be gone.
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrating, it's sad, but it should be expected.
</P>
<P>
   But does it have to be that way?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Franchione has a great thing going at TCU. Any chance
he'll like it in Fort Worth so much, enjoy the challenge of turning
a small, private university with a pretty neat history into a
perennial power in the Southwest, that he might just decide he's
making enough money to be comfortable and stay?
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the one that begins, ``Once upon a time....''
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me, the next time you hear some professional
athlete or coach say he ``reluctantly'' has to opt for the big
bucks ``because I have to think about my family,'' wouldn't it be
nice if his family spoke up and said, ``Hey, we've got enough,
we're happy here.''...
</P>
<P>
   Pat Sullivan kept telling us all last season that the Frogs
should have been better than 1-10, that the talent was better than
that. Turns out he was absolutely right. They just needed someone
who could show them how to win. Exit Sullivan, enter Franchione....
</P>
<P>
   For those who complain that Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman is
too conservative, isn't creative enough and doesn't scramble,
please note the flipside of the coin: The Cowboys led the NFL with
only 15 turnovers and had the fewest sacks, numbers directly
related to Aikman's unwillingness to gamble and risk huge losses or
interceptions....
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wiley Curtis, president of the Frogs' basketball booster
club, was playing golf this summer with Billy Tubbs, head coach of
the men's team, and Mike Petersen, who coaches the TCU Lady Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there were a few side bets riding on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``These matches always start out for fun but those two guys
being extremely competitive start to really battle it out,'' Curtis
says.
</P>
<P>
   On the back nine the threesome comes up to Billy's ball laying
directly on the cart path. Tubbs asks for a drop but as Coach Pete
starts to his drive in the center of the fairway he reiterates that
the rules for the day were to play everything as its lies, no
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Let Dr. Curtis pick up the story:
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Pete chuckles from the middle of the fairway as Coach
Tubbs takes a practice swing and sparks fly as the clubhead goes
across the pavement. Tubbs then takes a vicious swing (sparks fly
again) and knocks his shot four feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petersen, in amazement, shouts, `Great Shot! What did you
hit?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Tubbs looks up and snaps, `Your 5-iron.'''...
</P>
<P>
   The winter's free agency lunacy has Rangers' president Tom
Schieffer shaking his head, even as his team jumps in with both
feet. He sees the rich continuing to get richer and the poor
looking for bankruptcy lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the Big 10 and the Little 20, and that's not good
for baseball,'' Schieffer says. ``Fortunately for our fans locally,
we're one of the big 10, so I think we'll be able to continue to
have a competitive team, but it's better if every city can have at
least the hope of winning. That's the essence of baseball, the
anticipation of spring and a new beginning, but for the majority of
teams, that's becoming increasingly difficult to do.''...
</P>
<P>
   Why, you ask, isn't revenue sharing working in baseball? Because
owners of the teams on the south side of the tracks are cutting
their payrolls, giving them no chance to win, then pocketing the
revenue sharing checks from the richer teams in order to break even
or even make a little money. It's the teams with the $30-$40
million payrolls that are getting clobbered....
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Star columnist Richard Griffin went on record last week
urging that Blue Jays' general manager Gord Ash pull the trigger on
a deal that would send Roger Clemens to the Rangers for pitcher
Rick Helling, centerfielder Tom Goodwin and a prospect. It could
happen....
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of reasons why Dave Wannstedt was fired as head
coach of the Chicago Bears, but the fact that he'd lost 10 straight
to the Packers hurt as much as anything....
</P>
<P>
   You think there were some big New Year's Eve parties Thursday
night? Wait'll you see the celebration in Alvin on Tuesday after
it's announced that favorite son Nolan Ryan has been elected to the
Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot. We should be
able to hear the hootin' and hollerin' from here....
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Ryan is a foregone conclusion. So, I figure, are George
Brett and Robin Yount. Carlton Fisk will eventually get there, but
maybe not this year. Others who got my vote: Gary Carter, Tony
Perez....
</P>
<P>
   Ryan can't help but look at the contracts Randy Johnson and
Kevin Brown have just been awarded and wonder what ``The Express''
at 30 would be worth on today's free agent market. ``It would be
pretty nice,'' he says, ``to be in your prime right now.'' Nice and
very, very lucrative....
</P>
<P>
   Best holiday party of the year? Probably the very small
gathering in Darrell Royal's hotel suite Wednesday night, when
Larry Gatlin put on a mini-jam session in Royal's honor....Next to
the Longhorns' season, Royal may be most proud of the golf round
this past year when he shot his age 41-33-74, despite being plagued
by arthritis in one hand.
</P>
<P>
   RIMSHOTS
</P>
<P>
   That ``Here Leezard, Leezard,'' headline in the LA papers back
when it was announced that USC would play _ yawn _ ``lowly'' TCU in
the Sun Bowl was kind of cute at the time, but overlooked the moral
to the story. The chihuahua in the taco commercial didn't realize
he was setting a trap for Godzilla. It goes back to being careful
what you ask for _ you might just get it. Think maybe the Trojans
get the real punchline now?...
</P>
<P>
   A New York newspaper reported that the George Foreman-Larry
Holmes' battle for Senior Citizen supremacy has been called off.
Holmes' managers say it's still on, which prompts the question: Has
anybody checked these guys for Alzheimer's? You think I'm kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Most ambiguous sign of the year was on the Cotton Bowl
scoreboard before Friday morning's game: ``The Cotton Bowl strongly
discourages smoking.'' So what, if someone lights up, ushers will
respond with a barrage of harsh language?
</P>
<P>
   Texas players entering the stadium through a thick haze produced
by a smoke machine run amok didn't look particularly mysterious or
intimidating, more like a group of school kids being subjected to a
mass de-licing.

COPING WITH RENEWED EMPHASIS ON TESTING: EXPERTS' ADVICE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the epidemics spreading from one school district to the
next in recent years has been the compulsion to test.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they were ready to graduate to sixth grade last
June, New York City fifth graders had taken eight standardized
tests over the previous 14 months; this year's fourth-grade reading
test, to be given statewide next week, will take three days to
administer. In Chicago, pupils took 12 standardized tests from the
winter of third grade through the spring of fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton's proposed national tests in fourth-grade
reading and eighth-grade math, while tabled by Congress for further
study, still loom.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to pick apart this trend for anxious parents and
children, two professors at Teachers College at Columbia University
_ Dr. Peter W. Cookson Jr. and Dr. Joshua Halberstam _ have written
``A Parent's Guide to Standardized Tests in School: How to Improve
Your Child's Chances for Success'' (Learning Express).
</P>
<P>
   The new book presents test-taking strategies and sample
questions for widely used tests like the Iowa Test of Basic Skills,
the Stanford Achievement Test and the Terra Nova (though not the
SAT).
</P>
<P>
   After school one recent afternoon, the authors spoke of the
testing craze and its impact.
</P>
<P>
   _ Why are students being subjected to so much testing?
</P>
<P>
   Cookson: It has a lot to do with the accountability movement.
The idea of holding schools accountable for kids' achievement has
almost become accepted wisdom in American education. There is a
sense that if we can measure kids' achievement we can have a pretty
good idea of whether they are learning or not. That's an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   I think the testing industry can be lucrative for some people,
so they push a lot of these tests. And, lastly, I would say it's
grown because it gives the public some measure _ rightly or
wrongly, and that's a good question _ of how to think about
schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Was there not this demand for accountability several decades
ago?
</P>
<P>
   Cookson: No, I don't think the schools were held accountable in
the same way. I am not sure schools were worse, either. We didn't
think about education that way. But with the changes in the economy
_ the idea that we're a knowledge economy _ the pressure to measure
this knowledge has increased.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam: Parents may have had a better sense a generation ago
of how their kids were doing. They were home more. You had at least
one parent in the house. There is a general sense out there that
parents don't have much control over their kids' lives. It's really
important to them to know that the education of their kids is up to
par.
</P>
<P>
   _ How important are these tests in terms of shaping children's
futures and academic careers?
</P>
<P>
   Cookson: If schools use these tests basically for diagnostic
purposes, they might actually be able to identify learning problems
that individual kids have, and that would be good, especially over
a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The other positive side would be that it does give a school a
sense of where they are at, with grade inflation and all the
subjective factors going into education. Testing does tell you
something about the nature of the academic climate at a particular
school.
</P>
<P>
   What may not be great about this is that you cannot funnel an
education through a number. We need to become much more
sophisticated about these results so they don't become sports
scores. Also, it's a pretty battering experience for a kid who
might be having difficulty with a subject _ or who might be
creative, or who might think differently _ to constantly get back
the message that you are not good enough. Most of these tests are
not going to make you think in ways that, as adults, you might
think of as important.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since these tests are not optional for most students, what can
parents do, what can kids do, to reduce the stress?
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam: You don't want the kid, and you don't want the
parent, to think this is trivial. It's not. On the other hand, it's
just a test. You don't want this child's whole self-image to be
pinned on it. More important, parents look at these scores and
decide whether their kids are smart or not. Some kids are not good
test-takers. But some just don't know the techniques. That can be
learned.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, figure out your child's learning style. This will
be different for different ages. Some kids are better learners by
listening, some kids are better by reading. Sometimes, they can
mouth the words if they are listeners.
</P>
<P>
   For kids who have never taken these tests, for young kids, they
have to learn that this test will be like nothing they have ever
taken before.
</P>
<P>
   Their teacher, who they love and is so kind and sweet, is going
to say, Pencils down! and mean it. They are not going to be able to
raise their hands and say, Just another minute, I need time to
finish. You have to explain to them what a standardized test is.
One of the things that's very important is to do some sample tests
with them in testing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What's most critical, though, is that you can't prepare for one
single test. The real story is to get parents to learn how to make
education part of their lives. It is clear that parental
involvement in a child's education makes a significant difference.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you are cooking with your child, do the math: we
have three more guests, we have to triple the amount of salt. Your
kid's driving with you, well, why don't you let him be the
navigator, draw a map of where you are going.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing we suggest here is to pull the plug on the TV.
The one piece of data that is clear is that watching too much
television is a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   _ What steps should parents of disabled children take in
advance?
</P>
<P>
   Cookson: The parents of kids who are handicapped have a lot of
rights here, and they ought to learn those rights. These kids have
rights to take these tests timed, untimed, and under special
circumstances. Secondly, the school and the parent probably have to
make a special effort, assuming it's not just physical, but that
there are emotional and mental issues as well, to create test
conditions that the kids can succeed in. Interpretations of these
tests have to be very sensitively and delicately handled.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you look at the layering of tests on top of one another _
particularly for third, fourth and fifth graders _ should we be
wary? Do we need to test so much?
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam: Psychologically, people like to be tested. Look at
magazines. Every women's magazine has, Here's a test to find out if
you are a good lover. We're a whole culture based on these quick
answers. And so we think this is right for kids. We don't see the
damage. We're probably hurting a lot of kids along the way.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, we do need some accountability, so we are in
this mess.

LAPD GEARS UP FOR Y2K COMPUTER CHAOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the clock strikes midnight Dec. 31, 1999, the
new millennium may start like this: Computers crash, credit cards
and ATMs won't work, the city goes dark and telephones fall silent.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the mayhem and confusion, criminals loot stores,
burglars prowl neighborhoods, thugs take over the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchy envelops the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Fear not: If the ultimate Y2K nightmare occurs, the LAPD plans
to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officials, taking no chances, have
asked the mayor and City Council to set aside $4.5 million to keep
as many as 300 more officers on patrol around the clock for a week
before and after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want to overreact, nor alarm the public,''
said Los Angeles police Cmdr. David Kalish. ``However, we simply
want to be prepared. Therefore, we have allocated overtime funds,
as a precaution, in case we need that during the week before or
after.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 meltdown, also known as Y2K, would be caused by a
programming flaw that would cause some computers, software programs
and microprocessors to interpret the abbreviated date '00 as 1900
rather than 2000. The result could be incorrect data processing and
equipment malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   If computer networks crash, Los Angeles could go dark, causing
traffic jams beyond anything the city has experienced, tying up
officers and causing unprecedented fear, Y2K experts said.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of power would trigger burglar alarms, Kalish said.
Meanwhile, real crooks could capitalize on the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the opportunity for criminal activity, so we have to
be prepared for that,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD leads the region in preparing for possible year 2000
anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're not expecting any major problems at all, but we
are making some contingency plans,'' said Sgt. Kevin Krafft of the
Burbank Police Department's high-technology unit.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Lief Nicolaisen, commander of the Glendale Police
Department' special-response team, said he expects technical
glitches but no public upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate that there's going to be massive civil
unrest,'' he said. ``We expect that some systems might fail. We're
prepared to continue to deliver police service, regardless of any
failures that might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, however, is prepping for the century transition and
has set aside a total of $300 million since 1997 to cover the cost,
said Brian Cohen, executive director of the Y2K project.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is that not only is the city of New York's
government prepared, but that all of the major organizations and
entities in New York are prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Los Angeles, however, New York has no money set aside to
pay for police overtime during the new year of 2000. Cohen said
police would make requests for any overtime needed at a later time.
</P>
<P>
   At Recon 1, a disaster preparedness store, co-owner Peter
Kalaydjian said that if his customers are any measure, 2000 will
come in with a bang. The store has sold more than $10,000 in food
and gear to some, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those computers are going to go nuts,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carl Howe, director of computing strategies at
Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research, the effects of the Y2K
bug will not hit all at once Jan. 1, 2000, but will be spread out
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is it's going to feel a little bit like a natural
disaster,'' he said. ``Nobody's going to die because of it. Your
phone may not work; you may lose electric power.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Worthington, a professor of politics and public policy at
the University of Southern California, said people are missing the
big picture when they look at the computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K problem is an example of how our society is overly
optimistic about technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The department is preparing for a long, wild New Year's weekend,
regardless of whether computers and the electric power grid
crashes.

LOS ANGELES: ``grid crashes.'' 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Year's Eve 2000 falls on a Friday night, so celebratory
complications like midnight gunfire and drunk driving may be
rowdier than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish cautioned that the department is preparing for _ not
predicting _ what New Year 2000 could bring. The overtime
allocation would be set aside in reserve _ available if needed, but
not mandated for use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting these problems,'' Kalish said. ``These are
just hypothetical issues that we're looking at in our preparation,
because nobody knows what the impact of Y2K will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the department is asking for $841,000 for computer
upgrades for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Police Department's year 2000 plan is part of citywide
policy by Mayor Richard Riordan to stem problems before they start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Los Angeles has taken a proactive approach to
Y2K,'' said Ellis Stanley, an assistant city administrative officer
who heads the emergency preparedness division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have developed a millennium management task force, in which
we are reaching all segments of our community, and we're confident
that when Jan. 1, 2000, rolls around the city will be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million effort covers year 2000 upgrades to all city
computer systems, training, workshops and contingency plans for
whatever community emergencies arise, said Frank Martinez, director
of the Year 2000 Project.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.5 million police overtime package would be added to that
budget if it is approved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation and utilities could be frozen by computer
glitches, so the harbor, airports and utility departments are
slated to get 70 percent of the city's Y2K budget.
</P>
<P>
   Power, water and telephone shutdowns could cripple the city if
they occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest Los Angeles has been without power has been 62
hours,'' during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, Stanley said.
``What happens if we're out of power for two weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of major water or power failure, Stanley said,
looting or hoarding could ensue. He thinks that's a slim
possibility, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the scenarios some people are painting is if we're out
for a period of time, people would be hoarding food or trying to
get supplies from other people or warehouses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good conscience we have to take a look at those scenarios,
but I think they are extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal governments are helping cities prepare for the
millennial unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Montane, chief of resource planning for the state Office
of Emergency Services, said the agency is reviewing everything from
aircraft safety to navigation and will conduct eight workshops next
summer to train local government staffs in Y2K emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there is a potential if we have weaknesses within
our systems, there are those who certainly will take advantage of
those opportunities, and those are things we have to plan for as
well,'' Montane said.
</P>
<P>
   For emergency management specialists, the changing millennium is
a dream come true _ an earth-shaking event they can plan for in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know when it's coming,'' said Marc Wolfson, a spokesman for
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, D.C. ``So we
can be alert and on standby to deal with any situations that might
occur in which the state and local governments might need
assistance.'' &QL;

Year in 1993 and received the Disney American Teacher Award for
mathematics that year. She teaches at Roslyn High School on Long

(lb) 
 By PATRICIA JAMES JORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For almost all her adult life, my mother, Juanita
James, was the neighborhood baby sitter. Every morning, working
women brought their infants to our apartment in the Melrose Housing
Projects in the South Bronx; children from outside the neighborhood
stayed overnight. On any given day, there might have been four
youngsters playing in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   My mother charged far less than the minimum wage, and she spent
a large part of her meager salary buying educational toys and
materials, doing laundry and sewing outfits for the children.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of June 13, 1985, at the age of 57, Juanita James
died of complications of diabetes. I had found her, seemingly
asleep, lying in bed. It was a sudden loss that remains painful to
me even now, and it touched the old neighborhood as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the young men and women who tearfully walked past my
Miss Nita's coffin had been toilet-trained by her. Some recalled
sitting at her kitchen table doing their homework, jumping
double-dutch with her or playing on the white sheet she transformed
into a hopscotch pattern.
</P>
<P>
   And though she died more than 13 years ago, she is still having
an influence on the youth of the South Bronx through the college
scholarship I established in her honor, which since 1989 has
awarded a total of $15,000 to high school seniors living in public
housing in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the fund came the day my mother was buried.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, people in neighborhoods like mine have needed
assistance paying for funerals or simply surviving after losing a
loved one. For as long as I could remember, members of the
close-knit community in our housing project had taken up a
collection when someone died, regardless of the survivors'
financial status.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's death did not impose any hardships on me or on my
sister, yet people still enclosed money in sympathy cards.
Residents of our building, No. 321, sent a group contribution of
$245; $460 came from colleagues at the New York City Board of
Education's Office of Facilities and Planning, where my mother held
a clerical job during the last years of her life.
</P>
<P>
   While writing thank-you notes, I imagined what Miss Dot must
have sacrificed to send us $5, and wondered what might be the most
meaningful thing to do with all the money _ almost $1,000 in bills
neatly folded into cards _ from all the Miss Dots my mother had
played bingo with or gossiped with on the bench in front of 321.
</P>
<P>
   My mother had not completed high school, but she had stressed
the importance of education. She could not help me do my homework,
but she always made sure I did it, and she proudly earned her
high-school equivalency diploma one year after I earned my
bachelor's from Vassar College. She was the best teacher I ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   Administering the Juanita James Memorial Scholarship Fund has
been a rewarding, sentimental, therapeutic and demanding second job
for which I had absolutely no training.
</P>
<P>
   THIS IS DEDICATED ...
</P>
<P>
   With $1,000 from the sympathy cards and my mother's $693 tax
refund, I opened an account in the commercial institution where I
did my personal banking. In no time, service charges began to
significantly decrease my sparse funds. Although I quickly
discovered savings banks where I would not have to pay monthly
fees, the scholarship fund would need far more than $1,693 before I
could even begin to think about seeking applicants. I didn't have a
clue about how to raise money, but I was motivated and determined.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the fall of 1986, I saw an advertisement for an
``oldies but goodies'' concert featuring the Chantels, the Penguins
and the Earls and had a brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a discounted block of tickets at the group sales office
of the Westbury Music Fair. Using the mailing list from the
post-funeral thank-you cards, I stuffed about 300 envelopes with my
own fliers promoting the first Juanita James Memorial Scholarship
Fund benefit. I sold each ticket for $20 _ $4.50 above cost _ and
spent less than $200 on refreshments for a preconcert cocktail
party at my apartment.
</P>
<P>
   I wrapped all the unused gifts and other newish items that had
accumulated in my mother's apartment in colorful holiday paper for
a grab bag. She had so enjoyed saving things and reminiscing about
the people who had given them to her. We sang oldies _ ``In the
Still of the Night'' and ``This Is Dedicated to the One I Love'' _
and it was as if my mother had given us the gifts. I raised only
$500, but I got to spend time with my mother's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, on my mother's 60th birthday, I tried it again.
This time I sold tickets for $35, $15 above cost, to a Johnny
Mathis concert. I raised only $265. But in between concerts, I
solicited funds through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Since I worked full time as a math teacher at Roslyn High School
on Long Island and was studying for my doctorate in clinical
psychology at Hofstra University, also on Long Island, I could
spend only evenings and weekends doing the enormous clerical work
involved: sending out appeals, picking up mail from a post office
box, recording responses, making bank deposits, acknowledging
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But $5 here and there from my mother's buddies, $500 from people
who never knew my mother and numerous other acts of generosity
began to make the fund a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Enclosed with a $500 contribution was a note from one of my
Vassar classmates: ``Because of my own struggles with a teen-age
son who has everything but is rapidly throwing it all away, I feel
strongly the urge to help out a teen-ager somewhere who is willing
to work hard to make a better life for himself and his community.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly I graduated from typewritten appeals to professional
color-coordinated brochures and envelopes. A Roslyn parent and
lawyer volunteered his help with the lengthy process of
incorporation so donations could be tax-deductible, and another
parent, an accountant, helped with filing regular reports with
federal and local tax agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A new friend, Jack Jordan, patiently and politely suggested that
I consider investing in mutual funds. I did some research, talked
with a consultant and invested, and the funds have flourished
beyond belief. (Today, we have $16,000.) I made another wise
decision: I married Jack.

<P>
   PRIDE IN THE PROJECTS
</P>
<P>
   With $4,228.29 in the bank in March 1989, I sent the first
letters recruiting applicants to every housing-project manager in
the Bronx and to Manhattan and Bronx high schools. There were 25 to
30 responses.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since then, the fund's board _ my sister, my husband,
a friend and myself _ has selected one student from a South Bronx
housing project to receive an award: $500 a year for at least four
years of college study. The amount may seem insignificant
considering college costs, but it has helped pay for travel
expenses, phone bills, books, clothing and even toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting finalists among the strong candidates is always
difficult. I have often sat alone at my kitchen table, struggling
with up to 50 applications. From the initial group of applicants,
the board invites five to eight finalists to a group interview with
its members and former and present scholarship recipients, who also
use the time to lend advice about college and careers.
</P>
<P>
   We consider grades and class rank. (Any student taking
advanced-placement calculus has my vote automatically.) Applicants
must also write a one- to three-page essay addressing their
backgrounds, strengths and weaknesses, and how the money will help.
(One young woman who recycled a lovely essay on world peace was
flatly rejected.)
</P>
<P>
   But we look at what each person has to work with as well: A
20-year-old senior made the finals because of her determination to
graduate from high school. Unfortunately, she didn't show up for
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   If only the media were as focused on South Bronx scholars as on
South Bronx crime. Pessimists' despair would disappear if they
could visit our dynamic group interviews. Year after year, prompt,
well-groomed, articulate finalists discuss life in the projects,
peer pressure, role models and aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of our scholars practically reared themselves. Some are
from families who receive public assistance; others have two
working parents. Some are the first in their families to complete
high school; others have siblings with college degrees. Juanita
James scholars do not fit any stereotype. Their one common
characteristic is residency in a housing project.

   Our first winner was Wilfredo Roman, a senior at A. Philip
Randolph High School in 1989. Wilfredo completed his bachelor's
degree in electrical engineering at the State University of New
York at Binghamton and then earned a graduate degree in physics
there. After teaching at Binghamton for several years, he came home
and got a job as an engineer with Computerized Elevator Control.
Wilfredo continues to be a volunteer and mentor for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gimore, our 1992 recipient and a graduate of Alfred E.
Smith High School, said he couldn't believe it when he saw our
flier posted at his school. ``I had to look twice,'' he said. ``A
scholarship for people who live in the projects? That one is for
me!'' Frank went to the State University of New York at Purchase
until family problems interrupted his plans; eventually he returned
to school at Monroe College to study business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we selected Pamela Ware, the first recipient from our
own Melrose Projects. But Pamela did not go to college that year.
In fact, she did not receive her first $500 check until the spring
semester of 1998, when she finally responded to my continual
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``After graduating from Kennedy High School in 1994, I intended
to attend Lincoln University,'' she wrote, ``but I was not
emotionally or financially prepared. I was forced to leave home and
secure my own housing in July 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally enrolled at Hunter College for the spring and summer
semesters of 1997, earning a 4.0 and 3.5 average, respectively, but
she had to take time off when her mother died. ``These periods of
ups and downs have given me strength to know that I am capable of
achieving whatever goals I set for myself,'' she wrote. ``I am
destined to overcome all obstacles that come my way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mentoring tradition of our scholarship fund, my sister
responded immediately when Pamela mentioned she needed a job. She
now works in the law firm where my sister is a legal secretary and
maintains a near-perfect average at Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Kanika Brooks, the 1998 recipient, graduated from A. Philip
Randolph High School and enrolled in the engineering department of
Columbia University this fall. She grew up in the J.P. Mitchell
Housing Projects, though she spent most of her time at her
grandmother's apartment at the Melrose projects while her mother, a
single parent, worked a 12-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the road has been hard, support from my mother has
been the guiding light in my life,'' she wrote in her application.
``My mother never finished college, but she always struggled to
make sure that I received what I needed. She gave me
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBERING MY MOTHER
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty, get upstairs!'' That admonition from the 11th-floor
window of the Melrose Housing Projects was as familiar to the
community as the sound of church bells on Sunday morning. One would
have thought that my mother sat by the window all day, because she
always seemed to be there to see me doing something that she
prohibited. And just what were those delinquent acts?
</P>
<P>
   My sister and I were not allowed to swing Hula-Hoops around our
hips _ too suggestive. One afternoon, after checking that my mother
wasn't watching, I hurriedly borrowed a hoop and started swinging.
Within an instant we heard the familiar screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 5 feet tall, my mother was a strong, intimidating and
demanding parent. She had to place her stamp of approval on all our
friends (no talking to anyone on her ``undesirable'' list), and she
had rigid geographical guidelines dictating where we could play
(within eyesight and earshot of her window). If I risked walking
around the corner with a friend, she was waiting at the window when
I returned. She actually persuaded me she would be able to look in
my eyes and tell if I had ``done anything with a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, my high school friends still laugh about the
time we were coming home from a party and a boy on my mother's
``undesirable'' list happened to be simultaneously entering our
building.
</P>
<P>
   Helplessly, I shook my head. ``When I count to three, my
mother's going to scream,'' I sighed. And there she was, right on
cue.
</P>
<P>
   Her list was sometimes accurate (that boy died of drug abuse
before he reached 30) and sometimes unfair. (She banned a nice boy
simply because he had processed hair.)
</P>
<P>
   My mother was always the one we turned to, although my father,
who died in 1997, lived with us until I was 15. He was a police
lieutenant, and I considered myself fortunate to have a father who
had a good job and paid the bills. I have fond memories of going to
church by his side. But I hated seeing my mother unhappy on nights
he didn't come home, or when he came home drunk. I hated seeing her
verbally abused, and I'll never forget the times I saw her cry.
Alcoholism would eventually destroy his life.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita James strove desperately to keep us out of trouble, and
her efforts worked. She was just as strict and overprotective with
her baby-sitting charges, but she wove her maternal magic: It was
not unusual to hear children crying when their parents arrived to
take them home.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, my relationship with my mother evolved into a
wonderful friendship. During my college years, she was still
weaving her maternal magic: It was not unusual to hear children
crying when their parents arrived to take them home.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, our relationship evolved into a wonderful
friendship.

OREGON FALTERS ON A NEW PATH TO HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 6th graf and to rewrite 13th and 14th grafs. No

 By PETER T. KILBORN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Nearly five years ago, Oregon began putting an
idea to work that seemed both harsh and humane: In return for
health insurance paid by the government, the poor would be required
to join health maintenance organizations and have their care
rationed.
</P>
<P>
   Most tonsillectomies, infertility treatment, hernia surgery and
removal of bunions would be denied. The program would support
preventive and hospice care and, starting this month,
doctor-assisted suicide, but rule out heroic intervention to
stretch a life for a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the state calculated, it could afford to provide
basic care for all the poor _ the goal of universal coverage that
eluded President Clinton four years ago. With rationing, Oregon
became the sole American outpost of an approach to care that is
routine in most developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oregon Health Plan is hitting roadblocks. The state has
abandoned its promise of universal care. Doctors routinely find
ways to get around the rationing. And conflicts with federal
Medicaid regulators have impeded efforts to deny more treatments.
</P>
<P>
   A requirement that employers insure all their workers or
contribute to a fund to cover them died early on. Spending for the
plan climbed to $2.1 billion in the 1997-to-1999 state budget
period from $1.7 billion in the 1995-to-1997 period. Higher
cigarette taxes have not offset the increase, requiring more money
from the state's general fund, and additional economic pressures
await this year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan offers all necessary care for people based solely upon
their income, and not, as in the basic Medicaid system, according
to their age or infirmities, as well as income.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``rationing care, not people,'' in the
sloganeering leading up to the plan's start in 1994, has been
ignored by physicians. ``The idea of this being a rationing system
is really bunk,'' said Jim Kronenberg, associate executive director
of the Oregon Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Enrolling participants in HMOs has failed to deliver expected
savings. Moreover, the practice of managed care, with doctors,
clinics and hospitals working together with HMOs to control patient
care, is breaking down in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the poor, access to care has become more difficult.
For many others, eligibility has become harder to establish and to
hold. A program that was once free now charges premiums of $7.50 to
$28 a month for a family of four, and purges from its rolls those
who do not pay.
</P>
<P>
   There are 340,000 Oregonians covered by the plan, and 350,000
still uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In his next budget, Gov. John Kitzhaber is proposing tougher
screening of applicants and stretching the time it takes to approve
applications from a day to at least a month. Members of the
Legislature, controlled by Republicans, are considering lowering
the income levels for eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back and revisit entry-level policy decisions,''
said Kitzhaber, the former emergency room physician who conceived
the program as president of the state Senate and rode it to
election as governor in 1994 after it took effect. He was easily
re-elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   The program is overseen by the Office of Oregon Health Plan
Policy. ``We're taking a pause to say: `Are the structures right?
Are our incentives right? Is it working?'' said Barney Speight,
administrator of that office.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is already clear: Health care for all cannot be
attained. ``Our goal is to have zero people in Oregon who are
uninsured,'' said Hersh Crawford, the state's director of medical
assistance programs. ``I don't think we're going to make that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber said, ``If you could get to 5 or 6 percent'' of the
population, ``you could declare victory.''
</P>
<P>
   That goal, too, looks remote. ``Structurally, the plan is the
right approach,'' said Donald Sacco, president and chief executive
of Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state's biggest health
insurer and HMO company.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it has never provided what's needed to take adequate care
of the population,'' Sacco said. ``To get to the next increment,
we're going to have to spend more money, and to do that is a
question mark.''
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the nation's health care, policy analysts
still call Oregon's program innovative and promising. From 15
percent, the state says the uninsured population has dropped in
five years to 11 percent. The national average has remained about
16 percent. Other states have looked at the program with interest,
but want to see more results before experimenting with a change as
radical as Oregon's.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the plan's difficulties, groups with special
interests in care support the ideas behind it and in most respects
the way it works. Physicians, while irked about pressures on their
incomes, see no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly better than where we came from,'' said Dr.
Michael Bonazzola, chief medical officer of Physician Partners
Inc., a practice management company owned by physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration set the stage for the program five
years ago in waiving regulations restricting Medicaid coverage to
specific groups, primarily women and children on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   With Oregon's assurance that it could cover more people without
asking the federal government to increase its 60 percent subsidy of
Medicaid coverage, the Health Care Financing Administration
permitted coverage of everyone with income below the federal
poverty line, currently about $16,400 for a family of four and
$8,000 for a single adult.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's rationing begins with a ``prioritized list,'' developed
over years of intense deliberations, of 745 pairs of health
conditions and treatments. Those that save and prolong healthy
lives and prevent disease are at the top and cosmetic surgery,
weight-loss programs, most infertility treatment and conditions
that cure themselves, like colds, are at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature then drew a line across the list, with free care
allowed for conditions above the line and denied for conditions
below. Initially, it drew the line low, at No. 606, and it has
since raised it to No. 574, still low enough to have stirred few
complaints from physicians or consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the line becomes fuzzy in the physician's office. The plan
requires that family doctors admit all patients for diagnoses, and
doctors say they do what they feel they must to treat a patient
during the office visit.
</P>
<P>
   And when a patient is referred to a specialist, doctors can
skirt the rules by changing a diagnosis and moving a patient's
condition from below the line to above it.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Romm, a registered nurse and health services director for
Care Oregon, a nonprofit HMO that specializes in Medicaid patients,
takes the example of fibromyalgia, a chronic condition marked by
diffused bodily aches and pains. The cause is unknown, there is no
cure and it is below the rationing line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of patients who have this condition,'' Ms. Romm
said. In addition to counseling patients to exercise, which can
help, doctors find ways to prescribe physical therapy, which can
also help. ``Physicians game the system,'' she said. ``They want to
get some help for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacco of Regence said, ``If someone comes into the office with a
below-the-line issue, it's going to get treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the unauthorized care, however comforting, is
ineffective or marginal and contributes to the rising costs,
Kitzhaber said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also wants to raise the rationing line 10 more
notches, to No. 564. Among services he would deny are some repairs
of ligament damage to knees, treatment for contact dermatitis _
rashes from poison ivy or spills of household chemicals _ that
cures itself, and treatment for genital warts, which as No. 574 on
the list would be the first to go.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the line, however, he faces intense federal scrutiny
because some procedures typically paid for by Medicaid would not be
covered. The Health Care Financing Administration, he complains,
``would rather have us keep the line and serve fewer people'' and
in that way preserve the practice of rationing people, not care.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, the state's medical assistance director, said
negotiations over changing a single item go on for months.
``There's a lot of suspicion of states like Oregon that want to
deviate from traditional Medicaid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent hours arguing with HCFA about diaper rash,'' he said,
before it was excluded from coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Mim DeParle, administrator of the HCFA, called the
plan ``a very interesting experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised that some other states haven't tried
it,'' Ms. DeParle said.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was no policy favoring conventional Medicaid
coverage over Oregon's approach. ``I think what the state would
like to do is to make these decisions and do it unilaterally,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency is bound by Congress to provide a defined set of
benefits to people who receive Medicaid. ``We have to make sure
that the procedures that are being covered are appropriate and that
they are not leaving out things that should be covered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also has a responsibility for public health, so
discussions over genital warts, a widespread, sexually transmitted
virus that can be treated but not cured, will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Such disputes aside, said W. David Helms, president of the Alpha
Center, a health care research organization in Washington, Oregon
has done something unique in tackling the taboo against rationing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we still face that issue, and we've ignored
it,'' Helms said. The Oregon program, he said, ``is how government
at its best ought to work.''

REAL ESTATE: CLEARING THE TRACKS FOR PENN STATION III 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After six years of pushing and pulling, negotiators
believe they have arrived at a workable division of the General
Post Office in Manhattan, allowing it to remain a hub of mail
service even as it is transformed into a new version of the lost
Pennsylvania Station.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service and Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corp.
are now talking about how to share the building rather than how to
partition it. The distinction is more than semantic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of searching for a sharp line demarcating post office
from train station, the designers have found ways in which
passenger movement and mail handling can overlap in the massive
neo-Classical structure, known formally as the James A. Farley
Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've mixed and marbleized the cake,'' said Robert A. Peck,
the federal commissioner of public buildings, after a meeting Dec.
21 at which agreement was reached on the general layout of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement in hand, the architects and engineers can now
begin a detailed redesign of the space within the 1.4
million-square-foot Farley Building. In broad outline, it will have
these features:
</P>
<P>
   The main entrances for Amtrak passengers will be on 31st and
33rd streets, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Driveways on both
streets will lead to a 300-foot ticketing hall _ as long as the
main waiting room of the original Pennsylvania Station.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers arriving on foot will be able to use entrances under
the niches on either side of the grand Eighth Avenue staircase. The
window-service postal lobby at the top of those stairs will remain.
(See you there April 15, 2003.)
</P>
<P>
   Passengers arriving on the Eighth Avenue subway will be able to
enter the Farley Building on an extension of the Long Island Rail
Road's West End Concourse. Those arriving on the Seventh Avenue
line would come through the existing Penn Station, which will
remain in use by New Jersey Transit and the LIRR.
</P>
<P>
   From the ticketing hall, passengers will proceed into a
160-by-205-foot atrium on the Eighth Avenue side of the building,
at the base of which will be a terraced series of three concourses
cascading down to the train platforms, some of which will be
visible through skylights. The platforms, which already extend
westward from the existing station, will be reached by stairway,
escalator or elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll actually be able to see the trains as you're waiting,''
said David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, part of the
team redesigning the space in the building.
</P>
<P>
   No one involved in the project presumes to say that this
concourse will make New Yorkers forget the glory of McKim, Mead &AMP;
White's original, which was torn down in the early 1960s. But they
are quick to note that it will share the quality of bringing
daylight and visibility down to track level.
</P>
<P>
   More than esthetics are served by this gesture. It will make it
easy for travelers _ particularly those arriving at the station for
the first time _ to orient themselves, unlike the current maze,
which is closer to a hamster run than a great train shed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from airports, Amtrak will build pre-boarding
lounges on the intermediate concourse level for intercity trains.
Commuters will use the lower concourse.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Station would also become an important destination
for air travelers early in the next century, on completion of rail
lines planned to link Newark International Airport to Amtrak and
New Jersey Transit trains and Kennedy International Airport to the
LIRR.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the Farley Building project will cost has yet to
be determined, since the detailed design work is only now
beginning. Earlier estimates put the price tag at $315 million.
Officials hope to open the new station in December 2002.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the ticketing hall, the Postal Service will move
many of its truck docks into a new space below grade on the Ninth
Avenue end of the building, reached by ramps paralleling 31st and
33rd streets. To free up the interior courtyard for use as a
concourse, the Postal Service will move the letter-carrier sorting
stations into workrooms on the Ninth Avenue side.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's key is a phasing plan that will allow postal operations
to continue,'' said Rudy Umscheid, vice president of facilities at
the Postal Service. ``We don't want to compromise mail service
during construction. And we don't want to compromise the potential
for mail service in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, he added, ``Everyone wants this project to be
successful.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For their part, state officials have temporarily set aside the
idea of building 200,000 square feet of retail space as part of the
station, which was proposed to help finance the project. ``The
short-term compromise will help us achieve a greater development in
the future,'' said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the
redevelopment agency and its corporate parent, Empire State
Development Corp. Among other things, that compromise helped pave
the way for the Dec. 21 accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we are definitely going to move forward,'' Gargano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six years have already passed since a plan was first announced
to improve Amtrak's passenger areas by building a new concourse in
the General Post Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me that there was a monumental building that
kind of looked like a station right above the platforms,'' recalled
Fred Bartoli, the manager of high-speed rail and facility programs
in Amtrak's Metropolitan Division.
</P>
<P>
   What made the idea so appealing was that it offered a kind of
redemption for the demolition of the original station. ``You don't
get a second chance like this often,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White, the Farley Building opened in
1914 as a companion piece to the station. A Ninth Avenue annex was
added in 1935. Above a portico of tree-sized Corinthian columns is
inscribed the famous ``Neither snow nor rain'' motto. The Farley
Building was one of the earliest designated landmarks, protected by
a law that had been prompted in part by the demolition of the
station across the street.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the inscription was a bit of a warning sign.
Postal officials are quite attached to the Farley Building; not
only because it has vast work floors and dozens of truck bays but
because it is a national cynosure, the grandest of the grand old
post offices. Some families have worked in the building for two or
three generations.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was moving some operations out of Farley to the
Morgan General Mail Facility annex at Ninth Avenue and 29th Street,
the Postal Service had subscribed nominally to the station
expansion plan from the outset. But the path from generalities to
specifics turned out to be tortuous.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials were offended by what they regarded as cavalier
incursions into their space by people who had no idea how a post
office operated. And they resented implications that the General
Post Office was inefficient or unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wasn't being utilized to its fullest efficiency,''
Umscheid said, ``but the fact is that there has been a growth in
mail volume and services over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, economic development officials and civic leaders were
growing impatient with what they saw as bureaucratic intransigence
impeding the conversion of an antiquated structure into an urban
dynamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postal Service bureaucrats go, well, they go postal when the
plan is mentioned,'' said a 1997 editorial in The Daily News, whose
offices are near the Farley Building.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1997, horns were locked. The Postal Service insisted it
could not give up more than one quarter of the Farley Building
(350,000 square feet) and the redevelopment agency insisted it
would need half.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Art Society went so far as to propose emptying
Farley of all postal operations except the service windows on
Eighth Avenue and turning it into a station, civic center, postal
museum and mall.
</P>
<P>
   The White House dispatched Peck, of the Federal Public Buildings
Service, to broker a compromise. ``Shuttle diplomacy wasn't
working,'' he said. ``It was more like long-range shelling.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corp. designated
an architectural and engineering team headed by Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill and Parsons Brinckerhoff, with Castro-Blanco Piscioneri &AMP;
Associates, Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and Ove Arup &AMP;
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   A joint management committee was also formed that month,
bringing postal officials and state officials to the same table.
``There is a different tone now,'' Peck said. ``They're fully
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides credit the architects with helping them find the
common ground necessary to apportion the building. ``S.O.M. has
been key in putting on their wisdom-of-Solomon hats,'' Umscheid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Jordan Taylor, a partner in the Skidmore firm, likened
the process to solving a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, made
easier to solve because ``a lot of people in the post office rolled
up their sleeves and were ready to take a fresh look.''
</P>
<P>
   One big piece of the puzzle was the truck docks on the ground
floor, which an earlier redevelopment plan had proposed to
eliminate in favor of a pedestrian arcade. ``Without the docks, the
building has no functional value,'' said David Eales, the manager
of realty assets for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   John D.T. Gerber, senior vice president of the redevelopment
corporation, said there was a ``great deal of competition'' for the
ground-floor space.
</P>
<P>
   The solution involves the construction of new loading docks
below grade, while keeping some supplemental docks on the ground
floor level for extra-long tractor-trailer trucks that could not
make a sharp turn on the ramps. Reducing the area of the
ground-floor docks will permit construction of a grand ticketing
hall.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, at least, the Postal Service will not be
ceding more than 350,000 square feet, although it acknowledges that
it may be possible to move other operations out of the Farley
Building over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plans describe a project of independent utility that we
can begin very shortly,'' said Alexandros E. Washburn, president of
the redevelopment corporation. ``That doesn't preclude us from
weighing options for the eventual reuse of the entire Farley
Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postal operations seem to me more and more a form of
transportation,'' he said. ``And what we are basically trying to do
is improve transportation for New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   An advocacy group called the Committee for Better Transit fears
that the Farley concourses may create as many problems as they
solve. Among their concerns is that moving Amtrak across Eighth
Avenue will make it harder to reach from the Sixth and Seventh
avenue subways, leading in turn to more taxi and auto trips,
thereby worsening traffic and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak also has concerns about the mid-block ticketing hall.
``It has to look like a main entrance,'' Bartoli said. At the same
time, it cannot compete too strongly with the renowned Eighth
Avenue facade.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad expects some back-and-forth over the arrangement of
ticket counters and the location of stairways, elevators and
escalators. But it is generally satisfied with the plans drawn up
by the redevelopment corporation, Bartoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter R. Ernst, the general manager of Amtrak's Metropolitan
Division, recalled that the project could be traced to a need,
recognized a decade ago, for better access to the platforms below
and more waiting room in the station above. ``When the Farley
project is completed,'' he said, ``you'll have greatly improved
vertical circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to deal with the problem of making Penn
Station better able to handle significant peaking levels of
passengers,'' Ernst said. Designed for a steady flow of intercity
trains through the day, the station was not equipped to handle
waves of commuter trains discharging or boarding more than 1,000
passengers at once.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects have been undertaken to improve conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The LIRR, which operates 542 of the 882 trains that run through
the station every weekday, completed a $190 million renovation in
1994. Designed by TAMS, it includes a new central corridor, a new
vaulted ceiling for the connecting corridor and more platform
access. A 90-foot-high entrance structure on 34th Street, by R.M.
Kliment &AMP; Frances Halsband Architects, restored some small sense of
the station as an important gateway. The LIRR also built the West
End Concourse to Tracks 13 through 21.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Transit, which operates 219 trains daily, has begun a
$105 million waiting room and East End Concourse, to open in 2001.
A steel canopy over the concourse, leading to Tracks 1 through 12,
is meant to evoke somewhat the look of the old station. The
architects are Sverdrup &AMP; Parcel.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, which operates 121 trains daily, has begun a $37.5
million renovation of the existing concourse, including three new
escalators and a waiting area for passengers boarding the
high-speed trains that are to begin running along the Northeast
Corridor later this year. The architects are Hellmuth, Obata &AMP;
Kassabaum.
</P>
<P>
   All but invisible to passengers is another critical improvement,
the $100 million upgrade to a switching and signaling system that
was essentially unchanged since the station opened in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   The work done by five control towers in Manhattan and Long
Island City, Queens, has been consolidated in a computerized
operating ``theater'' at the Claytor-Scannell Control Center at
Ninth Avenue and 31st Street, a joint venture between Amtrak and
the LIRR. It opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatchers work at consoles in front of a 70-foot-long
illuminated board that shows the position of every train coming
into or out of Pennsylvania Station, from Morrisville, Pa., to New
Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as this center is, it would not be enough in itself.
``Whatever is done to improve the signal system goes for nought,''
Ernst said, ``if you can't deliver people and get them off the
platforms quickly.''

CHOOSING A COLLEGE: WHICH WAY TO THE SALAD BAR? 
</HEADLINE>
  Linda Lee, an editor in the style department of The New York Times,
is writing a book on the choices facing high school seniors. 
 (For release on Sunday, Jan. 3.)  
(lb) 
 By LINDA LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When choosing a college, high school seniors and their parents
invariably say that cost and academics come first. Students also
want a school that is as far away from home as possible, or as
close as possible, and to go where siblings and friends have gone
before. But there are other, far subtler factors influencing a
student's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Balaban, 21, opted for Sarah Lawrence College because,
she said, she ``liked the way people dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornelia Nicholson, a private counselor in Massachusetts who
helps students pick colleges, says she's heard it all. ``How about
two snowboarding requests in one week?'' she said. ``Another
student wants to go where he can windsurf!'' Call it the Club Ed
approach to choosing a school.
</P>
<P>
   In the competitive college climate, school officials know that,
all else being equal, a crispy cafeteria salad bar or an on-campus
McDonald's, a T-1 Internet hookup or a glossy health-club gym can
tip the scales in their favor. These are the goodies that influence
teen-agers nowadays during their campus visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard admissions directors talk about managing the first
few hours a kid is on campus,'' said Patrick O'Brien, the president
of Making College Count, an advisory service in Green Bay, Wis. So
schools push their ``residential suites'' (preferable to
hotel-style dormitories) and the other essential accessories of a
good education, circa 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Here, according to admissions officials and college counselors,
is what sways students.
</P>
<P>
   A WARM AND COZY FEELING
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a college comes down to a feeling. ``Most college
freshmen are a little bit scared,'' O'Brien said. ``They'll do well
at a place where they feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges know this and turn their brochures and videos into big,
ethnically diverse group hugs, often atop a grassy knoll.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien strongly recommends that students visit a campus to
check things out firsthand. ``If they visit, they are more likely
to go there, and more likely to stay,'' he said. ``They have a much
better sense of what the school is about.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIGHT KIDS, BIG CITY
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, even a suburban school was thrown into the
category of being too close to a big city,'' said Nancy Monnich,
the director of admissions for Bryn Mawr College, near
Philadelphia. ``People would say, `What sane parent would send
their daughter to the evil city?' And now cities are so hot.''
</P>
<P>
   She placed Bryn Mawr firmly in the category of a city college.
``Not isolated like Sweet Briar,'' she said and laughed, perhaps in
sympathy. (Sweet Briar College is in rural Virginia.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Jennifer Ann Adams, a graduate student at
Pennsylvania State University who has done a study on campus
geography, more than half of all universities and colleges, both
two- and four-year, are now urban.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a college is not within shouting distance of a city, it
will stress its proximity to one. Admissions officers at their
respective schools promote the fact that Bard College, in rural
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., is only two hours from New York City by
train; that Clark University, in industrial Worcester, Mass., is
less than an hour from Boston; that Princeton University, in its
tranquil New Jersey setting, is only an hour and 15 minutes from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   What draws students to urban campuses, according to Julia Eells,
the dean of admissions and college counseling at Miss Porter's
School, the private girls' school in Farmington, Conn., are
cultural events, internship opportunities and the fast pace of
urban life.
</P>
<P>
   For students who instead choose a more rural campus, ``there is
still the suitcase-college mentality,'' said Nancy King, the
president of the National Academic Advising Association, an
organization of 5,000 college advisers based in Manhattan, Kan.
``They are there during the week and off to a party school or home
on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE DIVERSITY, PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   ``For my students, the diversity of the student body is probably
the biggest consideration, after academic reputation,'' said Ms.
Eells of Miss Porter's, where 11 percent of the students are from
other countries and 16 percent are minorities. ``My seniors are
surprised by the homogeneity they encounter on their college
visits, especially at the smaller, rural or suburban schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Students want schools that are sophisticated and open-minded.
Abraham Park, a 21-year-old senior at the State University of New
York at Albany, grew up in New York City. When he graduated from
Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, the high school was 52 percent
Asian-American. Park chose SUNY-Albany because it was an urban
school far enough away from home (``Not that I don't love my
parents,'' he said) and sufficiently cosmopolitan. ``The student
body here is becoming more diverse every year,'' Park said. ``It's
not too homogenous. I've totally been happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversity, however, has different meanings to different people.
David Strauss, an executive at Art and Science, a marketing and
research group in Baltimore, points out that while students have
``bought what they've been told about the value of diversity,''
they sometimes have their own version of it.
</P>
<P>
   He recently asked 500 high school seniors, in a national survey,
how they would rank in importance various kinds of diversity on
campus. The highest rankings went to a wide range of courses,
social activities and housing possibilities. The kinds of diversity
most parents think of _ racial, regional, international, income
level and religious affiliation _ were less important.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these varying definitions found common ground. When asked
about roommates, the high school seniors said they were ready to
live with a roommate from overseas, or with one from a different
part of the country. They were also ready to live with a person who
had a different racial, income or religious background. ``The only
place where there is a problem,'' Strauss said, ``is with rooming
with someone with a different sexual preference.''
</P>
<P>
   LIVING LARGE
</P>
<P>
   The dorm situation can make or break a school on a candidate's
checklist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long row of rooms with a telephone at the end of the hall,
the kind of dorm I had, aren't attractive anymore,'' Ms. Nicholson,
the college counselor, said. ``As colleges are constructing dorms,
they are well aware of the more comfortable circumstances kids have
grown up in. Now it's suites and common space. That old barracks
style is certainly on its way out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to attract and retain freshmen (the most likely to
drop out of college) some schools have devised special-interest
floors for athletes, honor students, international students and
even students with similar hobbies. And Internet access from rooms,
for chatting with family and friends, is an essential.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   GLITZY GYMS
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much more consumer-oriented generation of students
and parents,'' Ms. Nicholson said. ``They expect to see more
opulent campuses.'' That opulence extends to athletic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges with large endowments, for instance, have built sports
complexes that would rival Equinox fitness centers. The Rochester
Institute of Technology's Hale-Andrews Student Life Center, opened
in 1992, has weight-training rooms, three basketball courts,
racquetball courts and an indoor running track, as well as aerobic
dancing workshops with sign-language interpreters for the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Students can assess various sports programs and facilities
through the Web site of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (www.ncaa.org; click the icon for the choice of
sports).
</P>
<P>
   CAREER PLANNING
</P>
<P>
   Students always ask about job counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the national data, the No. 1 reason students
are going to college is to get a better job,'' O'Brien of Making
College Count said. ``Obviously, adults and educators hope for
education, but they're thinking jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colleges have begun offering programs that place
undergraduates in short-term jobs before they graduate. Beyond
that, colleges are improving their career-planning centers to
attract students. Ms. King, the academic adviser, who is also an
executive in enrollment services at Kennesaw State University near
Atlanta, agreed that schools see more demand these days for helping
graduates obtain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a consumer's market,'' she said. ``It's not enough to
just offer a degree program.''

SOFTWARE: TOONSVILLE TUTORS
</HEADLINE>
   Josh Barbanel specializes in computer-assisted reporting for The
New York Times. (For release on Sunday, Jan. 3.)

 By JOSH BARBANEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that I could walk past the study, see the children
huddled in front of the computer screen fighting over who would
hold the mouse and sigh with relief: At least they weren't watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, they might as well be. There is Arthur, from the
PBS program, looking guiltily at his mom, in a software version. Or
Steve, a grown man who wanders through a cartoon adventure with a
blue dog in ``Blue's Clues,'' on Nickelodeon. And there are many
other software programs like these.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the titles competing for shelf space in computer stores
seem to have sprung, fully grown, from the heads of the
merchandising staff members at television and film companies,
especially now that there is more competition in the software
market for very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Take some dazzling media characters, provide some animated
scenes, add some familiar, certifiably ``educational'' activities _
this seems to be the formula for success. The age of celebrity has
come to preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is a price. Originality is sacrificed, and
familiarity is glorified. The quality of animation on CD-ROM's has
improved so much that entertainment value is the main event. And so
I walk by the study, wondering whether playing on the computer will
soon offer no more rewards than television's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   TV'S ARTHUR, A BIT AT SEA
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur's Computer Adventure,'' one of the many merchandising
tie-ins for Arthur, the aardvark with big ears and big glasses, is
a completely circular product. It is a CD-ROM based on a book,
popularized by a television series, about Arthur's struggles to
play a computer game, ``Deep Dark Sea,'' on his mom's computer. A
version of that game (and not a very impressive one at that) is
included.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by Marc Brown, is called ``Arthur's Computer
Disaster.'' Perhaps the marketing department thought ``computer
disaster'' would turn off novice computer users. ``Arthur's
Computer Adventure'' is in the form of a ``living book,'' with text
at the top of the screen and words highlighted as they are read by
a narrator and the character. (Wouldn't it be cozier to have mom
read it at bedtime rather than a narrator at a computer?)
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the text, Arthur and his family act out the story.
Arthur, driven by his search for sunken treasure, disobeys his mom
and seems to have broken her computer. Children can click on
various animated objects _ a helicopter that can be flown about the
page, ghosts that fly out of cabinets. Also among the five
activities are the somewhat basic ``Deep Dark Sea,'' in which
children maneuver a diver past sharks and sea creatures to find
treasure. In ``Frankenfish,'' young adventurers can click on fish
and learn a simple fact about each one, then mix and match parts of
the fish to make their own strange creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There is a word-recognition game and a counting game, both
simple, but parents will not find enough weighty educational
treasures to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur's Computer Adventure,'' $29.95, The Learning Company;
www.learningco.com. Windows 3.10, Windows 95 or Macintosh. Ages
3-7.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE ON HOW TO HAVE A PARTY
</P>
<P>
   The television program ``Blue's Clues'' might have been modeled
after an interactive CD-ROM. Steve, the human host, lives in an
animated-storybook environment. In each episode, Steve invites
young viewers to help him solve the day's puzzles, presented in
nonverbal clues through Blue, his puppy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rough plot of all interactive CD-ROM's; ``Blue's
Birthday Adventure'' is no exception. In four separate episodes on
two CD-ROM's, Steve needs help planning Blue's birthday party. Blue
has left three blue paw prints around the house and yard. Children
click through the rooms, searching for the paw prints. Once found,
they can be put in notebooks, a handy place to ponder the paw
prints' meanings.
</P>
<P>
   What does Blue want to give her guests? What does Blue want to
eat at her party? What does Blue want to do at her party? What game
does Blue want to play? These are the questions that will try
children's minds.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, children make a birthday card, bake a cake and
pursue other inventive activities that integrate nicely into the
clue hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Videos of Steve against a cartoonlike background appear
throughout, just as they do on television. But there is one
significant difference. On television, each episode ends with a
solution. At home, children are in charge. Sometimes, it seems easy
to get lost: Children who miss a clue sit in silence as they try to
figure out where to go next. Steve, too, stands silent, rocking
slightly from side to side, and Blue wags her tail. Some children
may give up.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, neither Steve nor the game's creators offer enough
clues or energy to sufficiently interest young users in following
through and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Birthday Adventure,'' $29.99, Humongous Entertainment;
www.humongous.com. Windows 95 or 98 or Macintosh Power PC. Ages
3-6.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DR. SEUSS'S BUSY WORLD
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the Cat in the Hat administering an IQ
test. But ``Dr. Seuss Kindergarten'' provides such an unusual blend
of whimsy and earnest skill-learning for studious 5-year-olds that
you can almost picture the cat pulling a Stanford Binet test out of
its hat.
</P>
<P>
   Like Arthur and Blue, the Dr. Seuss franchise is hot. ``Dr.
Seuss Kindergarten'' provides the familiar and fanciful characters,
bright music and songs and colorful Seussian scenery. A zoo is
being built in Seussville, and children must travel to far-off
locales on a colorful train in search of exotic animals to populate
it. At each stop, children are asked in rhyme to complete
skill-building exercises: There is matching, letter recognition,
addition and subtraction (Barbaloot math), phonics, measurement,
estimation, sorting _ all the essential skills children must master
to be promoted to first grade.
</P>
<P>
   The Seuss characters add charm and fun, but the drill-sergeant
nature of the material shows through. In one exercise designed to
teach basic addition, the Barbaloots and the Lorax are picking
Truffula fruits. Children are asked to drag the correct amount of
fruit into two wheelbarrows. The fruit is then combined in a third
wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   But pity the poor child who doesn't know his numbers. ``Put the
Truffula fruit in the barrow,'' the narrator says repeatedly as
each mistake is made. ``Put the Truffula fruit in the barrow. Put
the Truffula fruit in the barrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Each exercise has three levels of difficulty, and parents can
monitor their offsprings' progress. Children may find this mix of
fancy and challenge appealing for a while. But I wonder if this is
software they will return to again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Seuss Kindergarten,'' $19.95, The Learning Company;
www.learningco.com. Windows 3.1, Windows 95 or Macintosh. Ages 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURE GIRL DRAMATISTS
</P>
<P>
   First came the dolls, then the books. Now comes the software.
The American Girls is a set of popular, if expensive, dolls that
portray girls from different periods of American history.
</P>
<P>
   But while the dolls just sit there, ``The American Girls
Premiere 2d Edition'' allows young devotees to do something with
them. It is essentially an animation program in which children add
recorded or synthesized voices, lighting, period scenery, props and
costumes. They can move characters _ ranging from Felicity, in
Colonial America, to Molly, from the World War II era _ around a
stage. Then they can play back the whole thing, or print out the
script.
</P>
<P>
   It is very high-concept, marrying a technology to a historical
concept with some success. But the animation process is complex. As
in the cartoons, a child has to create the action and overlay the
sound, then match up both elements as closely as possible. Be
prepared for some frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Girls Premiere 2d Edition,'' $34.95, The Learning
Company; www.learningco.com. Windows 3.1 or 95 or Macintosh;
microphone recommended. Ages 8-12.

ENDPAPER: THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING BUSY

<TEXT>
<P>
   As with most elite schools, all Harvard applicants must submit
to an interview with a local alumnus, who describes Harvard to the
candidate and then the candidate to the admissions committee. The
chats take place in November and January. Jenny Lyn Bader, a
Harvard graduate whose ``Manhattan Casanova'' was featured in the
1998 National Playwrights Conference, has conducted such
interviews. They inspired this playlet.
</P>
<P>
   The Phone Call
</P>
<P>
   SCENE 1
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: May I speak to Billy?
</P>
<P>
   Billy's mom: Sure, he's right here. May I ask who's calling?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: This is his Harvard interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's mom (hyperventilating): Billy!
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Billy, I'm calling to set up your Harvard
interview. Are you free tomorrow at 4?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: No problem. I've got nothing going on tomorrow. I like to
keep my afternoons pretty free. (Suddenly) Oops! Did you say
Harvard? I'm sometimes busy in the afternoons. Very busy.
</P>
<P>
   SCENE 2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: May I speak to Susan?
</P>
<P>
   Susan's assistant: I'm afraid not. May I take a message? I'm her
assistant. Actually, I'm her mother. But I feel like her assistant.
Susan won't be home till midnight. She has band practice, a track
meet and play rehearsal. She's directing a Lorca play in Spanish,
and did I mention she started a soup kitchen, where she tutors kids
from the projects with learning disabilities? Gee, looking in her
calendar, she has her piano students. She has Spinoza Club in the
morning. I'm sorry, it looks like she won't be home until
Wednesday. Can I take a message?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: I'm trying to set up her Harvard interview.
</P>
<P>
   Susan's assistant: Oh! I can page her if you like. I know she'd
love to go there.
</P>
<P>
   The Scores
</P>
<P>
   (The Harvard Club, later that week)
</P>
<P>
   SCENE 1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: What are your SAT's?
</P>
<P>
   Billy (musing): Gosh. What were they again? They were good.
Sorry, I usually try to remember things of moral or social
significance. SAT's aren't that important in the grand scheme of
life, are they?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Well, no. But I need them for this form.
</P>
<P>
   Billy: But they've already been sent to the admissions office.
Why would you need them again?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: You're not going to believe this, Billy, but some
kids come in and lie about their scores, hoping we won't notice.
And some kids reel off all their scores from kindergarten onward,
which makes the interviewer worry about their mental state. And
some kids can't remember their scores, though I've never met one
before. It's actually refreshing!
</P>
<P>
   Billy: But it's not promising, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Well, sometimes the kids who forget are just flaky.
Or embarrassed their scores are low. But you seem to have forgotten
because you realize these scores are not among the really important
things in life. It's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Billy: I guess. But it's the kids who remember their scores who
get in, right?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Did I say that? I didn't say that.
</P>
<P>
   SCENE 2
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: What are your SAT scores?
</P>
<P>
   Susan: 1570 the first time I took them; 1600 the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Why did you take them again?
</P>
<P>
   Susan: Um, I thought it would be fun?
</P>
<P>
   The Tough Questions
</P>
<P>
   SCENE 1
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: What do you do after school, Billy? I'm always a
little startled to find a student at home when I call in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Billy: I see my friends. Hang out with my family. Go to the
movies. Read books.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Are you directing a Lorca play in Spanish?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: No.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: What about Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: Did he direct a Lorca play in Spanish?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: No, but he didn't go to college. Have you founded
any nonprofit organizations or multinational corporations?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: Does it ask that on your form, too?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Not really, but sometimes people forget to tell me
the most important things. How about titles? Do you have any
titles?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: Like Richard the Lionhearted?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: No, like editor in chief of the school newspaper.
Hmm, you said friends, movies, books, family. That sounds awfully
nice. Can you name them?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: Name what?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Favorite books, movies, friends, family? I could
throw it in my report. ``Billy's favorite book is `Crime and
Punishment,' '' or ``Billy's favorite relative has changed his life
in profound ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy: If I had to pick a favorite relative, it would be my
Great-Uncle Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Is he disabled in any way? You don't have any
community service, so I was thinking I could jazz up my report by
saying Billy frequently visits his ailing elderly favorite
relative, Great-Uncle Alfred, in a nursing hospice.
</P>
<P>
   Billy: Nah, Great-Uncle Alfred takes me race-car driving.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer (brightening): Race-car driving? In the professional
athletic sense?
</P>
<P>
   Billy: No. For fun. There's no place for fun on that form, is
there?
</P>
<P>
   SCENE 2
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Are you really directing a Lorca play in Spanish?
</P>
<P>
   Susan (reciting a passage from ``Blood Wedding''):
</P>
<P>
   La luna deja un cuchillo
</P>
<P>
   abandonado en el aire,
</P>
<P>
   que siendo acecho de plomo
</P>
<P>
   quiere ser dolor de sangre.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: And you teach piano?
</P>
<P>
   Susan: Do you play? We could do a four-handed Tchaikovsky piece
I have with me.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: I'm a little out of practice. That piece looks
awfully difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Susan (puzzled): Didn't you go to Harvard?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Yes, but things were different then. Do you ever
sleep?
</P>
<P>
   Susan: Why, does anyone sleep at college?
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Sure. Maybe you'll get some rest then. How's your
family life?
</P>
<P>
   Susan: I love my family! I see them on my vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: Do you have any questions for me?
</P>
<P>
   Susan: Yeah. How's my mom? You spoke to her more recently than I
did.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer: She seemed in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Susan: I'm glad. Send her my love.

 &HT;    What would you do with an electronic tongue?
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some big companies want the technology to test
new food and drink products. The American military has something
more distasteful in mind: monitoring the disposal of chemical and
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with all of them to pick the first practical and
profitable use of an electronic tongue invented at the University
of Texas are four UT graduate business students who won't get their
master's degrees until May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it really fits this community,'' said student Jason
Levin, director of business development for Vusion Inc., a new
Austin company.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, with classmates Richard Burgess, Kent Bradshaw and Paul
Kunko, created Vusion for a class competition, picked the UT
electronic tongue as its first product and won the contest. They're
now trying to raise the real capital they need to win a university
license to market the tongue to the pharmaceutical industry as a
control monitor for processing medicinal chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could give them instant feedback if there are problems with
quality,'' Levin said. ``We're not aware of any other technology in
the marketplace that can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many consider the tongue's potential to be vast.
Invented by UT chemists and engineers to mimic the speed and
sophistication of human taste buds, the electronic tongue is
smaller than Lincoln on the head of a penny. It now consists of
hundreds of chemical microsensors on a silicon wafer, but future
tongues may be printed by the thousands on disposable plastic tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to license the technology to (Vusion) if possible,''
said Renee Mallett, assistant director of UT's Office of Technology
Licensing. ``But we can't give them special treatment because
they're students. They have to come up with the necessary
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett said at least 30 companies worldwide _ including some
big names in commerce _ have inquired about licensing the tongue.
He declined to say how much money the students need for a license.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said Vusion plans to raise $150,000 for company operations
through May, $2 million in June when it will hire a chief
executive, scientists and engineers, and $3 million in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett said the tongue has so many potential uses that it
probably will be licensed to several companies, regardless of
whether Vusion wins a development license. The university and
inventors of the tongue would receive royalties from those
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue got its start in 1996 when co-inventors Dean Neikirk,
an electrical and computer engineer, and chemists John McDevitt,
Eric Anslyn and Jason Shear began kicking the idea around after
reading of efforts in Britain and Sweden to make biosensors to
mimic the sophistication of an animal's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs, for example, have such an acute sense of smell that they
can sniff out particular molecules in vapor concentrations as low
as a few thousand parts per billion parts of air.
</P>
<P>
   The UT researchers built a test nose but decided what they
really wanted was to do something different, and a tongue fit the
bill. They made one by micromachining tiny inverted pyramids in a
silicon wafer to contain polymer microbeads, each one smaller than
the width of a hair and equipped with a sensor for a particular
class of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The sensors, which respond to chemicals by changing color, are
attached to a camera-on-a-chip to analyze color changes at 30
frames a second and report them to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who would share in any royalties from the
invention, are now up to hundreds of bead sensors on a single
wafer, with the potential to rapidly analyze millions of chemical
combinations at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a variety of potential commercial uses, the
tongue is being considered as a tool for enhancing the speed and
accuracy of medical tests. The National Institutes of Health, for
instance, recently gave the UT researchers $600,000 to develop the
tongue to try to replace multiple, lengthy tests of blood and urine
with one rapid test.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said Vusion is considering a long-range effort to get the
tongue federally certified for medical uses, but they figure the
pharmaceutical industry is a safer bet for a quick return.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue's inventors agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a particularly clever utilization,'' McDevitt said,
``because new processing plants are constantly being developed to
commercialize new drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Neikirk added another reason why the inventors would like to see
the business students win a UT development license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some big companies buy things and sit on them to avoid the
competition,'' Neikirk said. ``And, with these guys, we'd probably
have more input in seeing it come to fruition.''

 &HT;    Kathleen Turner's movie memories
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner reminisces about some of her major movies:
</P>
<P>
   BODY HEAT, 1981's steamy film noir shot in Lake Worth, Fla., a
town she never really got to see: ``Well, you have to realize we
shot almost entirely at night. I remember vividly going home in the
vans at like 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock in the morning. I think we were
staying in Pompano. Basically, I never saw the town.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the weather stifling, sticky hot, as required by the
script. ``We started shooting in December. It was damn cold. That
first scene on the beach, where I'm wearing the white dress and
they meet. The wind was so high and it was so cold, they drove the
trucks up on the beach and put plywood by the wheel bases to try
and block it, so we could actually get the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the characters needed to perspire. ``It was freezing and I
remember the make-up man kept coming up to me with his spray
bottle. And I looked at him and said, `Don't even think about it.
You want to live tomorrow?'''
</P>
<P>
   PRIZZI'S HONOR, as hit-woman Irene Walker (1985): ``That was
tough. John (Huston) said to me, `Everyone else is a member of this
club (the Mafia), and you're not.' And so you're the anchor, you're
the contrast to everyone else. Jack (Nicholson) was terrific.
Angelica (Huston) I didn't have any scenes with, but I used to go
and watch her work, because I think she was really doing some
on-the-edge stuff, which she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always a student. There's nobody you can't learn from.''
</P>
<P>
   WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, Unbilled as vamp Jessica Rabbit (1988)
_ ``The reason I didn't take credit for it was because of my
stature. They would have had to have given me equal billing with
Bob (Hoskins) and with Charlie (Fleischer), who did the voice of
Roger Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anywhere near the amount of work or commitment
to the project that they did. I thought I was being graceful by not
taking credit,'' but it was perceived as an attention-getting
stunt. ``I suppose it's because people tend to look for the worst
interpretation they can, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   SWITCHING CHANNELS, as cable news reporter Christy Colleran
(1988) _ ``The only film truly that I'm not proud of and that
wasn't my fault. I rehearsed that with Michael Caine and then they
threw in Burt Reynolds. Yuck!''
</P>
<P>
   THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, as estranged wife Sarah Leary (1988) _
``When Larry (Kasdan) sent me the script, he sort of said to me,
`Look at both women,' '' asking her to choose between Sarah and
dog-groomer/girlfriend Muriel Pritchett, the role that won Geena
Davis an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got about halfway through and said, `Oh, I want the wife,'
because to me she was so interesting. She left him, she tried to
put together another life, she failed to do so, and then she came
back and then she had to accept the relationship on his terms.
Fascinating. I thought it was much more challenging, for me.''
</P>
<P>
   V.I. WARSHAWSKI, as the title detective (1991) _ ``That was a
big disappointment. This is where some of my ill feelings toward
Disney come from. They cut that film to shreds. They have a policy:
`Offend no one, upset no one.' And there was some hard-edged stuff,
they took it all out. They tried to make it a straight-line action
film or something. I was terribly sorry, but I can't do the
character again as long as she's under their control.''

TECHNOLOGY: NOTES FROM CYBERCLASS
</HEADLINE>
   Bruce Weber is national cultural correspondent for The New York
Times. 
 (For release on Sunday, Jan. 3.)  
(dal) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adult education, the concept, has never much appealed to me.
Volunteer for more school? No thanks. I was quite pleased, more
than 20 years ago, when it was done with the first time. Every now
and then I still have that dream about being unprepared for a final
exam. (For some reason, the exam is always in French.) There's
something about entering a classroom that feels like a withdrawal
from the actual business of the world, participation in which I'd
earned by virtue of enduring two degrees' worth of pedagogy. I'm
not one of those people who get nostalgic about college: I like to
get paid for my work, not graded on it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, augmenting one's education isn't anything you can
really be against, and I decided to go back to class, via the
Internet, spurred by an interest in exploring cyberspace and an
instinct that self-improvement wouldn't feel so burdensome if it
were a little more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by many measures, going to school online is convenient.
You can go undressed. You can go in the middle of the night. You
can go in Kansas City. You can participate in discussions to
whatever extent you choose, sounding off overbearingly or keeping
smugly silent, without having to observe the ordinary etiquette of
classroom decorum. You can, in other words, construct your own
private experience.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this ends up having its burdensome side. For
convenience, you pay with responsibility and accountability. Online
school is a venue for self-starters, which may be one reason that,
though 10 people enrolled in the class I took, only half were ever
heard from after the first few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem any prospective student faces is simply
deciding what school to attend. The global reach of Internet
technology obviates geography and transportation as considerations
in making such a choice. From my home in Chicago I could get to
class at the University of California as easily as at the New
School for Social Research in New York, or to any of the hundreds
of places that now offer Internet classes. Any thorough perusal of
online catalogues is so time-consuming as to be daunting. I gave up
rather quickly, choosing the New School (www.dialnsa.edu) after
checking out only one or two others because it offered the class I
wanted _ a playwriting workshop _ and because it was familiar.
Until a year or so ago, I lived in New York, not far from the
campus. Call me homesick.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine other people who enrolled in the same class, all but
one were New Yorkers. The exception was Angela Davis, a federal
prosecutor in Los Angeles. Ms. Davis, whose contributions to the
class documents were as voluminous and thorough as legal briefs,
told me that she chose the New School because she was impressed by
the resume of the instructor, Robert Montgomery (particularly that
he had attended Yale Drama School and had had a play of his own
produced at the Joseph Papp Public Theater), and because she wanted
a drama class taught in New York, which is, after all, the center
of drama. ``I was delighted that I had the opportunity to take this
`New York' class from my home in Los Angeles,'' she wrote to me in
an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is one of access. In one way, real school is
a passive experience. You show up in class, the curriculum gets
flung at you and maybe, if you're not asleep, it sticks.
Cyberschool is a bit more active; you find your classroom and
negotiate around it. There's a facility to be learned _ the deft
burrowing of a computer mouse, not necessarily a natural thing for
a middle-aged man who is habitually behind the techno-curve. It
took me about an hour to get comfortable with the mechanics of
going to school. (OK, not as onerous as settling into a dorm room.)
</P>
<P>
   How it works at the New School is this: after online
registration _ and payment via credit card (the nine-week class
costs $450 for a non-credit student) _ I was sent a set of
passwords that granted me access to the online campus, which is
essentially a set of Web sites. A handful of them are accessible to
all students, no matter what classes they are taking. One is an
orientation site, where tips for efficient campus travel are
dispensed. One is a student lounge, where students can mingle,
posting messages either for general consumption or for individual
correspondents. (The tone of the conversation was distinctly eager
and friendly _ ``Hi everybody! This is my first online class and
I'm really psyched!'' _ much like what I remember freshman
orientation to have been so many eons ago. Some things transfer to
cyberlife undisturbed.) For some reason, there is also a room set
aside specifically to discuss movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is a separate site for each class for which a
student has registered, and inside that site is another set of
sites set up by the professor. In the playwriting class, Montgomery
had his own ``podium,'' as it were, from which he gave
``lectures,'' providing, about once a week, disquisitions on
elements of playwriting _ things like story, character, dialogue _
mostly tips for us students to keep in mind as we composed our own
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us had our own site as well, in which we were to post
our work for the consumption of our classmates and in which
Montgomery and our classmates could post commentary. Since we all
had access to all sites, we were able to keep tabs on our mutual
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Once I got the hang of it, I found it remarkably efficient and
ingenious. There were some obvious drawbacks. Any classroom
certainly is meant to take advantage of social intercourse and the
dynamic that develops when people are in actual contact with one
another. Online this is lost, by definition, but in a playwriting
seminar what is also lost is the opportunity for the writers to
hear their work read out loud, which it is, of course, meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence thing, that's what's missing,'' Montgomery, who
also teaches playwriting in ``real space'' at the New School, told
me in a phone interview after the course was over, when I announced
my intention to write about the class. ``As a playwright you have
to know how to include it, the presence of an actor, in your
work.''

 &HT;    Turner may have quirky taste, but she chooses roles carefully
 &HT;    (With KATHLEENTURNER-MOVIES.)
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ Hollywood is a town that rarely knows what
to do with actresses over 40. Kathleen Turner is an outspoken,
44-year-old actress who rarely plays by Hollywood's rules. When
they collide, the smart money is on Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've decided is that I find most of the real studio
monolithic productions boring as hell,'' she says with her
trademark husky purr. ``As far as I'm concerned, they're all
men-with-guns. They could save a lot of money on promotion and
advertising if they just changed the numbers on the posters _ Men
With Guns 2, Men With Guns 3, Men With Guns September. They don't
need me for anything like that, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   So as she has for the past 17 years, ever since she sauntered
and sweated on-screen, steaming up moviegoers' glasses in the South
Florida film noir ``Body Heat,'' Turner has hit the pause button on
her film career in favor of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   For every ``Romancing the Stone'' or ``Peggy Sue Got Married,''
she has gone off and done a ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' or a
``Camille'' in regional theater. After every ``Accidental Tourist''
or ``Serial Mom,'' Turner has turned down movie projects to star on
Broadway in a ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' or an ``Indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say no,'' she instructs. ``You're known as much
for what you won't do as for what you do. I truly believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   She has said a resounding ``yes'' to ``Tallulah,'' a one-woman
show about irascible, irreverent stage and screen star Tallulah
Bankhead, beginning previews Tuesday at the Coconut Grove
Playhouse, prior to its American premiere on Friday, Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Although born in different halves of this century, Bankhead and
Turner are two theatrical souls connected by a common baritone.
``Yes, I'm often mistaken on the phone for a man,'' concedes
Turner. ``I always wonder whether or not to correct them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting across from her in the lobby of a waterfront condo near
Coconut Grove, it is impossible to make such an error. Her soft
blonde hair cascades around a flawless complexion. Dressed casually
but well, in a black pantsuit and turtleneck top, it is clear that
Turner has shed her early '90s, V.I. Warshawski heft. If she is no
longer ``Body Heat's'' Mattie Walker, she is at least her older
sister, and equally capable of driving men to do foolish things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared to Bankhead, Turner is Little Mary Sunshine.
Bankhead was a legendary partier, known for multi-day alcohol and
drug binges, for doffing her clothes in public and for taking on
uncountable lovers. Although wed to actor John Emery, marriage did
not agree with her and she divorced him four years later at the age
of 38. In contrast, Turner has been married for the past 14 years
to New York real estate developer Jay Weiss, with whom she has a
precocious 10-year-old daughter, Rachel Ann.
</P>
<P>
   `Great affinity'
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Turner knows a good role when she sees it. After
reading the script of Tallulah, which playwright Sandra Ryan
Heyward is said to have written with Turner in mind, she hit the
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some research on Tallulah, read about five biographies
including her autobiography, which is flattering but not entirely
accurate,'' says Turner. ``And I was drawn all the more to her. We
are so totally different, and yet we are kindred spirits.'' When
the performance works, she adds, it is equal parts of Tallulah and
Kathleen. ``I don't think you can tell the difference,'' says
Turner. ``We seem to have a great affinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the difference between a good role and a good play,
however, Turner took Tallulah to England's Chichester Festival to
test its stageworthiness. ``And the deal was that I would do
Somerset Maugham's ``Our Betters'' on the main stage if they would
let us do a workshop production of Tallulah on their smaller
stage,'' she says. ``We worked on the script there, adding things
in, taking things out, moving things around, shaping it, getting it
to the point where we were ready for the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   To make that quantum leap, Turner brought in director Michael
Lessac, who had directed her in the 1993 arty autism film, ``House
of Cards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is fearless,'' he says of Turner. ``I have never seen such
courage in an actress, taking on a challenge like a one-woman show
on Tallulah. I think you're going to see a more intimate Kathleen,
a more vulnerable Kathleen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on her agenda
</P>
<P>
   Even before South Florida takes a look, though, Turner is
convinced the show is New York-bound. ``I think it belongs on
Broadway,'' she says, then wonders aloud, ``Does that sound
boastful?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked if Tallulah aims to show Hollywood a different
side of her to gain better film roles, Turner wrinkles her nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care, frankly. I mean, that's not the purpose,'' she
says. ``That isn't part of the agenda in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the '90s have seen her trip in a succession of little-seen
films like ``Undercover Blues'' and ``Naked in New York,'' while
taking supporting roles in such non-studio films as ``Moonlight''
and ``Valentino,'' ``The Real Blonde'' and ``A Simple Wish.'' The
latter at least is a conscious choice, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've done really is let it be known that I'm very
interested in developing scripts and working with new directors,
young directors. But, there's a condition,'' Turner says
emphatically. ``They have to compress all of my character's work
together in the shortest period possible, three or four weeks being
optimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she can retreat to her Greenwich Village home and to her
family. ``So I'll work for a month, I'll go home for a month, work
a month, go home a month. It's wonderful. I have my life and I have
my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel sorry for Turner because she hasn't been starring in
major movies lately. ``I love it,'' she insists. ``I don't know
whether it's being 44 or whether it's just that I've done that,
I've been there. I don't have the same ambition. I don't want to
carry the entire film anymore. I don't want to stop my life for
five months while I do this monolithic production. I like having a
life apart from all that.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't feel sorry for Turner's agents and managers, or worry
that their children will starve while she feeds her artistic soul
doing Tallulah. After all, four of these small independent pictures
are poised for release in 1999, three with first-time directors.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a dark comedy called ``The Virgin Suicides,''
directed by Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Turner's ``Peggy Sue Got
Married'' filmmaker, Francis Ford Coppola. ``I think it might be a
very moving piece,'' says Turner softly. ``Not easy, pretty tough
stuff. Five kids kill themselves, and I'm the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast is ``Baby Geniuses,'' in which she plays Dr.
Elena Kinder, a mad scientist who gathers a gaggle of pre-speech
infants, trying to crack the code of baby talk. ``I try and mold
their minds in order to take over the world,'' she laughs. ``It's
your basic take-over-the-world plot, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``a very sweet film,'' ``Prince of Central Park,''
where she is a demon cyclist who befriends a boy who has run away
from an abusive foster home and lives in Central Park. And most
recently, Turner completed a black comedy with Ed Asner, Jason
Alexander and Courtney Vance titled ``Love and Action'' in Chicago,
in which they work for a secret government unit known as the
Eliminator Corps. ``For example, when you have a diplomat who's
smuggling drugs and arms, but the government can't touch him, we
eliminate him.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can accuse Turner of not having quirky taste. As to these
films' fate at the box office, let's just say that ``Star Wars
Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' isn't worried. ``I don't think any
of them will be blockbusters,'' says Turner with a shrug. ``I liked
the scripts, liked the people, liked what they were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If she had to adjust her salary downward to fit these
independent film budgets, she did so without qualms. ``We're doing
fine,'' she says. ``How much money does anybody need?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it has been 10 years since Turner made the movie
exhibitors' list of top box office draws, but don't start feeling
sorry for her. She's doing exactly what she's always wanted to,
ever since her parents took her to the theater in London as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was way up on the third tier, and I leaned over and I
thought, `My god, people do this for a living,' '' she recalls with
another throaty laugh. ``It had just never occurred to me that I
could actually make my living acting out. Once I got that into my
head, that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Millennium travel possibilities
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if New Year's Eve usually means trying to keep your eyes
open until midnight so you can watch the countdown at Times Square
on TV, this year will be different.
</P>
<P>
   How many times do you get to experience the start of a new
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   But it's crucial to make plans ASAP. Space in hotels, on tours
and cruises is selling out fast.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some outlandish, lavish and a few
within-the-realm-of-possibility suggestions to ring in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: Most are expensive. Even modest hotels are charging
new millennium prices on the eve of the Big Day.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cruise around the world
</P>
<P>
   Yes, The World Cruise Company's Ocean Explorer I will set sail
from Athens, Greece, Nov. 19 and passengers will circumnavigate the
globe three times on the 361-day voyage. They will visit 55
countries on all seven continents. The price is $35,947 per person
based on double occupancy _ only $99.58 per day! Passengers will
have options of more than 470 shore excursions, including African
safaris. The fare includes round-trip air fare from New York to
Athens. For more information, contact The World Cruise Company at
(888) 558-0887.
</P>
<P>
   2. Have a Grand time
</P>
<P>
   There are rooms still available in Grand Canyon National Park at
Maswik Lodge (a half-mile from the park headquarters and restaurant
on the South Rim), and Yavapai Lodge (1 1/2 miles from the South
Rim). Rooms at Maswik are $112 and $72; and at Yavapai, $83 and
$98. For reservations, call (303) 297-2757.
</P>
<P>
   3. Enjoy ancient wonders
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying that entry-level BMW, visit 10 of the world's
most famous and ancient architectural wonders such as Petra in
Jordan and Luxor Temple in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Builders Millennium trip begins Dec. 14 in Hong Kong.
Stops include the glittering temples of Rangoon, Myanmar, along
with sites in Cambodia, India and Egypt. New Year's Eve will be
celebrated in Istanbul. The expedition costs $29,950 per person and
includes hotel accommodations, meals and group transportation.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, call TCS Expeditions, (800) 727-7477.
</P>
<P>
   4. Celebrate in South Africa
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can celebrate the start of the new year in either Cape
Town, Kruger National Park or Sun City. Starting at $6,795 per
person, African Travel's tour packages include a variety of
accommodations, all meals while on safari, game viewing with
professional guides, and sightseeing tours. Contact African Travel
Inc. at (800) 421-8907.
</P>
<P>
   5. Make a pilgrimage to Rome
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the soaring porch of St. Peter's Basilica is the
towering bronze Holy Door. Striking the door three times with a
ceremonial hammer next Christmas Eve, Pope John Paul II will usher
in a millennial Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Year will end on the Feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 6,
2001, when the pope celebrates Mass and ceremonially closes the
Holy Door at St. Peter's. But before that, grand events gathering
hundreds of thousands in celebration and prayer will occur.
</P>
<P>
   6. Marry on Turtle Island
</P>
<P>
   Turtle Island resort in the Fiji Islands is able to provide the
first Wedding Ceremony in the Millennium due to its observance of
daylight savings time and convenient location on the international
date line. For $200,000, a couple will receive accommodations for
10 days in the luxury resort along with a wedding ceremony,
reception and honeymoon. The resort will donate the $200,000 to
build a medical center on the island. Contact Turtle Island at
(877) 288-7853 or your travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   7. Party in the Big Apple

</P>
<P>
   9: Feeling lucky? Try Vegas
</P>
<P>
   Try Vegas. But watch out _ rooms in Las Vegas, normally a great
bargain, are expensive for the big night. Rooms at the new New
York-New York Hotel usually start at $49. But to stay there New
Year's Eve you have to buy a three-night package (starting Dec. 30)
for $2,000. The ``package'' includes only the room. Call (800)
693-6763.

   Don't even think about it
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

The park's two hotels that are open in the winter, Mammoth Hot
Springs Hotel and Old Faithful Snow Lodge, are booked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rooms at small inns in Key West are hard to find. The desk
clerks at the popular Westwind Inn and the Island City House, a
complex that includes the island's oldest hotel and several
historic conch houses, laugh when you ask about New Year's Eve.
(But a few inns such as La Mer, the Dewey House, and Flagler's

GROOMING TIPS CAN HELP PREPARE HOUSE FOR SELLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The real estate market is hot in Southern
California's suburban San Fernando Valley, with both prices and
sales hitting their highest levels in years. So now might be the
time to wring a little equity out of your house.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes more work than calling up a broker, planting a
``For Sale'' sign in the front yard and waiting for prospective
buyers to call.
</P>
<P>
   You may have to invest some time and effort into your place to
turn it into someone else's dream home.
</P>
<P>
   In the language of the real estate game, give your house some
``curb appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 tips on doing just that from the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors:
</P>
<P>
   1. Give the house a top to bottom cleaning. This signals to a
buyer that the home has been well cared for and is in generally
good shape. A dirty or messy house can highlight every flaw.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spread some paint around. Realtors say that nothing improves
the value of a home for a lower capital outlay than a fresh coat of
paint. And it is often easier to give a room a fresh coat of paint
than it is to scrub down the walls. Choose neutral colors, like
off-white. Hold those artistic vibes in check and avoid black,
violet and pink.
</P>
<P>
   3. Plan on sprucing up the grounds. Make sure the lawn and
shrubbery are neatly trimmed. Prune any trees whose branches are
touching the roof line, and make sure the clippings are either
bagged and placed in a trash can or stowed in an orderly fashion.
If you have a pool or spa, make sure the water is clean.
</P>
<P>
   4. Get rid of clutter and follow the general rule: Less is best.
Throw a garage sale, clear out closets and trash what you can't
sell. Less stuff in the house will make it look roomier.
</P>
<P>
   5. Let there be light. Pull back the drapes or open the shades.
Put brighter bulbs in the light fixtures, but don't go overboard
and blind prospective buyers with glare. Remember, dark rooms feel
gloomy. Bright, open rooms feel more inviting.
</P>
<P>
   6. Don't forget the Fido factor. If you have pets, send them
away for a while or take them away from the home when a prospective
buyer is coming by. Some people can be intimidated by pets or even
allergic to them.
</P>
<P>
   7. The same can be said for children. They can be noisy and
distract someone while they are looking at the home.
</P>
<P>
   8. Air it out. Try to get rid of odors that may be unfamiliar or
unpleasant such as tobacco, pets, cooking and old laundry. Put out
some fresh flowers or bowls of potpourri. You can also bake some
bread to give your house a homey fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   9. Fix what's broken, if possible. Include in this list
plumbing, electrical systems, switches, windows, TV antennas,
screens, doors and fences. If you can't fix it, get rid of it. A
window with no screen is better than a window with a ripped screen.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, buyers will make lower offers if the house is in
disrepair and still insist that everything be fixed before moving
in. This cuts down on the chance of buyers offering a lot less than
you are asking.
</P>
<P>
   10. Keep the noise down. Silence is as restful as it is golden.
Make sure the television is off; if you want some music, opt for
some soft instrumental numbers. If necessary, close windows to
block out street noise.
</P>
<P>
   You can also obtain a checklist of things to do from the
Realtors association by calling (818) 786-2110.

 UNDATED: your work.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the semblance of a writing seminar became quite
persuasive; the discourse involved healthy doses of both insightful
criticism and self-serving blather, just what aspiring writers
sound like when they gather in person. And because people are
forced to write out their reactions, the communication was
relatively lean. In writing, the speaking-to-hear-yourself-speak
impulse is curtailed. There's no blurting. People take care to say
what they mean, not just what has crossed their minds, so even when
someone had something silly to say, it was clearly expressed. (For
that alone, gratitude is in order.) Writing focuses thought; I've
rarely found that illustrated so acutely as I did during this
class.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a funny way, even without the familiar interaction in a
classroom, the human dynamic asserted itself. Personalities became
evident. People were supportive mostly, testy occasionally.
Alliances were formed. And a general allegiance to Montgomery was
forged, even though none of us ever laid eyes on him. (In four
years of teaching online, he told me over the phone, ``this is the
longest conversation with a student I've ever had.'')
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, 52, who has taught playwriting for 20 years, is the
author of several produced plays, including ``Subject to Fits,'' a
musical takeoff on Dostoyevsky's ``Idiot,'' which featured Ben
Kingsley when it was produced in London in 1972. He proved to be a
careful, diligent reader and critic, offering firm but gently
worded suggestions that were both conceptual and quite specific
(for instance, line cuts and phrasing changes). I have a terrible
time beginning things, but something Montgomery wrote early on _
that each scene is like a play in microcosm, with the characters
wrestling with conflict and moving to resolve it _ helped me decide
that my play should start with the two main characters already
angry at each other. Otherwise, I'd have had them dithering around,
trying to make each other mad, but only frustrating the audience as
they frustrated themselves.
</P>
<P>
   My classmates _ a diverse bunch and distinctly adult, with
several, like me, in their 40s _ included an
actress-turned-hospital administrator, two massage therapists, a
nurse and an executive with a finance company. They were all, at
least the ones who stuck around, serious about writing for the
stage. I had wanted to take playwriting because it is a skill I
admire, and because I write about the theater as a journalist. It
couldn't hurt to get a little closer to my subject. But it was
daunting to hear about the projects the others were working on,
most of which were more ambitious than my own, an ostensible comedy
about two old friends in a battle over a cheap Manhattan apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis had already made considerable progress on a historical
drama set in 16th-century England. Another was adapting Dickens's
``Christmas Carol'' with gay characters in a contemporary Manhattan
setting. A third was writing about a man who, unhappy in love, was
getting nighttime visitations and advice from the ghosts of
historical figures like Lord Byron, who spoke to him in rhymed
couplets. The hospital administrator was working on a play about
Anna Mae Aquash, an American Indian activist whose 1976 murder in
South Dakota has never been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some of the writers were more polished than others,
but overall the reading was absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   That was a blessing, as there was a lot of it. Those taking the
course for credit were required to produce 15 finished pages, and
even with half the class falling by the wayside, several people
proved to be prolific revisers. (I'm a prolific procrastinator
myself, and by the end, I'd only offered an opening scene of four
pages. The verdict was that they were promising. Yeah, yeah.)
</P>
<P>
   But more than the actual scripts, what also had to be read was
the ongoing discussion, and herein lies the main difference between
real school and online school. The latter may be more user-friendly
than the former, but inattention costs more. Though there are no
occasions to show up for, that doesn't mean there are no classes;
rather, what it means is that the course is one continuous,
semesterlong session. In real school, if you cut a class, it is
gone, over, unreclaimable. Online, however, you never miss
anything. Whatever commentary is offered by the teacher or by
classmates is recorded, and whenever you sign on and check in, it
is all there, a linear record of what has gone on in your absence.
Which means that if you don't check in for a week, a week's worth
of discussion is there to be perused. Once, when I didn't sign on
for 10 days, there were nearly 200 entries waiting for me when I
returned, well over 100 pages of reading before I could begin
crafting any of my own responses to my classmates' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing is that people think an online course is
going to be easier than a classroom course, but I've spent a lot
more time with this one than with the others I've taken at the New
School,'' said Joseph Carman, 42, one of the massage therapists,
who is finishing a degree at the New School, both online and in
class, that he left incomplete at Fordham University more than a
decade ago. ``It takes an awful lot of time, logging on, and then
deciding where to go first, and reading other people's work and
making a thoughtful response.''
</P>
<P>
   Carman, who said he signed into class about four times a week,
finished two long scenes during the semester and said he was going
to re-enroll so he could finish a draft of his play. His was the
one with the Byronic couplets. ``It would be interesting to get
everybody in a room without identifying ourselves,'' he said, ``to
see if we could pick out who's who.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about re-enrolling myself. I'd only managed to sign
on for class about once a week, and I'd only managed to produce
those four pages. My classmates reacted to me accordingly. In the
end, my Web site had less activity than any of the others. The
salient point, I realized, is that whatever I got out of the class,
I earned. Which may be the ultimate definition of adult education.

   MEAT _ WASHINGTON _ Nearly a year after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture handed over many of its food monitoring tasks to the
meat and poultry industry, there has been a sharp rise in reports
of meat products contaminated with a deadly strain of E. coli
bacteria. (Jaspin and Montgomery, Cox News Service 950). MOVED.

   AUS-Y2K-DOOM _ TEXAS HILL COUNTRY _ From their extravagantly
untidy goat farm hidden in the Texas cedars, Kerry and Prisca
Wooster are trying to jump start America's survival instincts. The
Woosters are self-anointed messengers of the millennium. From this
remote and unlikely nerve center, where rusted ghosts of cars and
scrap metal outnumber the 15 goats, they send high-tech warning
sirens to the Internet. The message: The Year 2000 computer bug
will push life so far off-line that only the well-prepared will
survive. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   w/AUS-Y2K-ELPASO _ The gravity of the year 2000 glitch became
clear the day the lights went out in El Paso. At 4:30 p.m. on
August 21, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental
Retardation lost power at a facility where 123 people with mental
disabilities live. No contingency plan was in place for a major
electric failure. The year 2000 computer problem had nothing to do
with the crisis in El Paso. But state officials say incidents just
like it _ or worse _ could occur in Texas if state agencies do not
conquer the Y2K bug. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   AUS-Y2K-PLANS _ Depending on which expert you listen to, the Y2K
problem could be as unnoticeable as a minute tick on a seismic
flatline or a cacophonous pre-Apocalyptic roar shattering our
otherwise Zen-like calm. Where the differing opinions on the
computer bug from Hell meet is that we should all, to some degree,
be prepared. While most caution going overboard on the food
hoarding and money withdrawal, others say you can never do too
much. (Kallenberg, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   AUS-Y2K-SUITS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Because computers play a part in
the delivery of nearly every product and service, the potential for
Y2K lawsuits stretches the imagination. Some say litigation costs
could approach $1 trillion, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has
asked Congress to set up an ad hoc Y2K court to handle all of the
cases. (Greenberger, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   RIVER-RESTORE _ HABERSHAM COUNTY, Ga. _ Severe erosion along the
Soque River was causing the loss of100 tons of soil a year on
Justin Savage's farm in Habersham County in North Georgia. The soil
was washing into the Soque, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River,
making the stream unfit for fish and destroying its natural beauty.
Now, an intensive project by EPA and environmental groups is
restoring the natural flow of the river and the native vegetation
to bring the stream back to life. Already, native brown trout have
returned to the stream. Seabrook. The project is being watched
closely by water experts around the Southeast as an example how a
degraded river can be restored. (Seabrook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   AUS-ELECTRONIC-TONGUE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Big companies want it to
test new food and drink products. The American military has
something more distasteful in mind: monitoring the disposal of
chemical and biological weapons. Competing with them to pick the
first practical and profitable use of an electronic tongue invented
at the University of Texas are four UT graduate business students
who won't get their degrees until May. (Stanley, Austin

MARKET MAY GET REALITY CHECK IN 1999
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- No more Internet frenzy. No more illogical
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market will tread water in the first half of 1999 and
improve methodically in the last half of the year once the U.S.
economy shakes off the effects of the Asian financial flu and
Russian ruble hangover. Investors will buy value and shun
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Or so say some of the nation's leading financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, analysts also predicted a quiet period on Wall
Street last year and declared 1998 a bear market after the
correction in July, only to announce the bull had returned after
the market roared to new heights in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the new year: Rational exuberance is out; reality is
in.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Kaufman, editor of the S&AMP;P Outlook, the investment
newsletter of Standard &AMP; Poor's in New York, predicts 1999 will
bring a dose of reality to investors who spent the last two months
of 1998 buying Net stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of jumping into stocks with astounding price-to-earnings
multiples, investors will begin to adopt a ``show me'' attitude, he
said. An Internet shakeout will be coming as investors sort out the
winners and dump the losers.
</P>
<P>
   And the stock market, in general, will cool off.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technical standpoint, it looks like the market is going
to top out fairly soon,'' Kaufman said. ``Sentiment is much too
positive, too bullish.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the market should peak in January or February and go
through a sideways consolidation phase where it doesn't make new
highs or lows but stays within established high and low parameters.
</P>
<P>
   If market breadth remains narrow, where gains come from a small
group of stocks and not the broad market, there could be a nasty
correction, Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   But mitigating the situation are two expected interest rate cuts
in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. economy regains strength in the last half of 1999,
and as Asia begins to shake off its malaise, the year should end on
a positive note, Kaufman predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Wellenreiter, a commodity trading adviser at Peregrine
Financial Group in suburban Westlake Village, Calif., warned the
end of 1999 might ``get wild'' as 2000 nears.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear so much about the Y2K problem,'' he said. ``Even if
you don't believe in any of (the doomsday theories), from a safety
aspect, most people will pull money out of the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Treasury Department recently began printing more
money in anticipation of a cash run at banks, which only keep 2
percent of deposits at hand, Wellenreiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could pull money out of mutual funds, stocks and bonds
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets ``will be tested severely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like it wasn't in 1998? First there was the Asian economic
crisis, which started in early 1997 but was still a strong drag on
the markets as 1998 dawned. Things didn't get much better in the
summer of 1998, when Russia defaulted on its bonds and sent the
world reeling.
</P>
<P>
   The bull backed down and the bear showed its fangs. Small-cap
stocks technically were in a bear market -- defined as a decline of
20 percent or more -- while large-caps came close. The Dow Jones
industrial average reached a low of 7,539.07 on Aug. 31, 400 points
below its performance at the start of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings slowed down. Some were affected by the Asian
crisis while others blamed the cooling U.S. economy. Hedge funds,
particularly the Nobel laureate-run Long Term Capital Management
L.P., took a big hit after making the wrong call in world bond
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the two biggest news stories of the year -- the
impeachment of President Clinton and the bombing of Iraq by the
United States and Great Britain -- barely registered a blip on Wall
Street's radar. Small potatoes, apparently, compared with Disney's
video sell-throughs in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors had a kind of what-me-worry? attitude,''
Wellenreiter said. ``As long as their 401(k)s are doing well, they
don't care what's going on in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,
through its Federal Open Market Committee, cut the federal funds
rate three times. This is the rate the banks charge one another for
overnight loans. The cuts make borrowing cheaper for businesses and
can boost profits.
</P>
<P>
   The move drove the bond market higher because it makes existing
issues more valuable. Meanwhile, bonds also benefited from a global
crisis. The shaky financial straits in many parts of the world
drove capital into a safer haven: U.S. treasuries. Indeed,
long-term bonds returned 19 percent this year, among the best in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rebounded. The Dow, which started the year at 7,908.25,
rose to a high of 9,374.27 on Nov. 23. It ended the year at
9,181.43, up 18.13 percent, including reinvested dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index recovered from a Dec. 31, 1997,
showing of 970.43 to a high of 1,241.81 on Dec. 29. It ended the
year at 1,229.23, up 26.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq also performed well. It rang in 1998 at 1,507.35, rose to
a high of 2,181.77 on Dec. 29 and ended higher at 2,192.71, up
40.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News Index, which tracks 50 of the largest publicly
traded companies headquartered in the San Fernando Valley area,
swung from 121.30 to 147.04 and closed at 142.22, up 17.91 percent
for the year.

49ERS VS. PACKERS CAPSULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL KRUGEL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Green Bay (11-5) at San Francisco (12-4) Time: 3:15 p.m. today,
KDFW/Channel 4
</P>
<P>
   Series record: Tied 25-25-1
</P>
<P>
   Last meeting: Packers beat 49ers, 36-22, on Nov. 1 in Green Bay,
Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Postseason records: Packers 22-9, 49ers 23-14 The story lines
Packers are 5-0 in opening playoff games under coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Packers quarterback Brett Favre has 4 TDs and 0 INTs in 3
playoff games vs. 49ers, and wide receiver Antonio Freeman has 11
catches for 300 yards and 3 TDs in past two games vs. 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay has won the past five between these teams, including
three consecutive playoff victories. The most recent win came in
Week 9 of this season, a 36-22 victory at Lambeau Field. Can the
49ers finally get their revenge?
</P>
<P>
   Scouting Green Bay's offense: Now that primary offensive weapons
Freeman and Dorsey Levens are back in the lineup, quarterback Brett
Favre has less of the offensive burden on his shoulders. However,
he continues to throw interceptions, including two last week vs.
the Bears. In Week 9, interceptions almost cost the Packers a
relatively easy victory against the 49ers. With his team ahead
16-0, Favre had three passes picked off. Levens carried 17 times
for 52 yards last week against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting San Francisco's defense: The defense is without
defensive tackle Bryant Young, out for the year with an injury.
They are so desperate for pass-rushing help that they signed former
All-Pro Charles Haley and plan to activate him for today's game.
The defensive backfield is weak, and without pressure from the
front seven, is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting San Francisco's offense: RB Garrison Hearst pulled his
hamstring vs. the Rams last week. If he isn't back to full
strength, San Francisco will have to rely on quarterback Steve
Young's ability to move the ball without a dependable running game.
The offensive line was surprisingly good early in the season, but
has gotten progressively worse in the past two months. Green Bay
sacked Young nine times in Week 9. Young, the most efficient passer
in NFL history, is a mind-boggling 0-8 in his career against the
Packers. Because he was under fire all day, Young threw for only
132 yards against the Packers in Week 9.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting Green Bay's defense: Is cornerback Craig Newsome
healthy? After suffering a serious knee injury late in the season,
he tried to stay in the lineup, but might as well have been wearing
a target. The secondary has been a problem for the Packers all
season, though, and Newsome's playoff experience could come in
handy. Vonnie Holliday is another player the Packers need healthy.
The rookie defensive end has been a force since training camp,
going hard after the quarterback and stopping the run effectively.
He's a star in the making. The bottom line The 49ers can't afford
to get too far behind early. With the way their defense is playing,
they stand little chance of containing Favre and mounting a big
comeback. Green Bay, despite being on the road, has had San
Francisco's number in recent years and holds a big psychological
edge. San Francisco's best hope is a high scoring shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Green Bay 28, San Francisco 24

GIULIANI WINS STANDING OVATION FROM CONSERVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Tenn., Texas)  (rl) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The mayor of New York, a tough-talking
Italian-American with a reputation as a liberal, swept into this
Southwestern outpost Saturday to take on some of the Republican
Party's staunchest conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was no contest. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quickly won them over,
first with his best raspy Godfather imitation, then by bragging
about reducing welfare and crime, then by asserting to this
audience of anti-Clintonites that impeachment isn't worth it. He
won a standing ovation, as well as invitations to be a guest on
numerous television shows and favorable comments from skeptics who
said they liked his take-charge executive style.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has big ambitions _ perhaps the Senate, perhaps higher
_ and he is out showing his wares to the nation and hoping to raise
money for whatever bid he makes.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke here at the annual New Year's gathering of
conservatives called The Weekend, formerly known as the Dark Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani described his push to drive down New York's welfare
rolls and cut the murder rate. He disparaged the ``romanticism'' of
homelessness and warned that while food stamps were vital for some
people, they created the chance for ``more fraud than welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   A mayor, he said, ``has to be capable of getting out of the
emotive spin'' of ideology and be practical. And Republicans have
to learn to frame issues in a positive way, rather than by what
they oppose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Grover Norquist, a columnist for the conservative
American Spectator, whispered to a friend: ``I could live in Rudy
Giuliani's America.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, questions from the audience were friendly.
One man asked why Republican governors and mayors seemed so strong
while the Republicans in Washington were ``a parade of wimps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous isolation that goes on in Washington,''
the mayor replied. ``You've got to stop watching Sunday morning
television talk shows. They create a reality that doesn't exist in
the rest of America.'' Governors and mayors, he said, do not have
the luxury of wallowing in abstract ideologic debates _ they have
real problems to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a legislative body, you tend to be in this abstract
world,'' he said. Did that mean, a reporter asked later, that he
was perhaps temperamentally unsuited for a legislative body, like
the Senate? ``Maybe I'd be good for a legislative body,'' he mused.
``Practical reality isn't a bad thing in a legislative body.''
</P>
<P>
   One man in the audience challenged Giuliani for favoring censure
for Clinton, and the mayor went to some lengths to explain his
opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   He said impeachment should be used very rarely, and only when
keeping the president, who was elected by the people, would
jeopardize the fate of the nation. ``To actually rip out a
popularly elected president, I think it would create a tremendously
dangerous precedent,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unpopularity of that position here, Giuliani was
given credit for asserting it. ``He's really given a lot of thought
to his positions, and he's not afraid to enunciate positions that
may be unpopular in an audience that may be hostile to those
positions,'' said Anthony Gilles, vice president of the University
of Tennessee at Knoxville and a conservative author who was in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pearlston, a lawyer from Torrance, Calif., said of the
mayor: ``He's a Republican who can attract broad support, just like
George Bush can, and that's the future of the Republican Party, not
single-issue candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Both said they would like to see Giuliani run for vice
president, perhaps with Bush, the governor of Texas, at the top of
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy would be great on a national ticket, but he needs
national exposure,'' said David Horowitz, a conservative advocate
based in Hollywood who organized the weekend's events. ``It's clear
that he's got core conservative principles and he's very
practical.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani won his biggest applause in an exchange with a
questioner who said he was disappointed that the mayor ``didn't
wear your dress today,'' a reference to a costume he had worn at a
reporters' banquet. The man was wearing an oversized Hawaiian shirt
splotched with big flowers. ``I could borrow your shirt,'' the
mayor shot back, to the roar of the crowd.

relatively easy victory against the 49ers. With his team ahead
16-0, Favre had three passes picked off. Levens carried 17 times
for 52 yards last week against the Bears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scouting San Francisco's defense: The defense is without
defensive tackle Bryant Young, out for the year with an injury.
They are so desperate for pass-rushing help that they signed former
All-Pro Charles Haley and plan to activate him for today's game.
The defensive backfield is weak, and without pressure from the
front seven, is vulnerable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scouting San Francisco's offense: RB Garrison Hearst pulled his
hamstring vs. the Rams last week. If he isn't back to full
strength, San Francisco will have to rely on quarterback Steve
Young's ability to move the ball without a dependable running game.
The offensive line was surprisingly good early in the season, but
has gotten progressively worse in the past two months. Green Bay
sacked Young nine times in Week 9. Young, the most efficient passer
in NFL history, is a mind-boggling 0-8 in his career against the
Packers. Because he was under fire all day, Young threw for only
132 yards against the Packers in Week 9. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scouting Green Bay's defense: Is cornerback Craig Newsome
healthy? After suffering a serious knee injury late in the season,
he tried to stay in the lineup, but might as well have been wearing
a target. The secondary has been a problem for the Packers all
season, though, and Newsome's playoff experience could come in
handy. Vonnie Holliday is another player the Packers need healthy.
The rookie defensive end has been a force since training camp,
going hard after the quarterback and stopping the run effectively.
He's a star in the making. &QL; 
The bottom line &QL; 
The 49ers can't afford to get too far behind early. With the way
their defense is playing, they stand little chance of containing
Favre and mounting a big comeback. Green Bay, despite being on the
road, has had San Francisco's number in recent years and holds a
big psychological edge. San Francisco's best hope is a high-scoring
shootout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Green Bay 28, San Francisco 24 &QL;

LADY RAIDERS BEAT LADY BEARS AT BUZZER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Defending Big 12 women's basketball champion Texas
Tech yesterday did what many predict few teams will do this season
_ win at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Keitha Dickerson swished a 17-foot jumper from out front
that she released just before the final buzzer to give the
eighth-ranked Lady Raiders a 51-49 victory over the Lady Bears
before a season-high Ferrell Center crowd of 4,192.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all Big 12 games are like this, I'll be in a cardiac unit
after the first half of the schedule,'' Tech coach Marsha Sharp
said. ``But Baylor played very well today. They're an awfully good
basketball team that is going to win a lot of games. We knew that
coming in here, and we're even more convinced of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Raiders (12-1) won their 11th consecutive game, on the
home floor of a team that along with ranked teams Tech, Kansas,
Iowa State and Nebraska expects to be among the league's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you win on the road in the Big 12 it's going to be
significant,'' Sharp said. ``The champion isn't going to come out
undefeated or even with one or two losses. From that perspective,
\Rthe victory\S is huge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   consecutive game recovering from a cracked bone in her left
elbow. And Baylor's Lara Webb connected on only one of four 3-point
attempts. But] Lara Webb sank three free throws after being fouled
attempting a 3-pointer with 22.5 seconds left to tie the score at
49 in a game where the largest lead was six points.
</P>
<P>
   After Webb's free throws, Tech guard Melinda Schmucker brought
the ball downcourt and passed to Dickerson. She lofted a pass
inside to post Angie Braziel. But Webb flashed in on the baseline
and knocked the ball out of Braziel's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Braziel won a scramble for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hesitant for a while,'' said Braziel, who scored a
game-high 17 points with 11 rebounds. `` I knew there wasn't much
time left. I was just looking for someone else to get off the
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   She found Dickerson alone out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just threw it up there and prayed it went in,'' said
Dickerson, who with 10 points and 11 rebounds recorded a fourth
double-double in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bears (8-4) have little time to ponder the loss before
a game Tuesday night at preseason Big 12 favorite Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset about the loss,'' BU coach Sonja Hogg said. ``But I
know what we're capable of doing against good teams. The Lady Bears
have arrived and shall not go away.''

 &HT;    NBA NOTES: Another basketball league? Forget it
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While we're at the dawning of the new year, let's dispense with
one piece of foolishness, that being talk of a new professional
basketball league to rival the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   While union executive director Billy Hunter blusters about a new
home for his players, the facts say there simply is no meat for his
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it objectively, there's no question that our
players would suffer,'' Hunter said in a conference call last week.
``By the same token, I don't think that the NBA owners are prepared
to blow up something that they've spent 56 years building. Now,
they may, out of arrogance and power, thumb their nose at us and
cut off their heads to spite their face. But the reality is, the
downside is so great that I don't know if the NBA would ever
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 29 franchises that in the aggregate are worth
probably $5 billion to $6 billion, so are you going to jeopardize
your $6 billion investment? They may be independently wealthy and
may be able to survive it, but I don't think they'll be able to put
the league back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to stop some other groups from stepping up (and
starting a new league)? I know the owners are aware there are other
people willing to replace them. They don't have a monopoly on
money.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it's apparently Hunter's view that there are wealthy men
across America who want to be insulted by Alonzo Mourning while
they pay him $15 million a year, that there is someone outside
Minnesota who wants to give Kevin Garnett $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   A new league cannot survive without television, and much of the
speculation from agents David Falk and Arn Tellem is that Rupert
Murdoch would like to bring his Fox network into play.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Wladika, senior vice president of media relations for Fox
Sports, points out that Fox carries games locally for 26 of the 29
NBA teams, with average contracts lasting seven years, and that
Murdoch also is a minority owner of the Knicks and thus in both
instances would be competing against himself by trying to form a
new league. For example, Fox Sports South carries 30 Hawks games
and 20 Hornets games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agents are having a fun time trying to spread that around,
but we're not a company that has a tendency to devalue its
properties,'' Wladika told the New York Times. ``Those rumors are
being spread by people who don't know the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   A more realistic view comes from NBA commissioner David Stern,
who says his league ``will always be here. In the form that you see
it, the NBA will open next year. It may not have the same players
it does this year; it may not charge the same ticket prices, it may
not even have the expensive TV package, but it will be a league,
and it will survive for a long time, and it will re-grow and recoup
itself. It will have suffered tremendously, but it will be here to
live and entertain another day and ultimately thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Heated
</P>
<P>
   If there is a season, Heat coach Pat Riley might have to do his
best job of coaching ever. First, if he re-signs defensive ace
Keith Askins, he will have to curb any problems with Alonzo
Mourning. Askins says the negotiating committee, with Mourning,
holds the masses hostage. And Tim Hardaway has taken some swipes at
Mourning for his comments regarding players' mismanagement of money
at the announcement for the Dec. 19 exhibition game in Atlantic
City, N.J. Hardaway ripped Mourning again after Mourning suggested
that part of the problem with negotiations might be related to
race.
</P>
<P>
   Lonesome
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Tom Gugliotta's talking like a homeless person.
``With the lockout, I've lost a lot of contact (with the Minnesota
team). I won't say there are hard feelings. I understand it's
business. But I feel like I'm out on my own. You can't use any of
the facilities. Like my teammate Sam Mitchell said, `My family has
been mad at me before. But they never locked me out of the
house.'''
</P>
<P>
   Omens
</P>
<P>
   A charity game planned for Durham, N.C., last week was canceled
because the gym was not reserved. Ron Mercer's planned public
practice at Brandeis U. was called off when no players showed, and
a Kansas City game was canceled because organizers said there was
not enough time to prepare. ``I definitely think (fans are) going
to get back at us,'' said the Lakers' Eddie Jones, who did play in
an exhibition game in Los Angeles. ``They're going to support a
charity event (maybe), but you're talking about an NBA game where
people are paying actual money that's going in someone's pocket. I
don't think they're going to support that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   They said it
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton of the Sonics: ``The owners still have a billion
dollars in the bank. They are in their big houses, but they don't
have gold chains around their necks and Rolexes. They don't flaunt
it like we do.'' Gee, has Payton ever seen the Lakers' Jerry Buss?
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Stith of the Nuggets: ``I will go out and play if the NBA
calls us back to work now or in (1999-2000). Whatever the situation
is, I'm willing to accept and just move on. But I haven't put my
life on hold, just sitting by the phone and reading the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Dan Fegan: ``If I were the players, I wouldn't take the
deal on the table. I would pass on the season. The deal is
horrible. In my opinion, David Stern and the owners are greedy
pigs. They want to have their cake and eat it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Brent Barry: ``We agreed during our (October) meeting
in Las Vegas that we wanted Billy and our committee to be the
megaphone for us. But at this point, maybe it is better if the
inmates run the asylum.''

 &HT;    FSU defense knows ropes
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ On Sept. 14, Florida State went to practice with
a 1-1 record and a most uncertain future. The Seminoles had just
lost to N.C. State and wondered if their string of 11 consecutive
top-four finishes was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Andrews, Florida State's veteran defensive coordinator,
arrived at a team meeting holding a rope. The players in the room
rustled nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at the bottom of a mountain and you have to climb this
rope to the top,'' Andrews told his troops. ``Look around. Who in
this room do to you trust to hold the rope?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew exactly what he meant,'' said defensive tackle Corey
Simon. ``If we didn't trust every guy in the room to hold that
rope, none of us were going to get to the top of the mountain. If
we didn't believe in each other and take care of each other, we
were not going to reach our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And the goal at Florida State, as always, is to play for the
national championship. That day the defense decided it could be
good enough to take the Seminoles there.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, No. 2 Florida State (11-1) will play No. 1
Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. And there is
no mystery why the Seminoles are here. Everyone, from head coach
Bobby Bowden to the water boy, knows that Florida State rode to the
national championship game on the backs of a defense that exceeded
everyone's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are impressive. Florida State leads the nation in
total defense, giving up only 241.8 yards per game. That's 42.9
yards better per game than No. 2 Ohio State. They are tops against
the pass, second against the run, and are giving up only 11.5
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers tell only half the story, for there was no way
Florida State's defense could have been expected to enjoy this
lofty position.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Wadsworth. Greg Spires. Sam Cowart. Darryl Bush. Samari
Rolle.
</P>
<P>
   Losing any of those great players would be hard for a defense to
overcome. The Seminoles lost them all after the 1997 season. Even
their most diehard fan assumed there would be at least a slight
dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People gave us no shot at being as good as we were a year ago,
but the truth is we're better,'' said Simon. ``We've proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles gave up only 138 points this season, but again,
those numbers tell only part of the story. Of that total, Florida
State allowed only 45 points in the second half (3.75 avg.) of its
12 games. Six of its opponents (Texas A&AMP;M, Maryland, Clemson,
Georgia Tech, Virginia, Florida) were shut out in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have as many name players as we've had in the past,
but we've got a lot of kids who wanted to be something special,''
said Andrews, in his 15th season at Florida State. ``We set the bar
pretty high around here, and they were willing to work to go over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews works his defense as hard as anybody, but the fact is,
there was a lot of talent waiting in the wings. Senior Tony Bryant
and sophomore Roland Seymour stepped into the end spots vacated by
Wadsworth and Spires. Bryant was All-ACC second team and led the
team with seven sacks. Seymour (6-4), will some day be an All-ACC
player. Simon, Jerry Johnson and Larry Smith are all dominating
tackles (Smith will miss Monday's game with an injury). Mario
Edwards returned after a year's absence at cornerback and, as a
result, this secondary covers significantly better than the 1997
unit.
</P>
<P>
   And there is depth. Injuries have limited the playing time of
Smith, linebacker Lamont Green and a host of others, but every
time, somebody stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, I thought we had more overall talent and depth
than we did a year ago,'' said Andrews. ``All they needed was some
experience, so this was a group that kind of grew up together.''
</P>
<P>
   If Florida State is going to beat Tennessee, the consensus is
that the Seminole defense will be the difference. FSU doesn't
figure to score a lot of points with sophomore Marcus Outzen at
quarterback, and with that defense, Bowden won't take a lot of
chances as long as he has the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it changes the way you call a game,'' said Bowden. ``You
don't want to do something silly on offense when you've got that
kind of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And the best is yet to come at Florida State. Seven of the
starting 11 and 15 of the top 22 on defense are scheduled to return
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, when we started the season I thought we
were a year away from being pretty good,'' said Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, wait until next year,'' said Simon. ``We'll be a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   That should make for a lot of sleepless nights throughout the
ACC.

 &HT;    Hard-working Fulmer enjoys a breakthrough season
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Given his surroundings, and given the fact that
Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer is about to coach the biggest game of
his life, he should be a bundle of nerves. That he is not is a
tribute to a man who, at 48, has finally found his comfort zone as
a coach, husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   Were this a year ago, Fulmer would not be smiling as he goes
through his daily media obligations prior to Monday night's Fiesta
Bowl, a game that will likely determine the national championship.
In Fulmer's mind, there would have been no room on the schedule for
grins.
</P>
<P>
   But this week in Tempe, Fulmer has surprised the masses with his
quick wit and his willingness to loosen up and have fun when the
stakes might suggest he behave otherwise. Bottom line, the old
Tennessee lineman is having a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell you the truth, Coach has been pretty relaxed all year,''
said Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin. ``We didn't expect this trip
to be any different. We're just out here having fun and so is he.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened to Fulmer, the man who for seven seasons
drove himself to prove that he belonged at the top of his
profession? Several things.
</P>
<P>
   For one, with two straight SEC championships and Tennessee's
first 12-0 season in 1998, Fulmer has finally proven _ to himself
and others _ that he is a top-drawer coach. For the longest time,
Fulmer endured the rap of being a good recruiter who was destined
to come up short on game day.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, Fulmer did the best coaching job of his career,
beginning with his preparations last spring.
</P>
<P>
   After Tennessee's SEC's championship season of 1997, it seemed
inevitable that the Volunteers would take a step back this fall. In
addition to quarterback Peyton Manning, the Vols were losing other
NFL caliber players such as Terry Fair, Leonard Little, Jonathon
Brown and Marcus Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer was determined not to let that happen. In the spring, he
challenged his team and his coaches not to use those personnel
losses as an excuse for complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, there was no reason for this program to drop
back,'' said Fulmer. ``We had recruited well for several years and
had players who had been waiting their turn. I just believed that
if we were willing towork hard enough, it would not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the loss of Manning and all those NFL draft choices
was liberating to Fulmer. With all those stars gone, he was free to
shape this team into his own image _ a blue-collar, lunch-pail
toting unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach ain't fancy and neither is this team,'' said senior
linebacker Al Wilson. ``This team is more like him than any I've
been on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee lost running back Jamal Lewis to an injury Oct.
3, Fulmer's doubters were convinced the Volunteers were done _ they
had a ready-made excuse. But it didn't happen because Fulmer
wouldn't let it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jamal Lewis went down he never wavered, he never
complained. He just simply decided to move on,'' said John Ward,
Tennessee's longtime radio broadcaster. ``He doesn't make excuses
and doesn't want others to do so. I don't know a lot about
football, but that sounds like pretty good coaching to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee went undefeated and Fulmer won his first national
coach of the year honor from the Football Writers Association of
America. It was, said others, validation that had been long in
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot,'' Fulmer said. ``You always appreciate it when
others recognize the kind of program that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, one cannot measure the load lifted off Fulmer's
shoulders on Sept. 19 when Tennessee beat Florida 20-17 in overtime
after five straight losses to the Gators. Despite all his success,
Fulmer's critics said he could not match wits with the likes of
Florida coach Steve Spurrier and was therefore destined to play a
permanent second fiddle to Spurrier the SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   Not fair and not accurate, Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it was fair to judge the quality of our
program based on just one game,'' Fulmer said. ``While it's true we
hadn't beaten Florida, a lot of people hadn't beaten Florida. But
that doesn't mean we were bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Fulmer got a reality check at home.
</P>
<P>
   Wife Vicky made him promise last summer to spend a little more
time at home with his three girls, Allison, 12, Brittany, 13, and
Courtney, 15. She felt adding a little more balance to his life
would make him a happier man and would probably make him a better
football coach. She was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Phillip's happier because after seven years as a head
coach he's found the right formula to do his job,'' Vicky Fulmer
said. ``He knows how to delegate his work so that it all gets done
but it leaves some time for himself and his family. This is the
best year we've ever had, and it's not because we're undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things, however, have not changed about the new and
improved Phillip Fulmer:
</P>
<P>
   _ He remains incredibly competitive, no matter what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not want to play pickup basketball against him,''
defensive coordinator John Chavis said. ``Not unless you want to
get pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I play tennis with him and he can't stand to lose,'' Fulmer's
wife said. ``And if he can't beat you physically, he'll beat you
psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty,'' Fulmer said. ``I don't like to lose in anything I
do. If I had stayed in law school instead of becoming a coach, I
wouldn't have been happy unless I was the best lawyer around.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In a profession filled with egos, Fulmer has managed to keep
his in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phillip knows it's not about him,'' said Anthony Edwards, a
former teammate of Fulmer's. ``It's about the kids and the
university of Tennessee. He's always known that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of ego, but I do have a lot of pride,''
Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   _ His work ethic, particularly on the recruiting trail, remains
legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not outwork him,'' offensive coordinator Randy
Sanders said. ``And when you see the head coach putting in all
those hours, you don't mind doing it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   _ With players, he has found the perfect combination of
friendship, discipline and tough love. And with that, he has
created a family atmosphere that has become one of the program's
selling points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach will joke around with us, but when he gives you that
look, you know it's all business,'' Wilson said. ``But at the end
of the day, we know he cares about us.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that Fulmer, having brought the Tennessee
program to the brink of the school's first national championship
since 1951, is in Knoxville for the long haul. He and his staff are
on the way to another nationally ranked recruiting class, led by
quarterback Chris Simms. Thirty-three of the top 44 players from
this team return next season, with a slew of good redshirt players
no one has even seen.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens in Monday night's game, Fulmer will
go home a contented man, secure in this knowledge: This will be the
first time Tennessee has competed for a national championship under
his watch. But it probably won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about where the program is and right now. We've
got the commitment to maintain it,'' Fulmer said. ``We're pretty
excited about the future.''

 &HT;    Last call of 'Whoa, Nellie' for old Georgia boy Keith Jackson
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the final seconds tick off the clock Monday night
at the Fiesta Bowl, the aftermath of the game between Tennessee and
Florida State will be a familiar one: the unbridled joy of victory
in concert with the painful expression of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The final scene in the ABC booth will be familiar, too. Bright
lights mounted on tall tripods will click off, and headsets will be
laid to rest on table tops in the press box. Except Monday night
will be no ordinary sign-off for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Although the network will air another national championship game
in 2000, burly linemen will not be called ``big uglies'' and a
fluttering pass won't fall to the ground ``like a wounded goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1998 season that has seen Keith Jackson perform as
passionately and colorfully as ever, the dean of ABC's announcers
has stayed the course to retirement. Monday's Fiesta Bowl will go
down as the final call in one of broadcasting's most storied
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no pressure on me to leave, and nobody forced me
out,'' said Jackson, who did Saturday's Rose Bowl with partner Bob
Griese. ``(ABC Sports president) Steve Bornstein said I could stay
as long as I like. But I've had a good run, and it's time for the
next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 70, has regaled college football fans for 31 seasons on
ABC with a folksy, cornpone flair for description that has made him
a television icon. And when Jackson announced this year would be
his last ``Whoa, Nellie,'' fans at every stop on the farewell tour
have leaped at the chance to say thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been modest about it, but when we traveled to college
towns this season, it was Keith everybody wanted to see,'' said Jay
Rothman, Jackson's game producer. ``It was like walking in with the
pope.''
</P>
<P>
   Even fans coming to big, sprawling towns like Atlanta for the
SEC championship nudged each other with elbows so they could turn
and shout their greetings to the man they recognized as the
national voice of college football.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson returned their star-struck attention with a
gracious wave of his hand as he weaved his way to the media
entrance of the Georgia Dome, he does not crave such limelight. In
fact, he's downright uncomfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers, I think I'd have kept my mouth shut,''
said Jackson, who said he does not want any on-air celebrations of
his career when Monday's game is over.
</P>
<P>
   Such modesty about a lifetime of accomplishment comes easily
when it is grounded in a childhood that began on a dirt farm about
eight miles from Carrollton, Ga., and was spent traversing dusty
roads that led to such quaint towns as Tallapoosa, home of his
one-room schoolhouse; Tyus, site of his junior high; and Roopville,
where Jackson attended high school and played on a championship
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   And when he wasn't traipsing to and from those tiny Georgia
towns, either on foot or horseback, Jackson was at the farm of his
grandparents, Jeff Robison and a family matriarch known
affectionately as ``Aunt Sug.'' Although in Jackson's recollection,
his grandfather ``Old Jeff'' had married the meanest woman he could
find.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jackson's memory of his grandmother has been flavored by
``Aunt Sug'' telling the family about seeing young Keith in the
fields announcing his imaginary games to the milk cows.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also ``Aunt Sug'' who would spend many an evening
telling stories to young Keith, which, unbeknownst to her, was
laying the foundation for a sportscaster who would grow up to
become one of the best storytellers in the medium of television.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Old Jeff,'' if people ever wondered why Jackson has
never been moved by the scores of awards and honors for
broadcasting excellence, perhaps it's because he never forgot what
his grandfather said after Jackson came home with a basketball
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, if you can't eat it, cash it, drink it or sleep with it,
don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson has lived more than four-fifths of his life on
the West Coast and traveled to 31 countries in covering the wide
world of sports for ABC, he has remained unmistakably true to those
Georgia roots.
</P>
<P>
   However, except for a few distant relatives he brushes off as
``shirt-tail cousins,'' Jackson has only one real tie to his home
state, but it is a close and binding one.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson's father divorced his mother, Polly, he also chose
inexplicably to sever any kind of a relationship with his son. But
Jackson was not destined to spend the majority of his childhood
without a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   While his mother was working at a Villa Rica hospital, she met a
man named R.C. Bragg toiling in a nearby construction camp. And by
the time Jackson was 9, Polly and R.C. were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember her telling me right off that she had a child. And
I said, `Good, now we don't have to worry about having any,''' said
Bragg, who to this day refers to Jackson as being ``home-raised,
hand-spanked and bread-fed.''
</P>
<P>
   In comfortable retirement at 86, Bragg still lives in Bremen,
about 55 miles west of Atlanta. Even when Jackson's mother died in
1989, no amount of urging from his stepson could get him to move
out of the plain, white one-story house near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg will visit his stepson in Sherman Oaks, Calif., on
occasion and has even been known to join Jackson and his family at
their getaway home in Garden Bay, British Columbia, a place where
many of the upcoming months will be spent now.
</P>
<P>
   But happiness for Bragg these days is to do a little bit of
fishing and a whole lot of lawn-mower repair, one of his favorite
hobbies. Bragg's face lights up when asked to talk about his
stepson, and he welcomes the opportunity to share those
well-preserved pictures of Jackson posing with his basketball
teammates and standing proudly in his cap and gown as a member of
Roopville High's class of '46.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith used to listen to Red Barber, and he used to tell his
mother, `Someday I'll be as good as Red Barber,''' Bragg said,
while sitting in his yard on a bright, sunny day. ``When he
graduated from high school, he wanted to go to Georgia Tech. But he
couldn't get in Tech. It seemed like everybody was coming out of
the service at that time and was going to Tech. So my advice to him
was to go into the Marine Corps, and the military service would be
a way he could get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson took that advice, but never returned to Georgia to
enroll at Tech. Four years of military duty, most notably in China
as an aircraft mechanic, would lead to college at Washington State
in 1950. And while in Pullman, Jackson would come upon the most
important events in his life, both professionally and personally.
</P>
<P>
   The latter would come in the form of a tall, striking blonde of
Norwegian descent named Turi Ann, also a student at Washington
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met under a willow tree, and I was a goner,'' Jackson said,
breaking into the cherubic smile of a man who has been happily
married for 46 years.
</P>
<P>
   And on this particular assignment at the Georgia Dome, Turi Ann
has made the trip to Atlanta with him. She has accompanied her
husband on the road often through the years, and one needs to chat
with her for only a few moments to realize she has yet to meet a
stranger. Little wonder Jackson has only first thoughts about
spending more time with his wife and no second thoughts about
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   When Turi Ann comes to the stadium with her husband, Keith
becomes the second-most popular Jackson among his ABC colleagues.
She is especially happy this night because their youngest son,
Christopher, whom she lovingly calls their bonus baby because he
was born 10 years after his siblings Melanie and Lindsey, just
happened to be in town on business and was able to join his parents
for dinner and a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Keith has traveled a lot, we've spent a lot of time
with each other, and he always found a lot of time for the kids,''
said Turi Ann, who is the best fisherman in the family, Keith and
Chris both acknowledge. ``But I'm really looking forward to having
him around all the time. The place we have up in Canada is
wonderful. We love it up there, and believe me when I tell you our
days will be filled.''
</P>
<P>
   When they became a couple in love at Washington State, the idea
of a fulfilling life weaved around the world of sports was not part
of the game plan. Jackson was in college to study criminology and
political science.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the only trouble was he kept listening to the games,''
Turi Ann said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Washington State was one of the first colleges to
operate its own radio station. Those fledgling broadcasts awakened
the Red Barber childhood dreams that had gone dormant during four
years in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember lying in the dormitory and thinking, `These guys
aren't all that good,''' Jackson said. ``So I decided to go for it.
A guy by the name of Burt Harrison was in charge. So I walked into
his office, introduced myself and told him, `I betcha I could do a
better job than the people you've got now.' He looked at me kinda
funny, and said, `All right, go record one, and we'll see.' So
that's what I did, and I never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson began calling football for Washington State in 1952, and
after graduating with honors in broadcasting in1954, he quickly
landed a job as a news anchor at the ABC television affiliate in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spent 10 years at KOMO, deftly mixing in play-by-play
work for the University of Washington and Seattle University
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a co-anchor with Herb Robinson, and we were the first
half-hour, two-man newscast,'' Jackson said. ``But we never saw
ourselves as being in show business. We saw ourselves as
journalists who were covering news and sports.''
</P>
<P>
   As time wore on and philosophies changed, Jackson grew
disenchanted with doing local news and took a job with the ABC
Radio Network in 1965, which included covering the NCAA basketball
championship between UCLA and Michigan. For four years, his work in
television was freelance. But all that changed in 1968 when ABC
Sports honcho Roone Arledge and his top producer, Chuck Howard,
needed someone in Seattle to call a parachute-jumping event for
``Wide World of Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   That someone would be Jackson, and ABC Sports would be the last
employer he'd ever have. Jackson will be linked indelibly to
college football, but hockey might be the only sport he never
called. The NBA, the first year of ``Monday Night Football'' in
1970, major-league baseball and the Olympics all are on the resume.
</P>
<P>
   Also on that resume, however, is the one incident that thrust
Jackson into a firestorm of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1978 Gator Bowl, a national television audience was
stunned when legendary Ohio State coach Woody Hayes punched Clemson
player Charlie Baumann after Baumann intercepted a pass to dash the
Buckeyes' last hope for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Even more shocking was the appearance that Jackson and partner
Ara Parseghian acted as if the punch didn't happen. Charges that he
was trying to cover up for Hayes were leveled at Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson never actually saw the punch from his vantage point
in the booth. And neither were he and Hayes bosom buddies,
especially after the week Hayes was a guest analyst with Jackson
and seemed more interested in plugging his book than commenting on
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fail to realize that I didn't get on well with Hayes,''
Jackson said. ``But the fact of the matter is I didn't see (the
punch). There were 143 people on the sideline, and if people go
back and listen, I said, `Let's look at the tape and see what
happened.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't see the tape because the network was
nickel-and-diming the operation at that time with a bunch of green
kids, and the tape was in New York, which did not feed to us in the
booth. I saw (the punch) for the first time at noon the next day on
NBC. But people took all the shots at me _ even though Ara didn't
see it, my spotter didn't see it, and the producer didn't say
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The punch proved to be the undoing of Hayes' coaching career,
and a lesser talent than Jackson also might not have survived such
an oversight, because of the damage to his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But survive Jackson did, to the point of being inducted into the
American Sportscaster Hall of Fame in 1994 and the National
Sportscasters &AMP; Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Far more rewarding has been the response of fans and admirers
this year. He has received some token of appreciation at every
stop, from two rocking chairs presented by Penn State coach Joe
Paterno to a personally engraved cowbell from the faithful at
Mississippi State. And the ovation Jackson received from 110,000
fans at Michigan's stadium in Ann Arbor, including the presentation
of a Wolverine helmet by former coach Bo Schembechler, was among
the moments he said he'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kidded him unmercifully about this,'' said analyst Bob
Griese, Jackson's football partner for the last 12 years. ``He's
getting all this stuff, and I've had to tell him, 'What do I look
like, your valet?'
</P>
<P>
   ``All this attention has made him kind of uneasy. But we kept
telling him to enjoy it and have some fun with it. It's just people
wanting to show him how much they appreciate what he has done. He's
a legend, and I don't think there will ever be another one like
him.''

 &HT;    AFC NOTES: Raven(s) maniacs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nucleus of solid young players like offensive tackle
Jonathan Ogden, wide receiver Jermaine Lewis, tailback Priest
Holmes, defensive end Michael McCrary, linebackers Peter Boulware
and Ray Lewis and corner Duane Starks could help Baltimore attract
a quality coaching prospect. But one still has to wonder how owner
Art Modell is running the franchise. Last Sunday night, the Ravens
contacted former San Francisco coach George Seifert about the
coaching job. Three weeks before that, vice president Ozzie Newsome
phoned Oregon coach Mike Bellotti. But on Monday, when they
announced the coaching change, Modell claimed that out of respect
for deposed Ted Marchibroda, the club had made no contacts. Like
everyone else, the Ravens have Mike Holmgren atop their wish list.
A more realistic working list now includes Vikes offensive
coordinator Brian Billick, Steelers defensive coordinator Jim
Haslett, former Eagles defensive chief Emmitt Thomas and Stanford
coach Tyrone Willingham. The team also has sought permission to
interview Jaguars defensive coordinator Dick Jauron. Seifert has
indicated to club officials that he's not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Kordell kaput?
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh management is disenchanted enough with quarterback
Kordell Stewart that the team already has discussed possible
veteran alternatives. Don't be surprised if the Steelers sign a
free agent like Rich Gannon and force Stewart to earn the starting
job. There's talk that, because of off-field problems and friction
with teammates, Stewart could find himself out altogether, just two
seasons after starting the AFC title game. Coach Bill Cowher, whose
ego approximates that of Stewart's, was calling many of the plays
and tutoring the quarterbacks the past few weeks. He could bring in
former San Diego coach Kevin Gilbride or promote tight ends coach
Mike Mularkey to replace Ray Sherman, who resigned Thursday as
coordinator. Cowher has also talked with Chicago quarterbacks coach
Matt Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers chatter
</P>
<P>
   San Diego coordinator Joe Pascale did a masterful job in 1998,
turning a unit that has only two legitimate stars in linebacker
Junior Seau and strong safety Rodney Harrison, into the NFL's
top-ranked defense. But Pascale may have overplayed his hand last
Tuesday when interviewing with GM Bobby Beathard for the team's
head coach vacancy. Pascale told Beathard that if he wasn't head
coach, he wouldn't return in '99. Beathard wanted to keep the
defensive group of Pascale, line coach Wayne Nunnely, linebackers
coach Jim Vechiarella and secondary coach Rod Perry intact and was
taken aback by the news. He identified Washington coach Norv
Turner, who could bring along defensive boss Mike Nolan, as a
secret candidate. But with John Kent Cooke now likely to retain
ownership of the Redskins, Turner's job probably is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be announced for another week or two, but
Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin and owner Wayne Weaver finally have
reached a handshake deal on a contract extension. The deal,
expected to pay Coughlin about $2.5 million annually, was hammered
out between the two men after Weaver grew frustrated with agent
Robert Fraley. ... Indianapolis coach Jim Mora, who fired defensive
coordinator Rusty Tillman, probably will hire old friend Vic
Fangio, the former coordinator in Carolina, as his replacement. But
Mora and GM Bill Polian also will keep an eye on what transpires
with Dom Capers. ... Tito PaulSince his contract includes a
stipulation that he can't have a ``franchise'' designation, Oakland
will pay Jeff George

 &HT;    NFC NOTES: Seifert nearly set
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assured they will not be considered by Green Bay coach Mike
Holmgren, the Carolina Panthers have settled on former 49ers coach
George Seifert to replace Dom Capers and an agreement could be
consummated by next week. Seifert interviewed Tuesday with owner
Jerry Richardson and, not surprisingly, was impressive. The
Panthers are so convinced of a deal with Seifert that they have
begun assembling a staff. The club retained offensive coordinator
Gill Haskell, tight ends coach Don Breaux and wideouts coach
Richard Williamson from Capers' staff. On Tuesday, Richardson will
interview highly regarded offensive line coach Tony Wise (Chicago)
and quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave (Philadelphia). Richardson is
taking his cues from Dallas owner Jerry Jones, who played a major
role in assembling a staff for Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Skins game
</P>
<P>
   Washington president John Kent Cooke likely owes Richardson a
dinner. The Carolina owner played a key role in hooking up Cooke
with NationsBank chief executive Hugh McColl, and the marriage
resulted in a bid of $780 million for the team by the son of late
owner Jack Kent Cooke. The odds are now that Cooke purchases the
team from his father's estate and retains coach Norv Turner and
general manager Charley Casserly. Because the two have been sniping
at each other much of this season, the '99 campaign could be an
interesting one.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news Bears
</P>
<P>
   Chicago president Mike McCaskey ignored the wishes of his top
football men, director of operations Mark Hatley and pro personnel
director Rick Spielman, in dumping coach Dave Wannstedt on Monday.
Then on his way out the door to a ski vacation, McCaskey instructed
Hatley to begin interviewing potential replacements. The zaniness
is simply the latest manifestation of how McCaskey has undermined a
once-proud franchise. The rumors that the club could turn to Hall
of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary, who has no coaching experience,
weren't afforded much credence at first. But because McCaskey needs
to score a public-relations coup with his hire, in part to attract
public support for a new stadium, anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Bucs
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay quarterback Trent Dilfer will be back in '99, but look
for coach Tony Dungy and coordinator Mike Shula to bring in a
veteran to push him. The Bucs feel that part of the reason for
Dilfer's regression is that he didn't feel threatened by backups
Steve Walsh or Scott Milanovich. Also look for Dungy to be much
tougher on his team in training camp next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky getting picky
</P>
<P>
   Heisman winner Ricky Williams likely will be the second overall
choice in the '99 draft after Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch. But
the Texas tailback is hinting that he does not want to play for
Philadelphia, which owns the second pick. Williams knows of the
Eagles' poor facilities and owner Jeff Lurie's shallow pockets.
Operations director Tom Modrak may end up having to trade the
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick, the hottest
assistant in the NFL, likes the situation in Cleveland, where he
interviewed Monday, and is enticed by some of the young players in
Baltimore. But he really hopes to hear from Seattle owner Paul
Allen. Like many, Billick feels the Seahawks are a talented team
that underachieved in recent seasons. ... Former Atlanta personnel
director Ken Herock, of course, drafted tailback Jamal Anderson.
Notable is that Herock, while at Tampa Bay, also drafted James
Wilder, the man whose single-season carries record Anderson broke
this year.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lost in the speculation about where San
Francisco coach Steve Mariucci and Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren
might be headed after the season is a ``where'' question on the
game.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``Where's Waldo?'' of football, with Packers strong
safety LeRoy Butler in the title role. Butler is a player the San
Francisco offensive line can't forget about if the team is to end
its five-game losing streak against the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very first play, you have to locate Butler every
snap,'' 49ers quarterback Steve Young said. ``He's the key guy in
most of the creative stuff they do. He'll sneak up close to the
line to play the run. He'll blitz you from the inside or coming off
the edge. If you don't account for him in your (blocking) scheme,
he'll make the big play. You have to pay LeRoy lots of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Packers' 36-22 victory over San Francisco on Nov. 1, the
49ers didn't pay enough attention, and Young paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Butler sacked Young twice in that game, once on a delayed blitz
up the middle and the other from his slot-safety position. He made
six tackles and had a forced fumble, a pressure and one pass
defensed. More important, he set the tone for one of the worst
beatings _ and poorest performances _ of Young's professional
career.
</P>
<P>
   Young was sacked by Butler on the Niners' first snap of the
game. He was dumped by defensive end Reggie White on the third
play. On his sixth play, Young threw an interception.
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked nine times that day and, while White and fellow
end Vonnie Holliday combined for 5 1/2 of them, Butler was the key.
In the pass-rush game, he is the wild card for coordinator Fritz
Shurmur, who will position the strong safety in as many as six
different spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great run-stuff guy, but as far as pass protection,
it's hard to account for him,'' 49ers center Chris Dalman said.
``You can plan to block him in the running game, but if he's lined
up all over the place against the pass, it's tough. He's kind of
the `hot' guy. We gave up nine sacks that last time we played them,
and everyone said the line didn't block well. But watch film, and
you see they're rushing six people. We can't block two of them at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who has made a big play in each of Green Bay's five wins
over the 49ers since 1995, agrees with that assessment and revels
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to play cat and mouse with them in terms of where I'll
be,'' he said. ``They have to find me before they can block me,
and, so far, they haven't done it.''

 &HT;    Search is on for Thrashers goalie
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eighteen years ago, an obscure backup goaltender in
Los Angeles named Mario Lessard became the unforeseen centerpiece
on an unforeseen winning team.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard started 64 of 80 games for the second-place Kings, lost
only 18 and proceeded to _ oblivion. He lost the puck, he lost his
confidence, and three years later he was out of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Jim Carey made the all-rookie team with
Washington in 1995, was honored with the Vezina Trophy as the
league's top goaltender the following year and has de-evolved into
_ a member of the Providence Bruins of the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other position in hockey, goaltenders lives a
fragile existence. The dramatic decrease in scoring in recent years
actually has increased the pressure on goalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the league, we were allowed to let a soft one
in and get away with it,'' the recently retired Andy Moog said. ``I
don't know if you can do that now, because the games are so
low-scoring. We could make a mistake and grow up as player. But you
can't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Moog has the job of determining which goalie is most likely
to withstand that pressure. If the goalie has a quick glove hand,
all the better.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Thrashers know that goaltending can make or break an
expansion team comprised of league obscurities next season, so they
hired the four-time All-Star, three-time Stanley Cup winner to
scout NHL backups who might be available in the expansion draft and
amateurs up for grabs in the entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   That Moog retired only six months ago after 18 seasons was key
to the Thrashers' interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us what I think is an inside person who really knows
a lot about these guys,'' Thrashers general manager Don Waddell
said. ``We need to know what these guys are like away from the ice,
whether they're high-character guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Work habits, the thinking goes, are a direct link to a
goaltender's longevity in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of reasons guys go on roller-coaster rides,''
Moog said. ``I wasn't mature enough to handle things in the NHL. I
got a taste of it when I was 20, but I didn't stick until I was 22.
I didn't realize what it took to stay there. Some guys don't take
the time to learn what it takes to be successful. They don't get
down and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Goaltenders ``don't lose skill overnight, but they lose
confidence,'' Waddell said. ``How is it that a goalie can get a
shutout one night? It's the pressure. A team loses 3-1, and all
people remember is the bad goal that got deflected in and they
blame the goalie. You hardly ever hear people say the forwards
didn't check at center ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog, who first was approached about the Thrashers job in
September by assistant general manager Les Jackson, will prepare
scouting reports on the top NHL backups who might be left
unprotected. Anticipating who might be available is difficult,
because some teams might opt to leave a high-salary starter
unprotected, believing that Atlanta would not want to pay his
salary.
</P>
<P>
   One possible example is Dallas, where starter Ed Belfour earns
$3.25 million and has one year left on his contract, while backup
Roman Turek (5-0-2 with a 1.94 goals-against average) is considered
the future of the franchise and makes only $725,000.
</P>
<P>
   Moog said his scouting reports won't be limited to game action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Don and Les that if I'm going to analyze someone
completely, I'll have to watch him in practice as well as games.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Moog think other teams will be so accommodating as to let
him watch practice?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I may have to sneak in.''

 &HT;    NHL EAST NOTES: Habs and Hab-nots
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although rumors throughout Canada have former New
Jersey coach Jacques Lemaire eventually taking over as coach or GM
of the floundering Montreal Canadiens, don't bank on it. Lemaire,
who had been doing some consulting work with the Devils this
season, primarily will assist in player evaluation in his new
position with the Canadiens. That is the job he enjoys most and is
what he did for Montreal before taking the coaching job in New
Jersey. Lemaire has said he has no desire to replace coach Alain
Vigneault. ``I don't want to coach. I don't want any part of
that.'' And neither does he especially relish the responsibilties
that go with being a general manager: making trades, negotiating
contracts, dealing with the media. It's also worth noting that
Lemaire and the Canadiens' maligned general manager, Rejean Houle,
are former teammates and close friends. ``Any decision will be
Rejean's and anything on the ice will be decided by Alain,'' said
Lemaire, who doesn't think that the Canadiens need an overhaul.
``My job is to tell them stuff that might help.'' That said, if
Lemaire contributes to Montreal's turnaround, he could have his
pick of jobs in the NHL. One postscript: Devils GM Lou Lamoriello
would not comment when asked if Montreal will compensate New Jersey
for letting Lemaire out of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a flyer
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia general manager Bob Clarke, whose future with the
team figures to be linked to this year's playoffs, did not make any
friends in the Flyers' locker room with this week's trade of
defenseman Petr Svoboda to Tampa Bay for defenseman Karl Dykhius.
The 6-foot-3 Dykhius, 26, is two inches taller and six years
younger than Svoboda. But Dykhius's minus-21 plus-minus rating also
ranks worst among NHL defenseman. Svoboda is a plus-five and
popular with his teammates. Eric Lindros waved off reporters when
asked about the deal and walked out of the locker room consoling
Svoboda, who said he was ``shocked.'' Clarke has made 10 roster
changes, nearly half the team, since the Flyers' playoff loss to
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Your NHL bankruptcy update: Penguins co-owner Roger Marino said
part of the team is for sale and that Mario Lemieux might be a
buyer. Lemieux's interest is not surprising because partial
ownership is one way to lessen the $28 million in deferred salary
he is owed by the organization. Lemieux's stature also could aid
the Penguins' quest for a new arena. ... For a team losing several
million dollars in a half-empty arena, the Carolina Hurricanes took
a huge financial gamble in acquiring defenseman Paul Coffey from
Chicago this week. The 37-year-old, whose contract at $2 million
per year runs through next season, has missed 59 games with
injuries since 1996. Hurricanes general manager Jim Rutherford
needed a point man for his power play _ but Coffey won't help if
he's in the whirlpool. ... Washington was outscored 30-10 in the
first period of its first 31 games, but in Game 32 it took a 3-0
first-period lead against Boston.

   (NYT10) BALTIMORE -- Jan. 2, 1999 -- EDLIFE-HOMEWORK, 1-2 -- At
the Dr. Bernard Harris Elementary School, Denise Norfleet, a
teacher, helps thrid graders after school with their homework. In
the last 15 years, the biggest increase in homework has fallen
mainly on the youngest citizens. This generation's parents are
caught in a trap of their own making: they are pushing their
children and their schools to be more competitive, even as they
have less time to help with homework and activities. (Ann

Juanita James scholarship, and Kanika Brooks, 1998's winner.
``Though she died more than 13 years ago, my mother is still having
an influence on the youth of the neighborhood through the

honor of her mother. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)

Majority Leader Trent Lott, right, has consulted with many of his
colleagues, including Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., left, as the
Senate prepares to take up the articles of impeachment against
President Clinton. Conservative Republicans, of which he is one,
are pushing Lott to hold a full trial, with testimony from
witnesses, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment. Many
of them disapprove of censuring Clinton. (Stephen Crowley/New York

his fiancee, Kathleen Johnson, 27, at his parents home in Long
Island. Despite Sardo's illness, and constant work and distance
related conflicts, the Columbia University graduates and college
sports stars have always found laughter to be the main ingredient
in their life together. ``It's the way we get through the tough
days and nights,'' says Johnson. (Lois Raimondo/New York Times

Thomas C. Colt III, 63, one of 10 living decendants of Andrew
Johnson, makes his living delivering pizza and selling hardware at
Sears. Colt has made a thorough study of his ancestor's
impeachment, and though he is a great-great-great grandson of a
president, even an impeached one, he does not blame his ancestor's
history for his own modest station. ``Don't do anything unless it's
worth doing, and by 'worth' I don't mean money,'' he says. (Mike

MASS-RURAL-INTERNET-1, 1-2 -- The cost of Internet connections

Peter Eagleton, 61, a retired ship broker, sketching the remains of
a diesel tug boat in New York Harbor. ``This harbor holds a whole
century of American maritime architecture and ship types. Once a
ship is finished, it's like a biography,'' says Eagleton. ``She's
been all over the world or the local harbor. To paint one is like

The timeworn pilothouses of a tugboat and a railroad barge are
among the wrecks at the Witte marine salvage yard off Staten
Island. Ships of every description lie in the yard, some rusted so
thoroughly that their iron decks are as thin and weak as old
cardboard. The boats contain no treasure, but to a small group of
maritime historians and archeologists, they represent a trove of
information about the days when New York was the biggest seaport in
the world. (Keith Meyers/New York Times Photo)

   WASHINGTON _ Facing one of the most burdensome New Year's
resolutions in history, the Senate reconvenes this week with eight
new members, a new House of Representatives next door, and,
according to some, a renewed sense of worry over the upcoming trial
to decide whether President Clinton will be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 15 days since the House impeached Clinton. In that
time, no one has suggested the same hard-driving impetus exists in
the Senate, where 67 votes would be necessary to convict, and where
a bipartisan compromise plan to speed up the trial process has been
under examination by Democratic and Republican leaders for the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But neither has Clinton's fate been resolved. From the
logistical questions _ such as when the House will vote to fund the
managers who prosecute the trial _ to the broad questions of
whether the trial must be conducted in full, few in the Senate are
equipped with answers, or even solid predictions, about how the new
political season will unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of unknowns,'' said Richard
Fenno, a political science professor at the University of
Rochester. ``Basically, you've got a lot of inexperience
confronting a very bizarre and unique situation. There are as many
computations and permutations as one could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many unknown factors, including what strategy the White
House will pursue, the only certainty is that a campaign of
lobbying and public opinion-swapping will unfold Sunday and in the
days to follow, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   During the holidays, with senators relying on news reports and
scattered phone conversations to determine where others stand, no
one has truly been able to gauge the potential for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   According to two Democratic Senate aides, who declined to be
identified, both parties plan to meet behind closed doors in the
Capitol Wednesday morning to air their views on the bipartisan plan
for a speedy trial, which was co-designed by Democratic Senator
Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Republican Senator Slade
Gorton of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the Senate could be summoning Supreme Court Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist to be sworn in to preside over the
proceedings. And by Jan. 11, some form of a trial could be ready to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothetical scenarios have been floated since the days before
Christmas, prompting varying responses on both sides, including
last-minute New Year's Eve objections and dozens of
senator-to-senator phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Lieberman-Gorton plan, which has been floated by
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi with the support
of Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, the whole
process could take less than two weeks. The Senate would hold what
amounts to a preliminary court hearing, listening to abbreviated
evidence, but no witness testimony, before voting on whether to
hold a trial at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under this proposal, a full-blown trial would proceed only if 67
senators voted for it. If there were not enough support, the trial
proceedings would stop, and the Senate would start considering
whether to censure Clinton instead.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, designed to placate members who see no point in
dragging out a trial in which conviction is out of the question,
has received unified support from Democratic senators, the two
aides said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But it has come under attack from conservative senators, who
believe the Constitution mandates a full hearing of all the
evidence against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio, objected to the
shortcut, warning that ``denied the closure of a trial . . .
censure would not end the civic ugliness in which we are currently
mired.'' Others, including New Hampshire Senator Robert C. Smith,
have also forsworn any form of censure, saying a trial is equipped
to determine guilt or innocence, not anything in between.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Clinton's tenure in office seemingly secured, the
fates of senators on both sides, particularly that of Lott, are
especially delicate as they begin to navigate the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a House speaker and a speaker-designate have become
casualties of the congressional impeachment proceedings. According
to Fenno, whether Lott is in danger of following in the path of
Representatives Newt Gingrich and Robert Livingston will be
determined by his ability to ``work across the aisle, to do
something bipartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to another Senate Democratic aide, Lott's
challenge, compromising with his conservative flank and the
Democrats, could threaten his own career.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of senators publicly committed to raising
roadblocks is relatively small, there are ``people in both parties
who are not afraid to mix it up,'' the aide said, adding: ``And
Lott has seen what that's done to the House. I don't think he wants
that in the Senate, because he doesn't want to destroy himself.''

COACHES GET SIMILAR RESULTS WITH DIFFERENT STYLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  TEMPE, Ariz. _ The coaches stepped up on temporary podiums set up
in Sun Devil Stadium at Fiesta Bowl media day last week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida State's Bobby Bowden told stories. Lots of stories.
Funny stories. Old stories that had been recycled. New stories
tailored for the occasion. Football? Oh sure, that was part of it.
But it wasn't really necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Phil Fulmer talked about football. He talked about
defenses. He talked about special teams. Gradually the crowd of
reporters faded away, blitzed no doubt by the unrelenting package
of Xs and Os.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a question was asked about the difference between the
folksy Bowden and the no-nonsense Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into a story-telling contest with
Bobby,'' said Fulmer with a smile. ``But that does not have
anything to do with the ballgame, does it?''
</P>
<P>
   No it doesn't. When the Fiesta Bowl finally is played Monday
night between No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida State, either
Bowden will walk away with his second national championship in six
seasons or Fulmer will trot away with his first.
</P>
<P>
   How they tell stories doesn't matter, but both have stories to
tell, stories that are about success, hard work, and overcoming
obstacles that would, and have, stopped other coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   He grew in Winchester, Tenn., watching football. Particularly
college football, and, of course, Tennessee football. ``Someday,''
Phil Fulmer told his mother, ``that will be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Fulmer thought that was nice. Her son wanted to be a
football player. ``No,'' said Phil Fulmer, pointing to the sideline
and the coaches walking with headsets. ``That's what I'm going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Fulmer did the football thing for a while. He was a star in
high school and became a captain at Tennessee before moving on to
his boyhood ambition: coaching.
</P>
<P>
   At 48, he's near the top of his profession. Still, it seems,
until this season at least, he has done it in a vacuum. Even last
week he did his business with little fanfare. At media day, as
Tennessee began an hour-long interview session, a Fiesta Bowl
volunteer asked, ``Which one is Fulmer?''
</P>
<P>
   How is this possible? The man has been in the Top 10 the past
four seasons and has the best winning percentage among active
coaches in Division 1-A (.857).
</P>
<P>
   Not winning the SEC East was a problem. Not beating Florida was
another criticism that kept haunting him. This season, the
Volunteers took care of both.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Fulmer is Coach of the Year. He's smarter. Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it,'' said Fulmer, when asked about the
perception of him. ``I don't read the papers. I don't listen to the
talk shows. I get around friends who I can tell to shut up if I
need to.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not lessen the intensity he feels. He's one of those
dawn-to-dawn coaches who spends more hours in his office during the
season than he does at home.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has a sense of family values. On Wednesdays and
Thursdays, he comes home in the early evening and spends time with
his wife, Vicky, and daughters Courtney, Brittany, and Allison.
``We do family things,'' he said. ``If my daughters have something
going on at school on those nights, I can see them. It's important.
Of course, after dinner, I might get on the phone and make some
recruiting calls.''
</P>
<P>
   All of it has helped in making Fulmer more than just someone who
took over for long-time Volunteers coach Johnny Majors in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's his own coach. Since taking over his alma mater, he's
won 66 of 77 games. He can go into any living room in the country
and talk about Tennessee football and people will listen. His
latest coup was getting a verbal commitment from blue chip
quarterback Chris Simms, the son of former Giants Pro Bowl QB Phil
Simms.
</P>
<P>
   There have been bumps along the road. Not being able to win the
SEC East because of the dominance of Florida under Steve Spurrier
had bothered him. And the rift with his one-time mentor Majors,
caused because Majors felt he was forced out of Tennessee before he
wanted (a situation in which he believed Fulmer may have been a bit
too opportunistic), cause him to tune out any questioner.
</P>
<P>
   But he also is getting some credit for what he is doing. Fulmer
says he has learned on the job. ``I hope I'm getting better at
seeing the big picture,'' he says. ``You learn a lot as you go
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden listened to the question with a grin and a nod of
the head, knowing it was coming. ``Bobby, you're 69. If you beat
Tennessee, will you think about retiring?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said. ``What would I do? Stay home and pull weeds.
As long as I've got my good health, I'll still coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has been coaching in some capacity since he came out of
Samford University in 1953. He has seen fire and rain and times
when he couldn't find a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still loves it. Still likes the roar of the crowd, the
feeling he gets on game days. Sure, he's more of a CEO than a
hands-on coach these days, taking naps in the afternoons and
letting his coordinators put in game plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean he's not involved,'' said offensive
coordinator Mark Richt. ``He watches what we do. He goes around,
takes notes, and then at staff meetings he'll go over things he
sees that bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden even will call some plays, although Richt said he has
learned to distinguish between requests and suggestions. ``I say,
`Coach, are you suggesting we do this or are you saying that's what
you want?''' said Richt.
</P>
<P>
   Richt said most of the ``suggestions'' come when the Seminoles
are near the goal line. ``He likes to call touchdowns,'' said Richt
with laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden's success is unquestioned. He has 292 career victories,
12 consecutive years of 10-win seasons, of Top 5 finishes in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The success has set the bar of expectations high, with some
people grumbling that the Seminoles have won only one national
championship. ``A lot of people are thinking, `Golly, they have
been at least No. 4 in the nation the last 11 years and haven't won
but one national championship,''' said Bowden. ``That doesn't
bother me one bit. I can keep my job if I stay No. 4. I'm scared to
try No. 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has changed with the times. When he first started he was
more general than grandfather, more inclined to get in people's
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year of coaching was back in '53,'' Bowden said.
``Back then you didn't explain. You said, `Go do it.' If a player
asked why, you said, `Get out of here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you need to tell players why you are doing things and why
it will benefit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the first national championship in 1993 released some of
the pressure that had been building. ``It was a feeling of relief
more than anything,'' Bowden said. ``It was, `Thank goodness. I
finally got that off my back.' Now they say, `How about No. 2?'''
</P>
<P>
   Football has been what Bobby Bowden does. Three of his four sons
have joined the profession. Tommy is the new coach at Clemson,
having taken Tulane to an unbeaten regular season before switching
to the Tigers. Terry coached at Auburn before resigning in the
middle of this season. Jeff is an assistant on Bobby's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our life,'' said Jeff Bowden, who also says Bobby
has softened over the years. ``When he first started, players would
fear him,'' he said. ``He has mellowed out. The kids have not seen
a side of him the way he was 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Bobby Bowden was one of those hot-shot young
coaches, looking around for a place to build a reputation. He began
building it at West Virginia, where he was 42-26, but they still
hung him in effigy. He came to Florida State in 1976 and began
building again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever I've coached, I've been an underdog,'' Bowden was
saying. ``At West Virginia I was always in the shadow of Penn State
and Pitt. At Florida State it was Florida, Alabama, and Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bowden nor Phil Fulmer is in the shadows any longer, nor
is either an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, come Monday night, one of these two good ol' boys from
the South is fixing to become Top Dog.

DOLPHINS DROP BILLS IN WILD CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The pulverized bits of Flutie Flakes littered the carpet
of the Dolphins' locker room at Pro Player Stadium like a freshly
fallen layer of New Year's confetti. It was a remnant of the
raucous celebration _ with Miami coach Jimmy Johnson supplying the
cereal _ that the Dolphins enjoyed after a stirring 24-17 victory
over the Bills in their AFC wild-card game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, after surviving a palpitating finish, J.J. wanted his
Dolphins to savor the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 seconds left and Buffalo just 5 yards from scoring a
game-tying touchdown, Miami veteran defensive end Trace Armstrong
sacked Doug Flutie for a 3-yard loss that caused the quarterback to
fumble, Buffalo's fifth and final turnover. Shane Burton fell on
the loose ball, as everyone on Miami's bench exhaled a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him with the ball and it was just milliseconds,
definitely,'' said Armstrong. ``But you're just straining to get
there and I got the hit on him, and I saw the ball come out, but I
wasn't sure how they were going to rule it _ a forward pass or a
fumble. It was a tough call for those officials to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad, because I don't think I could've gone another
play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that was chock-full of big plays from start (Flutie's
65-yard strike to Eric Moulds that was stripped by Terrell Buckley
and recovered by Brock Marion) to finish (Armstrong's sack that
halted Buffalo's 64-yard stampede to the 5 in 74 seconds), the
difference was a controversial call just inside the two-minute
warning that led to the ejection of Bills wideout Andre Reed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bills drove for a touchdown that would've pulled them
within a field goal, Reed made an apparent 10-yard TD catch,
writhing out of the grasp of safety Brian Walker to lunge for the
goal line. When the officials did not signal a touchdown, Reed
sprang to his feet and bumped into field judge Steve Zimmer, who
had rushed in to spot the ball at the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was given the heave-ho, and the Bills were hit with an
unsportsmanlike penalty that backed them up to the 15, from where
they were forced to settle for Steve Christie's 33-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnovers cost us,'' said Flutie, who outgunned Miami QB Dan
Marino by completing 21 of 36 for 360 yards and 1 touchdown,
compared with Marino's 235 yards and 1 TD (23 for 35). ``But I
still think Andre was in the end zone. You don't take a touchdown
away from the team when they are in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reed, ``I didn't go up and push him for any reason. Like I
said, man, I didn't know I was thrown out of the game until he went
like this,'' _ he gestured with his thumb out. ``I have never been
thrown out of a game for any reason. I don't get upset like that
for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins had plenty of reasons to be upset with themselves,
especially after they failed to capitalize on a pair of red-zone
opportunities early in the first half and had to settle for field
goals of 31 and 40 yards by Olindo Mare to take a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Mare kept the Bills in it when he muffed an onside-kick
attempt, giving Buffalo great field position at the Miami 42. Three
plays later, Thurman Thomas capitalized with a 1-yard TD that gave
Buffalo a 7-6 lead with 8:54 left.
</P>
<P>
   Mare then missed giving Miami a 2-point lead at intermission
when his 26-yard chip shot bounced off the right upright.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, who talked all week of establishing the run to
create more of a balanced offense, did precisely that in the second
half, pounding the ball on an impressive 12-play, 52-yard drive
that ended on Karim Abdul-Jabbar's 3-yard burst up the middle.
Stanley Pritchett scored from the same distance on the 2-point
conversion to make it 14-7, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Dolphins rushed 34 times for 117 yards, with Jabbar
(27 carries, 95 yards) doing the bulk of the work. It was the best
playoff rushing effort by a Miami back in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie hit Moulds (9 catches, an NFL postseason-record 240
yards) on a 32-yard strike with 48 seconds left in the third to
even the score at 14. Miami appeared to salt it away in the fourth
when Mare connected on a 23-yard field goal, and Marino found Lamar
Thomas with an 11-yard TD that gave the Dolphins a 24-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, who had engaged Miami's defensive backs by suggesting
earlier in the week that ``it was important for officials to pull
their flags out if they start tugging and pulling, as usual,''
rallied the Bills on a comeback that conjured up collegiate
memories of his Miracle in Miami in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I wasn't thinking about that,'' snorted Johnson, when
asked if he thought about Boston College's 47-45 victory over his
former Miami Hurricane team. ``This is professional football.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Marino of the Pro Bowl-bound Flutie, ``He's had an
incredible year and he's got a big heart and he's got a lot of
experience, and you can tell. In these situations, you've got to
have quarterbacks with experience if you want to win games.
Obviously, it showed today because he brought his team within a
touchdown of tying it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, he came up short _ by 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Madison had promised that, if given the
opportunity to get Flutie on the ground, he would stuff some Flutie
Flakes down his throat. Armstrong did the honors by flattening
Flutie, but Madison and his teammates alternately danced and
stomped on the box afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, that's definitely what it is,'' Madison confirmed,
breaking into a wide smile. ``I ate a little bit _ then I spit it
all out.''

BOSELLI ALWAYS READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Tony Boselli sits by his locker, willing
to take on all comers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksonville offensive tackle listens to all questions,
answers all questions, and usually in an insightful manner. Even
when a media member asks about the spotlight that is on him in all
games, a spotlight not often reserved for an offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you like it when they always have a camera
isolated on you,'' Boselli is asked, ``and they're looking to see
how you're doing against John Randle, Bruce Smith, Jason Taylor and
...''
</P>
<P>
   ``... and all those guys,'' Boselli replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   All those guys.
</P>
<P>
   All those huge defensive linemen or linebackers, usually the
best defensive lineman, all intent on scorching past Boselli to
wreak havoc on the Jaguars' quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' Boselli says.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Ever since Boselli devastated Buffalo's Bruce Smith
in Jacksonville's first-ever playoff game (a victory) two years
ago, and when he was first noticed by the football throngs beyond
the banks of the St. Johns River here, the spotlight has been on
him every game. The warfare between the offensive and defensive
lines in football always is mano-a-mano but this is so different;
this is television mano-a-mano and so the hype only grows and
grows.
</P>
<P>
   Not since John Hannah played for the Patriots has an offensive
lineman garnered so much TV time, but even that was in a more
subdued era. Now, TV is in excess mode, so it shows Tony Boselli
against The World.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like going against the best,'' Boselli says. All players do,
but Boselli truly believes it, and often proves it, as he will try
to do this afternoon when he goes against the Patriots and Willie
McGinest, his former teammate at Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I know Willie's moves from all the time we
practiced together in college,'' said Boselli. ``And I know Willie
is very good. I know that personally. But the other thing is I'm
not going to be going only against Willie all the time _ they move
him around _ and the other guys the Patriots have, Chris Slade and
(Ferric) Collons and all of them, they're very good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boselli can be a gentleman football player, too, taking
pains to note that this Willie McGinest who will show up Sunday is
not the same Willie McGinest he played against last season or two
years ago in the AFC Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie is a great pass rusher and a great defensive end when
he's 100 percent,'' said Boselli. ``I know he's nicked up now but I
also know him, that he'll turn it up and that he's the type of guy
who'll be huge in the playoffs. Willie's a guy you definitely have
to watch out for, to be aware of him at all times to make sure you
block him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boselli did not devastate McGinest in any of the three games
they have played against each other and, indeed, McGinest may have
gotten the better of Boselli in the AFC title game two seasons ago.
Only partisans of the Jaguars or Patriots would argue that either
was dominant; a standoff might be the best description. Of course,
when playing against Boselli, a standoff can be considered a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie's pass rush is improved from college,'' said Boselli,
``in that he's able to do it a lot, but Willie has always been a
very athletic and physical player. He's a guy who likes to play
football and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As does Boselli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football'' fans can remember Boselli pointing at
Taylor, Miami's very quick defensive lineman, after Jacksonville
had made a big play, pointing at Taylor to get downfield and into
position so Boselli could get after him again. Boselli not only
taunted Taylor but embarrassed him on the field. Just as he had
done to the Chiefs' Derrick Thomas and many others.
</P>
<P>
   And Jaguar fans can recall how Boselli chased after Cincinnati's
Artrell Hawkins, who had recovered a fumble and was running toward
the goal line. But Boselli chased down Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen 330 pounds move that fast,'' said Jacksonville
quarterback Mark Brunell. ``What can I say? It saved a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, it must be noted, is a cornerback and, said Jaguars
coach Tom Coughlin, ``You're looking at a legitimate corner in the
league who had the opportunity to go all the way. Tony really
showed his athleticism and quickness and made the tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   So Boselli deserves the attention he receives, and his role will
be huge Sunday as he and his linemates may bear the burden of the
Jacksonville offense with Brunell less than 100 percent. The line
will have to open holes for running back Fred Taylor and, in
passing situations, keep McGinest and pals away from the
qurterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things get built up in the media,'' said Boselli, ``and
everyone wants to try their hand. If a guy beats me, hats off to
him. But if he beats me because I've done something mentally or
physically stupid, that's what bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   So pay close attention to Boselli and McGinest Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie is a good, good defensive end,'' said Boselli, ``a guy
you have to block. You have to know where Willie is at all times
because he can cause problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And the very same words can be said of Tony Boselli.

LEAFING THROUGH THE HISTORY BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the minds of Bruins fans, the closing of Maple Leaf Gardens
doesn't rank with the cathartic demise of the Montreal Forum (crank
to full volume here on the Hallelujah Chorus), but on Saturday
night, the Bruins will take their last skate in the historic
Toronto barn.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins and Leafs, two of the NHL's Original Six, will play
out their future matches in the Air Canada Centre, leaving in
darkness yet one more of the old, huggable, august buildings that
were once as much a part of the league's fabric as horsehair goalie
pads.
</P>
<P>
   Oh say, can I still hear the national anthem resonating, the
organ churning, in Chicago Stadium? Please, book me a seat on that
time machine and dial back the calendar, oh, I don't care, 10 years
will suffice. No hockey setting in the world could surpass the
stage that was the Stadium, especially the first five minutes of
play that dovetailed out of the emotional high of the anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the '90s we've witnessed the closing of Boston Garden,
Chicago Stadium, the Forum and now the Gardens. True, the game
isn't about girders. But so much history surrendered so fast, so
many memories cashiered in the name of luxury suites and
mega-mess-ageboards, leaves a thumb print of abandonment and sad,
sad loss.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vivid Bruins-Leafs memory for Boston fans is
the spring of '69 when Boston wiped out Toronto in a four-game
playoff bloodbath. The Bruins opened the series with their first
postseason victory in 10 years, a humiliating 10-0 pounding on
Causeway Street, followed the next night by a 7-0 hammering.
</P>
<P>
   Who could forget the pulverizing elbow Leafs defenseman Pat
Quinn KO'd Bobby Orr with in Game 1? Toronto's Forbes Kennedy, an
ex-Bruin tough guy, fought everything but the Zamboni, battling
first with Gerry Cheevers and eventually being beaten into
submission by Johnny McKenzie. Before he exited, the crazed Kennedy
even felled linesman George Ashley with a menacing left hand.
Imagine how that would play today in front of league disciplinarian
Colin ``Collar 'em'' Campbell. Fire up the electric chair. (It
turned out to be the 34-year-old Kennedy's last NHL game, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   After a day off, the series moved to the Gardens, where the
Bruins delivered 4-3 and 3-2 knockout punches on successive nights.
It took 11 years, a few buckets of blood, and a trip to 60 Carlton
Street, but the Bruins made it to Round 2 of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' most humiliating night in the Gardens came some
seven years later, Feb. 7, 1976, when Darryl Sittler torched them
for a record-setting 10 points (6 goals, 4 assists) in an
embarrassing 11-4 loss. Former University of Vermont netminder Dave
Reece suffered the beating between the pipes. Toronto lore has it
that Reece was being showcased for a potential trade that night.
There would be no trade. It was the last NHL game Reece would play.

   Former Bruins coach  &UR; Brian Sutter  &LR; brings his Flames into town
Monday night. Calgary has struggled of late, mostly because of a
lengthy list of injuries to its goalies _  &UR; Ken Wregget  &LR; (back),
 &UR; Tyler Moss  &LR; (groin), and  &UR; Jean-Sebastien Giguere  &LR; (hamstring). The
Flames were forced to bring back  &UR; Andrei Trefilov  &LR; as a stopgap,
but it looks like lean times until Wregget gets back in shape. The
subplot still to be worked out: what to do with  &UR; Theo Fleury &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
becomes a free agent July 1. Right now, he's due about $6 million a
year _ more than double his 1998-99 salary. Calgary is a small
market, much like Buffalo, and prudent economics would dictate a
deal that brings younger, cheaper talent. But even Buffalo forked
over the big money for one superstar,  &UR; Dominik Hasek &LR; , who will
collect a minimum of $23.5 million over three years, and if Fleury
is gone, the Saddledome could look like Greensboro West ... When
Sabres owner  &UR; John Rigas  &LR; popped Hasek and wife aboard a private
jet for a trip to the Mayo Clinic (Hasek's wife needed back
surgery), the 74-year-old cable-TV mogul jumped aboard for the
ride. Fully in the spirit of things, Rigas also underwent an
angioplasty while at the Minnesota hospital. Synergy, what every
club owner is looking for here at the dawn of the next millennium,
right? ... OK, I'm ready; when is  &UR; Dmitri Kvartalnov  &LR; coming back?
... First goal scored at Maple Leaf Gardens by a Montreal Canadien:
 &UR; Aurel Joliat &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Nov. 14, 1931. Last goal scored there by a member
of the Habs:  &UR; Stephane Quintal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Dec. 26, 1998. Joliat made it to
the Hall of Fame. Quintal's enshrinement is, well, shall we say,
pending? ``But I'll always be a very good trivia answer,'' he said
... Edmonton's  &UR; Doug Weight &LR; , &UR;  &LR; when asked by Canadian television
what books he's read recently, said he prefers fiction, but never
seems able to get past the first seven chapters of whatever he's
reading. When the team flight ends, the book gets closed. ``I've
got some books I started eight years ago,'' said Weight. ``I can't
wait to see how they end when my career's over.'' ... The recent
hire of  &UR; Jacques Lemaire  &LR; in Montreal buys some time with the fans
for club president  &UR; Ron Corey  &LR; and GM  &UR; Rejean Houle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but
ultimately Lemaire will replace Houle _ perhaps even before the end
of the season. Lemaire can tell talent, but at times underestimated
it during his days as Devils coach (witness the revived  &UR; Bobby
Holik  &LR; at Exit 16W). The single most important thing a front office
must be able to do is tell who can play and who can't (Wheat From
Chaff 101). Once the money men in Montreal figure that out, Lemaire
will get his chance to call all the shots ... Ex-Bruin  &UR; Andy Moog
 &LR; said in this space a few weeks back that he'd like to be a
goaltending consultant for an NHL club, just the job  &UR; Reggie
Lemelin  &LR; has with the Flyers. In case you missed it, Moog landed
the job with Atlanta last week, which means he will be front and
center at the Fleet June 25 when the Thrashers make their
selections in the expansion draft ... The Bruins ended 1998 with
four losses in five games, their only victory coming over the
Nashville Neophytes. Unless something happens to solidify a second
line _ i.e.  &UR; Joe Thornton  &LR; takes control, one of the Baby B's grows
up, or a trade is made _ you're going to see some more stretches of
.200 hockey. Until there's a real threat presented by a second
line, other teams' two or three best checkers most nights can
handle  &UR; Sergei Samsonov &LR; , &UR; Dmitri Khristich &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Jason Allison &LR; 
... Florida coach  &UR; Terry Murray  &LR; on defenseman  &UR; Ed Jovanovski &LR; :
``He's in his fourth year in the league now. Once you get in your
third year, you have to start getting better.'' And the point is,
Jova-novski leveled off early in his second year, which is why
you're going to hear his name in more trade rumors from now until
the March 23 deadline ... Ottawa GM  &UR; Rick Dudley  &LR; figures goal
scoring could be helped by increasing the net size by about 10
percent, from 24 to 26.388 square feet, adding 4 inches to the
width and 2 inches to the height. ``They've tried everything
else,'' said Dudley. A better idea: Leave the net alone but don't
allow penalized teams to clear the puck during man-short
situations, and have players serve the full two minutes of
penalties even if the other team scores ... In Pittsburgh, where
money is a problem these days, this greeting was on the Igloo
messageboard: ``Hope your holiday spending hasn't left you, shall
we say, bankrupt.''
</P>

   The cracked rib  &UR; Keith Tkachuk  &LR; suffered last week vs. Los
Angeles will keep him out at least three weeks. ``I was hit in the
exact same spot last year,'' said the Phoe-nix power forward. ``I
knew it right away.'' This time, Tkachuk wants to come back when
the crack is mended, which means he won't be pulling on one of
those flak jackets. Fellow Bostonian  &UR; Jeremy Roenick &LR; , &UR;  &LR; sidelined
by a concussion, should be out of the Phoenix lineup at least
through this week ...  &UR; Paul Kariya's  &LR; $8.5 million-a-year contract
in Anaheim is up at the end of the season. Where does that bidding
begin? The guess here: eight years, $100 million. And when that
deal's done, he'll be 32 years old, an unrestricted free agent
finally able to make real money ... The closest anyone has come to
Sittler's record since '76:  &UR; Tom Bladon  &LR; (Philadelphia),  &UR; Bryan
Trottier  &LR; (Islanders),  &UR; Peter Stastny  &LR; (Quebec),  &UR; Anton Stastny
 &LR; (Quebec),  &UR; Wayne Gretzky  &LR; (Edmonton),  &UR; Paul Coffey  &LR; (Edmonton),
 &UR; Mario Lemieux  &LR; (Pittsburgh), and  &UR; Bernie Nicholls  &LR; (Los Angeles)
all had 8-point games. Gretzky and Lemieux, in fact, twice tallied
8 points in a game. No one in NHL history has finished a game with
9 points ... Nice touch by Devils coach  &UR; Robbie Ftorek &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who makes
a point of personally handing the players their paychecks every two
weeks. Playing postman didn't do much for  &UR; Kevin Costner's  &LR; career,
but something's working for Ftorek, and maybe there is some
accountability built when the boss literally hands you the dough
... One theory around Pittsburgh has it that Lemieux will end up
owning part of the team, but not in a partnership with  &UR; Roger
Marino  &LR; (The two weren't exactly seen clinking champagne glasses
Thursday night). Interesting scenario, because Mario Magnifique
then would be the owner in charge of paying himself the millions he
is due in deferred money. Hey, if nothing else, maybe Fox can make
a 13-week sitcom out of it ...  &UR; Stephane Richer  &LR; says his
surgically repaired ankle is still hurting. Lightning doctors say
they can't figure it. It's reminiscent, says Lightning GM/coach
 &UR; Jacques Demers &LR; , &UR;  &LR; of injury episodes Richer lived through in
Montreal and New Jersey. Translation: a huge lack of trust between
the parties. Richer has some $5 million coming his way over the
next 2 1/2 years. The Bruins owe  &UR; Jim Carey  &LR; approximately another
$4 million through next season. Anyone else out there see some swap
possibilities? It appears the only value the Bruins see in Carey
right now is that he is a goalie they can expose in the expansion
draft, but no one wants to touch him at that price ... Two of the
reasons the Red Wings are faltering a bit:  &UR; Uwe Krupp's  &LR; bad back
and  &UR; Jamie Macoun's  &LR; rotator cuff injury. That's why the Winged
Wheels went out and picked up 33-year-old  &UR; Todd Gill  &LR; off waivers
from St. Louis ... Tampa Bay center  &UR; Chris Gratton  &LR; said he didn't
spit on referee  &UR; Paul Stewart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but concedes maybe he ``sprayed''
him during an on-ice fracas. Sounds almost Clintonesque (well, it
depends what your definition of spit is). Collar-'em Campbell's
definition was a three-game suspension ... The Avalanche still
can't settle the nickels and dimes with holdout defenseman  &UR; Sandis
Ozolinsh &LR; . Until they do, the Colorado power play isn't going
anywhere, and their playoff hopes are headed in the same direction
... Look for the NHL not to have any of its clubs in the air Dec.
31, 1999, or the next day, because of the anticipated Year 2000
computer meltdown. The schedule-maker might slate games that night,
but only if destinations can be reached via ground transportation
... Phoenix defenseman  &UR; Oleg Tverdovsky  &LR; (once billed as the
Russian Bobby Orr) needled some of his teammates recently when they
griped about the lack of hot water in the club's hotel in Detroit.
The former Soviet Wing went without hot water for a whole year when
he played at the Sports Academy in Moscow. ``And it snowed in the
room and on the bed,'' said Tverdovsky. Must have been murder on
the Godiva chocolates the maid left every night.

GAME PLAN: A MATTER OF FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ If there are as many mixed signals in
Sunday's game plan as there have been about Pete Carroll's future
with the Patriots, there might not be any future for the team this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots coach and owner Robert Kraft had a long phone
conversation Friday in which they discussed the recent report that
Carroll had to win Sunday's wild-card game against the Jaguars to
retain his job.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Carroll nor the Krafts were happy to see stories of the
coach's possible ouster on the eve of their playoff opener, which
the Patriots go into without Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn on
offense and Ted Johnson and Todd Collins on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very consistent in our comments throughout this
season,'' said Patriots vice president Jonathan Kraft, who denied
that Carroll's future will be decided by Sunday's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said that everyone gets evaluated at the end of the
season. How can you make an evaluation on anything before the
season is even over? Pete has done a lot of good things and he's
had to overcome a lot this year. I like Pete Carroll very much and
it bothers me that this is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be Robert Kraft who makes the decisions on the team at
the end of the year and nobody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts' policy has been not to discuss Carroll's future.
Repeatedly, Robert Kraft has been asked by national and local
outlets whether Carroll would be his coach next season and each
time he has shied away from a direct answer.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft said Saturday that the team's policy is not to
issue votes of confidence because if they did, then the public
would expect one every year. Red Sox CEO John Harrington began a
practice of issuing them to his managers over the years, but they
became a kiss of death as managers were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kraft also clarified reports that his father angrily
dashed into Carroll's office after the loss to the Jets a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert just went in to shake his hand, wish him a Happy New
Year, and caught a plane back to Puerto Rico where we were
vacationing,'' said Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll attempted to distance himself from the stories this past
week, but there's no doubt they have created tension. For the past
several weeks, Carroll had been discussing future personnel moves
and other team-related matters with Kraft, which is an indication
that he is staying around.
</P>
<P>
   But some comments by a few veteran players have been damaging to
the coach, and even if those players are in the minority, every bad
word has an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Patriots head into Sunday's game with a sense of
bonding and purpose after the embarrassment of the 31-10 loss in
the regular-season finale. Veteran players have tried to rally the
troops toward a common goal. Two weeks ago, the Patriots responded
well after a horrible showing against the Rams _ a loss that seems
as responsible as last week's for Carroll's current predicament _
with a big win against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   It is that rebound that gives Carroll and the team hope, for the
Jaguars are not the Jets (and they may not even be the 49ers). New
England is 3-0 all-time against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat Jacksonville,'' Bledsoe said this past week.
``There are matchups we can definitely exploit and that we have in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have pretty much kept the same personnel over the
past couple of years, though rookie Fred Taylor has made all the
difference in the running game this season and taken considerable
pressure off quarterback Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   There are two key names for the Patriots Sunday: Robert Edwards
and Willie McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars' defense knows that if they shut down Edwards,
they've shut down the Patriots' offense for the day. And if
McGinest can't get after Brunell by fighting off tackle Tony
Boselli, then Brunell, though limited in mobility by a sore left
ankle, could pick apart the Patriots as a pocket passer.

CARROLL MUST TAKE CHARGE OR TAKE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ I am conflicted this morning as the sun
rises over the sawgrass, for this is no place for a head coach to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Not here, among the swamps and the mosquitos and the golf
courses. But, frankly, that is what Pete Carroll faces Sunday. If
his team plays as it did a week ago at the Meadowlands and loses
badly to the Jaguars, he loses more than a game. He loses the keys
to his Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   If Pete's Patriots lie down, he is finished and deservedly so,
injuries or no injuries, because what happened last week against
the Jets cannot be tolerated. If it is repeated, no explanation
will be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not lie down, however, Carroll will likely survive to
coach another day in New England unless being forced to move to
Hartford has taken away all sense of fairness from team owner Bob
Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's track record _ two straight playoff appearances and a
19-13 won-lost mark _ cries out for another chance because of the
massive injuries his team has been forced to cope with the past two
years and because his mandate is to reach the playoffs and he has
fulfilled it. Yet doubts about his approach persist, fueled more by
his players' reaction to him than anything external.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense of chaos in his locker room and on the
sideline, and not simply among a few isolated veterans as some
observers of the scene wanted you to believe this past week (was
rookie fullback Chris Floyd heard cursing out his coaches last
weekend on the sideline in New York, as someone whispered?).
</P>
<P>
   Doubt about Carroll is loose in his locker room, not just
lurking in the corners of a few players' minds. It is widespread
and growing, and it is in the minds of the Eagle Scouts as well as
those he perceives as malcontents, and he must find a way to stop
it. The only way is to accept what he seems to abhor. The only way
is to become his players' boss and not their favorite uncle.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie McGinest said last week that no one fears coming to
work after a loss, it was a far worse indictment of the Carroll
regime than Chris Slade's generalized talk of being ``outplayed,
outcoached, out-everythinged'' in New York. Yet it was Slade
Carroll chose to confront, not McGinest.
</P>
<P>
   If Carroll doesn't realize that McGinest's words were more
damning, he will never succeed as a head coach. If he does realize
it, then it is time for him to change his mode of operation, and
Kraft would be fair to demand as much.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he has to turn into a tyrant. He doesn't need
to become a svelte version of Bill Parcells, because what works for
Parcells wouldn't work for most coaches, least of all Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll should forget about Parcells. He also should forget
about the 49ers' model he so often talks about because (A) he has
no exemplary superstar veterans like Jerry Rice and Steve Young in
his locker room to lead his young players where their coaches want
them to go and (B) he doesn't seem to understand that the backbone
of the 49er Way was not the light contact at practice. It was quite
the opposite of that and everyone who played there understood it.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the 49er Way, as former club president Carmen
Policy once described it to me, was, ``You win here or you die.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no tolerance for failure in San Francisco. No
tolerance for those who did not prepare to win.
</P>
<P>
   That's why even Charles Haley was eventually run out of there;
he became more trouble than he was worth even though he was still
one of the greatest pass rushers in the game, as he went on to
prove in Dallas. Compare that with Carroll's decision to start
Chris Canty at cornerback four days after Canty was busted while
asleep in a parking lot for having an open container of alcohol in
his car _ at 2:20 a.m., six hours before he was to have been at the
stadium for a special teams meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Did Carroll need to come out the next day and rant and rave
about Canty to the media? No. Did he need to belittle him, as
Parcells surely would have? Absolutely not. What he needed to do
was show Canty and everyone else on his team who controls access to
the field and how quickly it can be denied. He did not, and that
irked many of his players and worried others.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll didn't need to make Canty disappear. He did need to
discipline him by denying him what a player wants most _ a start.
When asked about this a week later, Carroll said, ``We've got
injuries everywhere. What am I supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   What you're supposed to do is run the place, and that means
making lonely decisions and unpopular ones. It demands that you
spend more time alone than with anyone else, particularly your
footsoldiers. They are not the coach's friends, as the Patriots
proved once again with the debacle in the Meadowlands. If you are
the leader, they are your enemy, whether they mean to be or not,
because few of them want to do what is required for victory. Few of
them want to sacrifice themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That is human nature, and the leader must understand that. Being
a leader demands that you play mind games with players, as Bill
Walsh did for so many seasons with one of the greatest quarterbacks
of all time, Joe Montana, and as Parcells does and Mike Shanahan
does and Mike Holmgren does and Jimmy Johnson does and all the best
of them do.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do it the 49er Way, then do it the 49er Way. But
remember this. There was a lot more to the 49er Way than brie and
chablis. There was always, always, The Threat. The coaches felt it
from the owner and the players felt it from first Walsh and then
George Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win or you die.''
</P>
<P>
   They felt it the same way Parcells made the Giants and then the
Patriots and now the Jets feel it, although his outward method was
different. Nobody feels that way in Foxborough now.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft has come to the opinion Carroll cannot or will not do
what he needs to do, then the owner has no choice but to act
because to delay only puts his team's future in further jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But this cannot be a decision based on the humiliation Kraft and
his family felt a week ago at the Meadowlands when their Great
Satan, Parcells, destroyed their team again. It cannot be a
decision based on ``I thought we'd be better than this,'' because
the fact is without all of the injuries, they probably would be
better.
</P>
<P>
   A change should only be made if Kraft believes he is hiring
someone better than the coach he has. If he can hire Bill Belichick
away from the Jets, fine. That is addition by subtraction, because
Parcells has never done as well without Belichick on his staff as
he's done with him.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft believes one of the hot young assistants like
Minnesota's Brian Billick or Pittsburgh's Jim Haslett, or fired
former Coaches of the Year Ray Rhodes or Dom Capers are better,
then he is justified in making a move.
</P>
<P>
   But if he believes Carroll can realize his deficiencies in
leadership before it's too late and change them, then Carroll
deserves another year because he is correct when he says over and
over, ``There's more than one way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more than one way to coach a team in the NFL. But there
is only one way to control a locker room, and that's for everyone
in it to understand who is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   If you are, don't change the schedule during the week after it's
been announced.
</P>
<P>
   If you are, don't show up late when you tell your players to be
on time.
</P>
<P>
   If you are, make your decisions quickly and then live with the
consequences, and that includes decisions made on the sideline,
because having too many men on the field (or too few) is the
coach's fault. That penalty is a galling insult to a coach and it
has happened far too many times during the Carroll regime to be an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in charge, don't listen to what your players say to
you, watch what they do for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in charge, be less understanding and more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, do not let them lie down on you Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you want to be back Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Now that another regular season has come to an end, it's time to
pick an All-Pro team. Here is the way the ballot that came to this
address was filled out:
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACK:  &UR; Randall Cunningham &LR; , Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   If you deliver 34 touchdown passes, complete 60 percent of your
throws, lead the league in passing, come off the bench at age 35 to
lead your team to a 15-1 record and you aren't the best
quarterback, you need to try another line of work.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACK:  &UR; Terrell Davis &LR; , Denver.
</P>
<P>
   It is always easy to simply pencil in  &UR; Barry Sanders's  &LR; name and
be done with it, but Davis became only the fourth guy in history to
rush for over 2,000 yards (2,008). Add to that 21 rushing
touchdowns (23 total) and a 5.1-yards-per-carry average that was
topped by nobody in the league, and the case for Davis is
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   FULLBACK:  &UR; Sam Gash &LR; , Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   You ever see this guy block?
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT END:  &UR; Ben Coates &LR; , New England.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a hometown choice until you look at the
facts. He is the most marked man in the Patriots' receiving corps,
especially after Terry Glenn went down. Yet he led the team with 67
receptions and scored six times. Since he also blocks, that's more
than enough. And please don't bring up  &UR; Shannon Sharpe &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is a
wide receiver in a tight end's body.
</P>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVERS:  &UR; Antonio Freeman &LR; , Green Bay, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Randy Moss &LR; ,
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to write in  &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; and whomever, but even
though Rice had 82 catches for 1,157 yards (14.1 yards a catch),
his numbers pale when compared with Moss's and Freeman's. Moss had
10 touchdown catches of 43 yards or longer, scored 17 touchdowns,
and averaged 19 yards per reception. Rookie or no rookie, he
destroyed the league. As for Freeman, he carried the Packers much
of the season, finishing with 14 touchdowns and a league-leading
1,424 yards. If you produce the most yards and more touchdowns than
all but one other receiver, you're one of the best. When you do it
in the mud and ice of Green Bay, you're one of the very best.
</P>
<P>
   TACKLES:  &UR; Tony Boselli &LR; , Jacksonville, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Jonathan Ogden &LR; ,
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Boselli is simply the best young tackle in the game. He can run
block, pass block and trash talk. That about covers it. Ogden is
big, strong, mobile, and may be as good as Boselli, but it's tough
to notice that because his team stinks.
</P>
<P>
   GUARDS:  &UR; Kevin Donnalley &LR; , Miami, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Will Shields &LR; , Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Donnalley was imported to bring a running game to Miami. He
didn't quite pull that off, but only because the guys around him
can't block the way he can. People who get blocked by Shields say
he is still one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER:  &UR; Dermontti Dawson &LR; , Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Some will lobby for the Vikings'  &UR; Jeff Christy  &LR; or maybe the
Jets'  &UR; Kevin Mawae &LR; . Off one season, they may even deserve it. But
until someone proves otherwise to me, Dawson gets the meritorious
service award. Besides, he's still the best anyway.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE ENDS:  &UR; Reggie White &LR; , Green Bay, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Michael
Sinclair &LR; , Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   White's 16 sacks may be as remarkable a feat as any produced
this season after the terrible back problems he faced a year ago.
White nearly retired; now people are begging him to stay, which is
the way to go out. Sinclair not only led the NFL with 16 1/2 sacks
but has 41 1/2 over the past three years, the most in the league.
What more does the Seahawks' designated quarterback killer have to
do?
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE TACKLES:  &UR; Darrell Russell &LR; , Oakland, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Bryant
Young &LR; , San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Russell has gone from rookie bust to sophomore bust-out. His 10
sacks made him a force and his overall play helped the Raider
defensive resurgence in a big way. If you don't think Young is
among the very best interior linemen, you haven't been watching the
49ers struggle without him. By the way, if you pencil in
Minnesota's  &UR; John Randle  &LR; over either of these guys, I can't really
argue with you.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE LINEBACKER:  &UR; Levon Kirkland &LR; , Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He can still do more things better than anyone else playing the
position.
</P>
<P>
   MIDDLE LINEBACKER:  &UR; Ray Lewis &LR; , Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   When you keep leading the league in tackles playing the position
at which you're supposed to lead the league in tackles, doesn't
that end the debate?
</P>
<P>
   OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS:  &UR; Mo Lewis &LR; , NY Jets, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Bill
Romanowski &LR; , Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the spiritual leader of the Jets' defense. He's also
their leading sack man and is second in tackles. Romanowski serves
many roles with the Broncos and is a marked man because so many
opponents hate his take-no-prisoners approach. Yet he covers
downfield, makes big plays, is tough against the run despite a lack
of size, and seems to be around the ball whenever there's a key
moment.
</P>
<P>
   CORNERBACKS:  &UR; Ty Law &LR; , New England, &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Shawn Springs &LR; ,
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Law has been asking for two years to cover the best receivers,
and now he's doing it. He led the league with nine interceptions
and that's a miracle since teams often had no interest in throwing
his way. When they did, he showed why it's a bad idea. Springs
barely noses out Miami's  &UR; Sam Madison &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who had one more
interception than Springs's seven. But Springs brought two back for
scores, which nearly offset the three he gave up.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, when  &UR; Deion Sanders's  &LR; toe heals, he's back at the
head of this list.)
</P>
<P>
   STRONG SAFETY:  &UR; Rodney Harrison &LR; , San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers had the league's best defense, and Harrison was all
over it. He led the team in tackles (which frankly isn't usually a
good sign, he being a safety), and had four sacks and three
interceptions. If there was anything else he could do for them,
they just should have just asked.
</P>
<P>
   FREE SAFETY:  &UR; Sammy Knight &LR; , New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   It's logical to pick Denver's  &UR; Steve Atwater &LR; , but Knight
intercepted six passes, recovered two fumbles, and also scored
twice. Free safeties are supposed to make plays. Tell me who made
more than he did this season.
</P>
<P>
   KICKER:  &UR; Gary Anderson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   When you become the first kicker to go all season without a miss
and you set a record for kickers with 164 points, that just about
rules out anybody else, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   PUNTER:  &UR; Craig Hentrich &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The league's first million-dollar punter showed why he has
earned that distinction. He led the NFL in gross (47.2) and net
yards (39.2).
</P>
<P>
   KICK RETURNER:  &UR; Terry Fair &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He had nearly 1,500 yards in returns, had the best average in
the league at 28 per return, and took two from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   PUNT RETURNER: Sanders, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's  &UR; Jermaine Lewis  &LR; is the consensus choice if you look
at all the All-Pro lists, but Sanders outdid him in every category.
Sanders's toe injury cut his season short, but he returned 24 punts
for a 15.6-yard average and two scores while Lewis didn't even lead
his conference, averaging 12.7 yards a return and scoring twice.
Sanders did more and did it more explosively, sore toe or not.
</P>
<P>
   There also are postseason honors to be voted on:
</P>
<P>
   COACH OF THE YEAR: Parcells, Jets.
</P>
<P>
   He took a team from 1-15 to 12-4 in two years. Shanahan deserves
a lot of credit for keeping the Broncos focused most of the season
coming off a Super Bowl victory, which may be one of the toughest
jobs in football. But nothing is tougher than winning in December
if you coach the Jets, and Parcells did it.
</P>
<P>
   ROOKIE OF THE YEAR:  &UR; Fred Taylor &LR; , Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a misprint. Sure, Moss scored 17 touchdowns, but so
did Taylor and he did it on a far weaker team. Taylor also rushed
for 1,223 yards and was fourth in the AFC in total yards from
scrimmage with 1,644. Moss had the benefit of playing on a team
with a multitude of weapons ( &UR; Cris Carter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Cunningham,  &UR; Robert
Smith &LR; , &UR; Jake Reed &LR; ), so he was not the center of attention,
especially early in the season. Taylor was, especially once the
Jaguars were hit by injuries. Think what Taylor's numbers might
have been had he been starting all season.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR: Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He carried the Broncos the way  &UR; John Elway  &LR; used to, even when
defenses were massed to stop him. It's difficult to ignore
Atlanta's  &UR; Jamal Anderson  &LR; because without his 1,846 yards and 14
rushing touchdowns  &UR; Dan Reeves  &LR; might have had chest pains a lot
sooner than he did in Atlanta. But who can deny that the Broncos
would be nowhere without Davis?
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR: White.
</P>
<P>
   The Minister of Defense had his best season since 1988 only
months after he said he was retired because his back had become too
painful to cope with. Once the season began, White was too much for
opponents to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   COMEBACK PLAYER OF THE YEAR:  &UR; Doug Flutie &LR; , Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and  &UR; Vinny Testaverde  &LR; are strong candidates, but
they didn't have to come back through Customs. At 35, Flutie
silenced his critics with a remarkable season after taking over for
injured  &UR; Rob Johnson &LR; . The backup who wouldn't stay back finished
fifth in the NFL in passing, threw 20 TD passes, and completed 57.1
percent of his attempts while taking a team no one expected much
from into the playoffs after an 0-3 start. Think what he might do
if he just wasn't too small to play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Got any arguments?
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Patriots defensive tackle  &UR; Henry Thomas  &LR; says he has no second
thoughts about leaving Minnesota even though the Vikings went 15-1
without him this year. Thomas played eight years in Minnesota, and
many of his former teammates are still there, and Thomas is happy
for them. ``All that stuff they're doing up there, I created,''
Thomas joked. ``I gotta get my credit somehow.'' The real credit
belongs to head coach  &UR; Dennis Green &LR; , &UR;  &LR; according to Thomas. ``He
consistently set the standards for what he wanted and it's paid
off,'' Thomas said. ``I see Dennis's mentality on the Vikings team.
I feel great excitement for all my friends I played with but I'm
not disappointed not to be there. I'm a Patriot now. I went in
another direction.'' ... Before Denver fans get too excited about
next weekend's home playoff game in Mile High Stadium, they should
consider this: The AFC's No. 1 seed hasn't won a playoff game the
last three years and hasn't reached the Super Bowl in four. The
Chiefs lost in 1995 and 1997 and the Broncos lost in 1996.

HAMED STOPS FIGHT OVER CONTRACT DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first casualty on American soil has been sustained in the
battle for control of British-born World Boxing Organization
featherweight champion Prince Naseem Hamed: It is his planned March
6 return to a US boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed will not fight as scheduled on HBO that night, and it
could be months before he reappears in the United States because in
the power struggle for control of his business future, it has not
yet been determined who will survive and who will perish from his
camp.
</P>
<P>
   That is what so often seems to happen when a young slugger
suddenly gains exposure to American fighting dollars _ 12 million
of them, to be exact. British promoter Frank Warren signed Hamed,
24, to a six-fight, $12 million dollar deal last year with HBO, one
that was preceded by a multimillion-dollar contract with SKY-TV,
the English equivalent of HBO, and therein began Hamed's problems.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular American debut in Madison Square Garden a year ago
_ a knockout of former world champion Kevin Kelley _ was followed
this past Halloween by a miserable performance in Atlantic City in
his second HBO appearance, and things quickly fell apart around
Hamed, as they had been threatening to do for months.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's eldest brother, Riath, took out a promoter's license,
and soon thereafter Warren was jettisoned. With him went trainer
Brendan Ingle, who had discovered Hamed at the age of 7 and
nurtured him. Hamed had been feuding with him ever since Ingle was
quoted in a book by a British journalist last year calling his
fighter a spoiled brat, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ingle was beginning to feel himself being pushed to
the side by Hamed's growing celebrity and tightly knit family, and
he did not react well. When Hamed got into the ring in Atlantic
City on Oct. 31, it was painfully clear that he was not mentally
focused to fight or to listen to Ingle, steadfastly refusing to
look at him or acknowledge his advice between rounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the debacle was over, Hamed was ripped by the British media
for winning a lackluster, 12-round decision from Wayne McCullough,
and he returned fire. Soon Warren was out and Hamed's brother was
telling HBO the contract was invalid because it had been signed by
Warren, not the fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's problem is one that often crops up in boxing: He doesn't
like his end of the take now that he's a star, even though he knows
he wouldn't be in this position were it not for his connection with
HBO in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hamed came to HBO, this Yemeni grocer's son had a bit of
a punch, bad pants, and seemed a bit of a buffoon with his absurd
entrances and weak list of opponents. HBO pumped $8 million into
promoting him, putting up huge billboards around New York and
showcasing him first at Madison Square Garden and then in Atlantic
City. By the time it was done, Hamed had become a cultural
phenomenon. He drew ratings as large as some of HBO's biggest draws
_ Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones, Lennox Lewis _ and wanted to be paid
like them even though his promoter had agreed to a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   So now Hamed's brother is quietly trying to renegotiate and HBO
is amenable in large part because Time-Warner Sports president Seth
Abraham has long espoused a philosophy that it is unwise to sign
fighters who don't want to fight for him.
</P>
<P>
   Since it seems clear to both sides that Hamed probably didn't
know the terms of the deal Warren signed, it's likely that a
shorter deal will be worked out. But there are other problems that
may be more knotty.
</P>
<P>
   First, SKY-TV wants Hamed on prime time in England when he
fights, and it signed him first. HBO wants him on prime time in the
US, and it signed him for more money. There is five hours
difference between prime time in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   HBO ultimately may agree to a short-term deal and then see where
things go, knowing that Hamed has caught the interest of sheiks
with deep pockets, because of his Arab background, and renegades
within the boxing business who would love to cherry-pick him off
the vine.
</P>
<P>
   Even if HBO and Hamed can iron out their dispute this month, he
has no trainer at the moment, because Ingle sided with Warren, and
no experienced promoter. Considering that Riath is a former
community liaison officer in Sheffield and his other brother was
working as an auto mechanic when the Prince's career began, they
are incapable of filling the trainer's role and are novices in the
promotional one.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Hamed's career has ground to a temporary halt
just as it began to take off. The British media is sick of him, and
he has disappeared in the US.
</P>
<P>
   What Hamed's family is trying to do is noble enough in that they
want to protect him from the sharks who fill boxing's seas, and
they understand that remaining a promotional free agent is the best
way to do so. But to argue that they don't have a valid contract
with the cable network that did the most to turn Hamed from a local
hero into a multimillionaire seems an unwise business practice.
</P>
<P>
   HBO believes it can work out a new deal that will be amenable to
Hamed and still protect the rights it received when it started
paying him $2 million a fight. Hamed's brother reportedly has been
a reasonable negotiator, carefully avoiding public condemnation of
HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The Prince should pray that this works out, because if it
doesn't, he may enter the ring for his next fight in America with
Janis Joplin singing, ``Freedom's just another word for nothing
left to lose,'' in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   HBO is hoping to replace Hamed's appearance with a world title
fight for Olympic gold medalist  &UR; David Reid  &LR; (11-0) against World
Boxing Association junior mid-dleweight champion  &UR; Laurent Boudouani
 &LR; (38-2-1) on a card that would also include a rematch between
 &UR; Miguel Angel Gonzalez  &LR; and  &UR; Kosta Tszyu &LR;  ... As expected, Dec. 23
came and went and  &UR; George Foreman  &LR; and  &UR; Larry Holmes  &LR; did not
receive the letters of credit they were due to insure their Jan. 23
fight in Houston's Astrodome. Thus the Battle of the Aged died last
week not with a bang but a whimper, and boxing is the better for
it. The fight's scrambling promoter,  &UR; Roger Levitt &LR; , &UR;  &LR; continued to
the end to insist the bout would come off. ``All the financial
arrangements that need to be put in place will be done so,'' he
insisted early in the week. Foreman and Holmes extended by a week
their deadline for receiving letters of credit of $9 million and
$3.6 million, respectively, but it didn't help Levitt, whose major
backer pulled out two weeks ago. So the two fighters collected
advances of $1 million and $400,000, respectively, without getting
hit. Once  &UR; Mike Tyson  &LR; decided to resume his career the weekend
before Foreman-Holmes, the bout was in big trouble. Instead of
being the off-week entertainment between the NFL's conference
championship games and the Super Bowl, Foreman-Holmes found itself
sandwiched between two mega-events, Tyson's return and the Super
Bowl, and that was a pending pay-per-view disaster that had to be
avoided ... Anybody notice that highly rated but lightly skilled
 &UR; Jade Scott  &LR; lost to journeyman  &UR; Melvin Foster  &LR; a week ago? As one
boxing insider said, ``That tells you all you need to know about
the ratings.'' In other words, they mean nothing.

FORMER KLANSMAN RAISES MONEY IN BID TO SUCCEED LIVINGSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., La., Miss., Okla., W.Va.)  (rl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Seeking donations from an audience sympathetic
to his view that too many federal policies favor blacks, Jews and
other minorities over whites, David Duke arrived in the Washington
area Saturday to drum up support for his latest political endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is the first Republican to declare his candidacy for the
House seat being vacated by Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana,
who announced his intention to resign soon after he was selected to
succeed Newt Gingrich as House speaker. Duke brought along a stack
of volumes of his new autobiography, ``My Awakening,'' and told a
crowd of about 100 here that he would become the first person in
Congress ``to stand up openly and proudly'' to defend the rights of
Christian whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need you to make a sacrifice economically,'' he said,
pitching the autographed books at $35 each, or four for $100. ``If
we can get just one person in Congress, it will be like opening the
floodgates. It could change this country overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashing diversity as a destructive force, he concluded his
hourlong speech by saying, ``If we lose European-Americans, we lose
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears that American culture is overly influenced by blacks and
other minorities through immigration policies, and that Jews have
taken control of the federal government, have been central themes
of Duke's world view for many years.
</P>
<P>
   As a Ku Klux Klan leader in the 1970s, he made his points in
white robes and at demonstrations. More recently, he has taken the
more genteel path of business suits and electoral politics. He
served one term in the Louisiana House of Representatives before
losing a 1990 U.S. Senate race to J. Bennett Johnston. He lost the
1991 Louisiana governor's race to Edwin Edwards. In 1996, he
finished fourth in a field of nine in an open primary for the
Senate seat now held by Mary Landrieu, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   After Livingston decided to resign, acknowledging extramarital
affairs, Duke, 48, jumped into the race despite immediate
condemnation by more mainstream Louisiana Republicans. Referring to
the possibility that Duke might succeed Livingston, Rep. Jim
McCrery of Shreveport told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans:
``Obviously, we'd work to avoid that unpleasantry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such objections, Duke is popular in many parts of
Louisiana, including the district he would represent, which he
claims supported him in each of his statewide campaigns. The
district is directly north of New Orleans and 85 percent white.
``And we weren't even concentrating there,'' Duke said in an
interview before the speech.
</P>
<P>
   He has also developed some support around the country. On
Saturday, an attentive crowd paid $10 a person to hear Duke and
another advocate of white rights, Edward Fields of Kennesaw, Ga.,
who spent most of his 30-minute speech blaming Jews and Israel for
the ills of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like Duke, Fields embraced the Republican Party, asserting,
``This country has been gutted by Jews who vote Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cotterill, the event organizer, said that many in the
audience were members of the Council of Conservative Citizens, an
organization that gained widespread attention in recent months when
it was disclosed that Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, one of the most ardent
supporters of the impeachment of President Clinton, had appeared as
guest speakers at council events.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Barr quickly distanced themselves from the group,
denouncing the racial views of many of its members.
</P>
<P>
   Cotterill, who recently resigned as chairman of the national
capital region of the council, stressed that the event was not
sponsored by the council. He said he stepped down, in part, because
the organization regarded Duke and Fields as ``too controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, human rights organizations like the Southern Poverty
Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League contend that the council
is steeped in bigotry, evolving as it did from the White Citizens
Councils that once flourished in the South, promoting segregation.
The human rights groups also claim that many members of the Council
of Conservative Citizens have ties to the Klan, the National
Association for the Advancement of White People and other white
supremacist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the books on sale here were several published by the
National Alliance, a virulent anti-Semitic and anti-black group
based in West Virginia and run by William Pierce, author of ``The
Turner Diaries,'' a futuristic story of a race war in which whites
rid the country of blacks. Authorities in Oklahoma said that
Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the 1995 Oklahoma City
bombing in which 168 people died, had a copy of the book when he
was arrested.

THOMAS NOT ON HIS LAST LEGS LEFT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For nearly two months now, Henry Thomas has
defied one of the most basic axioms. Each Sunday the 33-year-old
former All-Pro defensive tackle has run before he could walk.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers have warned their children against this. Fathers have
counseled their rash sons against it while using the phrase in
different contexts. Obviously, none of them ever met Henry Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Thomas smashed up his ankle on Nov. 1 against the
Indianapolis Colts, he has spent six days a week barely able to
walk across the locker room and the seventh running around like a
wild man while 300-pound enemies try to knock him off his feet.
More than half that time, he was running when he literally couldn't
walk.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy thing to do; even Thomas understands that. The
former LSU communications major knows his ankle was not meant to do
what he has been asking of it. It was not meant to support his
277-pound body and propel it around a football field while others
roll on top of it. Not when it is swollen to the size of a
grapefruit, badly discolored, and thoroughly reluctant to even let
him shuffle along on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas knows this, but he also knows no one wants to hear it.
Not from a pro football player. No one cares how you feel; it's all
about how you play. And, in some cases, if you play.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, Thomas believes, you play unless doctors are
standing between you and the field. If he didn't think that way, he
would have been on disability leave a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a warrior,'' said Patriots linebacker Chris Slade, who
likewise played much of the season with a severe ankle sprain.
``He's the true definition of a football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry can barely walk, but guys still can't block him when
he's on one leg. He's tough as nails. Any player, at any age, can
learn from him. He's well established in this league. He's been
here 12 years. But he's out there every day fighting for his job.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be out there this afternoon, fighting the Jacksonville
Jaguars for the chance to beat up his ankle for at least another
weekend in the playoffs because that is how he has approached his
job since he arrived in the NFL in 1987 and became an immediate
sensation. Success has changed nothing for Henry Thomas but his
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Early glory
</P>
<P>
   In his early days, Thomas combined with Keith Millard to form a
combination that terrorized quarterbacks from the inside rush
position in Minnesota. When Millard's body began to give out from
doing the kind of things Thomas is doing today, Thomas joined young
John Randle and continued to do the same things, just with a louder
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Thomas went to the Pro Bowl and several more times he
should have. In 1994, for example, he and Randle combined for 20
1/2 sacks, the highest total in the league for a tackle tandem.
Thomas had 8 1/2 of them but Randle had a few more sacks and a lot
more loud conversations with anyone who would listen, so he went to
Hawaii while Thomas went home.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings were so enthralled with Thomas, however, that they
made him _ a defensive tackle, remember _ their transition player
one season and their franchise player the next. Then they did what
a lot of teams have done with guys like Thomas. They made a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1995, the Vikings took the franchise
designation off him and let him enter free agency. A few months
later, he was the Detroit Lions' defensive MVP after registering
the most sacks of his career, 10 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   That was the most by a Lion since Mike Cofer had a dozen in
1988, and they were instrumental in propelling Detroit into the
playoffs. But then injuries began to hit Thomas, and the Lions
began to worry about him.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas suffered through most of 1996 with a nagging groin pull
and was not the same player he had been, especially in the second
half of the season as his injury worsened. The Lions decided that
his slump to only two sacks in the final eight games of the season
(after registering four in the first six before his injury) was a
sign that Thomas was finished, and they let him go.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was damaged goods, they said, past his prime at 31.
Perhaps that was true when compared with the guy who terrorized
teams in his early years with the Vikings, but as he has shown for
two seasons in New England, that didn't mean he couldn't still rush
past an offensive lineman and make plays.
</P>
<P>
   The plays have been different from the ones he once was noted
for, even though he has 13 1/2 sacks in his two seasons here. That
is just about on pace with his career average of 7, but Thomas has
made his presence felt most on the goal line and in short-yardage
situations, those moments when everyone is digging in and a bad
ankle isn't as much of a traitor to you as it is when you try to
rush the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He has made no concessions to his balky ankle, but a veteran
makes adjustments to the vagaries of his game, and so Thomas does
what he can when the quarterback is in retreat and the rest of the
time he does the grunt work that has made him the team's leading
tackler among defensive linemen despite having to do it with a
limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can still do those things I did before, but I've
been nursing this nagging ankle for eight weeks,'' Thomas conceded.
``It's not that I'm not trying to do the things I did in Minnesota.
I'm trying to make those things happen, but I know my role in this
defense and it's a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm not trying to get to the quarterback. It
just looks like I'm not. Trust me. I'm trying. But the way things
have turned out, a lot of my plays have come on goal-line and
short-yardage. It's disappointing to finish with only 6 1/2 sacks,
but I still think I'm a pretty good nose tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   A different feeling
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas dives low and then rises up and drives a guard or
center backward or slashes between two men trying to knock him
backward and upends a running back silly enough to think he is
going to get a first down through the heart of New England's
defense, he makes that point. Henry Thomas is indeed still a pretty
good nose tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important _ as he'll show again Sunday when he
throws away his crutches, takes his ``treatment'' in the form of a
needle or two of pain killers, and goes out to play _ he is still a
football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this because I love to play football,'' Thomas said.
``When I first came into the league I played with Doug Martin and
he showed me the ropes. His last season, he played with a really
bad shoulder. It bothered him all week but not in the games. I just
thought that's how everybody did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that attitude all comes from my father. He owned a
restaurant for 17 years. He was there every day at 5 a.m. and
didn't come home until 8 p.m. I never remember him being sick.''
</P>
<P>
   No one playing with Thomas will be able to say anything
different about him. Yet he knows the difference in him these past
eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he hasn't been playing his game his way. Knowing that
is harder to swallow than knowing about the pain that awaits him
every Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field, I don't notice it, but when I'm watching myself
on film and I see a move I couldn't make that I would have used
before to get free, it's heart-wrenching,'' Thomas said. ``In this
situation I'm in, you have to rely on your teammates to protect you
when you can't change direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a quick guy. That's my game. Sometimes I'll be watching
film and see me make a great move and then see that I couldn't
counter the lineman's response with another one and it gets
depressing. When it does, I put a little more ice on my ankle. But,
no, I never doubted I'd be there every week.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he has been. And so he will be Sunday. And if things go
well and the Patriots surprise Jacksonville, he will be there next
week. In Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Running, whether he can walk or not.

NOT WILD ABOUT THEIR PROSPECTS

<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Bob Kraft will show up looking as though he
just beat George Hamilton in the International Tanning Festival in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe will stand on the sideline, holding a clipboard,
wearing a headset and a beard.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll _ who appears to be little more than a smarter,
drug-free Butch Hobson _ will perform his ``Boola Boola'' routine,
looking over his shoulder for smoke signals from Kraft's luxury
box.
</P>
<P>
   And after a tumultuous week that was downright Red Soxian, the
Patriots Sunday will play a wild-card game against the Jacksonville
Jaguars in Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. Jacksonville. This place makes Hartford look like Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville. Is this where it ends? Or do we make that trek to
Denver and watch the Patriots get routed again by the Broncos next
Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   In the greatest movie of all time, ``Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid,'' it was sheriff Ray Bledsoe (honest) who told Butch
and the Kid, ``You're gonna die bloody and all you can do is choose
where.''
</P>
<P>
   So where will it be, fellas? Here or Denver? And what happens to
Carroll when the Patriots finally end this season of the witch?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's employment status has become the trendy story line of
Wild Card Week, which says something about him and something about
the town in which he works.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the state of the media situation,'' he said calmly last
week. ``It's ongoing about people's jobs. It's difficult to deal
with it, but you have to understand the nature of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxborough was not a laugh riot in the week after the Jets loss.
Unless you cite any Red Sox postseason of the last decade, it would
be difficult to find another playoff team in deeper turmoil than
Sunday's Patriots. In the wake of the New York mugging, the
playoff-bound Patriots were asked about dissension, injuries,
quitting, and firings.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was decent about everything. When he was asked about his
job security after Bloody Monday (when five NFL head coaches got
the ax), he turned the question back to the media and asked how we
would feel if five of our brethren lost their jobs. When the
assembled reporters expressed no sympathy, Carroll laughed. By the
end of the week, there was no laughter. A proverbial ``inside
source'' (is that you, Jonathan?) was leaking Carroll rumors to
gossip columnists and the coach said he would entertain no more
questions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He may be gone. And it may be unfair. But can people stop
bragging about Pete because he got this team into the playoffs two
years in a row? It's like the Washington Post celebrating being
named one of America's top 10 newspapers. It's insulting. Carroll
inherited a young Super Bowl team. Making the playoffs was supposed
to be a given. He was hired to take the Patriots deep into the
postseason. Nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this playoff ride lacks all the good feeling usually
associated with postseason ball. It feels a little like 1990 when
the Red Sox won the American League East but we all knew they stood
no chance against the mighty Oakland A's in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's not the opponent that makes us feel hopeless.
It's the Patriots themselves. The embarrassment against the Jets,
the injuries, the planned flight to Hartford, and the uncertainty
about Carroll make this a Wild Card Weekend without much hope.
</P>
<P>
   Remember four years ago when the young and hungry Patriots had a
playoff game in Cleveland on New Year's Day? It was their first
postseason appearance in eight years and they went in with a
seven-game winning streak. There was a buoyancy about the team that
reappeared two years later when they made it all the way to the
Super Bowl. In those days, the Patriots went into the playoffs as
the hot team, the team nobody wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are the team everybody wants. But it is their good
fortune to be playing the other team everybody wants. Truly. Take a
look at the dozen NFL playoff entries and it's clear that the two
teams waiting to be beaten are playing one another this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   We tried all week to get the Patriots to say something
meaningful about this game, but the answers were flat and
predictable. The Patriots are wounded and playing without Bledsoe,
their leader. Some want out. Others want a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our ass whipped last week, and (Scott) Zolak's the
starter this week,'' said safety Willie Clay. ``That's all there is
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all there is to say. Meanwhile, the ghost of the
Great White Tuna is not going away. The Patriots were a 5-2 team
when Parcells first beat them last year. They proceeded to lose
three of their next four. They were a muscle-flexing 4-1 when the
Tuna came to town this past October. That defeat sent them reeling
to four losses in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have a playoff game one week after being humiliated by
Parcells. Kraft hasn't commented, but he no doubt was mortified and
stupefied by what he saw in New York. And one of his people is
planting rumors about hiring Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries aside, the Jet debacle followed by a one-and-out
playoff experience could be enough to get this coach fired. But
right now there's a wild-card game to be played.
</P>
<P>
   Whoop-de-do.

ANDRADE MAKES THE TURN ON UPSWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is in a tropical paradise, a far cry from the golfing hell he
had been in just four months ago. Billy Andrade made the trip to
Maui from his home in Atlanta the other day, but, in truth, it was
a journey that began on a Friday in early September in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Golf was beating up Andrade, which would be no big deal if not
for the fact that in his line of work, bad play means no pay. The
pride of Bristol, R.I., was in a horrendous stretch when he opened
with a 74 at the Greater Milwaukee Open. ``I was almost in last on
not a really, really hard course,'' said Andrade. A week earlier,
he had missed the cut at the Greater Vancouver Open. Before that,
he had missed the cut at the Sprint International. Before that, he
had missed the cut 10 times in 21 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The checks, when they did come, were small. The frustration was
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either go home and a take a while off or figure
something out,'' he said. ``I don't know if I've gone that long
with playing that bad ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   There were mechanical problems, said Andrade, but mostly he was
never giving himself a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly 3 over after seven holes, constantly shooting
myself out of it,'' he said. ``But I knew (in Milwaukee) that I had
to get myself up the next day and play out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf can be a cold-hearted game that penalizes those who make
even the slightest mistake, but on the other hand, it is
marvelously rewarding to those who persevere. So it was that on
that Friday in Milwaukee the sport extended a gentle embrace and
Andrade turned his season around. The swings were true. Putts
dropped. The trademark smile returned. He shot 64. When he followed
that with rounds of 65 and 68, Andrade finished tied for ninth, his
first Top 10 since the opening event of the season, and he had shot
three consecutive sub-70 rounds for just the second time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He rode that momentum to an emotional win at the Canadian Open
the next week, his first on Tour since back-to-back triumphs in
1991. Just two shots out of the lead through 54 holes, Andrade was
wakened by a phone call that Sunday morning. Bobby Orr, a partner
in Woolf Associates, which handles Andrade's affairs, wanted to
know if the golfer was ready. ``Bobby,'' said Andrade to the NHL
Hall of Famer, ``I better be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade prevailed in a playoff over Bob Friend, dispelling any
lingering doubts that he would win again. Gone, too, were those
haunting thoughts at the back of his mind of not making the Top 125
in money and possibly losing exempt status. Instead, Andrade earned
a $396,000 check, two years exempt status, not to mention a pair of
priceless passes to Augusta National and Carnoustie for this year's
Masters and British Open. (He still has to earn his way into the US
Open, though that is a matter for another day.)
</P>
<P>
   There were two more Top 20 finishes following the Canadian Open,
and in his final 29 rounds of 1998, Andrade broke 70 14 times. He
finished 41st in money ($705,434), rather remarkable considering
that he had earned just $189,380 through the first eight months,
and he hopes to ride that strong finish into the new season.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, 1999 is a perfect time to kick into high gear if
you're a player of Andrade's stature.
</P>
<P>
   There is the introduction of the World Golf Championships,
select-field events that will offer $5 million purses, not to
mention the looming Ryder Cup matches at The Country Club in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Andrade, ``is the ultimate goal. It would mean so
much to me and Brad Faxon and Brett Quigley, guys from New England,
to play what would amount to a home game. I've played (The Country
Club) a lot and nothing would be better than to represent your
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade, like many of his colleagues, will start paying
attention to his world ranking, for that is how the fields will be
drawn for the WGC events, a group effort of the pro golf tours in
the US, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. The top 64 will
qualify for the first event, the Feb. 24-28 match play competition
at La Costa, and Andrade is on the outside looking in, ranked 78th.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade was back in Rhode Island for Christmas, but thanks to
his Canadian Open victory he is in the field for this week's
kickoff to the 1999 PGA Tour season, the Mercedes Championship (for
1998 event winners only) at Kapalua's Plantation Course on Maui. He
is about to commence his 12th year on the PGA Tour, an
accomplishment of which he should be proud, and just a few weeks
shy of his 35th birthday he remains one of the friendliest
personalities in a line of work that desperately needs more of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Hawaii is a two-week affair (Andrade will also play
in next week's Sony Hawaiian Open), and he was able to travel with
his wife and two children, combining work with pleasure. Daughter
Lelia, at just 20 months, said Andrade, would make for an
interesting traveler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck to the passengers,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Royal and Ancient announced that the Open Championship will
be staged at Royal Lytham &AMP; St. Annes in 2001 and at Muirfield the
following year. It stops at Carnoustie this summer and at St.
Andrews in 2000 ... Andrade isn't the only notable player looking
to work his way into the WGC Match Play bonanza in February.  &UR; Scott
McCarron  &LR; (75th),  &UR; Steve Pate  &LR; (76),  &UR; Robert Allenby  &LR; (85),  &UR; Tom
Kite  &LR; (87),  &UR; Costantino Rocca  &LR; (91),  &UR; David Frost  &LR; (94), and  &UR; John
Daly  &LR; (121) are all on the wrong side of the number. Rocca and
Frost have plummeted, having been 52d and 51st, respectively, at
the end of 1997 ... Dates are being finalized by the Women's Golf
Association of Massachusetts, which has secured some outstanding
sites for its premier 1999 events: Sankaty Head on Nantucket for
the Baker Trophy, Eastward Ho! in Chatham for the Stone Cup, and
Oak Hill in Fitchburg for its Association Championships.

TEXAS A&AMP;M SETTING SIGHTS ON NATIONAL TITLE IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Texas A&AMP;M began and ended its 1998 season with
narrow losses to teams that remain in the mix for college
football's national championship.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the Aggies ruined the title aspirations of opponents
ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the respective polls with two stunning
upsets as double-digit underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging returns from such extended exposure to members
of college football's upper crust boosted the Aggies' confidence to
a level unprecedented in 10 seasons under coach R.C. Slocum.
Instead of hanging their heads after a 24-14 loss Friday to No. 3
Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, A&AMP;M players talked yesterday about
using the experience as a steppingstone to a run at the 1999
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M (11-3), ranked No. 8 in The Associated Press poll, returns
16 starters next season, including its leading passer, rusher and
receiver. All will return with an ingredient that had been missing
in the Slocum era: the self-assurance gained from victories against
top-five opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back next year gunning for that national
championship,'' said tailback Dante Hall, who rushed for a
team-high 1,024 yards and eight touchdowns. ``We should be right
there in the mix, I think. This season showed us that hard work and
great togetherness can go a long way. Even ending with a loss, we
can take the Ohio State game and build on it as something to push
us in the off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season, A&AMP;M players admitted to self-doubts about
their place in college football's pecking order. That no longer is
the case, thanks to upsets of then-No. 1 Kansas State (36-33) and
then-No. 2 Nebraska (28-21), as well as respectable showings
against Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl and No. 2 Florida State in the
Kickoff Classic (a 23-14 loss).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're over that hump. We've beat the good teams,'' said
fullback Ja'Mar Toombs. ``We know what it takes to contend with the
best. We're building a team that can be a powerhouse. When people
look at us now, they are going to have to say, `A&AMP;M is a really
good football team' instead of, `A&AMP;M ... they're OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest evidence of the change, tight end Dan Campbell said,
is in the way players respond in preparation for meetings with
top-10 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't stress anyone, regardless of who we play. And that
hasn't always been the case,'' said Campbell, a senior. ``That's
what we accomplished this year that we'll pass along to the younger
guys. These guys know they have a chance to win every game. We're
on Florida State's level and Ohio State's level.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two teams join top-ranked Tennessee (12-0) as the only
remaining pieces in the puzzle for the 1998 national championship.
At A&AMP;M, the focus already has shifted to 1999. The Aggies consider
themselves a huge piece in that puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this team will do what it takes this summer and a couple of
guys step up, I see no reason why it can't contend for the national
title next year and beat everyone on the schedule,'' strong safety
Rich Coady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I think we set our goals too low,'' Hall said. ``We
wanted to win the Big 12 South, and then the Big 12. That's all we
talked about. If we come back with a higher goal in mind, we'll
probably be able to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Aggies are talking of pursuing the ultimate goal in
1999.

 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's all you need to know about this wild-card
battle of titans: Charles Haley just might suit up and play for the
49ers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presumably, that means that means Dick Butkus wasn't available.
Or Tommy Nobis or Chuck Bednarik.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, it means that Bart Starr will pull on the helmet again
for the Packers. Or even Max McGee or Paul Hornung.
</P>
<P>
   If you were promoting this as a heavyweight fight, it would
likely be the NFL equivalent of George Foreman vs. Larry Holmes. A
pair of doddering ex-champions trying to pass themselves off as
real contenders.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't be just another playoff game when San
Francisco hosts Green Bay at 3Com Park. It will definitely be the
end of an era. It could be the end of several eras.
</P>
<P>
   Just say that there are so many comings and goings on both
sidelines that the respective franchises might be best served
installing revolving doors in their training facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it was less than a year ago, heading into the Super
Bowl against Denver, that the word dynasty was being used to
describe this new version of the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   So they promptly were dethroned by John Elway and the Broncos
and spent all of this season looking up at Randall Cunningham,
Randy Moss and the Vikings. Now, the most popular activity in
Cheeseland is betting on who catches the first plane out of town _
defensive end Reggie White or head coach Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   White, of course, retired after last season, then changed his
mind and came back and now swears that this is his farewell tour.
After Holmgren led his team to the Super Bowl title in 1997, he was
honored by having a street named after him in Green Bay. But that
honor is diminished when you consider that Holmgren Way is usually
covered by six inches of ice, and it seems that things have gotten
too cold for the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend Holmgren wants to go someplace where he can run his
own show, holding the titles of both coach and general manager.
There is also the speculation that he is holding out for an
opportunity to come right back here to the Bay Area, where he used
to be the offensive coordinator, and take over the reins if Niners
boss Steve Mariucci should decide to follow Carmen Policy and
Dwight Clark to the expansion world of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's response to rumors about a return to the Bay Area was
to say very little, which only served to fuel the feeding frenzy
even more. Not that a little more blood in the water would even be
noticed by Niners fans.
</P>
<P>
   The chardonnay-sipping faithful are frothing over the fact the
Niners have lost their last five meetings with the Packers,
including three in a row in the playoffs. And don't think for a
minute that quarterback Steve Young isn't being saddled with much
of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight years as the Niners' starting quarterback, Young
has developed into the NFL's most accurate and highest-rated
passer. But he has not been able to clear the hurdle of the
Packers. In his last three full games against Green Bay, Young has
thrown just one touchdown pass against four interceptions and been
sacked 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the wins and all of the big numbers, the critics are
again coming out of the woodwork to tell Young what he already
knows: He's not Joe Montana. There is a school of thought that says
for all of his accomplishments, including winning a Super Bowl
title, the only really big game Young has ever won was the 1994 NFC
title game against the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has led to speculation that Young, banged up and
with a history of concussions, might walk off into retirement if
the Niners lose this game, paving the way for a complete rebuilding
of the team once Ed DeBartolo Jr. regains control of his franchise,
which seems only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBartolo finally clears his legal problems and is given
the OK by the NFL to move back into his office, he will definitely
bring back former coach and guru Bill Walsh, maybe as GM, maybe as
general overseer. There was even one rumor that Walsh was going to
start working again the week leading up to this game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, wouldn't that be ridiculous, bringing back an old name from
the past as a display of panic?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Haley, who spent six years with San
Francisco, was traded to Dallas in 1992 and retired from the
Cowboys with a bad back following the 1996 season. Haley was in
town for a physical and could be in uniform today because the
Niners have been devastated with injuries on the defensive line to
Chris Doleman, Roy Barker and Bryant Young.
</P>
<P>
   Two years on the shelf and now likely straight into the
playoffs. That says it all about Packers vs. Niners '98. How the
mighty have fallen.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ He heard the roar go up immediately, but he figured
it was more for the result than for any style points that might
have been involved.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big play. Big moment.
</P>
<P>
   Timely, too, of course, but what else was new?
</P>
<P>
   Then the man of the moment sneaked a glance at the Georgia Dome
replay board, and even a fellow with a name like Peerless was
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how tough a catch it was until I saw the
replay,'' Peerless Price said here the other day. ``It was real
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Often as not, it is. When Tennessee gets around to calling on
its big-play receiver, the Volunteers are in a bind, in need of
something special, a role Price has been happy and able to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have to make a big play in every ballgame I
play,'' he said matter-of-factly. ``There's going to be a play to
be made in the passing game by me, and hopefully I'm going to come
down with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking in a new quarterback, Tee Martin, Tennessee opened this
remarkable season with a clear preference to run first, second and
maybe even third, throwing only often enough to remind opponents it
wasn't out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Price made the most of his opportunities, catching 61
passes for 920 yards and 10 touchdowns in helping the Vols to a
12-0 season and a spot in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl against
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those plays were big, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Others were merely huge.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the two touchdown catches in the
season-opening nail-biter at Syracuse, and a big touchdown
reception in the home win over Florida. Or the 10 catches for 165
yards and a pair of scores against South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There was more, too. A 36-yard touchdown reception started
Tennessee on its way back from an 18-point deficit against
Arkansas. Finally, Price wrapped up the regular season with seven
receptions for 181 yards and a touchdown at Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the catch-and-run act the extent of his contribution.
When Alabama limited him to one reception for nine yards, Price
made his presence felt with a 100-yard kickoff return for a score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best we've had here, no question about it,''
Vols coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``He's made a lot of big plays for
us this season when we really needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   None, though, was bigger than the one Price made midway through
the fourth quarter of the Southeastern Conference championship game
against Mississippi State in Atlanta. With his team trailing 14-10,
he pulled down a 41-yard throw from Martin despite tight coverage
to put Tennessee ahead for good, earning game Most Valuable Player
honors with his six catches for 97 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peerless is a guy who's going to make plays,'' Martin said.
``You know if you give him a shot, he's going to get in there and
get it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The raw numbers might not look sensational compared to the
recent 1,000-yard seasons of former teammates Joey Kent and Marcus
Nash, but Price's accomplishments might be more remarkable. Those
others, after all, had the advantage of working with Peyton Manning
in a more pass-oriented offense; Price was left to help ease the
transition to the inexperienced Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Price finishes third on the all-time Tennessee
receiving list in catches (147) and yards (2,298), trailing only
Kent and Nash in each category. In the course of things, he passed
the likes of Alvin Harper, Carl Pickens and Tim McGee in the
Tennessee record book, despite being slowed his junior year by a
hurried recovery from a broken fibula and torn ankle ligaments
suffered in the 1997 spring game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can't say I fit in, because those guys went on to
have great professional careers,'' he said. ``But I know I broke a
lot of their records. I'm in the top two or three in most
categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Price hopes to be Peerless in a different way, helping
Tennessee to its first national championship in 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we've been talking about all season,'' he said.
``This is where we all wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Vols are just a big play or two from the title. If
the opportunity arises, Peerless Price would like nothing better
than to provide it.

WILD-CARD ARIZONA UPSETS DALLAS 20-7 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The wheels have been wobbly all season, but the
Dallas Cowboys made it to the playoffs as the strongest team in a
weak division. The Cowboys had managed to win the National Football
Conference East, but they were not the powerful Dallas teams of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels came off completely Saturday afternoon to the most
unlikely of opponents, the Arizona Cardinals. The Cardinals (10-7),
in their first playoff appearance in 16 seasons, applied relentless
defensive pressure and allowed the Cowboys to unravel through their
own ineptitude, pulling off a stunning 20-7 victory before a
sellout crowd at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Cardinals' first playoff victory since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the kind of playoff performance that Cowboys fans
have come to expect. In the third quarter, when they needed to cut
into the Cardinals' 17-0 lead, the Cowboys produced no points on
three offensive possessions. The Cowboys fell behind by 20-0 early
in the fourth quarter; their offense lifeless, they appeared to be
a beaten team at that point.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals advance to the second round and will face
Minnesota at the Metrodome next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, it was difficult to tell that the Cardinals
were the team with the limited playoff experience and the team that
hadn't won at Texas Stadium in 10 years _ or that the Cowboys had
beaten them twice this season. Indeed, the Cowboys had a 16-2
record against the Cardinals in this decade entering this game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite controlling the ball with a bruising rushing attack
(Emmitt Smith had 51 yards on 13 carries in the first half), the
Cowboys had no points. Two of quarterback Troy Aikman's passes were
intercepted, thwarting drives. The Cowboys blew a great scoring
chance when Cardinals linebacker Mark Maddox stopped Smith for a
1-yard loss on a fourth-and-1 at the Cardinals' 7.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cardinals scored their first touchdown on a
cleverly executed shovel pass from Jake Plummer to running back
Adrian Murrell that went for 12 yards. And they scored with 19
seconds to play in the first half on Chris Jacke's 37-yard field
goal. The Cowboys were booed as they headed to the locker room at
the half, trailing by 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't supposed to be happening. There were still enough
players around from the Cowboys' Super Bowl teams of 1992, 1993 and
1995 to know better than to let a wild-card game slip away. The
Cowboys were 4-1 in wild-card games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were making their first playoff appearance since
1982. That was a strike-shortened season and the then-St. Louis
Cardinals made it in with a 5-4 record. There were no division
winners and by virtue of their record, the Cardinals were included
in the postseason tournament.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't last long. After Green Bay blasted them by 41-16 at
Lambeau Field, the Cardinals have been trying to get back into the
postseason ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona made it here on the guile of quarterback Plummer and the
foot of Jacke, who kicked last-second game-winning field goals in
three of the four games he had played in since signing with the
team on Dec. 1 to replace Joe Nedney, who is injured.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes here were on another foot, though. Cowboys cornerback
Deion Sanders was playing in his first game since injuring his left
big toe in a Nov. 15 game against the Cardinals at Sun Devil
Stadium. Sanders went out of that game in the first half and
Plummer and receiver Frank Sanders took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders received a big ovation when he walked onto the
field for the Cowboys' first defensive series. Plummer tested him
on the Cardinals' second play from scrimmage, throwing a quick out
to Moore, who dodged the cornerback and picked up 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only time in the first half that Plummer threw
Sanders' way. Sanders came out to return one punt, and got another
ovation, but Cardinals punter Scott Player punted the ball out of
bounds at the 47.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders saved a touchdown by dragging down Cardinals running
back Adrian Murrell at the Cowboys' 3 after a 74-yard run. It was
the longest run against the Cowboys' defense in postseason play.
Plummer hit fullback Larry Centers on a 3-yard scoring pass on the
next play to put the Cardinals ahead by 17-0 early in the third
quarter.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ All things considered, Mario Edwards gladly will let
someone else take a crack at the job.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dealing with Tennessee's Peerless Price will be enough of a
challenge in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, the Florida State
cornerback says. But what about trying to defend against a fellow
he sees in practice every day?
</P>
<P>
   Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-on-one matchup? No,'' Edwards said. ``On this level, I
don't think anybody can stop Peter Warrick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers will have to try, of course. Sometimes, that will
leave corners Steve Johnson and Dwayne Goodrich with the unenviable
task of keeping the 6-foot, 190-pound Warrick in check without
help.
</P>
<P>
   This is not something Edwards _ a fellow hardly lacking in
confidence _ would care to attempt on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rare that you see a guy with that kind of mobility,
who can stop on a dime and then accelerate like he can,'' he said.
``He's just a special guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols, of course, aren't the only ones who have noticed. In
FSU's 11-1 season, Warrick averaged 20.2 yards on his 61 catches,
scoring 12 touchdowns. Against Florida, he turned a deflected pass
into a scoring catch-and-run, then broke open the game with a
46-yard touchdown pass off an end around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I get the ball, I feel I have to do something with
it,'' the former high school quarterback said.
</P>
<P>
   Should Tennessee stick with its standard defense, heavy on
man-to-man coverage, Warrick might have some chances to do
something special Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when they come up and press me,'' he said. ``If they
miss the jam, it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers defensive coordinator John Chavis concedes the risk.
At the same time, Chavis says it is too late to revamp a successful
scheme to accommodate one player _ as special as that player might
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I think he may be the very best receiver in college
football,'' Chavis said. ``But we've played against good receivers
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   With redshirt sophomore Marcus Outzen making only his third
career start at quarterback, that strategy might play into FSU's
hands. As the Seminoles ask a passer with little experience to lead
them, a big-time receiver could enjoy an even bigger role.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Outzen has considered the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Warrick is one of a kind,'' he said. ``You think you
have him covered, but it's impossible to be as quick as he is, so
he gets open.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminoles fans might witness that for the last time Monday
night. Warrick, a junior, has been coy about his plans for next
season, but most FSU insiders expect him to wear an NFL jersey come
summer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there remains a bit of unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot about this national championship,'' Warrick
said. ``We made it here, and we need to make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can go out there and dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   If form holds, Warrick will keep up his end of the bargain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many people think Detroit has too much talent for this
season-long funk to continue, but there are indications general
manager Ken Holland is ready to make a move. The Red Wings allowed
26 goals during a six-game winless streak, including a loss to
Nashville, and the team's goals-against average of 2.79 ranked only
19th in the league. The team even put in a waiver claim on St.
Louis defenseman Todd Gill. Holland expected motivation problems in
the first 20 games this season, but the Wings are nearing the
midway point of the season. As to conversations with other teams,
Holland said, ``You go through some spans of time when you're not
really talking. Now, I'm trying to touch base with as many people
in the league as I can. I want to make sure I know what's going on
and get a feel for how teams are thinking. I want to make sure we
don't get caught by surprise and miss a chance to get one of the
guys we have interest in. If one of those guys is being moved, we
want to be on top of it.'' The Wings remain in first place in the
Central, and Holland is far from panicking, but he said, ``It's
still the regular season, but you can't just all of a sudden turn
it on come April 1 and find your 'A' game. You need to get it going
at some point in the regular season and play your 'A' game.''

   Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, potentially only six months away
from unrestricted free agency, has not signed a new deal with the
Avalanche. A number of teams, including the Thrashers, are keeping
an eye on developments, but Dallas forward Mike Keane said he
thinks the Avalanche would be crazy not to re-sign Roy. ``They're
moving into a new building, and you'd think they'd want a strong
team to build around,'' said Keane, a former teammate of Roy in
Montreal and Colorado. ``That means not getting rid of Patrick Roy.
You can see how much a great goaltender means. ... I know Patty
wants to play in Denver the rest of his career. He has roots here.
He really wants to stay.'' The Avalanche, meanwhile, has rebounded
nicely from a 1-5-1 start this season, despite a string of injuries
that has sidelined six regulars, including Roy. A 4-2 win in
Vancouver earlier this week left Colorado in undisputed first place
in the Northwest Division for the first time this season.

 &HT;    San Francisco soap opera
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A once and perhaps future king in this city,
Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren landed here Saturday evening.
By the time his team departs tonight, conventional wisdom is that
he and his wife, Kathy, could be dusting off the furniture at the
home they never sold in nearby Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Preposterous as it once seemed, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   The various job-related permutations involving Holmgren and
incumbent San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci include more twists
than Lombard Street, the famous and narrow 45-degree slope here
that could double as a grand prix course. How the fates of these
two men came to be so intertwined is a tale replete with the
hackneyed elements more typical of a cheap paperback mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Pride, avarice, ego, ambition. They all play a role in a
real-life drama that has placed enormous pressure on Mariucci. A
likable and gregarious coach who has won 26 of 34 games in two
years, Mariucci's only shortcoming is that he has failed to augment
the franchise's collection of Super Bowl hardware.
</P>
<P>
   That egregious oversight, along with the pending return of
exiled owner Ed DeBartolo, could be enough to earn Mariucci a pink
slip and send him packing to Cleveland to fill the coaching vacancy
there.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months ago, the Niners presented Mariucci with a
proposal for a contract extension through the 2005 season. Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the return of DeBartolo, the coach
tossed the contract in his car trunk and sought clarification on
what his expanded role might be in an organization that will be
reshaped following the departures of team president Carmen Policy
and vice president Dwight Clark.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't get a straight answer, Mariucci decided three
weeks ago to sign the contract and take his chances. The only
catch: The 49ers suddenly weren't so eager to have his autograph on
the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   And so the young coach privately steams and figures to spend
much of today glancing over his shoulder at the specter of
Holmgren. Indeed, objects in Mariucci's rear-view coaching mirror
are closer than they appear.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Don Yee, who represents Mariucci, acknowledged last week
that ``any one of three things'' could happen after today. Asked if
those three options were consummating the extension, dismissal or
resignation, Yee allowed: ``You're three-for-three, I'd say.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci, after all, was hired by Policy, suddenly persona non
grata with the Niners. In the current atmosphere, in which
DeBartolo is attempting to expunge anything that has Policy's
fingerprints on it, all things are possible. George Seifert, after
all, exited the 49ers in 1996 after posting a .755 career winning
percentage and claiming two Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   Only this much seems certain: DeBartolo, in exile while he
battled federal racketeering charges in Louisiana, desperately
wants to return with a splash.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing back former coach Bill Walsh in some management role _
and as the tangible reminder of this franchise's halcyon days _
figures to be the first step. The return of Holmgren, who served as
offensive coordinator here and is like a son to Walsh, could be the
second half of the daily double.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren has a terminal case of the seven-year itch. He longs to
run his own show and has a stipulation in his contract that allows
him to leave for a combination job that includes the coach and
general manager titles. His brilliant record aside, the options are
dwindling for Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Carolina has settled on Seifert as its next coach.
Holmgren confided last week that he likes the potential in
Washington, but the likelihood that John Kent Cooke will retain
ownership of the franchise probably means Norv Turner will survive.
The Seattle job he explored a year ago isn't as attractive now to
Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Packers general manager Ron Wolf suggested to
Holmgren that he sign the lucrative extension Green Bay has offered
and stay put. That option doesn't look as bad to Holmgren now. Even
in the league's most remote outpost, after all, $3 million a year
can buy a lot of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   But there is DeBartolo, said to be in the throes of emotional
mood swings over what to do about his coach. And there is Mariucci,
twisting in the wind. And there is the house in Santa Cruz and the
several business interests Holmgren maintains in the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the drama would play out, 49ers quarterback Steve
Young offered the kind of answer inherent to such soap operas.
``Stay tuned,'' he said.

 &HT;    WEATHER: Tornado damages homes in South Florida
 &HT;    By Alexandra Navarro Clifton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Tracey Howard and her neighbors were
sleeping just before dawn Saturday when the windows started
rumbling. Then they shattered, letting in the wind and water that
destroyed most of her and her family's belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true what they say,'' Howard said Saturday afternoon.
``It sounded like a freight train.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Miami confirmed that category
F-1 tornado ripped through Howard's Riviera Beach neighborhood at
about 5 a.m. Saturday, tearing shingles off roofs, snapping
concrete electricity poles and even overturning a semi-truck.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are classified between F0 and F5 on the Fujita Wind
Damage Scale. A minor F0 tornado's winds are 72 mph or less. An
extremely destructive F5 tornado's winds range between 260 and 310
mph. The tornado that hit Riviera Beach Saturday, an F1, had winds
between 73 and 112 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach police officials said the more severely damaged
homes, including Howard's, were on the 700 and 800 blocks of 4th
and 5th Streets, just west of the Port of Palm Beach, but said much
of the city experienced flooding and lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Lurry, who lives next door to Howard, had a pile of
wood stacked on her kitchen floor alongside pools of water and
piles of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the heat and debris inside, two of Howard's four
children played with their yet-unnamed puppy, looking down at the
street and nodding when asked whether the storm woke them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything,'' Howard said. `` There's nothing I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross provided food and water and set up a
temporary shelter at 2409 Avenue H Saturday afternoon for people
affected by the storm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ It took more than four months of pleading, griping,
inputting, ciphering and sorting.
</P>
<P>
   Geeks told us about victory-margin formulas and schedule
calculations. Coaches made impassioned testimonials for their
teams. Fans demanded a playoff resolution on the field. Teams tried
to run the score up, hoping to climb a little higher in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, the Bowl Championship Series leaders told us
it all would work out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida State and Tennessee, it did.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 college football season will end Monday night with one
game, one champion. It will be Tennessee-Florida State in the
Fiesta Bowl for the whole enchilada, not to mention all the
Tostitos.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no reason for any other contender to argue. There
will be no way any other team could cast doubt on No. 1, even if
Ohio State's John Cooper prays over his black-eyed peas that FSU
wins a ``sloppy'' game.
</P>
<P>
   It might not have been a perfect ride to a single championship
showdown, but it worked. It is the contention here that anything
short of a playoff still shortchanges players, fans and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But in this system, in these times, while we still might not
know which team will win college football's national championship,
we do finally know which teams will not win it.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State? No second half, no Sugar Bowl rout, no cigar. Kansas
State? No focus, no case for the ring. UCLA? No defense, no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Any of those teams might still believe it could defeat both the
Seminoles and the Vols. Any of them, except for UCLA, might in fact
be good enough to do such a thing if there were a playoff. And
other teams, namely Arizona and Wisconsin, could legitimately talk
about being the best in the land.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Seminoles and Vols smiling as they walked off the
practice fields Saturday, finally knowing that theirs will be the
once-and-for-everything Game of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   And they should have been smiling. They are the teams that
should play for the ring, because while everyone else was griping
and pleading for a way to get it done under the BCS system, the
'Noles and Vols showed us how it is supposed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Beat everybody. If the program and conference are
strong enough, it will work out no matter if there is a cheap
fumble recovery against Arkansas in the final minutes, a close win
at Syracuse to begin the year and doubt cast from skeptics
coast-to-coast.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane, a usually feeble program from an upstart conference,
also went undefeated this season. But the Green Wave didn't have
the tradition and monster conference affiliation that the Vols
have. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the right way to decide champions. In a playoff, the
Green Wave might keep winning and might even knock off a Tennessee
or Florida State. But that's how it is.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Vols earned this shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a kind of magical year for us, yeah,'' Vols
quarterback Tee Martin said. ``But sometimes, you work for that
magic. Look at what's happened. Look at the Arkansas game. If our
defensive lineman doesn't bust his tail if he thinks the game is
over, then maybe he wouldn't have gotten to that ball. You can
always be fortunate, but you have to do the job even when you're
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 2: If you don't win them all, then win the ones that
count. The ones late in the year. The ones against the rivals. The
conference-championship games.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes couldn't beat Michigan State late in the year. The
K-State Wildcats couldn't hold off Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 title
game. The Bruins couldn't stop Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Seminoles came back from an inexplicable
early-season loss to North Carolina State and showed how title
contenders get on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed how you rebound from adversity and put together a
great season,'' FSU safety Dexter Jackson said. ``If Ohio State
thinks it should be here, it should have beaten Michigan State.
That's just how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what the 'Noles know from experience, having won the
1993 national title with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   And after watching all the bowls thus far, the Seminoles also
now know that no team could legitimately cast doubt on their
championship if they can defeat Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out about as good as it could have,'' FSU coach
Bobby Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes didn't get the romp over the Aggies they so
desperately craved. The Wildcats and Bruins didn't even get a bowl
win.
</P>
<P>
   Geeks can power down their computers. Coaches and fans can quit
their moaning and lobbying. This might not be the best way to
determine a champion, but it's the way it's done now, and this time
it worked.
</P>
<P>
   One game. One champion.

FORMER COWBOY HALEY RETURNS TO 49ERS TO ``GO GET BRETT FAVRE''
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ For three years, the Cowboys have been
trying to sign ``the next Charles Haley.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the San Francisco 49ers signed the original, just in
time for today's first-round playoff game vs. Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back to the 49ers feels like old times,'' Haley said
yesterday. ``My job is simple and plain: Put my hand down and go
get Brett Favre. That's what I'm here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual signing is another odd twist to a
glorious-but-bizarre career for Haley, a former NFL defensive
player of the year and a five-time Super Bowl winner who was run
out of San Francisco and acquired by Dallas in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Haley, 34, hasn't played football in two years. He retired from
the Cowboys after being limited to playing five games in 1996
because of chronic back problems. He participated on two Super Bowl
champions with San Francisco in the first six years of his career.
He was on three Super Bowl champions with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't spell `Super Bowl' without Charles Haley,''
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones once said, explaining how Haley's
presence made him such an important puzzle piece.
</P>
<P>
   After using a trio of premier picks in the past three years
seeking Haley-like defensive ends, the Cowboys earlier this season
contemplated re-signing Haley. But the Cowboys passed, as did San
Francisco, which worked him out on Sept. 1 but bowed to concerns
about his back and his possibly negative locker-room effect.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Haley has mellowed since his retirement, a change
perhaps motivated by the illness of his daughter, who has leukemia.
Still, Haley said his volatile reputation might be a factor in the
way he's perceived.
</P>
<P>
   But, Haley said yesterday, ``I'm not one to put a lot of weight
into whether someone cares whether I'm here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley probably won't be a locker-room favorite with the 49ers,
though coach Steve Mariucci said yesterday that the acquisition was
approved by his ``Dirty Dozen,'' a group of 49ers veteran team
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has needs. Defensive ends Roy Barker and Chris
Doleman are limited by injuries, and tackle Bryant Young is out
with a broken leg. San Francisco had 46 sacks in its first 12
games, but has five sacks in the four games since Young was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Haley is coming to do a job,'' Doleman said. ``We're
on the eve of creating history. We have to put personal feelings
and a lot of stuff aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley underplayed concerns about his back, though he has had
three recent surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be OK,'' Haley said. ``We'll see on Sunday. We'll
see on Sunday.''

UMASS DEFENSE KEYS VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST _ The University of Massachusetts and Virginia Tech
Saturday combined on an effort that set college basketball back
several years. So much so that the second half of their Atlantic 10
contest was played around the same time of Duke Ellington's first
piano lesson.
</P>
<P>
   But by late in the second half, UMass's occasionally sporadic
offense began to catch up with its reliable, aggressive defense. It
enabled the Minutemen to put together several strong sequences at
both ends of the floor and that fast forwarded the game back to the
present, giving UMass a 55-40 league-opening triumph before a
listless Mullins Center crowd of 6,415.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Charlton Clarke had a game-high 18 points and added three
assists to lead the Minutemen (4-6, 1-0), who bounced back from a
disheartening overtime home loss to Davidson Tuesday. The Minutemen
led, 23-17, at halftime, increased their lead to 37-25 with 13:38
remaining, then put the game away after Tech cut it to 6 with 6:08
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Minuteman surge was led by sophomore reserve center Kitwana
Rhymer (6 points, 2 rebounds, 2 blocks in 12 minutes). With UMass
ahead, 40-32, with 5:31 left, he rejected a shot by center Russ
Wheeler and the Minutemen converted on the other end on a free
throw by Mike Babul. Monty Mack made two more free throws after
UMass got the rebound on Babul's miss of his second freebie.
</P>
<P>
   That was the start of a 9-2 run that put the Minutemen ahead,
49-33, with 3:03 remaining. ``That was one of the biggest plays of
the game,'' said UMass coach Bruiser Flint of Rhymer's block.
``He's showing that he's getting more comfortable on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech (5-5, 0-1), whose offense struggled with UMass's defensive
pressure, never came closer than 12 after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute worth a flip, and whenever we did we didn't
hit our shots,'' said Virginia Tech coach Bobby Hussey, who was
putting it mildly. Tech's 40 points was its lowest output since the
1966-67 season, and it tied a Mullins Center low set by the College
of Charleston last season. The Hokies' 14 field goals set a Mullins
record.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, it appeared Tech would struggle to reach the
40-point mark; it didn't tally 20 points until 16:24 of the second
half. It also shot 31 percent from the floor and had just five
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we only had nine assists, so we weren't much better,''
said Flint, whose team finished with its lowest point total since
its 46-point output in its first-round NCAA tournament loss to
Saint Louis last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen shot just 39 percent from the floor and saw
leading scorer Mack finish with 9 points (10 below his average) and
No. 2 scorer Lari Ketner attempt just four shots and finish with 2
points (10 below his average).
</P>
<P>
   But Ketner tied teammate Chris Kirkland with a team-high eight
rebounds. And though Kirkland hit just two of 10 shots from the
floor, he held Hokies forward Rolan Roberts to just 8 points, 7
below his average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won, but it was ugly,'' said Flint. ``It was not one of the
most oustanding offensive performances by either team. Defensively
we were able to clamp down on them, we didn't turn the ball over
much (eight turnovers), and we made the baskets when we needed to
make them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two seasons UMass has offset a sub-par pre-January
slate with a string of victories to lift it back into postseason
contention. The Minutemen say Saturday's win could be the start of
such.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes us 1-0 in the league, and to us it's a great start
to the new year,'' said Clarke. ``We're trying to put last year
(the start of this season) behind us. Now it's time to make our run
but we have to take it one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass hosts Iona Tuesday.

HUSKIES SPREAD THE WEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ Before Saturday, the University of Connecticut and
West Virginia women's basketball teams had played seven times
dating back to 1982, with the Mountaineers winning just once.
Saturday was not the time to try and reverse that trend.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies left no question as to why they are ranked No. 1 in
the country and have a perfect record after 11 games. Seven players
scored in double figures as they soundly defeated West Virginia,
116-71, before a sold-out crowd of 16,294 at the Civic Center. It
was the eighth time this season the Huskies scored more than 100
points, breaking their team record.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Geno Auriemma passed the minutes around and used 13
players. They shot 65 percent from the floor, compared to 34
percent by West Virginia. It didn't seem to matter that the Huskies
were missing starting point guard Sue Bird, who's out for the
season with an ACL injury, or forward Swin Cash, who is out with a
stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody's missing, they all try a little harder,''
Auriemma said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they did. Despite the disappointing first-half play by
Svetlana Abrosimova, who was 0 for 2 from the floor and made only
one free throw, she came back in the second half to hit 9 for 10,
ending up as high scorer with 23 points. Adding to the Huskies'
totals were Shea Ralph (20), Tamika Williams (14), Asjha Jones
(12), Amy Duran and Kelly Schumacher (11 each), and Stacy Hansmeyer
(10).
</P>
<P>
   High scorers for West Virginia were Maria Tchobanova and Rebecca
Burbridge, with 15 each, followed by Val Zona with 11.
</P>
<P>
   With seven minutes to go in the first half, after West Virginia
had tossed in its third 3-point basket in four minutes, Auriemma
took off his blue jacket and stood up to bark at his players,
fearing they would let their 12-point lead slip away. But it's
doubtful he was really worried. The Mountaineers, who had not had
the lead since the score was 4-2 in the opening two minutes, could
not contest for the Huskies' hot-shooting, fast-breaking play and
never got closer than 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Huskies' surges that seemed to frustrate the
Mountaineers. UConn took off with a 20-7 run in the first half, but
was slowed when West Virginia narrowed the gap with two layups and
two free throws. Not to worry (despite their coach's yelling), the
Huskies seemed to say. They came back with two rebounds by freshman
forward Williams, followed by two layups, and after a run of their
own, took a 54-28 lead into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play in spurts, and any time you drop your head, they're
going to take advantage of that,'' said West Virginia coach Alexis
Basil. ``And they have a lot of depth, they can match up with
anybody in the country. And the intensity that the young players
have coming off the bench is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her cold first half, Abrosimova said she didn't look at a
stat sheet at halftime, ``but I felt I played horrible.'' The
coach, she acknowleged, told her to get going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, during the game he was screaming at me,'' she said. ``I
made some bad decisions. I bave no idea why, the coach says it's
all in your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma didn't deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if Svet's mad at me, you've got to be mad at
somebody to play this game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Abrosimova's second-half heroics, the crowd
erupted when, with 9 seconds to go, rarely-used guard Courtney
Gaine took a back-pass steal by Hansmeyer and went in for a layup.
No wonder that Gaine watched the basket go in, and exulted; those
were her first 2 points of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The next test for UConn is the game against No. 2 Tennessee next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph, who was 8 for 8 from the field, said she's ready, and
admitted that maybe the Lady Vols are looking over their shoulders
at the undefeated Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know what they're thinking, but I'd be a little
concerned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Saturday's score, they probably are.

 &HT;    WEATHER: Train echo system drops 31 inches of rain in 9 hours in
Palm Beach County, Fla.
 &HT;    From staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A violent storm named for a locomotive
steamed through northern Palm Beach County without warning early
Saturday, fueling a tornado and dropping 31 inches of rain in nine
hours that flooded hundreds of homes and streets.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service, which had predicted only a 20
percent chance of rain before the storm, said the county was hit by
a ``train echo'' system that is extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Gardens suffered the worst. Water creeped into more
than 100 homes scattered throughout the city, police said, from the
older neighborhoods east of I-95 to the higher-priced homes in the
PGA National community. And that's conservative, said fire shift
commander Evan Bestland.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere cars were stranded and streets were impassable by
midday. The parking lot of Gardens Park Plaza on the southwest
corner of Military Trail and PGA Boulevard turned into a lake.
Winn-Dixie Market Place, Eckerd Drugs and a dozen small business
had up to five inches of water running through their aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disaster to us,'' said Value Card and Gifts owner
Suzanne Slate, who estimates between $20,000 and $30,000 in damage,
plus whatever business is lost. ``We lost everything we made for
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Highway Patrol officials closed all northbound lanes on
Interstate 95 from 45th Street to Blue Heron Boulevard Saturday at
about 12:30 p.m. after Riviera Beach firefighters reported watching
a concrete construction extension start to crumble, making a half
circle about 40 feet deep. A portion of the sand foundation
supporting the extension had been washed away during the early
morning storm.
</P>
<P>
   At a makeshift command center on Old Dixie Road and 10th Street
in Riviera Beach, Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputies said about
eight units assisted Riviera Beach police with road closings.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest-hit area was at Old Dixie and 10th Street, where
all that was left of one traffic light was the top third. The
yellow and green portion was found nearly two blocks away in a
restaurant parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   At Mom &AMP; Dad's Restaurant and Take Out, manager Lonnie Lovett
said his sign was found about three blocks away. Inside, the
employee time clock stopped at 5:39 and an employee who was inside
when the twister hit lamented his car's broken windows.
</P>
<P>
   The series of storms called a train echo began pounding the
northern part of the county just after 2:30 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters at the National Weather Service in Miami say they
could not have predicted the pummeling storm, but its special
characteristics were clearly recognizable on radar screens once it
started.
</P>
<P>
   In a train echo, heavy showers line up in an area like ``like
boxcars on a train,'' said meteorologist Scott Carroll of the
National Weather Service. ``Echo'' is a radar term for a repetitive
weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, showers that carried north past the
Florida Straits, and then up through Miami-Dade and Broward
counties eventually collided with moisture and air moving west
across the Atlantic Ocean from the Bahamas and into Palm Beach
County, said meteorologist Wayne Colin of the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of those two weather systems spawned a diagonal line
of thunderstorms and rain showers stretching southeast of West Palm
Beach northwest to the Martin-Palm Beach County line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole area blew up,'' Colin said.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense of the showers hit Riviera Beach, where a small
tornado hit a four-block area, and 31 inches of rain was recorded
by a gauge in the C-17 canal in North Palm Beach that is controlled
by the South Florida Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was not related to other weather systems or fronts
moving in and out of Florida, forecasters said. Unlike typical
thunderstorms that flare up and move by rapidly, train echo rains
grind away along a single track without let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps raining over the same area time after time after
time,'' Colin said. ``There's almost no way to forecast if it's
going to happen and where it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of the county had heavy rain _ 3.75 inches was
recorded at Palm Beach International Airport _ but were spared of
floods because the locomotive-like rain confined itself to one
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those freakish weather things that happen,'' said
district spokesman John Neuharth. ``It caught everybody by
surprise.''

FIESTA PARADE CROWD CHEERS GLENN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bands and floats got the expected cheers from the crowd
watching the 28th Annual MicroAge Fiesta Bowl parade Saturday. But
the crowd of 400,000 saved their biggest applause for John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and his fellow crew members from the space shuttle
Discovery, riding in a convertible stretch limousine, were welcomed
with a standing ovation along the four-mile parade route.
</P>
<P>
   Paradegoers rushed up to Glenn for a photograph, some thrusting
their kids into his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him. Our kids are part of history,'' said Gina Riordan,
28, from Rockville Center, N.Y., after getting a picture of Glenn
and her 3-year-old daughter, Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave a thumbs-up and the kids saluted him and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Those seated just north of Indian School Road were lucky enough
to get five whole minutes of the oldest astronaut. The parade came
to a standstill because the float in front of Glenn caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Oil leaked from the engine powering the ``Undersea Adventure''
float, causing lots of smoke and a few flames.
</P>
<P>
   Neptune, we have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the capsule-like driver's seat, Bob Towne, 51, of
Mesa, said flames shot to his neck before he doused them.
</P>
<P>
   The mermaid riding atop the float had no idea it was aflame
until the crowd told her in jeers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was saying, `Can you swim?' and I said, `Can you say
fire?' '' said Vanice French, 50, of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Children riding in the submarine dashed off without injury. The
mermaid, who can't walk on dry land because of her fin, was carried
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have this problem under the sea,'' said the ocean
nymph, who preferred to stay anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only glitch among the 83 entries.
</P>
<P>
   The grand-prize float featured Peter Pan on a flight to
Neverneverland. It was one of the few flights not delayed by the
snowstorm in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The second-prize float, sponsored by a cell-phone company, had
Little Red Riding Hood going wireless to alert the woodsman that
she was being chased by a big, bad wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The marching bands that received the most applause were from the
University of Tennessee and Florida State, the universities who
square off for Monday's Fiesta Bowl championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State fans gave out spirited Seminoles chops and
Tennessee band members were greeted with shouts of ``Go Vols.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and his wife walked the route,
alongside the convertible carrying their children. He waved and
smiled like a guy running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Although most watchers sat in the traditional lawn chairs and on
blankets curbside, some found creative perches from which to view
the parade.
</P>
<P>
   People used stepladders, climbed billboards, stood atop RVs and
climbed into paloverde trees. Several sat on rooftops of downtown
building or peered from their apartment balconies.
</P>
<P>
   Some assured themselves a good spot by buying bleacher seats in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Sterline Seaboch, 45, of Phoenix, was one of them. But he didn't
want to be.
</P>
<P>
   `It's almost un-American,'' said Seaboch, who said he was in the
bleachers only because he got them from a Fiesta Bowl connection.
``See that guy back there with the kid on his shoulders? That's how
you watch a parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Bartley was a guy who had a kid on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good shape for it after the block party,'' said
Bartley, 41, of Chandler, hoisting 5-year-old Kaleb on his
shoulders. Bartley said his son was on the same perch during the
New Year's Eve countdown on Mill Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   People lined three to four rows deep along the parade in most
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Some showed up early.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Jardine, 40, of Phoenix, was up out at 5:30 a.m. setting up
22 seats right across from the television cameras set up for a
live, local broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only certain place where the bands play,'' he
said, explaining his choice of spot.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine has dragged his reluctant family to the parade every
year for about 15 years, he said. He would never settle for
watching it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between reading about life and living
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Alice, didn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very happy watching it on TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some showed up late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really lucked out,'' said Steve Frisch, 46, who showed up
with his wife, Nan, 47, and their 7-year-old daughter, Sienna, just
20 minutes before the parade.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up with a prime, uncrowded spot and a parking space
just a few yards from Central Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Frisch said. ``I've lived here all my life
and this is my first Fiesta Bowl parade.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife wanted to keep their spot a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them it's private,'' she said, ``or we'll never get it
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret spot is on Central and Orange Drive. Don't tell
anybody. &QL;

UCLA PONDERS OFFSEASON QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The season ends and the questions begin. Among
those UCLA must answer in the coming weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Will Kris Farris bolt for the NFL? Farris, a junior offensive
tackle and the Outland Trophy winner, is expected to announce his
decision early this week. (The deadline for underclassmen to
declare is Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Farris said there's a 90 percent chance he'll
leave school. After the Rose Bowl, Farris certainly sounded like he
had played his last game.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed two holding penalties: ``They could call holding
on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to note the final sack of Cade McNown ``came from
the right side.'' (Farris plays left tackle.)
</P>
<P>
   He implied he has maxed out collegiately: ``I played the game of
my life, but I'm just a lowly lineman. I could play great, and we
could still lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Will strength coach Kevin Yoxall depart? Yoxall is mulling an
offer from Auburn and said he'll decide this week. He worked with
several Auburn assistants at Texas Christian in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking to leave, but (Auburn) came to me,'' said
Yoxall, who was one of coach Bob Toledo's first hires in Feb. '96.
``UCLA has done a great job in putting things together to try to
get me to stay. They've given me a lot to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   How important is Yoxall? Ask Toledo to account for UCLA's recent
rise to prominence, and the first thing he mentions is Yoxall's
impact.
</P>
<P>
   What of the defensive staff? Toledo will meet with his
assistants Monday to review performance and plot strategy for '99.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo declined to discuss potential changes until he meets with
the staff, but defense is obviously his priority.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible changes:
</P>
<P>
   Switching to a 4-3 alignment from the 3-4 set used this season.
The Bruins will have a slew of big, experienced linemen next
season, and a 4-3 would best suit the talent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 4-3 would place freshman Robert Thomas, perhaps
UCLA's most gifted player, in his natural position: middle
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Reshuffling the defensive staff. Nick Aliotti will be retained
as defensive coordinator if he agrees to play a 4-3 and use more
zone coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised if Toledo rearranges assignments: either
Marc Dove (inside linebackers) or Bob Field (outside linebackers)
could replace Aliotti as the secondary coach. That would give
Aliotti more time for tactics and teaching his complicated system.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is assigning two coaches to the line: one
for tackles, one for ends.
</P>
<P>
   Will Borges bolt? Offensive coordinator Al Borges reportedly is
a secondary candidate to fill the vacancy at the University of
Washington, but he lacks two critical ingredients: no Washington
ties and no head coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   However, Borges may be a prime candidate for a coordinator post
in the NFL. Those offers probably would come after six teams (San
Diego, Philadelphia, Carolina, Baltimore, Chicago and Seattle) hire
head coaches.

MCCAIN'S CAMPAIGN REFORM ROLE MAY HURT FUNDRAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 and MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sen. John McCain led the politically unpopular charge for
campaign finance reform, a Republican colleague, Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, offered a humorous perspective on their travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd follow McCain over a cliff,'' said Thompson, a co-sponsor
of the legislation. ``In fact, I've already done it.''
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against the legislation could eventually cost McCain
critical support from certain conservative constituencies, among
them big business.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, like Thompson, revels in the role of political
maverick, a Republican risk-taker willing to venture into new,
potentially dangerous territory even if it isn't on the GOP's
strategic map.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has officially set his sights on the Republican
presidential nomination, McCain faces the most crucial test of his
political career. Can a stubborn nonconformist who delights in
bucking trends win enough support to lead the right-leaning
Republican Party closer to the center?
</P>
<P>
   By nearly all accounts, it's a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain is no stranger to the national stage, it is his
first national campaign. Forging a solid national base and raising
the requisite $20 million to finance a competitive race could be
daunting, particularly in what is expected to be a crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there enough McCain types out there to raise that kind of
money? I'm not sure,'' said Ladonna Y. Lee, partner the Eddie Mahe
Co., a Republican consulting firm in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's potential GOP rivals include Thompson, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, wealthy publisher Steve Forbes, former Vice
President Dan Quayle, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
conservative Family Research Council President Gary Bauer, Missouri
Sen. John Ashcroft, Sen. Bob Smith and conservative radio talk-show
host Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned in some circles are Elizabeth Dole, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Vermont Sen. Bob Smith,
former House speaker Newt Gingrich, former New York Congressman
Jack Kemp, and Colin Powell, former head of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said
McCain's occasionally unpopular stands on issues like campaign
finance or a national tobacco tax aren't enough to scuttle his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the fact that I have very serious differences with
him about his approaches to reforming campaign financing, I admire
John,'' Nicholson said. ``He is fully capable of being president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain enters the race with several important positives: a
reputation for speaking his mind, an ability to transcend partisan
concerns and, importantly, a proud Navy career that included 5{
years in a Vietnamese prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring image of McCain's war years is that of a skinny,
silver-haired young man on crutches stepping off a plane after
years of torture and humiliation as a POW. It could help him carve
out a niche among the legions vying for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hero to many people,'' said Greg Stevens, McCain's
media consultant. ``For people who raise money in politics, that
turns them on. It brings them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona GOP National Committeewoman Lori Marsh says McCain's
powerful personal history makes him a speaker in demand on the
eastern Republican chicken-dinner circuit.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, McCain must cope in the coming months with
the resurrection of less flattering chapters in his personal
history, notably his membership among the infamous ``Keating
Five,'' his wife Cindy's battle with addiction to prescription
drugs, and his legendary temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   Given those variables and the number of potential candidates
involved, national political observer Larry Sabato said ``it's
literally impossible to know'' how McCain's political fortune will
play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can change overnight,'' said Sabato, a political science
professor at the University of Virginia. ``If you're going to run,
you have to do what McCain did _ throw caution to the wind, dare
and jump in.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush joins the race, the field would probably shrink
dramatically. Thanks to his father's presidency, Bush brings with
him instant name recognition, a national base of support to build
on and reams of recent favorable national publicity.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the other likely GOP candidates falling to the
right of Bush, McCain could find himself competing with Bush for
the same ideological ground. But Bill McInturff, a GOP pollster
advising McCain, said surveys showing Bush as the front-runner
don't mean much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Front-runners stumble,'' McInturff said. ``I did (Bob) Dole in
the last primary and he started at 51 percent in New Hampshire and
ended up at 28. Once you get into a real campaign, high numbers now
start shifting radically.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest there is plenty of room for McCain, whose name
identification nationally is not as high as candidates like Forbes
or Alexander, who have built a national following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Bush, all those people are in mid-single digits,''
McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain barely registered a blip in Iowa and New Hampshire
polls last year. A mid-year straw vote in South Carolina, which
holds the south's first primary, showed Ashcroft, Bush and Keyes as
the top vote-getters.
</P>
<P>
   Though these are inauspicious signs for a dark horse candidate
in a party that traditionally ignores dark horses, the time was
never better for a political outsider to ride to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts across the board say deep public discontent
over the Clinton presidency and recent events on Capitol Hill have
given a leg up to candidates who are outside the political
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a Westerner and Beltway outsider, is certain to capitalize
on those credentials if he runs. So will McCain, Forbes, even
Quayle, who moved to Arizona in part to distance himself from his
Beltway past.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant, predicted McCain will
wage ``a different campaign that cuts across conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's different than a lot of the people that voters see coming
at them, particularly from Washington,'' Stevens said. ``People are
looking for something different. They're looking for people that
are honest. They're looking for people that speak their mind.
They're looking for people that take on special interests. That's a
powerful message.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is still the matter of filling campaign coffers and
finding enough support to make it past the first few primaries.
That means building momentum in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has his work cut out for him. Key McCain aides like chief
of staff Mark Salter and administrative assistant Deb Gullett are
from Iowa and know the political landscape there well. Former New
Hampshire Sen. Warren Rudman is co-chair of McCain's exploratory
committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa GOP Chairman Steve Grubbs noted that McCain is
nonetheless starting late, compared with competitors who spent
years cultivating support. And if many Iowa Republicans know
McCain's name, ``most would probably say they don't know enough
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by comparison, is also starting late but ``he has been on
the front of every national magazine for the last two months,''
Grubbs said. Grubbs has already offered to go to work for Bush if
he runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McCain ``fits quite nicely into the ideological
mold of Iowa voters,'' Grubbs said. He estimated about one-third of
the GOP caucus voters are sympathetic to the Christian right. The
rest are ``establishment voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain seems to move pretty well among all of those
groups,'' Grubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain earns good marks from the Christian Coalition and other
religious groups for his socially conservative positions on
abortion, gay rights, welfare reform and pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Yet moderates have been impressed by a range of actions: his
efforts to rein in campaign spending, to impose a tobacco tax and
his support for renewed diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's willingness to break with the party line also endears
him to the powerful Washington press corps, which has showered him
with favorable coverage. Sabato thinks the mutual admiration could
hurt McCain with party conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their endorsement is usually the kiss of death,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, it could benefit McCain if the primary field
remains crowded. In that case, the powerful national press will
winnow the field by limiting coverage to those it considers key
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain will be in the top tier,'' Sabato predicted. ``They
would never leave their boy out.'' &QL;

DEFENSE, EMOTION LIFT CARDINALS TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It didn't come in drops, it came in waves. A river of
respect that crashed through the dam, washing over them, cleansing
them of their past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone got dominated today,'' Andre Wadsworth chirped in the
locker room. ``Someone got dominated today.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Dallas, where they've learned to snicker about
the Cardinals, a team that was once a nice piece of chew. Soft,
tender and easy to spit out. Just don't get any on your boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team had been kicking us around for a long time,'' Lomas
Brown said. ``I mean, it was time. Time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   And it happened on national television, a game that validated
all the close victories and the last-place schedule. A game when
the country not only accepted the Cardinals, but in all
probability, adopted the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our minds right,'' Simeon Rice said. ``We came in today
and said, `We just got to have it. We just got to have it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So the reward is a trip to Minnesota, a chance to compete with
the best team in the NFL. The reward is 10 victories, one of Jake
Plummer's preseason guarantees. The reward is a struggle that would
end in the sweetest possible way:
</P>
<P>
   Sucking the life out of the Cowboys. Making them quit. Forcing
the most lovesick fans in the world turn on their beloved heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, you've heard them cheer the Cowboys at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Cardinals made them boo the Cowboys in their
own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't get any better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!'' Eric Swann shouted, working
his way past a crowd and into the locker room. Once inside, he
hugged everyone he could find. Players sought him out, wishing him
well. And this giant of a man, this man you want to say doesn't
care, the man who took so much ridiculous grief . . . this man
started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   After wiping away the tears, this space became his:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real proud. Real, real proud. Seeing the guys step up,
Corey Chavous making huge plays, Aeneas Williams just shutting down
Michael Irvin, Jamir Miller piercing through the line, Andre
Wadsworth coming back to where he played his first game and getting
a sack, seeing the destroyer defense being played, a relentless
effort that just took everything away . . . I've just never seen
the defense play like this. I was standing on the field and it was
like I was dreaming. Simply amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't work out for me, but you have to look at the big
picture. All the skepticism, all the critics, all the hopes, all
the dreams, all the expectations . . . they are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made it. And you know what? I'm feeling what they're
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Right then, as Swann started to smile, Rice peeked his head
around the corner. They shook hands, locking the grip and holding
it, these two men who supposedly can't get along. And if you
could've only seen the warmth in their eyes as they gazed at one
another, warrior to warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year,'' Swann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man. That's going to be ugly,'' Rice responded.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone but Swann, there is still some of this year left.
Brown, ever an optimist, openly talks about reaching the Super Bowl
this year, but it's all gravy now. They've broken through the glass
ceiling, and now they're flying.
</P>
<P>
   It was an afternoon when Dave McGinnis, the defensive
coordinator, may have locked up the big chair in another city. An
afternoon when the defense found the way to Troy Aikman, picking
the right seams to deliver an assortment of blitzes. A day when the
Cardinals showed them look after look _ four different schemes on
the first series alone _ until the Cowboys didn't know what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   A day when they gathered at a bar in Scottsdale to watch the
Cardinals. And in the fourth quarter, when it was long past over,
when the owner was shown standing on the sidelines, Bill Bidwill
received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the past has buckled under to the present. The bus is
rolling. And you'd be a fool not to believe. &QL;

IS COLLEGE FOOTBALL TOO COMMERCIAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nike-clad Florida State, coached by Burger King Whopper hawker
Bobby Bowden, will tee it up against Adidas-sponsored Tennessee in
the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, brought to you by ABC-TV, for the
ultimate college football prize _ the Sears National Championship
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And now we pause for a commercial message.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seminoles battle the Volunteers on Monday night in
Tempe, that may not be much of an exaggeration of how ABC's Keith
Jackson kicks off the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   College football and its realigned major bowls are rolling in
corporate sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Bowls and ABC line up the corporate sponsors for the Bowl
Championship Series and first unified title game to help finance
the staggering pot of $13 million per team.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say fans don't mind the commercialization of college
football. But some football diehards, like John MacDonald of Tempe,
wonder if it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me to sit through a college football
game, as much I love them,'' said MacDonald, an Arizona Supreme
Court communications officer who grew up on Frank Kush-era Sun
Devil football and a fledgling Fiesta Bowl. ``Big-time college
athletics and commercialization have become forever entangled, and
it makes me wonder if the big time is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsor dollars funneled towards sporting events,
including college athletics, are expected to surge to $5.1 billion
next year, more than double its 1993 level, said Lance Helgeson,
managing editor of the ``IEG Sponsorship'' ``Report,'' a newsletter
that tracks sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Frazier, Fiesta Bowl president, said the Fiesta Bowl has
been forced to boost corporate involvement to stay competitive with
the other top bowls and remain in the championship game rotation.
``The Arizona Republic'' is among dozens of Fiesta Bowl sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of fans that would like for it to remain pure,''
he said. But he said the sponsors help keep ticket prices down and
they have gilded the payoff to the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Each of eight BCS teams will receive about $13 million, which
they will share with their respective conferences. That helps
support other college sports and student athletes, said Frazier,
senior associate athletic director at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   But the blitz of advertising drowns out the cheerleaders, bands
and referees' whistles, and hurts the college game experience,
MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the second half of the ASU-Notre Dame game was the most
enjoyable game in a long time because a stadium power failure
pulled the plug on the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, an ASU basketball team manager from 1980-84, takes
his kids to high school games to get a pure football experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still go to ASU games and I still enjoy the Fiesta Bowl, but
it's different. It's the difference between the county fair and
Disneyland. Is one more enjoyable than another? Is one better
because it's bigger and brighter and louder? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Tostitos and ABC officials say they think most fans understand
the commercial marriage of the sponsors, networks and bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Tostitos spokeswoman Lynn Markley said the company has taken the
sponsorship ``to the next level, but we do it tastefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devil Stadium undergoes a transformation for the Fiesta
Bowl, with hundreds of yards of bunting resembling the design on
Tostitos bags. The field and the players' uniforms also are adorned
with a logo in which the Tostitos name is the dominant image, about
three times larger than Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tostitos says the sponsorship has helped the company create more
consumer awareness of its products.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl is a huge national platform, Markley said, and
``it was something we could own, whereas a lot of events are
sponsorship cluttered.''
</P>
<P>
   Teri Wagner, ABC marketing director, said the BCS sponsors _
Tostitos Fiesta, Nokia Sugar Bowl, FedEx Orange Bowl and Rose Bowl
presented by AT&AMP;T _ use restraint in their advertising to avoid any
fan backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors are interested in the rub-off effect of being linked
with the passion of college football and its wholesomeness, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds corny, but I really believe that,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that college football games are huge commercial
ventures. The ``granddaddy of them all,'' the Rose Bowl, has its
roots in the first Tournament of Roses, staged in 1890 to promote
California's warm climate. Football became a permanent part of the
Pasadena festivities in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   All the bowl games that have followed, including the 28-year-old
Fiesta Bowl, were launched by civic leaders to attract visitors and
show off their communities, said Mark Eschenfelder, an assistant
economics professor at Robert Morris College in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logical way of promoting your community, and the bowls
have gotten a lot better at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Fiesta Bowl arguably has done the best job
of elevating fan and corporate interest, said David Carter, a
sports management professor at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fiesta Bowl has pulled off that last chip, so to speak, to
be one of the premier bowls,'' said Carter, author of ``Keeping
Score:'' ``An Inside Look At Sports Marketing''.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tostitos is really the poster child for what's right with
corporate sponsorship,'' and fans have come to accept sponsors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Roper Organization survey reported in his book and the
``IEG Sponsorship'' ``Report,'' 76 percent of the public and 80
percent of sports enthusiasts agreed that ``corporate sponsorship
is a fair price to pay to keep sports on free TV and hold down
ticket prices.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of what corporations get for supporting bowls, Carter
cites the experience of John Hancock Financial Services, which
sponsored the Sun Bowl in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hancock spent $1.6 million sponsoring the bowl and
received the equivalent of $4.86 million in advertising value,
Carter writes in ``Keeping'' ``Score.'' That included ``1.2 billion
impressions _ the number of times the consumer is exposed to the
company name or logo, such as on billboards, TV, or print media.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl pioneered title sponsorships in 1985 when
Sunkist Growers signed a five-year deal to underwrite the game and
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Other bowls followed suit, except for the Rose, which resisted
sponsorship. For 1999, AT&AMP;T became the ``presenting sponsor.'' It's
the ``Rose Bowl presented by AT&AMP;T,'' rather than the ``AT&AMP;T Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When that was announced, people said that was the final piece
and the world's coming to an end,'' said Mark Mandell, ABC director
of media relations. ``But the Rose Bowl is still going to keep its
tradition _ dignified and classy _ without logos plastered end to
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he wonders whether the presenting sponsorship is an
interim step and that there will be some ``mission creep,'' in
military terminology, so that eventually the Rose Bowl adds a title
sponsor and becomes commercial.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald said he would hate to see that. The absence of
commercial signs in the Rose Bowl and other stadiums like Notre
Dame's is something that stood out when he went to South Bend,
Ind., and to Pasadena for the 1997 Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his fondest memories of college football occurred
near the end of that Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was around dusk, drizzling rain and it was cold. It was a
great game. ASU was behind at the time and things were looking
bleak,'' MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mist, steam was rising off the Sun Devil players and you
could see their breath. There were a lot of fans in maroon and
gold, and scarlet and gray in the stadium but not one advertising
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife to look around for a minute. This is what
college football is all about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Jake Plummer scored a go-ahead touchdown, but it ended
badly when Ohio State answered. Still, MacDonald said that moment
is frozen in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   For fans like him, the bloom would be off the Rose if it got on
the corporate bandwagon with the Fiesta and the other bowls. &QL;

 &HT;    WEATHER: A flooded New Year in South Florida
 &HT;    With STORMS-MAIN, TORNADO.
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Highland Pines woke up Saturday to find
their neighborhood engulfed in a 3-foot-deep lake _ full of raw
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look out the window and see a geyser of water pouring
with brown things floating...We're catching hell back here,'' said
Vern Wiggins, who was able to move his car to dry land at the
neighborhood entrance at PGA Boulevard, just west of Military.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Anderson wasn't so fortunate. His Ford Taurus was half
underwater, and 6 inches of water flowed through his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The china cabinet was ruined. The new dining table, still
unassembled, was lost. So were his children's toys, shoes and
clothes. Still, he kept his spirits up. It was, he said, all he
could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we don't have to water the Christmas tree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Tillman, whose house was the last to escape the water,
ferried neighbors in his canoe and warned the children about
playing in the lake.
</P>
<P>
   This flood wasn't bad as the one in 1996, residents say. But
they fear that with all the development, things will only get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any problems until they built Ballens Isle,''
said Donna Morris, a 10-year resident.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Highland Pines is in the county
(Palm Beach County) but surrounded by cities that approve all the
development. Compounding matters, a dam at the intersection of
Canal C-17 and Military Trail blocks the natural flow of water.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins has been waiting for a new storm drainage for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody wants to take responsiblity,'' Wiggins said. ``Each
government just points at the other. It's a comedy of errors. But
when you got people with 6 inches of water in their house,
somebody's got to do something.''

CAR FANS GET GLIMPSE OF FUTURE IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If there's one thing to be learned at the Greater
Los Angeles Auto Show this week, it's that the year 2000 will
deliver a lot more than a computer virus.
</P>
<P>
   How about a sporty new Chrysler Chronos instead?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the fact that we're only a few days into 1999:
Every major auto maker in the world is participating in the
exhibition at the Los Angeles Convention Center, which started
Saturday and runs through Jan. 10, and most are already trying to
put Y2K in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical for auto shows -- especially at the major shows
-- to give people an early look at next year's car,'' said Danny
Jacobs, who was displaying the not-yet-for-sale Honda S2000
roadster. ``It just happens next year is the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs is a ``product specialist'' for Honda. In layman's terms,
he's the well-dressed guy who stands on the giant turntable with a
microphone pointing at the car.
</P>
<P>
   By early Saturday afternoon, Jacobs had the type of swooning
crowd associated with Tony Bennett -- with consumers packed five
deep around his rotating stage, hanging on his every word as he
described the cherry red coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Art Gomez was mesmerized, even though he came for a $20,000
Dodge Intrepid. The projected $30,000 sticker price on the Honda
was way out of his price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never know when you're going to hit it big and be able
to buy a toy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The show features more than a dozen prototypes for the year
2000, even though most will not enter showroom floors until the
fall. Dealers are clearly trying to convey that there will be a car
for everyone in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find the 2000 Lincoln LS too domestic, there's the
2000 Jaguar S-type luxury sedan. For those who find the 2000 BMW M5
too regal, there's the Nissan 2000 Frontier four-door.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, customers this week will have to take a
look-but-don't-touch approach to the 2000 cars and settle for a
chance to slide into the already-ancient 1999 models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one gentleman tell me that we were treating him like a
horse, dangling a carrot in front of him,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,000 carrots dangling in front of consumers
on more than 760,000 square feet of convention floor, including
cars, trucks, minivans, sport-utility and alternative-fuel
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   More than one product specialist said the Los Angeles show is
one of the biggest in the country, along with Detroit, New York,
Chicago and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. today and 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on
weekdays. Admission is $7, and children 12 and under are free when
accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Brenda Gross of suburban Sherman Oaks hadn't been to
an auto show in 15 years, and they were marveling at both the
technological and social advancements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't as many girls in swimsuits and evening wear
pointing at things,'' Brenda Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   David Valla wore a conservative, double-breasted suit as he
pointed at the new Rolls-Royces and Bentleys in one of the pricier
displays.
</P>
<P>
   While the pristine autos were kept behind a short Plexiglas
barrier like the chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo, Valla quietly
admitted that anyone in the three-deep crowd could cross over at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need that little barrier,'' he said. ``It has to seem more
unattainable than it really is.''

SHARKS BEAT SLANDERS, 4-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ After Saturday's 4-3 overtime loss to the San
Jose Sharks, the Islanders' fourth straight defeat, a disgusted
Mike Milbury considered shaking up the team before the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly something we'll have to think about the next
48 hours as we get ready for Chicago,'' Milbury, the Islanders'
coach and general manager, said when he was asked what was next for
his team. ``But this is not acceptable, from a coaching standpoint,
from a managing standpoint, from a player's standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we'll do,'' added the coach, who seemed more
upset with this loss than any of the recent losses at Florida,
Tampa Bay and Chicago. ``But we'll have to do something to get it
going in the right direction. It doesn't get any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   As the playoffs slid further from the Islanders' reach Saturday,
Milbury was left with these questions to study: Make a trade?
Promote a few farmhands? Bench some veterans?
</P>
<P>
   Something has to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the mid-December signing of Zigmund Palffy, who scored
twice Saturday, the team needs another playmaking forward. There
are a few players in the minors _ wing Warren Luhning tops that
list _ who deserve a shot. There are several veterans _ including
Bryan Smolinski and Robert Reichel _ who merit a seat in the press
box, and Milbury will not hesitate to do that. Ask defenseman Scott
Lachance, who sat out this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury made his comments after the Islanders had lost to
another struggling team, dropping their record to 13-22-2, last in
the Atlantic Conference and 9 points out of the last playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders fell behind by 2-0 in the first period against the
Sharks (11-16-8), came back in the second period and went down by
3-2 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, the Islanders came back to send the game into
overtime. It seemed to be anybody's game, but less than two minutes
into the extra session, a blown coverage led to Marco Sturm's
one-timer, which beat Islanders goaltender Marcel Cousineau (25
saves). The Sharks' Steve Shields made 18 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders performed miserably in the first period and were
fortunate to trail by only two goals. The Sharks' first goal was
scored shorthanded, the other came on a blunder by the Islanders'
goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ricci, who scored twice, banged in a cross-ice pass from
Stephane Matteau at 11 minutes 4 seconds. Owen Nolan, the Sharks'
captain, scored San Jose's second goal on a dump-in. He flipped the
puck on the Islanders' net from inside the blue line, and it got
behind Cousineau, who appeared to have been off guard. Nolan's
goal, at 13:43, was just his fourth of the season.

   The Islanders were as inspired as they have been at the start of
the second period, scoring two early power-play goals to tie the
score. Kenny Jonsson tallied the first. The other came from Palffy,
who has 5 points in six games since ending his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson's power-play goal at 5:11 of the second period ended the
Islanders' scoreless streak at 178 minutes 55 seconds, a team
record. The old record, set in 1973, was 176:11.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Ricci gave the Sharks a late 3-2 lead with
a power-play goal at 16:34. Palffy tied the score 17 seconds later
by one-timing a pass from Reichel past Shields.

CARDINALS CRUSH COWBOYS' PLAYOFF DREAMS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The 1998 Cowboys will be known as the first team
to win every regular-season game in the NFC East. But they couldn't
win the game that counted most.
</P>
<P>
   An offense of superstars reverted to its woeful ways of last
month, and a defense with Deion Sanders was not enough to stop the
underdog Arizona Cardinals, who pulled off a 20-7 upset in a
wild-card playoff game yesterday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And so after a promising 8-3 start, the Cowboys' season is over.
It might not be down to the rock-bottom depths of 1989, but the
Cowboys franchise was sent spiraling downward. Besides anger,
despair and shock, the feeling among players in the losing locker
room is that team owner Jerry Jones needs to make changes to a club
that dropped four of its past six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nucleus of the team is not getting any younger, and it's
time to step up or step out,'' said Sanders, who played for the
first time since Nov. 22. ``I couldn't put up with it if I was Mr.
Jones. If this was my money, it's got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Said quarterback Troy Aikman: ``Sometimes there is a tendency to
look at some of the guys that have been here through the better
years and then everyone wants to think that this is the same
Cowboys team. We're not the same team. We're relying on a lot of
different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the window closing?'' he asked rhetorically. ``For a lot of
people, that window was shut a long time ago. We don't have a lot
of the players we had when we had that success. We're looking
through a different window right now.''
</P>
<P>
   History was on the Cowboys' side yesterday. They had not lost to
the Cardinals in Dallas since 1989. The Cowboys had defeated the
Cardinals 16 of the past 17 times. They had not lost a home playoff
game since 1983. The Cardinals had not won a playoff game anywhere
since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But history couldn't help the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had averaged 36.5 points in the two regular-season
games with the Cardinals. But they needed a 6-yard Aikman-to-Billy
Davis pass with 3:33 remaining to avoid being shut out by the
21st-ranked defense in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who entered the game with the second-highest postseason
passer rating, had a miserable afternoon. He completed 22 of 49
passes (44 percent) for 191 yards. He was sacked four times and
threw three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not show up to play today,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was not alone in his offensive misery. His receivers
dropped five passes. Michael Irvin, shut out the last time the
Cowboys played Arizona, did a little better with four receptions.
But he was not a factor against Pro Bowl Cardinals cornerback
Aeneas Williams, who had two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pressured us,'' wide receiver Patrick Jeffers said, who
had a game-high seven receptions for 92 yards. ``Sometimes, we'd be
open but we didn't protect long enough to let Troy get us the ball.
And other times, he had time to throw and we couldn't get open.
They were not playing a lot of bump and run. They were just sitting
on some things where it was hard to run our routes.''

DISTRIBUTOR OF ARAB PAPER RECEIVED PHONE THREAT BEFORE FIRE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days before an attack on the Queens company that
distributes the influential international newspaper Al Hayat and a
number of other Arabic-language newspapers, an unidentified caller
left a vague but threatening message in Arabic on the company's
answering machine, Yazid Mourani, its president, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the holidays, the company, Media Marketing Research
Inc., discovered the message only after an attack on its
distribution center in Long Island City, N.Y., in Queens County, in
which a car was driven through a steel gate in front of the
building and set on fire at 4:30 p.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was someone cursing, but there were no specifics, no
nothing,'' Mourani said.
</P>
<P>
   The caller did not mention any of the newspapers handled by the
company, he added, and the poor quality of the tape makes it
difficult to make out either the Arab dialect or the nationality of
the caller.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the car, a stolen 1992 Mitsubishi, did not hit
the warehouse building and did not contain explosives. No one was
injured at the warehouse, at 25-25 51st Avenue, and there was only
minor damage to the gate. But the fire gutted the car.
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokesman said Saturday that the
investigators had not determined a motive for the attack or its
specific target.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Terrorist Task Force, which includes local law
enforcement agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
responded to the fire. A spokesman for the New York City office of
the FBI said that the agency had not decided whether it would stay
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the sorting-out process is still continuing
here, as to what happened and who is responsible,'' said the
spokesman, Joseph Valiquette. ``Our interest is, obviously, to see
if those events would warrant a federal investigation. That
determination has not been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Hayat, which is printed and distributed in the New York City
area by Media Marketing Research, was the target of a letter bomb
campaign at several of its overseas offices and its London
headquarters two years ago. One of the bombs exploded in the mail
room at the London office, injuring two workers. The other bombs,
including those sent to the Washington and New York bureaus of the
paper, were discovered before they blew up.
</P>
<P>
   Mourani said his company has been threatened before because of
its association with Al Hayat. In May, he said, a caller threatened
to blow up the distribution company's building but nothing came of
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has not received any threats recently, a
spokeswoman for Al Hayat in London said Saturday. Reporters in the
paper's bureaus in Washington and New York also said they had
received no threats.
</P>
<P>
   Al Hayat, owned by a relative of the Saudi royal family, is
widely considered the world's most prestigious Arabic-language
newspaper. It prints a broad spectrum of political opinion and
recently covered the activities of Islamic fundamentalist groups in
Egypt and the dispute between leaders of Iraq and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Al Hayat, the Queens company distributes another
Saudi-owned international daily newspaper, Asharq Al Awsat; the
semiofficial Egyptian daily Al Ahram; the independent Palestinian
daily Al Quds; and a variety of New York City publications in
Arabic.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   WOLF SOLENT
</P>
<P>
   By John Cowper Powys. (Vintage International, $15.) This British
novel, recently restored to print, follows a sensitive young
Londoner who returns to an insulated village in his native Dorset
and becomes romantically entwined with two vastly different women.
```Wolf Solent' is a modern prose 'Hamlet,''' Percy Hutchison wrote
here in 1929. ``The novel is a momentous piece of work ... of
transcendent interest and great beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   GOD &AMP; THE AMERICAN WRITER
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Kazin. (Vintage, $14.) A renowned critic and
impassioned reader, in his final book before his death last year at
the age of 83, argues that classic American writers from Hawthorne
to Frost to Faulkner were driven by spiritual passion and a
yearning for something like faith, motivations that echo the
author's own emotional approach to his subject. ``He strolls from
writer to writer as if through the rooms of his own house,
occasionally shaking hands, by means of an anecdote, with someone
he has known personally,'' Paul Berman wrote in the Book Review in
1997, adding that when Kazin hits his target squarely, ``the effect
is spectacular and brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   FLYING LEAP: STORIES
</P>
<P>
   By Judy Budnitz. (Picador USA, $12.) These tales twist familiar
middle-class terrain into strange new shapes, creating a world
where a local baker creates babies from dough and high school
cheerleaders get so charged up at a pep rally that they set
themselves on fire. In 1998 our reviewer, J.D. Biersdorfer, called
this ``a consistently impressive debut.''
</P>
<P>
   FATHER, SOLDIER, SON: MEMOIR OF A PLATOON LEADER IN VIETNAM
</P>
<P>
   By Nathaniel Tripp. (Steerforth, $14.) In his unflinching
account of the horrors of war, an ex-infantry lieutenant also
describes his efforts to confront his guilt and achieve manhood
through love and family. ``The writing is cathartic, an expiation
by a middle-aged man haunted by everything that went wrong in war,
in youth, in country,'' David D. Gilmore wrote here in 1997. In
Patches of Fire: A Story of War and Redemption, by Albert French
(Anchor, $12.95), a black novelist tells how his Vietnam War
experiences became a creative wellspring he tapped into after years
of struggle in civilian life. ``It is a classic tale,
life-affirming and updated for the modern age,'' Terrence Maitland
said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   THE GUN SELLER
</P>
<P>
   By Hugh Laurie. (Washington Square, $14.) The hero of this
tongue-in-cheek techno-spy thriller is a dissolute ex-military man
who gets sucked into international intrigue involving money
launderers, terrorists, arms dealers and, of course, beautiful
babes. The result is ``a genuinely witty and sophisticated
entertainment,'' Christopher Buckley wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   UTOPIA PARKWAY: THE LIFE AND WORK OF JOSEPH CORNELL
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Solomon. (Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16.) The
author maintains that the secretive artist known for his boxes
filled with scraps, cutouts and trinkets was primarily an
iconographer and archivist with a basement full of ``source
material,'' including files on movie actresses and 19th-century
ballerinas. In 1997 our reviewer, James R. Mellow, called this a
``thoroughly detailed, highly informative biography.'' Mary
Cassatt: A Life, by Nancy Mowll Mathews (Yale University, $18),
shows how the American-born Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) blended her
love of painting with a desire for financial success. In 1994 in
these pages, Carol Armstrong cited some shortcomings in the
author's straight-ahead approach, but said the book was
``thoroughgoing in its resurrection of the contexts and
conditions'' of the artist's life.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TROUBLE SLEEPS
</P>
<P>
   By Clyde Edgerton. (Ballantine, $12.95.) Much of this novel is
told by a 6-year-old boy who describes what happens when a stranger
in a stolen Buick rolls into sleepy Listre, N.C., in 1950. The book
is ``as much the story of a man who brings random badness into a
good place as it is the story of a boy's search for his own
salvation,'' Mark Childress wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG BALLAD JAMBOREE
</P>
<P>
   Rural North Carolina circa 1950 is also the setting for The Big
Ballad Jamboree, by Donald Davidson (University Press of
Mississippi, $17), which follows the fortunes of a country singer
and his sweetheart, who is collecting folk songs for her a master's
degree thesis. In 1996 in these pages, George Garrett called this
''a lighthearted and (in a musical sense) light-fingered'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   THE REICHMANNS: FAMILY, FAITH, FORTUNE, AND THE EMPIRE OF
OLYMPIA &AMP; YORK
</P>
<P>
   By Anthony Bianco. (Times Books/Random House, $20.) This
large-scale chronicle tracks the rise and fall of an Orthodox
Jewish family that at its peak in the 1980's amassed phenomenal
wealth through its international property holdings. In 1997 our
reviewer, Mordecai Richler, called the book ``a nicely balanced
study.''
</P>
<P>
   THE VOICE IMITATOR
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Bernhard. Translated by Kenneth J. Northcott.
(University of Chicago, $10.) The tiny stories in this 1978
collection showcase the Austrian writer's obsessions with
hypocrisy, corruption, murder and lunacy -- and especially his
contempt for his homeland. ``Bernhard's rage against society'' is
``a highly artistic undertaking,'' Peter Filkins wrote here in
1997.

FINDING OLD GLORY DAYS WON'T BE AN EASY TASK FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas dynasty died two seasons ago, but
torture for the Cowboys has only just begun. The past haunts them.
The future ignores them.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, however, was all about the present. And while brutal
reality was on display at Texas Stadium, it was actually only a
continuation of the decay that began in '96.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys were, they will never be again. But what they
became yesterday was a toothless old relic, moving at 45 RPM,
unable to dodge a knockout punch, unable to avoid the humiliation
of being dominated at home by the...
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Arizona Cardinals. Not in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey arrived this season, and was asked to dig up the
dead, revive the Cowboys' playoff history, and return some life to
both the offense and January.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday, Gailey officially failed. There is no question
Gailey restored a football mentality to Valley Ranch this season,
but the bottom line is about January, and there is no exception or
excuse for losing, 20-7, to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Easy answer for 1999:
</P>
<P>
   Blow up the team, and start all over again. Let a total
rebuilding begin, and that rebuilding doesn't necessarily have to
include any of the Triplets, meaning Emmitt-Aikman-Irvin, or Deion,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Easy answer for the blow-up-the-team theory:
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't work that way in the NFL, not with the salary cap
money meshed into the fiber of big cash contracts. And with the
Cowboys, it's particularly impossible. Jerry Jones has repeatedly
traded up-front money and extended years on contracts for the right
to create extra salary cap space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't even consider it anyway,'' said Jones, who was
among the multitude suffering from postgame shock in the Dallas
locker room. ``You don't blow it up when you've got a Troy Aikman
and a Deion Sanders. Why start all over when, in general, you can
figure them for four or five more good years?''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's performance yesterday didn't suggest four or five good
games left, much less seasons. The only consolation for what had to
be Aikman's most frustrating postseason moment was the disgusting
lack of help provided by receivers, who either couldn't work open
or dropped passes when they did.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of Deion, since Jones brought up the name.
Nine-Toed was back on the field yesterday. Played the whole game.
All it proved was the obvious _ the Cowboys' late crumble that
began in December had little if anything to do with Sanders'
absence. And his return provided no ``spark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough time for me to try and give snap answers to
what needs to be done for next season,'' said Jones. ``But I will
say we won't blow things up. What we have in mind is being more
imaginative under the cap and making good personnel moves, both in
free agency and the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution, however. Jerry had the same roster plan at
the end of last season. But to his credit, and Gailey's, that plan
appeared to be working. Ernie Mills was a newcomer who was by far
the most consistent receiver until a season-ending injury in
November. Running back Chris Warren also arrived to play a key
role, until injuries took him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it understood,'' added Jones, ``that the season overall
was not a disappointment for me. Not at all. The disappointment
came today, and losing the opportunity to go to Atlanta next week.
I didn't see that happening to this team. I thought we'd move the
ball and score on Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the Gailey offense that lost its pop in December
continued popless yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing about today that I view as a negative on
Chan,'' said Jones. ``I was and am totally sold on him. This loss
won't change that. His fundemental approach to offensive football,
and to the football team, is really solid.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the most important portion of the NFL season _ the only
segment of the season that really counts, the Cowboys failed
miserably. And they were also undressed by a divisional neighbor in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While there won't be a rush to judgment _ not here anyway _ to
anoint Arizona as the NFC East's new bully, the comparisons don't
look good for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer is the first divisional quarterback of the '90s who
over the long haul can prove to be Aikman's equal, or, as of
yesterday, superior to Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   And with young talent like Plummer now starting to jell, the
Cardinals will also have the eighth pick in the first round of
April's draft, plus another pick in the low 20s of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   More than all that, however, the Cowboys simply looked old and
tired yesterday. Worst yet, they are old and tired, and that won't
change anytime soon.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TEEN DIES FROM BURN INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- One of two brothers critically burned in a Val
Verde, Calif., Christmas tree fire died Saturday following surgery
at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital, approximately
15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokesman Larry Weinberg said that Shawn Williams died
at 2:24 p.m. of respiratory failure that brought on cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The youth stopped breathing at 1:34 p.m. and doctors worked on
him for 50 minutes before pronouncing him dead, Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, Lisa Reese, was joined Saturday by her pastor,
friends and family at the hospital, Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of a child is devastating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn, 17, suffered second- and third-degree burns over 43
percent of his body in the fire, which arson detectives continued
Saturday to investigate as having suspicious origins. Shawn
underwent surgery earlier Saturday to remove dead tissue and cover
burn areas with cadaver skin to ward off infection.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn's half-brother, Patrick Crawford, 7, who suffered
third-degree burns over 65 percent of his body, underwent his first
surgery Saturday and was in extremely critical condition, Weinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was to relieve swelling that was threatening blood
flow in Patrick's hand, forearms and left upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to undergo a second surgery similar to Shawn's
on Monday, Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to use a variety of different methods to remove
the dead, nonviable skin that covers 65 percent of his body,''
Weinberg said. ``Ultimately, they need to find viable tissue to
serve as a platform for skin grafts.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick was so badly burned that doctors were unable to use the
boy's own tissue for skin grafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's burned in all the places where they take skin to use as
skin grafts,'' Weinberg said. ``Ultimately he'll be covered with
some cadaver skin and some donor skin.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge facing Patrick is organ failure, Weinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have great concern that he may suffer major system
failure as Shawn did,'' Weinberg said. ``That's been our concern
since he arrived here, and that remains our concern today.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also worried about the risk of infection -- a danger
because bacteria from the dead tissue could enter the boy's
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer they wait before removing the dead tissue the
greater the chances of infection,'' Weinberg said, ``but they have
to balance that concern with whether he is ready to endure the
rigors of surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers and two other people were injured in the fire that
broke out shortly after 8 a.m. Dec. 30 in the Santa Clarita Valley
northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn's friend Patricia Lynn Martin, 20, was injured along with
the boys' aunt Dawn Carter, 45.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over 18
percent of her body, remained in critical condition in the burn
intensive care unit at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who fractured her ankle after jumping from an upstairs
window, left the facility early Saturday afternoon, said Sgt.
George Ducoulombier of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arson investigators went to talk to Dawn Carter, but she left
the hospital against medical advice,'' Ducoulombier said. ``They're
looking to talk to her'' about the origins of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital nurse said Carter's sister took the injured woman to
a Veterans Administration hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ducoulombier said arson explosives detectives continued to
search the charred house for clues to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing investigation, and the fire still is
suspicious in nature,'' he said.

CARDINALS' DEFENSE LEAVES COWBOYS FRUSTRATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' season didn't die of snakebite. It
was a casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona quarterback Jake ``The Snake'' Plummer was impressive in
yesterday's 20-7 playoff upset of the Cowboys at Texas Stadium,
throwing for 213 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Plummer is not the reason the Cardinals will face Minnesota
in the NFC divisional playoffs while the Cowboys watch from home.
The Cardinals didn't need their young star's patented last-second
theatrics thanks to a defense that, according to cornerback Aeneas
Williams, ``declared war on the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on our team believed we were at war,'' Williams
said. ``We were trying to take enemy territory. We had to take that
attitude. Obviously, it's not as serious as Desert Storm or Desert
Fox, but we wanted a sense of urgency on this team. We wanted them
to know we were serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys found that out quickly, especially quarterback Troy
Aikman, who was battered mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys behind all day, Aikman wound up throwing 49
passes but completed only 22 for 191 yards and was intercepted
three times. More important, he was sacked four times and hit time
after time by the Cardinals' pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it takes to win,'' said linebacker Jamir Miller,
who finished with 12 tackles and two sacks. ``You have to rattle
the quarterback. And we got to Troy. I think he got a little dinged
and started throwing the ball up for grabs. Maybe he was frustrated
or maybe he was dinged, but that pressure made a difference. He was
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure came in part from a few surprises put into the
Cardinals' game plan this week by defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis. After watching film of Arizona's two regular-season
losses to the Cowboys, McGinnis decided he needed to stop Dallas'
inside running game and installed a five-man front, replacing
linebacker Patrick Sapp with defensive tackle Carl Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added even more pressure by blitzing Miller often,
leaving cornerbacks Williams and rookie Corey Chavous in single
coverage on Dallas' receivers. Williams shut down Michael Irvin for
the second consecutive game, holding him to 32 yards on four
catches and intercepting two passes. Chavous prevented big plays on
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We challenged our corners and they accepted,'' McGinnis said.
``But that's what we expect of them. We used our ability to be
flexible and move people around, and overall, it was pretty
decent.''
</P>
<P>
   And then some. The Cowboys managed just 260 yards _ an average
of 3.6 yards per play _ and one meaningless touchdown with 3:33
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed they got one in the end zone, I'll
tell you that,'' McGinnis said. ``The guys were extremely upset
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards' biggest defensive play, the one that turned the game,
came in thw second quarter. And it was head coach Vince Tobin who
gets credit for the idea. McGinnis said Tobin added a couple of
late adjustments to the game plan, including a short-yardage
scheme, adding an extra linebacker, Mark Maddox, in place of a
defensive back.

   The Cards, leading 7-0, used the formation on fourth-and-one
from the Arizona 7, with the Cowboys on the verge of tying the game
and grabbing the momentum. Maddox got inside and dropped Emmitt
Smith for a 1-yard loss, ending the threat and visibly deflating
the Cowboys.

   ``My job is to make the calls,'' McGinnis said. ``The players'
job is to make the calls work. Today, we both did our jobs.''

   PASADENA, Calif.  &UR; -- &LR;  The Midwest blizzard shut down airports in
Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis on Saturday, stranding throngs of
University of Wisconsin fans who came out for the Rose Bowl for a
few more days.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they were complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Still savoring the Badgers' 38-31 win over UCLA, Dennis
Tauscher, 45, of Marshfield, Wis., said he welcomes the extra time
in sunny Southern California. When he left Wisconsin last week it
was 18 degrees  &UR; -- &LR;  or 40 below zero with the wind-chill factor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pasadena reached a balmy 77, missing its record
high, set on the same day in 1994, by 1 degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it's almost like we're in heaven,'' said Tauscher, a
sportswriter who planned to fly out this morning. So far, he and
his family have visited Universal Studios Hollywood, Disneyland and
Venice Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're delayed, we will just sightsee and tour again,'' he
added. ``We really haven't seen a lot of Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Though several charter planes made it out of Southern California
early in the day, several more faced more questionable chances of
getting in the air by afternoon, said hotel operators and tour
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines canceled hundreds of flights as blizzard
conditions forced the closure of Midwestern airports. Snow blew in
drifts that reached 8 feet in some areas of northern Illinois, not
far from the Wisconsin border.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Greater Los Angeles, temperatures soared about 10
degrees above normal and are expected to stay there through
midweek, according to the National Weather Service. The weather
today and Monday in suburban Woodland Hills in Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley should be sunny and breezy, with highs of 80 today
and 81 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not too upset about it, let me say that,'' said Jeff
Jankiewicz, 46, of Milwaukee as he planned an unexpected trip to
the beach. ``Most Badger fans are pretty happy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he continued to hold the phone for United Airlines,
Douglas Alexander of Madison, Wis., thought he might spend today at
the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens  &UR; -- &LR; 
and watch the Green Bay Packers' NFL playoff game on television.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood at a row of pay phones at the Pasadena Hilton,
Alexander, 41, was only slightly worried about missing his first
day at his new job Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, of course, will understand, because going to the Badger
Rose Bowl is the ultimate excuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Quality Inn in Pasadena, some 30 families of Badgers fans
booked longer stays, hotel managers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're staying two more days because of the stormy weather,
but they're happy here because they won the game,'' said hotel
manager's assistant Lily Yu. She noticed many fans headed to San
Francisco to watch the 49ers battle the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Others ``have been going to Universal tours, or to the bar,'' Yu
said. ``They're really nice people. We don't want them to leave.
They're beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Since airline phone lines were jammed Saturday, many fans still
didn't know what the reports of bad weather meant for today's
flights. Several said they planned to spend the day camping out at
Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm planning to do? I'm not sure,'' said waitress Sandy
Sternitsky, 28, also of Marshfield, Wis. ``I've never been in this
position before, ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called home and they're basically snowbound. They said, Stay
where it's warm.''
