in order to help ensure stable economic growth, according to the
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
The SETC has established a special department in charge of the

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns New Killing, as Violence Goes on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat has condemned the killing of an
Israeli woman soldier Friday by a Palestinian man, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that Arafat, who is on
a visit to Russia, condemned the stabbing in a telephone
conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said earlier that the incident underlines Israeli
demands that the PNA uproot terrorism infrastructure on its
territory. Labor Party leader Ehud Barak also said that terrorism
must be fought relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came after the Israeli woman soldier was stabbed
to death at about 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Radio reports said the 19-year-old victim was attacked soon
after she got off a bus at an intersection to the Jewish
settlement of Tomer, about 10 kilometers north of the
Palestinian-ruled town of Jericho. She was a resident of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Two other Tomer residents who witnessed the stabbing chased
after the assailant, who run towards a nearby Palestinian
village, shooting and wounding him in the legs, the radio
said. The 34-year-old man was interrogated while being treated in
an Israeli hospital.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settler leaders urged Israeli army to enter the
Palestinian village where the assailant lives to punish his
family, saying that Israel should not give up lands to the
Palestinians and expect them to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10 Palestinians and a Spanish journalist were
injured in the West Bank town of Hebron as hundreds of
Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted before a funeral for a Palestinian who was
killed by Israeli soldiers in a clash Thursday. The mourners, who
chanted slogans and carried banners denouncing Jewish settlers,
threw rocks and firebombs at Israeli soldiers. The soldiers
responded with rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli car mistakenly entering a Palestinian town near
Hebron was stoned and two children inside were slightly injured,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has been one of the flashpoints between Israel and the
Palestinians since it was divided under an agreement signed early
last year. Violence broke out almost daily since a dozen Israeli
soldiers were injured by a grenade attack on September 30 and
Israel imposed a curfew on the Israeli-controlled part.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the stabbing Friday would cast a shadow on the
coming Washington summit next week between Netanyahu, Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton, during which an agreement is
expected to be reached on the second Israeli withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been high in the West Bank since Israel sealed
off the areas and the Gaza Strip last month following the killing
of two members of the Islamic militant group Hamas by Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has repeated its threat to attack Israelis in
retaliation, including committing suicide bombings and kidnaping
hitchhiking Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Annan Underlines Full World Response to African Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday stressed "the need for a comprehensive
response" to a challenge in Africa in order to bring an end to
both conflicts and poverty in the war-ravaged continent.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the U.N. chief was addressing the plenum
session of the General Assembly, which opened a debate on a report
by Annan, who analyzed in April the internal and external causes
of conflicts in Africa and how to achieve sustainable development
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
"I emphasized the need for a comprehensive response to a
challenge which has many roots and facets," Annan said,
"Specifically, I called for the promotion of investment and
economic growth, of ensuring adequate levels of international aid,
of reducing debt burdens and opening international markets to
Africa's products."
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first U.N. secretary-general from black Africa, said
that "while the burden of responsibility for Africa's fate lies in
African hands, Africa's development partners can also do more and
do better to assist Africa's struggle for lasting prosperityly."
</P>
<P>
Annan's Friday remarks once again highlight the growing U.N.
concerns over security and development in Africa and increasing
U.N. efforts, together with African regional groups including the
Organization of African Unity, to end conflicts in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Africa has witnessed more than 30 wars since 1970. Annan said
in his report that a quarter of African countries was plagued by
conflicts last year, which caused more than half of the world's
casualties. Of these deaths created by conflicts, some 90 percent
are civilians, most of whom are women and children.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Annan also added urgency of the challenge in a
time "when the global economy is facing serious threats and when
millions the world over have been thrown back into a life of
poverty after years of struggle and success."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan also briefed the session on his meeting last
Tuesday with visiting U.S. Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin,
during which the two sides discussed the current global economic
crisis, in particular the crisis of globalization and the United
Nations response.
</P>
<P>
"I also urged immediate and dramatic action to the debt
situation facing Africa's poorest nations, particularly in these
dark days of global economic crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis is now a threat not only to Africa's prospects for
growth, but to Africa's attempts to secure free and democratic
societies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council adopted a resolution at the end
of consideration of this report in September, with a determination
to help African countries improve the conflict-preventive
capabilities and better investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from such countries as Argentina, Austria,
Burkina Faso and Malaysia also took the floor in the debate
session, voicing their support to find "the African solution to
African problems."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Urges People to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni called on his countrymen Friday afternoon to act to
promote security in the country.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing the nation at a celebration
here marking the 36th anniversary of Uganda's independence from
British rule.
</P>
<P>
"Our security can best be assured through the collective
action of the majority of the population. I ask each and every
Ugandan to be each other's keeper," he urged.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, terrorism was labeled as a weapon of the weak,
the dispirited and the cowardly.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism can be defeated if we all become sensitive to our
security and alert the authorities to anything and anyone likely
to jeopardize security. Security is too important to be left
only to the security organs," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sign of stability in the politics of the country to
see that our opponents have for some time now been resorting to
terrorism," added the 53-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the opponents resort to terrorism because
they can neither successfully challenge the government through
the ballot box nor take on the government militarily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Museveni said, the security organs should be alert
and utilize fully the information offered by the general public.
</P>
<P>
Although it is important to set timetables, the president
wishes to assure his fellow Ugandans that the lingering
insurgency and banditry in both northern and western parts of the
country will be history in the goodness of time.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government will do everything possible to
stop infiltration from Sudan and to eradicate all bandit hideouts
in Rwenzori mountains in western Uganda and eastern Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
All that the public should do is to be on constant alert and
contribute information which may lead to arrest of criminals and
terrorists. Only general mobilization can eventually wipe out
terrorism from the country, the president said.

BONN, October (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport claimed the No. 1
ranking in women's tennis Friday when Martina Hingis was beaten
at the Porsche Grand Prix in Filderstadt, Germany, said reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who needed to win to hold off the charging American in
the computer rankings, lost to Belgium's Dominique Van Roost 3-6,
7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, the U.S. Open champion, will officially end the
Swiss teenager's 80-week reign at the top in the new rankings to
be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost, ranked 12th, constantly caught the 18-year-old
Hingis flatfooted or moving in the wrong direction with her
disguised strokes, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Davenport would have taken away Hingis' top ranking, even if
the Swiss teenager had won, if she beat France's Nathalie Tauziat
in her quarterfinal match to be played later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the fourth seed, became the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Turkish Accusation over PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry has
expressed "astonishment" at a statement made by Turkish ambassador
in Amman alleging that Iraq has contacts with the Kurdish Worker's
Party (PKK), outlawed in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency Friday, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman termed the Turkish allegations as
groundless.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq deplores the Turkish statements and it (Iraq) would like
to remind Turkey that the presence of PKK elements in northern
Iraq was caused by the abnormal situation created in 1991 by the
Americans, British and Turks themselves," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf War in which Iraqi troops were defeated, U.S.
and British aircrafts have been using Turkish military base to
enforce a no-fly zone in northern Iraq, under the name of
protecting Iraqi Kurds there. Baghdad has been mainly ineffective
in its control over the region.
</P>
<P>
Fighting since 1984 for autonomy in southeast Turkey, PKK
militants often launched cross-border attacks on targets inside
Turkey from northern Iraq where they found shelter after the Gulf
War ended.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman criticized Turkey for fresh military
incursions into northern Iraq under the pretext of tracking down
the Kurdish opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
On October 2 over 10,000 Turkish armed troops crossed into
northern Iraq with the support of Turkish air force.
</P>
<P>
While calling on Turkey to pull out its troops from Iraq's
territory immediately, the spokesman alleged that Turkey has
contacts with Iraqi Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We find that Turkey continues its contacts with Iraqi Kurdish
rebels and provides them with assistance and facilities, a matter
which directly contributes to perpetuating the abnormal status in
northern Iraq and spreading instability in the region," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He urges Turkey to reconsider its position towards the
abnormal situation in northern Iraq, saying "the return of the
central authority is the sole guarantee to establish security and
stability in this region."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned Turkey against "running after the mirage
of American dubious schemes" which he said will never solve the
Kurdish problem inside Turkey, warning "if Turkey continues with
its double-standard policy, it will sustain heavy losses."
</P>
<P>
"Paying no heed to the good neighborly relations with Iraq in
particular and with the Arab nation in general contradicts the
national interests of the Muslim Turkish people," he added.

September 19, while pursuing former faction leader Roosevelt
Johnson and his supporters, who were seeking refuge in the

treason charges after he escaped arrest attempts by the

</P>
<P>

and responsibility under international law, and shall continue to
provide maximum security and protection to all diplomatic
missions and their personnel, including the U.S. embassy," it
said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Forecasts Success of Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people will exhibit
resolute determination and ensure the success of the Three Gorges
Project, according to Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project was initiated on the basis of thorough
scientific investigations. The project was approved by the NPC and
has the full support of Chinese citizens, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, made the
remarks during an October 3-9 fact-finding tour of the Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Li also visited Fuling, Wanzhou, Yunyang, and Zigui where he
solicited the opinions of local residents and examined the
relocation program.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River was blocked last year to build the dam and
the second phase of the project, the world's largest water
conservation project, is progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 people had been relocated by the end of August,
and an additional 550,000 people will be relocated during the
second phase.
</P>
<P>
Li said relocation and resettlement progressing are operating
smoothly, and specifically cited the extensive efforts of
Chongqing Municipality and the Hubei provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project has entered into a crucial stage, and
top priority must focus of project quality, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The project will yield great comprehensive benefits for flood
control, power generation and shipping, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that the primary function will center
on effective flood control by the year 2003. This summer's
devastating floods provided ample proof of the urgency and
importance of constructing the project, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Environmentally-sound agriculture can be developed in the dam
area and administrative affairs must be managed in accordance with
the law, said Li, adding that standard environmental protection
practices and relocation efforts can be achieved by adopting
regional law and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Li has visited the Three Gorges area on seven fact-finding
tours since the NPC approved the project in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects Higher Economic Growth This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus economy is expected to
grow by 4.5 percent in real terms in 1998, compared with 2.5
percent last year, the Planning Bureau said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was based on the expectation of political
stability in the country, robust tourism, increased external
demand and recovery of domestic demand, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the bureau said that Cyprus' economy has
begun to pick up since mid-1997 and maintained a growing momentum
in the first half of this year thanks to the tourism boom and the
good performance of the services sector, whose earnings make up 73
percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The report quoted statistics as showing that during the first
half of this year, foreign traveler arrivals increased by nearly 9
percent to reach 1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, over 2 million foreign travelers visited the island,
bringing an income of about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, or 20
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry, which underwent a grave slump last
year, showed some signs of recovery in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is also gaining its fizz thanks to
higher demand at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Economy revival helped to keep unemployment rate at a low level
of 3.3 percent of the economically active population at the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the overall balance of payments for the first
seven months of this year was in surplus, estimated provisionally
at 28.4 million Cyprus pounds (about 56.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was brought about by a significant rise in net capital
inflows in July, associated with a government bond issue under the
European medium-term note program, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Multi-Party Talks Postponed to Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government,
opposition parties and Southern African Development Community
(SADC) mediators will hold a new round of talks next Wednesday,
South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamady said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks were due originally on Monday. The decision to
postpone Monday's meeting was made in consultation with the
parties involved, said Mufamadi, who heads the SADC team.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office said
Thursday that the Lesotho opposition party alliance was ready to
report back on a SADC proposal for the formation of a
transitional structure at the coming talks.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the SADC proposal, a transitional committee would
help create conditions conducive to the holding of free and fair
elections, Mufamadi said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed committee would comprise one or two members from
each party taking part in the election, and would ensure equal
treatment for all political parties by state-owned broadcasting
and information services in the period leading up to the
election.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the SADC was fairly
optimistic that political parties in Lesotho were committed to
moving their country out of its present political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho held a general election on May 23, but opposition
parties claimed the election was rigged in favor of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
A national unrest occurred since early August. The government
of the mountain kingdom became paralyzed when some young officers
and soldiers tried in mid-September to overthrow the cabinet led
by Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Mosisili's government, South Africa and
Botswana sent their troops in the name of the SADC on September
22 to help restore law and order in Lesotho.

<HEADLINE> Poor Conviction Rate in Rape Cases in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has the
highest rape rate in the world. However, only one rapist was
convicted for every 400 women raped last year, a survey has
found.
</P>
<P>
Following interviews with 4,000 women, the survey found that
for every 400 women raped, 272 reported the crime to police.
</P>
<P>
Of these reports, 17 became cases to be investigated, one of
the dockets was lost, police referred five to the court and only
one rapist was convicted.
</P>
<P>
The survey was a collaboration by Johannesburg's southern
metropolitan local council, police, a non-governmental
organization and community organizations, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
However, SAPA did not say when the survey was conducted.
</P>
<P>
Professor Neil Anderson, who was in charge of the survey, said
the statistics highlighted a need for the judiciary and the
police to increase the number of rape cases going through the
legal system and harsher penalties for perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and police said the low conviction rate was partly
because about 50 percent of rape victims withdrew their cases
from court. Reasons for this included that women were often
poorly prepared to deal with the court system.
</P>
<P>
Another major finding was that most sexual violence in
southern Johannesburg happened in the home, with 60 percent of
rapists known to the victim and one in four rapists being a
family member.
</P>
<P>
This meant that traditional policing methods and increased
police presence on the streets would not alleviate the problem,
SAPA said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Urged to Act Immediately Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Friday launched a national campaign here
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address, Mbeki said South Africa had for too
many years allowed the HIV virus to spread at a rate which was
one of the fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Every single day a further 1,500 people in South Africa get
infected. To date, more than three million people have been
infected," he said.
</P>
<P>
By allowing the pandemic to spread, South Africa faced the
danger that half of the country's youth would not reach
adulthood, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest census, South Africa has a population
of about 40 million.
</P>
<P>
To curb the deadly disease, Mbeki said the government would
"mobilize all possible resources to spread the message of
prevention, to offer support to those infected and affected, to
de-stigmatize HIV and AIDS, and to continue our search for a
medical solution".
</P>
<P>
Representatives of various sectors in South Africa attended
the launching ceremony in Johannesburg, and pledged support for
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference, South African Health Minister Nkosazana
Zuma also urged all people in the country to make sustained
efforts to wipe out AIDS.
</P>
<P>
She said drugs were available on the market to prolong the
lives of people infected with HIV/AIDS, but these medicines were
expensive.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on the public to join the government in
pressurizing drug manufacturers to reduce prices.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, South African national flags were
flown at half-mast Friday on all government buildings, including
parliament and foreign missions abroad, in line with a directive
from President Nelson Mandela, government sources said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Says Syria Supports Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem has sent letters to his Arab counterparts, saying Syria is
supporting the Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Cem pointed out that Syria was trying to
provoke Arab states against Turkey with misleading information,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there are very positive relations between
Turkey and Arab states, and no one will have the power to disrupt
these relations.
</P>
<P>
In the letters, Cem said that Damascus has extended facilities
to the Kurdish rebels, which have been fighting since 1984 for an
independent homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey has warned Syria many times diplomatically,
but Syria failed to respond to these warnings.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Syria and Turkey have always been troublesome.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK, while
Syrian, denying the charges, repeatedly voiced its concern and
anger over Turkey's close military ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has intensified its vocal attacks on Syria and, for the
first time, massed heavy troops along Syrian borders late last
week.
</P>
<P>
It issued an ultimatum to Syria this week, threatening to
uproot the alleged Kurdish camps in Syria by force if Syria fails
to stop supporting the PKK within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's warlike rhetoric has aroused fears of a conflict that
may spill over the region.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi were making efforts to try to ease the tension
between the two neighbors and attain a peaceful solution.

<HEADLINE> De-Mining in Angola Paralyzed by Tension of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The de-mining activities in
Angola have been virtually paralyzed due to the stalemate in the
peace process and the increasing tension of war in the country.
</P>
<P>
The increasing military moves taken by the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has posed
great threat to the safety of de-mining personnel, hence bringing
the country's landmine clearing activities to a standstill, said
Helder Cruz, head of National Institute for Removal of Obstacles
and Explosives.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here Friday to representatives of donor
countries assisting the de-mining operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, there were 19 de-mining teams working
across the country, but now the number is reduced to eight, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cruz appealed to the international community to take up
effective measures to force UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi to give
up war and disarm his forces as prescribed by the Lusaka Protocol
signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more international aid in clearing
landmines in Angola so as to eliminate its scourg to the human
society as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the leading countries which laid the most
landmines. Statistics from a U.N. agency showed that a total of
11 million mines had been laid during the 30-year
anti-colonialism and civil war.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, over 170,000 landmines have been cleared in the
southern African country, making 4,429-km-long highways free of
mines.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has donated five million U.S. Dollars to Angola
this year for de-mining. Similarly, the United States also
provided nearly two-million-Dollar assistance in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Air Strike Activation Expected Over Weekend: NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO was expected to issue the
order that would activate the phased air strikes it has threatened
for almost seven months, an alliance official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the issuance of activation order does not immediately lead
to actual air-borne attacks, the official hinted after the day's
two sessions of the North Atlantic Council, the decision-making
body of the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors are due to meet for certain on Saturday and on
Sunday as well if need arises, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"Decision is imminent and decision can be taken quickly," said
the official who explained that the activation order would
authorize the supreme commander of Europe to deliver the planned
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The order to be issued covers five phases of the air-borne
attack NATO has planned as an option to bring Belgrade to full
compliance with the demands of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Each of the phase needs a case-by-case authorization from the
North Atlantic Council while the phase that already gets the green
light remains valid during the authorized period of time in the
hands of the supreme commander of Europe, now United States
General Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
But the official did not clarify how long the valid duration of
authorization for each phase lasts.
</P>
<P>
He only said that the mechanism of re-authorization is designed
to put the phased air strikes under political control for the role
of engagement and targeting in different phases.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Australia reportedly started
evacuating non-essential embassy staffs and the families of
diplomats from Belgrade for fear that they would be taken hostage
once air strikes are underway as it was the case in 1994 when NATO
missiles hit Serbian targets in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has amassed a total of 340 warplanes including 260 from
the United States that provided the NATO air strike operation with
two B2 Stealth bombers and six B52 bombers.
</P>
<P>
The same official said that NATO ambassadors also met their
Russian counterpart during the day and the NATO-Russia Permanent
Joint Council (PJC) served as the third Kosovo-related
consultation of late and the second within the week.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the PJC proved to the fact that
NATO-Russian cooperation is needed in crises like that in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"NATO and Russia came close together in that the Russians
agreed that compliance has to be verifiable and both the Serbians
and Kosovars have to keep their promises," said he.

ADDIS ABABA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced Friday that a regional meeting will be held
here on October 12 to 15 on enhancing the participation of
conflict-affected population in reconstruction and peace
building.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release issued here said the meeting will focus
on returnees, refugees and internally displaced women and
children and their participation both as contributors to and
beneficiaries of this aspect of the peace process and how that
participation can be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that the general objective of the meeting
will include the adoption of a plan of action for reconstruction,
rehabilitation and ensuring peace building for the populations
affected by conflicts, particularly returnees, refugees and
internally displaced women and children.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action will constitute concrete and implementable
programs and project proposals which facilitate the
re-integration of vulnerable groups in the resettlement and
development process of countries emerging from conflicts, said
the release.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by a broad spectrum of
participants from international organizations, OAU member states,
interest groups, observers as well as representatives of women's
peace movements, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Palestine in Building Independent State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia supports Palestinians and
their leadership in efforts to create an independent state,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting here Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
Ivanov said that this is "stategic goal" for Russia to back the
Palestinian desire.
</P>
<P>
The creation of an independent Palestinian state "cannot
contradict Israel's national interests, especially in the sphere
of security," Ivanov, who had just returned from London, was
quoted by the Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
He described as "rational and justified" the Palestinian

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks for Another 6 Weeks for MONUA's Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan issued on Friday morning his report on the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), asking the Security
Council to extend MONUA for another short period of up to six
weeks in order to revive the currently stalled peace process in
the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The extension is necessary "to give my Special Representative
(Issa Diallo) an additional opportunity to revive the stalled
peace process" in Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of the Angolan peace process has been
"seriously threatened by negative developments," including the
breaking of all contacts by the Angolan Government with rebel
UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, and the government's September 7
recognition of the leadership of the UNITA Renovation Committee,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola, and its leadership in Bailundo,
central Angola, "bears the primary responsibility for the present
crisis" in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his report that he had asked Diallo to visit
Savimbi to "deliver the strong message of the international
community and to ascertain his intentions concerning the speediest
implementation of the Lusaka Protocol," which was signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The (Angolan) Government should facilitate this contact, which
would help to establish UNITA's real intentions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the dialogue between the parties remains elusive and my
Special Representative is unable to maintain meaningful contacts,
and MONUA remains obstructed in its verification activities, I
might have other alternative for the Security Council but to
propose" other actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed actions include that at the beginning of December,
the United Nations would proceed with the immediate re-adjustment
of its presence throughout the country, with its deployment
concentrated mostly in and around six regional headquarters, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The reconfiguration would be conducted gradually, in order to
fully protect the United Nations personnel and property, and would
be completed by the end of January 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
MONUA, sent into Angola to monitor the peace process under a
Security Council resolution adopted in June last year, groups 1077
civil and military observers from such countries as Argentina,
Bangladesh, Ghana, Pakistan, Romania, Russia and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government, which blamed Savimbi for his negative
role in the peace process, had disqualified the UNITA leader for
peace dialogue before recognizing the UNITA Renovation Committee
as the legal partner for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Angola has long been plunged into civil war since its
independence in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Papandreou: Margins Still Exist for Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Margins still existed for a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis, and activation of the
orders for NATO military intervention in Kosovo could be delayed
until such a solution was found, Greece's Alternate Foreign
Minister George Papandreou said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on private radio, Papandreou said that Greece firmly
backed the peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis and was very
reserved on all the scenarios concerning a military intervention
by NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the time limits were narrowing, but Balkan
countries must keep in mind that a military intervention would
also symbolize defeat for them, namely that they could not solve
the problems among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas also said on Friday
that Athens would not use its right to veto if NATO decided to use
military forces in Kosovo, but Athens would not send troops and
airplanes to take part in any strike.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
stressed that if NATO decided to launch air strike in Kosovo,
Greece would provide no facility other than the activation of NATO
bases in the country.

<P>
CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has decided to resume exporting cotton textiles
to European markets as of next week, the Al Ahram reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after the EU foreign ministers early this
week refused to impose dumping taxes on the commodities, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Textile Industries Chamber Al Motaz Billah
Abdul Maqsoud said the resumption will generally improve the value
of textile exports.
</P>
<P>
He said textile exports have declined by 17 percent over the
past eight months and exports of cloth alone dropped from 185
million Egyptian pounds (53 million U.S. dollars) to 116 million
pounds (34 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has instructed that
all ministries and public sector authorities should first consider
to buy local cars, instead of importing from abroad, for office
use.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also demanded that unnecessary specifications and terms
not be used as a pretext for imports.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Four natural gas processing plants will be built
under BOT system in Turkey, with a cost of about 3.5 billion
dollars, the Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The four plants will be located respectively in Adapazan,
Gebze, Izmir and Ankara, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The plants in Adapazan, Gebze, Izmir will be built by a
consortium made up of U.S. Intergen company and Turkish Enka firm,
and the fourth one in Ankara will be constructed by the National
Power and Bayindir consortium.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Finance Minister Fuad Sinyoura has voiced
support for privatizing the country's state-run enterprises, the
Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Transferring some public-run services to the private sector
is a positive thing, and could be a lucrative prospect for the
state," he said in an interview with the paper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister suggested that the government could allow several
services to be privatized provided that measures preventing
monopoly were introduced.
</P>
<P>
But he said some sectors such as security and education would
remain under state control
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Bank of Beirut, one of Lebanon's leading banks,
enjoyed a net profit increase in the first nine months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The balance sheet showed that the bank's net profit in the
first nine months of this year has risen to 9.798 million dollars
from 7.106 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank's interest rates on deposits, loans and commissions
collected from securities were the main sources of profit growth,
the sheet showed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Both Russian Premier Yevgeny
Primakov and visiting Chairman of the European Commission Jacques
Santer are satisfied with the results of their talks held here on
Friday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that during the talks "we reiterated the
coincidence of our views on the market-oriented transformations in
Russia."
</P>
<P>
"We both believe that those transformation should lead to the
creation in Russia of a socially-oriented, market-based economy.
Both the European Union and the Russian leaders are of the same
opinion. There are no differences on that issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Primakov, the relations between Russia and the
European Union are developing well, but "ther are major reserves,
which are not being used so far."
</P>
<P>
As for the way out of the current crisis in Russia, Primakov
said ways of reimbursing GKO (state short-term bonds) treasury
bills will be found by late October.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said this applies both to foreign and
domestic holders of GKO treasure bills, the payment of which was
frozen from August 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Primakov promised that no more statements like the one of
August 17 will come from the government and the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the program of the new government, Primakov said
that it "pursues the super-task of carrying out the market reforms
in the interests of our society and building a socially-oriented
economy."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Reactivate Post Code Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Postal Service
(NIPOST) is reactivating its post code project after delay by
poor funding, the Postmaster-General Taiwo Olukolu said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remark at a ceremony in capital Abuja
marking the 1998 World Post Day, saying that the completion of
the post code project is essential to accelerate mail processing
and sorting by using modern technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said the minister of communications is already pursuing the
issue with the government for further assistance.
</P>
<P>
Olukolu also disclosed that the NIPOST is going to expand its
electrical mail service to five more cities, including Ibadan,
Ikeja, Aba, Enugu and Benin, in response to the growing
technological development in the communications industry
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Existing E-mail services in Lagos, Port Harcourt, Warri, Jos,
Abuja, Kano, Kaduna and Onisha will be boosted through new
equipment to cope with increasing traffic, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the completion of this project this year, it will be
possible for subscribers to send their mails through NIPOST,
using their personal computers at the comfort of their homes or
offices," he was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying.
</P>
<P>
Olukolu promised to improve NIPOST's services, which he said
has declined in quality in recent times due to shortage of fuel
and collapse of infrastructure, particularly the airlines.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government will provide some funds for the
purchase of new motor vehicles and the rehabilitation of broken
down ones.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Peaceful Efforts to End Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday called
for efforts to end conflicts in Africa by peaceful means and
promote development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The call came as Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, was delivering a speech at
the plenary session of the General Assembly, which opened a debate
on a report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the causes of
conflicts and the promotion of sustainable development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Recently regional conflicts in Africa have cropped up
frequently that have affected the unity, stability, security and
development of regions and countries concerned and aroused the
concern and attention of the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without stability in Africa, there will be no global peace.
Without the development of Africa, world prosperity will not be
possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts in Africa can be traced back to profound
historical roots and are, at the same time, set in complicated
present reality, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To resolve the conflicts and maintain stability on the
continent is an important and arduous task for the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Shen listed two points which he believes are
crucial in ending conflicts and promoting development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
First, to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of African countries and refrain from interfering in their
internal affairs is "the prerequisite and starting point for
settling African conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that conflicts and disputes should be settled through
peaceful means," he said, adding, "We believe that the United
Nations should increase its input in Africa, play its constructive
role as a coordinator in settling African conflicts, support
regional efforts and provide necessary assistance to African
countries at their legitimate and reasonable request."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, attention should be given to taking steps to help
promote development in Africa, Shen said, adding the African
economy is improving in recent years, but "the overall reality
is still grim.
</P>
<P>
"Despite their efforts in various aspects, African countries
are still facing the danger of being marginalized in the
globalization process," he said, "Africa still has a long distance
to go to achieve its development."
</P>
<P>
"The international community, especially the developed
countries, should carry out in real earnest its commitments with
regards to funds, debt, market and goods, and create a sound and
development-friendly external environment for Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen voiced his support for proposals in Annan's
report for reducing the debt burden of African countries,
opening markets wider for African nations and helping Africa
strengthen regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that organizations concerned will, on the basis of a
good understanding and knowledge of Africa, work out a feasible
and specific program that suits the national conditions in African
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-African relations, Shen said that "China has always
cherished its traditional friendship with the African people."
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to strengthening its
cooperation with Africa in various fields. We have always
supported African countries in their efforts to resolve
conflicts and instill lasting peace and respected the African
countries' choice of political system and path of development as
they see fit for their national conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to contribute even more to Africa's development
by continuing to support the efforts of African countries to
develop their national economy and continuing to offer our
assistance within our capacity without attaching any political
conditions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Accepts Arbitration on Dispute with Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh Friday welcomed the international arbitration of his
country's disputed island of Greater Hanish with Eritrea and pledged
to settle differences with neighbors through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Calling the arbitration "a fair result," Saleh said peaceful
settlement of disputes and differences could help strengthen peace
and security in the region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the London-based International Arbitration
Committee has reached a unanimous resolution in favor of Yemen's
sovereignty over the disputed island in the south of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said his country is satisfied with, and accepts "the fair
result of the arbitration."
</P>
<P>
The Greater Hanish has an area of 90 square kilometers and is
28 nautical miles off the Yemeni coast and 32 nautical miles off
the Eritrean coast. Armed clashes erupted between Yemen and
Eritrea on December 15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to settle the dispute peacefully
through international arbitration on May 21, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. Agree to Authorize NATO Action in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder told U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday he
concurs in the authorization of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) plans for military action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's commitment was one step away from authorizing an
attack, but Schroeder also warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic not to count on Germany refusing to act against him.
</P>
<P>
"If the Yugoslav president thinks he can depend on doubting the
German position and readiness to act together with the
international community, he's making a big mistake," said
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Schroeder spoke with reporters in the Rose Garden
as the president escorted his guest from the Oval Office to lunch
in the private residential area of the White House.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said Germany will
provide 14 fighter jets and 500 soldiers for use in a NATO force,
but parliamentary approval will be needed to deploy them.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he expected the current German government to
announce its decision on the matter on Monday. Schroeder takes
over at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"(Milosevic) must fulfil the U.N. resolutions completely and we
will do all we can to ensure it is fulfilled. The U.S. knows that
is our view," Shroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has been arguing in favor of military strikes for
days, said Milosevic still had not complied with demands of a U.N.
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved on September 23, requires Belgrade to
end the violence, withdraw forces, let tens of thousands of
refugees return home, give humanitarian relief organizations
access to people who need them, and begin negotiations with Kosovo
Albanians on autonomy for their region.
</P>
<P>
"The first issue is whether Germany will support NATO issuing
the action order to make sure that the plans are in place and
authorized if NATO action should be need," said Clinton. "That is
what he (Schroeder) said 'yes' to today."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced it is important that we authorize NATO to act.
That's where the agreement is," added Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the White House meeting, Joschka Fischer, who is
in line to be Germany's foreign minister, said full authorization
from Germany for action in Kosovo could not come until Schroeder's
new government is in place.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in office now," said Fischer. "After October 27 we
will be in government and the new majority will be capable" of
acting.
</P>
<P>
"We agree with the positions of the Western alliance that there
must be a serious pressure on Slobodan Milosevic," added Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"In this transition situation, the Americans have to understand
that our possibilities for action are very limited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder arrived here late on Thursday. Earlier, Schroeder
discussed the global economic crisis with World Bank President
James Wolfensohn.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cotton and Soybean Productions Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. cotton production
fell 2 percent this month, due partly to poor weather conditions,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's cotton-growing regions such as Georgia's cotton
production dropped 50,000 bales from last month and Texas'
harvested acres declined 250,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
The hot and dry weather also took a toll on soybean production
but not enough to affect prices, which rebounded slightly.
Soybeans are forecast at a record 2.77 billion bushels, but
production is down 5 percent from September projection.
</P>
<P>
Soybean prices could be propped up further by a the fact that
worldwide production is off 2.5 million metric tons from earlier
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Corn, forecast at 9.74 billion bushels, remained unchanged from
last month. Corn production is still up 4 percent from last year.
If realized, this would be the second-largest production and the
second-highest yield on record, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Officials are also predicting a drop in this year's orange
crop. The initial forecast for this year is 11 million tons, down
21 percent from last year's record 13.9 million tons. Florida's
orange forecast is 190 million boxes, about 22 percent less than
the record 244 million boxes produced last season.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Rally With Firmer Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- European share prices staged a
recovery Friday after the dollar strengthened overnight against
European currencies, and more European central banks cut their
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday there had been sharp falls in equities after the
dollar had fallen sharply amid persistent fears for the growth
prospects of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
London shares ended the week on a positive note, buoyed by a
recovery in U.S. stocks in late trading and an encouraging cut in
interest rates by Ireland and Portugal. Ireland lowered base rates
by 1 percent to 5.75 percent, while Portugal followed Spain with a
0.5 percent cut to 4 percent. Italy had also been expected to
follow suit, but the move was delayed when the government fell.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE index rose 124.5 points to 4,823.4, reversing most of
Thursday's steep falls.
</P>
<P>
However, traders said that global stock markets continue to
swing up and down, and that no gains are guaranteed to last for
long.
</P>
<P>
One factor helping sentiment Friday was the panic selling of
government bonds, which was apparently linked to hedge funds
unwinding their positions. This made stocks relatively more
attractive.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong related stocks did well on the back of the sharp
recovery in the Hang Seng index.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Dax 30 index recovered by more than 3 percent
to 3,983, up 87 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the bourse recovered from its Thursday plunge, too,
putting in one of the best performances in Europe in thin trading.
The Cac 40 index was up by 132 points to 3,092.

<HEADLINE> Syria Reported to Take Measures against PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's semi-official Anatolia
News Agency Friday reported that Syria has promised to take
measures to rein in Turkey's Kurdish rebels on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, the agency said the
pledge was contained in an oral massage from Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad to his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel,
conveyed by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi who was on a
mediation mission.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering its rebel group
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and threatened to use force against
rebel camps inside Syria. Syria denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that there are PKK sympathizers among the
people. So, we can not stop the PKK activities immediately, but we
banned the PKK organization and we are arresting the PKK
militants," Assad was quoted as saying in the oral message.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NATO Kosovo Air Strikes Worries Relief Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Relief organizations working
in the Serbian province of Kosovo said on Friday the threat of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air strikes had
disrupted their work at a critical time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, officials from
five relief agencies said the important thing was to act fast so
that international staff can go back to Kosovo and resume
humanitarian work.
</P>
<P>
They said their main worry was that NATO attacks would turn the
Serbian minority in Kosovo against their staff, without
necessarily convincing displaced Albanians that it is safe for
them to return to their villages.
</P>
<P>
Joelle Tanguy, who works for Medecins sans Frontieres, said it
would be naive to belief that a Tomahawk cruise missile could
solve the problems of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Martone said that air strikes by NATO, which could take place
within less than a week, may well prove counterproductive in the
search for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia being somewhat of a pariah state, force emboldens the
hardline position. It furthers people's sense of isolation and
exclusion and victimization by foreigners," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It certainly could interrupt the leverage you might have for
negotiations, if the relationship is one of overwhelming force, as
in this case," he added
</P>
<P>
"Our staff say that perhaps air strikes without a troop
enforcement would not help them. The fact that their own safety is
in jeopardy and many of the staff have evacuated impedes our
ability to provide assistance at a critical time," said Gerald
Martone of the International Rescue Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Our mandate is to save lives and to help those who are
suffering. If there are air strikes, there will be casualties,
people will die and this is not something we are in favor of,"
added Serge Duss of the Christian group World Vision.
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "We understand that when political solutions
are sought, sometimes military action has to take place.".
</P>
<P>
Only Catholic Relief Services said it had decided to have them
stay for the moment but spokesman Phil Oldham said the
organization was reviewing that decision every day.
</P>
<P>
Oldham said the staff had already seen signs of hostility from
local Serbs in Kosovo, who see the relief workers as
representatives of a hostile force.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asked Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
fighting in Kosovo, withdraw troops and begin negotiations with
ethnic Albanians for a final settlement.

TEHRAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces have
seized 1,751 kilograms of narcotics in an armed clash with
traffickers in the northeastern Khoransan province.
</P>
<P>
An official from the security forces told the official news
agency IRNA Friday that the clash took place Thursday in the
Jafari region, near Tabas city, and lasted for three hours.

The unnamed official said that the traffickers intended to
transfer the amount of drugs to Tehran and Semnan provinces, but
were blocked by the security forces.

<HEADLINE> Hubble Detects Most Distant Galaxies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Hubble Space Telescope
has detected galaxies of stars more than 12 billion light-years
away, The Washington Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rodger I. Thompson, an astronomer from the University of
Arizona, and his team focused an infrared instrument on the
Telescope on a narrow patch of space and detected about 100
galaxies never before seen, and 10 of them were at extreme
distance.
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that the galaxies are seen as they were when the
universe was only about 5 percent of its present age.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers generally think the universe began with the "big
bang" about 13 billion years ago. Since then, the galaxies have
been moving rapidly away from each other, spreading out and
becoming more distant. For this reason, distance and time can be
measured together. Light from the distant objects traveled for
about 12 billion years before being detected by Hubble.
</P>
<P>
A light-year equals about 6 trillion miles.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Calls for End to Nigeria Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Some government ministers from
the Commonwealth Friday recommended that member states start
lifting sanctions against Nigeria as the African country is trying
to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of the eight-nation Commonwealth Ministerial
Action Group (CMAG) in London, the ministers said in a statement
that the meeting marked an important step towards the
normalization of relations between Nigeria and the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
"In recognition of the progress made by Nigeria so far towards
the restoration of democratic government, (we) recommend that
member states begin forthwith to lift sanctions in existence
against Nigeria," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
CMAG chairman Stan Mudenge told a news conference, "We believe
that the integrity and the nature of the transition program
compels us to give (Nigerians) further encouragement so that they
continue along the lines they have so far adopted."
</P>
<P>
"We want to make it loud and clear to the Nigerian government
and people that they should continue along the correct path they
have now chosen," said Mudenge, who is the foreign minister of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
However, there should be no discussion of whether to lift
Nigeria's suspension from the 54-nation body until presidential
elections set for February 27.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG comprises Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Botswana,
Barbados, Malaysia, Zimbabwe and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says to Consider Proposals by an Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said Friday that the proposals raised
by Seyed Jalal, a well-known Afghan residing in Saudi Arabia, were
"considerable."
</P>
<P>
He said the proposals were worthy to be discussed on the
condition that the Taliban will release all held Iranians, return
the remaining bodies of the killed Iranian diplomats, bring to
justice those responsible for the killings and apologize for the
slayings, the Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has refused the Iranian demands.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio did not give details about Jalal and his
proposals. Jalal helped secure the release Friday of five Iranian
businessmen, who were captured by the Taliban 15 months ago in
western Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also expressed welcome to initiatives for the release
of captured Iranians in Afghanistan, hoping them will return home
soon.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Iran and Afghan Taliban militia have been on
rising since August after Iran accused Taliban of capturing scores
of Iranians, including nine diplomats and a journalist, when it
took over the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Iran massed heavy troops along its borders with Afghanistan for
military exercises, with an apparent aim to show force, after the
Taliban admitted that its men killed seven of the missing
diplomats and the journalist.
</P>
<P>
There were reports on Thursday of skirmishes between Iranian
border guards and Taliban fighters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jalal has told Tehran radio that the Taliban
proposed to send a joint delegation, made up of representatives
from Iran, the Taliban, the Organization of the Islamic Conference
and the United Nations to Mazar-e-Sharif to probe the killing.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over 30 Iranian nationals were still in the
hand of the Taliban, which accused Iran of supporting its rivals
in northern Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> OECD E-Commerce Meeting Ends in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ended their two-day
meeting on electronic commerce here today, without much concrete
to show back at home.
</P>
<P>
"Elements of a 'shared vision' for global electronic commerce
emerged from the conference," said an OECD news release issued at
the end of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed electronic commerce in the context of
four broad themes: building trust, establishing marketplace rules,
enhancing the information infrastructure and maximizing the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
And they adopted an action plan that set the course for future
work in such areas as consumer protection, privacy, authentication
and taxation, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
"Each country will continue to pursue its domestic policy
independently in these areas," declared John Manley, chair of the
conference and Canada's minister of industry.
</P>
<P>
"What we have achieved here is agreement on the kinds of global
issues that policy makers should keep in mind when creating
electronic commerce initiatives in their respective countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of consumer protection, the ministers agreed to
work together to ensure that consumer are afforded a transparent
and effective level of protection. A guideline for consumer
protection will be drafted within 1999.
</P>
<P>
As to the much-contested issue of privacy, it was agreed that
OECD, in cooperation with industry and business, should provide
practical guidance on the implementation of its privacy guidelines
based on national experiences and examples.
</P>
<P>
On taxation, the ministers agreed that taxation principles
which guide governments in relations to conventional commerce
should also guide them in relation to electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
There was also agreement that consumption taxes should be
levied in the country where consumption takes place, and that for
the purpose of these taxes the supply of digitized products should
be treated as a supply of goods, the OECD release said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt to Free 10,000 Genocide Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
planned to free about 10,000 genocide suspects, the Rwanda News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Minister of Justice Faustin
Nteziryayo Thursday night at the end of a one-day meeting in
Kigali, capital of Rwanda, which was attended by the minister,
prosecutors in the country and representatives of the Ministry of
Interior, and the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Nteziryayo explained that most of the 10,000 suspects to be
released are people detained without sufficient charges, or those
whose files are incomplete.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda abides by the rule of law. It is ununderstandable
that someone is kept in prison for four years without any file,"
Nteziryayo said, adding that those who will be released will be
sent back to their communes.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 people will join about 1,500 others who were set
free for different reasons ranging from old age, terminal
illness, to lack of enough evidence against them.
</P>
<P>
It was explained that the decision was first adopted during a
consultative meeting attended by President Pasteur Bizimungu,
cabinet ministers, governors, representatives of political
parties on August 4.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was aimed at streamlining the domestic and
external politics of the country, as well as discussing
mechanisms for solving current crucial problems.
</P>
<P>
After a year and a half of trials in the country's criminal
courts, only a small portion of the genocide suspects, about 400,
have been judged, of which over 120 were sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
The first 22 genocide criminals were executed in public on
April 25 this year in five different locations of the country.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Warns Against NATO Force in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov warned Saturday that the use of force by NATO in Kosovo
could lead to the revision of relations between Russia and the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reiterated Moscow's resolve to veto any U.N.
resolution authorizing NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow this resolution," the Interfax news agency
quoted Primakov as saying.
</P>
<P>
If NATO goes ahead with the threatened air strikes in Kosovo
by passing the U.N. Security Council, the whole system of
international security will be eroded, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
That would mean that such actions unsanctioned by the Security
Council are possible against other countries, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as saying that
"there are no clear signs that the situation is getting worse."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov has just returned from Belgrade, where he met with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and from London, where he
attended a session of the Contact Group on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed the hope that the problem will be solved by
political means.

<HEADLINE> Syria Pins Hope on Egypt's Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa expressed the hope on Saturday that the on-going
Egyptian mediation efforts will dispel tensions between Ankara and
Damascus, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak here
on how to defuse the present Syria-Turkey crisis, al-Sharaa
thanked the Egyptian president for the good offices he is exerting
in this issue.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister also conveyed a message to Mubarak
from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on tension between Turkey and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the meeting, Mubarak will call later in the day
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to arrange a visit to Ankara by
Moussa in the coming few days within the framework of Egypt's
mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Syria rejects threats and is keen on finding diplomatic
solutions to all pending problems between the two countries,
especially security ones," al-Sharaa told reporters after the
meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Asked on reports claiming that Syria is backing some Turkish
terrorist organizations especially the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), al-Sharaa said he did not want to go into details as
Egypt is following the Syrian view and conveying it to the Turkish
side.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that they (Egyptians) will convey our views
in the most accurate and honest way possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that current efforts would help remove all tensions
between Syria and Turkey," he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa arrived here earlier in the day and left after the
meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak visited Turkey and Syria Tuesday in his bid to contain
the escalating tensions between the two neighbors from developing
into armed conflicts. He has offered the two countries a set of
proposals to start a direct dialog for an immediate solution.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Syria and Turkey deteriorated in recent
weeks with Syria bridling at Turkey's growing military links with
Israel and Turkey threatening Damascus for allegedly aiding
Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Super Hybrid Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China will grow super
high-yield hybrid rice within the next 3-5 years, according to
experts attending a scientific investigation meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Changsha, capital of central China's
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing research project, funded at a cost of 10 million
yuan, will eventually raise the daily hybrid rice production to
between 90-100 kg per hectare. The quality of the new variety will
equal the quality of existing second grade rice in terms of
resistance to pests, according to Yuan Longping, China's
well-known "Father of Hybrid Rice."
</P>
<P>
Improving the cultivation of high-yield rice has been a global
priority in recent years. China plans to cultivate new rice
strains with annual per hectare output of 9,000 kg-10,500 kg by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, has
conducted extensive research related to the cultivation of new
strains of hybrid rice. Yuan developed and introduced new
techniques for cultivating hybrid rice in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Group Offers New Award for Rushdie's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian student organization
has announced a new award for carrying out the death sentence on
British writer Salman Rushdie, the evening daily Kayhan reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah Students Association announced the award of one
billion rials (about 333,000 U.S. dollars) in a statement to
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to protest the
government's promise not to carry out the death sentence on
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan said that the members of the central committee of
the association delivered the statement to an official of the
Foreign Ministry. However, it did not mention when the statement
was handed over.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed regret that Kharrazi promised to his
British counterpart Robin Cook last month in New York that
the Iranian government would not take or support any action to
threaten the life of Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iran's late supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini issued a
religious decree or fatwa in 1989 to sentence Rushdie to death
for his controversial book the Satanic Verses.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Khordad 15 Foundation later announced an award of 2.5
million dollars to carry out Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
On September 24, Kharrazi announced at a joint press
conference with Cook that the Iranian government has nothing to
do with the award and will not support it.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi and Cook also announced jointly to upgrade the
diplomatic relations between the two countries to the
ambassadorial level by putting aside the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian student association urged the Iranian Foreign
Ministry to at least support the implementation of Khomeini's
fatwa and to apologize to the Iranian nation for giving
promise to Britain over the issue.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that only the Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei can make any comments on Khomeini's fatwa, but so
far Khamenei did not show any retreat from the stance on how
to carry out the death sentence.

KATHMANDU, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat said here Saturday that the World Bank had agreed to
help his country fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank is very much concerned about corruption
troubling the world, not just Nepal," he told the press at the
airport upon arrival from Washington, where he attended the annual
meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
He said the donor and recipient communities should join hands

<P>
The bank is aware that the Nepali government accords high
priority to corruption control, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the present government is totally committed
to fighting corruption.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Quebec Expected to Have Tight Election Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's French-speaking
province of Quebec could have a very tight election race if the
ruling Party Quebecois (PQ) chooses to call an election this fall,
according to a poll released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While Quebec's opposition Liberal Party still leads the PQ by
about four percentage points, the poll also shows a high level of
satisfaction with the PQ government despite years of cuts in
spending on health care and social services.
</P>
<P>
Among decided Quebec voters, 48.7 percent said they would opt
for the Liberals, while 44.9 percent preferred the PQ.
</P>
<P>
These numbers have changed little over the past six months.
Support for the Liberals has dropped slightly, and the PQ has
gained marginally, Canada's main newspaper, the Globe and Mail,
reported.
</P>
<P>
But among the key Francophone voters, 53.8 percent said they
would choose the PQ, compared with 39.4 percent for the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the voters in Quebec are French
speakers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53.8 percent said they were satisfied or very
satisfied with the government, compared with 35.5 percent who said
they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted from Monday to Thursday this week by Groupe
Leger &AMP; Leger, questioned 1,070 people over the age of 18, and had
a margin error of 3.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard said Friday that he would tell
voters next week whether they would be going to the polls this
fall.
</P>
<P>
If he decides to call an election, the possible dates would be
November 23 or 30, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Zimbabwean Currency Devalues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Dollar, once a
stable currency, has devalued to present 33 Dollars against one
U.S. Dollar from 18 dollars against one U.S. Dollar at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, the Zimbabwean Dollar dropped to a
historical low with 39 Dollars against one U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that the value of the currency in the south
African country will further tumble to 50 dollars against one
U.S. Dollar by the end of this year. The drastic devaluation is
feared to be another factor threatening the country's already
poor economy.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar began on November 14
last year, when it took a heavy plunge losing 75 percent of its
value against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since "the black Friday", the local currency has been
swinging, reaching new lows and firming marginally on the back of
the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Thus the average consumer price has so far risen by about 50
percent compared with that at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The lack of substantial efforts to reduce imports to offset
the reduced export earnings has been regarded by experts as one
of the reasons for the currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of export revenue from tobacco and mining
industries, two biggest foreign exchange earners of the country,
is taken as yet another cause for the currency's value slip.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murewa has estimated that due to the
falls his country's foreign exchange earnings will drop by nine
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the devaluation of Rand, the South African
currency, businessmen in Zimbabwe have spent large amounts of
foreign currencies on importing large quantities of merchandise
from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank was unable to inject enough foreign
currencies on the market to meet the demand, which resulted in
the loosing of confidence by domestic and foreign investors in
the prospects of Zimbabuwe's economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, sending troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) to back President Laurent Kabila has also strained
Zimbabwe's already meager foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country has increased its monetary supply
this year by over 30 percent, exceeding the planned 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
To contain the slumping of the currency and curb outflow of
foreign exchanges, the central bank has raised its rediscount
rate three times in the past 10 months to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has also increased import duties by 100 percent
and increased statutory reserves for commercial banks and
merchant banks from 20 percent to 25 percent and from four
percent to five percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
But economists in Zimbabwe said the measures are short-term
and appealed to the government to map out long-term polices to
introduce export incentives.
</P>
<P>
Increasing import duties without stimulating exports is half
baked measure, they said.

<HEADLINE> EU Observer Claims Kosovo Crisis Exaggerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) observer
in Kosovo said Friday that the crisis there had been intentionally
exaggerated by the United States, a Finnish newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish EU observer Pentti Metso told Helsingin Sanomat in
a telephone interview that the exaggeration was designed to rally
support for a proposed U.S.-led NATO air strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Metso, who has been an observer for three months,
the tension in Kosovo had obviously relaxed this week and EU
observers had no report of new conflicts between the Serb forces
and the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Metso complained the EU observers' claims on the
Kosovo situation had been "put aside", adding that the U.S. envoy
to Yugoslavia met only with U.S. observers for information.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that, among the total of 22 observers, Americans
and Russians were the majority and based themselves in the Kosovo
capital of Pristina. Four EU observers were scattered the province.
</P>
<P>
So far, only the four EU observers continued their work while
the others had left Kosovo in case of possible NATO military
strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Since all the rescue organizations have fled Kosovo, possible
NATO military strikes will harm at least the refugees there,"
Metso noted.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing was to help all parties involved in
the crisis keep in contact and negotiation, the Finnish observer
believed.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Against Early Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Saturday that he is "categorically against early
presidential elections".
</P>
<P>
"Early presidential elections can result in a situation which
will not facilitate stabilization in society," Primakov told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, it will lead to a division and whip up
political passions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's statement came two days after Gennady Seleznyov,
speaker of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, called
for a national referendum on confidence in President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
During a day of national protest Wednesday, many demanded the
ouster of Yeltsin, whose current term expires in 2000, in addition
to repayment of back wages and pensions.
</P>
<P>
"After this large-scale action of protest ... it would be more
legitimate to call a referendum in Russia on whether society
trusts or does not trust the president, on whether the president
should or should not resign," Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed "regret" over Seleznyov's statement and
indicated he would serve out his term until 2000, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is grappling with its worst financial and economic
crisis since 1991, with the ruble shedding 60 percent against the
dollar since the August 17 decision by the government of Sergei
Kiriyenko to effectively devalue the national currency and default
on some foreign and domestic debts.
</P>
<P>
The current government under Primakov, who took office a month
ago, is hard pressed to find ways to stabilize the situation and
mitigate social discontent.
</P>
<P>
An early presidential election "will create a situation in
which it will be hard to overcome the complex situation in which
we are now," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted Primakov as saying.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Founding President's Daughter Re-elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Megawati Soekarnoputri,
daughter of Indonesia's founding president Soekarno, was
re-elected on Saturday as general chairwoman of her faction of the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) for 1998-2003 at its congress in
Denpasar, Bali.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the congress also gave a full
mandate to Megawati to appoint others to sit in the party's
central executive committee under her leadership for the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
After Megawati's re-election, the congress was adjourned to
give her time to draw up the party's super structure and decide
who would fill the positions in it.
</P>
<P>
The conflict-ridden PDI is the second largest opposition party
in Indonesia. Megawati was for the first time appointed chairwoman
of the PDI at a national congress in Surabaya, East Java, 1993.
She was ousted two years ago as leader of the PDI in a move backed
by the Soeharto government.
</P>
<P>
Megawati has been demanding that she be reinstated as leader of
the PDI.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who replaced the late Soekarno in 1965, was himself
forced out of office on May 21 this year in a wave of public anger
and bloody riots amid the Asian economic crisis which plunged
Indonesia into its worst recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
The government-backed PDI held its congress in Palu, Central
Sulawesi, in August, and elected Budi Hardjono as new chairman of
the party.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls on Teachers to End Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Saturday appealed to teachers nationwide to call off their
October 12.
</P>
<P>
He announced that he "will not accept to be pressurized" to
negotiate with striking teachers who demand that government
implement its pledges of the 150-200 percent pay rise for
teachers.
</P>
<P>
It was "unrealistic" to force the government to negotiate on
the teachers' pay dispute as the economy could not accommodate it
at the moment, Moi said at the Moi Day celebrations marking his
20-year rule as the President of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Once the economy had recovered, salaries of the entire public
service including those of teachers will be reviewed, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the 250,000-member Kenya National Union of Teachers
(KNUT) warned of a long teachers strike if the government rejects
any dialog with the teachers.
</P>
<P>
"There is no solution in sight. And we are not breaking the
strike. The strike is effective and it will continue," KNUT
Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government signed the pay rise agreement last
December just before the second multi-party general elections
held at the end of that month.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' salaries range from 2,700 Shillings to 29,000
Shillings (45 to 480 U.S. Dollars) a month, relatively higher
than most other civil servants in the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Kosovo Crisis Cannot Be Bombed Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- With the Kosovo crisis becoming
increasingly intense and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
beginning the countdown for military strikes against Yugoslavia,
fair-minded world opinion is calling on the leaders of NATO and
Western countries to abandon military plans and to continue
seeking an effective and peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue is complicated by both historical and
contemporary factors. But in the final analysis, it is
Yugoslavia's internal affair which should be tackled by the
Yugoslav people themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, some Western countries are threatening to unleash
military strikes against Yugoslavia and are racking their brains
for excuses for their proposed actions. The move, an intervention
in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, not only obviously
violates the United Nations Charter and the commonly-recognized
norms of international law, but also runs counter to the trend of
the times, which calls for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the world community has expressed deep concern over
the cloud of war hanging over Kosovo. Some NATO member states
also have reservations over military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Yugoslav federal government, hoping to
demonstrate its determination to find a political solution, has
formed an interim executive council for Kosovo's autonomy, which
consists of representatives from all Kosovo ethnic groups,
including ethnic Albanians, thus granting Kosovo the status of an
autonomous province. A series of measures were also taken to
stablize the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Currently, large-scale armed conflicts have ceased in Kosovo,
and the overall situation is moving towards relaxation. Under
such circumstances, NATO military attacks, instead of creating
peace, are sure to encounter firm resistance from the Yugoslav
Federation, causing the war to spread and the conflict to
escalate. It will also complicate the crisis and pose a new
threat to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Today, the international community is mediating a political
solution to the crisis. Meanwhile, people hope the Yugoslav
Federation will comply with relevant U.N. Security Council
resolution, cooperate actively with international community,
attach more importance to humanitarian factors and take
substantial steps for constructive cooperation, thus gradually
eliminating tensions among ethnic groups in Kosovo, and creating
more favorable conditions for resolving the crisis through
dialogue rather than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The former Yugoslav region was once a so-called "powder keg"
that ignited the First World War. In post-Cold War years, people
there continued suffering from civil wars. Historical experience
proves that bombs cannot disperse crises in the region. Instead,
they will worsen the situation and result in unforeseeable serious
consequences. To resort to political dialogue while respecting
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and maintaining its territorial
integrity, is the only way to tackle the Kosovo crisis once and
for all.

<HEADLINE> Rushdie Says He Feels Hurt by India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Controversial British author
Salman Rushdie says he has been hurt and humiliated by the country
of his birth, India, which treated him as a persona non grata and
his next novel is about saying good-bye to the country, Press
Trust of India reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest loss to me is that my relationship with India has
been thoroughly damaged. India prevented me from going to India,"
Rushdie said in a recent interview published in the latest issue
of Sunday, a weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
Bocker prize winner Rushdie had been living a furtive life
since 1989 under police protection in Britain following a death
sentence issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for
blaspheming Islam in his book the Satanic Verses. Iran announced a
lifting of the death sentence on September 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
"They (India) won't give me a visa, despite the fact that I
have a right to go there, that I have a status of non-resident
Indians by virtue of being born there, and despite the fact that I
have my property there," Rushdie said.

<HEADLINE> Top Priority Placed on Post-flood Epidemic Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing on
Friday urged areas recovering from heavy summer flooding to launch
a massive clean-up and disease control campaign to prevent
outbreaks of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Local branches of the National Committee for Patriotic Public
Health Campaign (NCPPHC) will direct related work scheduled
through next spring, according to Li, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign is extremely urgent to overcome heavy damage to
both the living and working environments, and eliminate the
possibility of epidemics early next spring," Li, who serves
concurrently as director of the NCPPHC, said at a televised
national meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's patriotic public health campaign, which mobilizes urban
and rural residents to respond to natural disaster and eradicate
pest infestations, has a history dating back well over 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"Government and Party officials at all levels should place top
priority on the campaign, with special emphasis on epidemic
control," said Li said, adding that the State Council has
coordinated related departments and arranged for needed funds and
materials.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that work should center on rural areas, hygiene and
the eradication of pests such as rats, flies and mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
He urged local departments to ensure supplies of potable water
and uncontaminated food in order to prevent intestinal diseases
and food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Planning and financial departments should join the NCPPHC in
providing financial support, and departments of civil affairs
should allocate a portion of donated funds and materials to
support disease control efforts, according to Li.

<HEADLINE> UN Resumes Food Aid to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) said Saturday it has delivered 1,244 tons of food to over
100,000 people in Upper Nile State of Sudan after food aid was
suspended in July for security reason.
</P>
<P>
The food was delivered by a WFP three-river-barge convoy to 40
locations within the basin of the Sobat River earlier this month
for the so-called "hunger gap" season, WFP said in a press
release reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The famine victims there are agro-pastoralists of the Nuer
ethnic group whose main crops include sorghum and maize.
</P>
<P>
The convoy is due to arrive at Nyandit near the
Sudanese-Ethiopian border at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
WFP said people living in the Sobat corridor receive food aid
by barge only between May and November last year when river
levels are high enough to allow passage of the barge convoy.
</P>
<P>
WFP, the U.N. front-line agency in the fight against global
hunger, has delivered over 87,000 tons of food to more than one
million hungry Sudanese since the first barge convoy was mounted
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The food has been delivered along 2,500 kilometers of
waterways along four rivers: the Nile, Sobat, Bahr el Ghazal and
Zeraf.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Sudan has dragged into its 15 years between
the Moslem-led government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army
fighting for more autonomy and religion freedom in the Animist
and Christian-dominated south.

<HEADLINE> Hours or Days Before Kosovo Strike Action: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A NATO official said on
Saturday that the allies were just hours or days away from air
strikes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said after
Saturday's extraordinary North Atlantic Council meeting that the
whole situation had reached a critical point where NATO had
cleared all the way for the final activation order.
</P>
<P>
"The allies are moving imminently toward a decision (for
activation)," said the official, who added that all technical
preparation for the limited air strike and the ensuing air
campaign had been completed.
</P>
<P>
The NATO ambassadors were briefed "in great detail" during the
council meeting on air strikes and the air campaign to be mounted
by the allies should Belgrade fail again to comply fully with the
demands of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to a decisive phase where Slobodan Milosevic
(Yugoslav president) can still avoid the NATO attack by complying
with the international community at the eleventh hour," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the
decision-making body of the 16-nation alliance, was expected to
arrive at the issuance of the activation order, or ACTOR in NATO
jargon.
</P>
<P>
But the absence of domestic approval in a couple of NATO member
states seemed to have stopped the meeting short of issuing the
order which does not necessarily lead to immediate attack.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Italy, Greece and Portugal were said to be still in
the process of domestic approval though some doubt that it would
take longer than what the NATO official had predicted to complete,
especially in Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Germany still needs approval from the new government while
Italy may have to wait for its new government to take care of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The allies have already started to enhance the safety of the
NATO-led SFOR troops in Bosnia as threats had been made to take
revenge on the peacekeepers should NATO go ahead with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Australia reportedly started
evacuating non-essential embassy staff and the families of
diplomats from Belgrade for fear that they would be taken hostage
once air strikes were underway as was the case in 1994 when NATO
missiles hit Serbian targets in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has amassed a total of 340 warplanes including 260 from
the United States which also provided two B2 Stealth bombers and
six B52 bombers.

Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- With last-minute spending talks bogged down and no
compromises apparent on core issues, an anxious Congress Friday
gave itself a three-day extension to finish its work to keep the
federal government operating.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate Friday unanimously approved a compromise bill
aimed at curbing religious persecution abroad, marking a victory
for accommodation toward the end of a session dominated by partisan
friction over foreign as well as domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times
</P>
<P>

clear Friday that he was furious with Clare Short, his
international development secretary, for her comment that Bill
Clinton was not fit to be president of the United States.
</P>
<P>

carrying out the global-warming treaty, as the government released

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Three Hundred and
ninety-three drug-related cases were referred to court in Kuwait
in the first seven months this year, the Kuwait News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Waleed Al-Majil, head of Kuwait's Drugs and Alcohol Department,
was quoted by the news agency as saying that 85 cases were related
to drug trafficking and the rest to narcotics addiction.
</P>
<P>
Most of the persons involved are Kuwaiti nationals, Al-Majil
said, adding that the drug addicts are mostly young people.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rampant drug problems in his country to
frequent travels to overseas by Kuwaitis and massive influx of
laborers from more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf sheikdom witnessed 662 drug cases last year, of which
131 were related to drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Alarming rise in drug trafficking and narcotics abuse have
become challenging problems for the government and the society in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that 4,456 persons were arrested from 1991 to
1997 in Kuwait due to involvement in drug-related cases.

<HEADLINE> NATO Still Waiting for Approval From Some Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Although NATO has threatened
to air strike to force Belgrade into full compliance, it failed to
activate the last order due to the absence of domestic approval in
some member states.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told the press after
Saturday's meeting of the North Atlantic Council, the
decision-making body of the 16-nation alliance, that the allies
had cleared all the way for the issuance of the final order of
activation, or ACTOR in NATO jargon.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said Belgrade had still not complied with the
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199 calling for a at
this point, three weeks after its adoption. The resolution calls
for a ceasefire in Kosovo and an entry of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The NATO ambassadors overviewed a detailed analysis from the
NATO Military Committee and evaluated the situation on the ground
in Kosovo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had
better comply with the demands of the international community or
face imminent NATO action.
</P>
<P>
When asked why NATO did not take the decision to activate the
air strike during the day's council meeting, Solana explained that
NATO wanted to continue the diplomatic pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
But the inability to issue the activation order seemed to have
arisen from the absence of domestic approval from some NATO member
states.
</P>
<P>
Germany now has to re-evaluate the approval given by the
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl while Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi just lost a confidence vote by a single vote and is
now serving as the caretaker of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Portugal were said to yet complete their respective
approval processes.
</P>
<P>
NATO needs a consensus from all member states before taking any
decision on actions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia President Urges Press to Improve Professional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday called on the country's press to improve the
professional standards of journalists, saying it was a must in the
current reform era.
</P>
<P>
"The standards, of course, must be set by the press itself, not
by the government or by any other party. Because those who are
most familiar about such standards are the mass media chiefs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 20th Congress of the Indonesian Journalists
Association (PWI) in Semarang, capital of Central Java province,
Habibie urged the media people to respect and implement the press
code of ethics and uphold moral and legal norms.
</P>
<P>
The press must be trustworthy, fair, balanced and avoid
prejudices, the president was quoted by Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government is now preparing a new basic press law which is
in line with the spirit of reform. God willing, the bill will be
finished in the near future," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The government would not interfere with the press
organizations' policies on news reporting, he said, adding that
the decision to publish or not to publish any news item is
entirely for the press itself to make.
</P>
<P>
He also said freedom brings certain responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
A free press must realize that news may have a positive but
also a negative impact on the people, and therefore they must be
responsible for the stories they publish, he said.
</P>
<P>
The press should be responsible not to the government but to
the whole nation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the association will elect its next
general chairman and secretary general.

<HEADLINE> Family Security Remains Vital to Elderly Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A recent national survey
revealed that elderly Chinese still regard the family an
indispensable aspect of life, financial supports and spiritual
sustenance.
</P>
<P>
Some 98 percent of 120 million elderly Chinese over the age of
60 continue to enjoy various degrees of family life, with only one
percent living in social welfare centers or homes for senior
citizens, according to the survey conducted by the China Research
Center on Aging.
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens spend 77 percent of time in various pursuits
such as caring for younger members of their families, doing
household chores and exercising. The remaining time involved
either jobs or social activities.
</P>
<P>
From a financial standpoint, the survey revealed that various
forms of support from children account for the bulk of income for
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
However, it also revealed that 60 percent of elderly people in
urban areas and and five percent in rural areas receive
pensions. The survey also revealed that 60 percent of elderly
parents living alone receive support from their children.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of elderly respondents indicated they
would prefer to live with their children and grandchildren, and
would only express their innermost thoughts and feelings to their
spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
Elderly parents and children living apart is quite common in
today's China. Nonetheless, studies point to the limited effects
separation has on family ties.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of children and elderly parents live in
the same city or town, with some 85 percent seeing each other at
least once a week, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
"The family will continue to play an extremely important role
in providing for the elderly, especially at a time when China is
experiencing a rapidly growing aging population which will reach
400 million by the year 2050," according to center deputy director
Xiao Zhenyu.

<HEADLINE> Germany Pushes for Creation of EU Sports Counci </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany has pushed for the
creation of a special European Union council of sports ministers
and suggested to hold a European tribunal for sports in 1999,
local press reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new and old problems within the realm of sports led
Germany to its suggestion for the creation of the sports council
and the inauguration of the sports tribunal, according to the
European Report, a journal that specializes in European Union
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The European competition commissioner is now faced with a
total of 56 cases involving sports, the latest complaint coming
this week from the Media Partners aiming at the Union of European
Football Associations (UEFA).
</P>
<P>
Several cases have already been open including doping in sports
, especially in the Italian football and this year's Tour de
France cycling race.
</P>
<P>
A consensus was being built toward EU's formation of a common
policy regarding sports in the materialization of the appeal now
incorporated into the European community's Amsterdam Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The clause appeals emphasizing the social significance of
sport, in particular its role in forging identity and bringing
people together.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has been called to listen to sports
associations when important issues affecting sport are at stake.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Ministries, Departments to be Sued for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Environment
Protection Authority (EPA) has planned to sue 11 state ministries
and government departments for polluting local environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language daily Arab Times, cases will
be lodged against the Ministries of Public Works, Electricity and
Water, Health and Interior.
</P>
<P>
Other government authorities such as Kuwait Municipality,
Public Authorities for Housing Care, Kuwait University, Kuwait
Oil Company, and even the National Assembly will also be sued for
their environmental neglectfulness.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the Ministry of Public Works has mismanaged its
drainage department. Some of its facilities are emitting nauseous
odors that have affected many people throughout the country, it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA, the Ministry of Electricity and Water
uses a sulfur-rich fuel which is believed to be hazardous to
residents, especially to children.
</P>
<P>
While Kuwait University was accused of failing to keep its
faculty campus tidy, Kuwait Municipality was singled out for
dumping large quantity of dangerous waste in the vicinity of
certain residential areas.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Oil Company is said to have poured the equivalent of
thousands of barrels of oil in holes in a practice that is
environmentally unsound.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Environment Protection Authority is monitoring the
local environment closely at a day-to-day base.
</P>
<P>
An environment offender in Kuwait is usually convicted to be
responsible for cleaning the polluted areas or get fined, or
both.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Upholds Death Sentence on German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court of appeals has
upheld the death sentence on a German businessman for having a
sexual relationship with a Muslim woman, the Iran daily reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Helmut Hofer was sentenced to death by an Iranian court last
January after he was arrested at Tehran international airport in
September last year with 26-year-old Bahideh Qassemi, an Iranian
woman.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was convicted of "moral corruption and improper relations
with a young woman," the official newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced Qassemi to 100 lashes, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Qassemi told the court of appeals that when they met at a hotel
in Mashhad, northeastern province of Khorasan, Hofer introduced
himself as a businessman engaged in trade of dried fruits.
</P>
<P>
She said that he promised to employ her in his company in
Mashhad and promised to marry her. But he failed to keep his
promise, she added.
</P>
<P>
Defending himself, Hofer said his relationship with the woman
was a simple friendship, rejecting accusations of illegal sexual
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under Iranian law, unmarried Muslims who have sex will be
flogged as a punishment. But if the man is a non-Muslim, he will
face death sentence.
</P>
<P>
Hofer's case has aroused Germany's concern. German officials
have warned that the relations between Tehran and Bonn would be
seriously affected if the death sentence on Hofer is carried out.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Thailand Expects From APEC Summit? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has a big plan for
next month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's
annual leadership conference in Kuala Lumpur despite recent
developments in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials have made it clear that Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai will attend the APEC meeting in Malaysia,
where its former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was sacked
last month and later detained under the Internal Security Act.
</P>
<P>
Political sources here said the summit, or the APEC informal
leadership conference, in addition to its agenda focusing on
economic issues, will test the unity and coherence of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), whose members have
different cards up in their sleeves in regards to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Thailand's decision to attend the meeting
demonstrated the country's desire to help bring all ASEAN members
to the summit which is expected to provide them an opportunity to
heal their rift.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials said Thailand is of the view that
ASEAN nations should turn to one another in an effort to tackle
the political and economic crisis facing the region.
</P>
<P>
"An internal matter should not be an obstacle to summits of the
region," said Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan, as a result, will have a mission high on
his agenda -- seeking discussion with other ASEAN members at the
APEC meeting on how ASEAN can strengthen its solidarity, revive
its dynamism and increase its bargaining power at the
international forum.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN must seek a new strategy that would lead the organization
into the new millennium making it less dependent on external
communities and more sustainable with its own rich resources,
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said.
</P>
<P>
"After one and a half years of economic crisis, we need to
assess the situation, look for ways to resolve the problem and
search for a new strategy to lead ASEAN into the new millennium,"
he said after chairing a recent preparatory APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the APEC conference slated for November
17-18, Chuan will seek a bilateral meeting with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad to stress the need to cooperate
particularly in trade, tourism and human resource development,
Thai government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's plan for the APEC meeting also includes efforts to
share the experiences with other nations in areas where Thailand
received assistance from international financial institutions, its
success in stabilizing the baht currency, measures to deal with
unemployment and social problems as well as its limitations in
other areas, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to seek more financial aid as Thailand still
faces liquidity problems," said one source. "We need our friends
to help us."
</P>
<P>
Thailand has more to achieve. It will propose to host APEC's
electronic commerce resource center aimed at creating awareness
and establishing an information data-base, by training those
involved in commerce.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will benefit a lot from the center as more than 300
million people will be linked to the Internet by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Another message Thailand is going to deliver will be its
commitment to "an early voluntary sectoral liberalization" in the
nine sectors it submitted last year.
</P>
<P>
Thai government officials said Thailand can easily liberalize
the jewelry sector, and would have no problem in four other areas
-- fish and fishery products, toys, forestry products and medical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
They said the Commerce Ministry will look into the areas of
energy, telecommunication, environmental equipment and chemical
products to ensure early liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also push for market access, cooperation and
coordination in financial monitoring mechanisms in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
"APEC members have good reasons to be optimistic that the
summit will benefit us all," said a government source.

<HEADLINE> India Offered Lab-Level Nuclear Test Facility by France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- India has been offered by
France to use its laser facility at Bordeaux to conduct
laboratory-scale nuclear tests, "Business Standard" said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the issue were held during Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit in Paris last month as part of the
two countries' cooperation in the nuclear field.
</P>
<P>
The paper said India does not have the technical means to carry
out sub-critical tests at present and it has to spend a lot of
money to set up a particle accelerator or a giant laser facility.
</P>
<P>
India is still unclear what the nature of the French support
will be, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
India announced a moratorium on further nuclear testing after
it conducted five successive underground nuclear tests in May this
year, but it kept the option open to conduct sub-critical nuclear
tests to validate, develop and alter weapons.
</P>
<P>
India will have to conduct sub-critical tests regularly to make
use of the data generated during the May nuclear tests and to
maintain its nuclear weapons program, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
France, as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), may run the risk of angering the United States and other
nuclear states by cooperating with India in sub-critical testing,
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Hails Hanish Arbitration Momentous Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim
al-Eryani Saturday described the international arbitration
decision to restore the Red Sea Hanish Islands to Yemen's
sovereignty as a "momentous victory for Yemeni and Arab diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio broadcasts over
telephone from Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, the premier expressed
hope that the approach both Yemen and Eritrea have adopted to
settle their differences on the islands of Hanish, would provide a
model for the settlement of similar disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled Friday that disputed
islands in the Red Sea were partly the sovereign territory of
Yemen and partly the sovereign territory of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from its Hague registry, the tribunal
awarded Eritrea the Mohabbakah islands, some of the Haycock
Islands and the South West Rocks. Yemen gained sovereignty of the
Zuqar-Hanish group, the island of Jaba al-Tayr and the Zubayr
group.
</P>
<P>
On his future vision for Yemeni-Eritrean relations, after the
arbitration decision on Hanish, al-Eryani said that this ruling
will open new vistas for relations between the two countries and
restore them to their past era.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration decision will be implemented within 90 days, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will later present their ideas on their
maritime borders according to the arbitration decision, he added.

<HEADLINE> African Job Project Launched in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has launched a
project to offer more jobs aiming at reducing poverty, according
to The Ethiopian Herald.
</P>
<P>
The Jobs for Africa Regional Poverty Reducing Employment
Strategies for Sub-Saharan Africa (JFA-PRESSA) project in
Ethiopia is to put in place poverty reducing employment growth
strategies in ten Sub-Saharan African countries including
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The project is jointly carried out by International Labor
Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday at the launching ceremony for the project,
Wilfred Ndongko, JFA-PRESSA Manager and Technical Advisor, said
that the project is to develop and strengthen the capacity of
national and regional institutions and networks "with a view to
assessing and advocating alternative policies for poverty
reduction through the creation of productive employment".
</P>
<P>
He said this could be achieved at the national level by
establishing national network advocacy groups to assist in the
implementation and monitoring of the program and by disseminating
the application of investment-led poverty reducing employment
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Hassen Abdella, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs of
Ethiopia, said at the meeting that Africa, particularly
Sub-Saharan Africa is confronted with unprecedented social
problems of which unemployment remained among the most
challenging during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic decline accompanied by soaring inflation
and ever-increasing debt burdens have made unemployment a very
serious issue.
</P>
<P>
ILO Area Office Director Vremudia Diejomaoh said on his part
that "even though recent years have witnessed an improvement in
the economic performance of most African countries, the
employment situation still remains grim."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the average rate of urban unemployment in
Africa has almost doubled to about 20 percent over the past 15
years and is projected to approach 30 percent by the year 2000,
adding that Africa is the only region in which the "incidence of
poverty" is projected to increase.

<HEADLINE> China Telecommunications Rivals Pick Same Foreign Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China's two rival
telecommunications companies have recently chosen Canada-based
Nortel Networks as the supplier of equipment and technology for
construction of their respective microwave communications networks.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom and China Unicom are the only two national
companies that provide initial and value-added telecommunications
services for customers in the country.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom placed a 12-million-US-dollar order with Nortel
Networks last month. So far, it has given at least two of its five
open bidding contracts on building digital microwave communication
networks to the Canadian company. Total value of the two contracts
was near 30 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nortel Networks has provided transmission equipment and network
management systems for the four trunk lines of China Telecom's
nation-wide microwave communication network.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom also sealed a contract with Nortel Networks on
purchasing the same microwave equipment and network management
systems last month. The contract value was near 20 million US
dollars. The construction project is a major part of China
Unicom's nationwide distant telephone call network.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom signed another 20-million-US-dollar contract with
Nortel Networks this week. Under the contract, Nortel Networks
will sell GSM equipment to China Unicom for expanding its local
mobile telephone network in east China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Nortel Networks is the new name of the Canadian
telecommunications giant Nortel. Nortel took over Bay Networks in
August and changed its name to Nortel Networks on September 29.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from China's telecommunications industry,
China Telecom and China Unicom are competing intensively in the
fields of long-distance telephone call, mobile communications,
digital microwave communications and data communications.
</P>
<P>
The two companies invested heavily to expand their own specific
telecommunications networks every year. In the past two or three
years, China Telecom spent 11 billion US dollars to introduce
advanced foreign technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
This year, China Unicom obtained the first batch of loan from
the Bank of China, worth about 181 million US dollars. It plans to
complete the construction of a nationwide mobile telephone network
that covers all the major cities in the country. It will also roll
out more than 10,000 km of optic fiber cables throughout the
country by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
China has opened its telecommunications equipment market
completely to the outside world. The Chinese Government has
adopted a strategic policy to encourage introduction of foreign
equipment and technology so as to swiftly lift the technical level
of its telecommunications network to the international standards.
</P>
<P>
At present, international big names such as Motorola, Lucent,
Nortel Networks, Ericsson, Siemens, NEC and Nokia took the lion's
share of China's telecommunications equipment market.

<HEADLINE> Unexpected Slump Hits Title Favorites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua)-- Under a cool gray day favored
by marathoners, the pre-game favorites lost their shine as they
failed to display their expected form in the biggest ever
international marathon held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hu Gangjun, 28, was helped outside the route at the finish
when a crowd of reporters poured questions upon the winner, a
similar scene when he became the first Chinese to break the
barrier of two hours and 10 minutes in the last edition.
</P>
<P>
Hu, biting his teeth to keep himself within the leading pack
for about 40 minutes, failed to catch the pace since the course
midpoint where he came to a slope.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old kept shaking his head when asked what was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I am not certain what the hell is the trouble, for I did
quite well in the training as well as the first half of the
route." said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Hu set his personal mark last year with a time of 2:09:18,
ensuring him the third trophy of the Beijing International
Marathon which dates back to 1981.
</P>
<P>
Hu was not alone at all. Another pre-race favorite, Abebe
Mekonnen of Ethiopia, who had tied the meet's record of 2:07:35
set by Kodama Taisuke of Japan in 1986, also failed to make top
10.
</P>
<P>
Abebe, whose arrival at Beijing was delayed for the death of
his brother, dropped out of the leading field before he reached
halfway.
</P>
<P>
"Both athletes are fresh from the marathon event held two
months ago which made them hard to recover over such a short
time." said the race organizer Shang Xiutang, vice president of
the China Athletics Association.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing International Marathon did not request the
participants should not run for three months before the event,
which is a precondition for any lucrative marathon, Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Shan Changming, Hu Gangjun's coach, argued that the trouble w
ith his student's bad form may lie in his mental state.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little surprised at his performance, for his
training is quite satisfactory," said the coach. "This had
something to do with his mental quality, we will have a careful
review of the past training."
</P>
<P>
Seeing Hu rise to fame, Shan added that the upcoming Asia
Games was their priority even though this year's race was the
biggest ever.
</P>
<P>
"I had told him before the start not to put too much energy
into the competition if his physical strength failed him, for we
set our sight upon the Asia Games in December."
</P>
<P>
The temperature posted about 16 centigrade with a wind speed
of one meter per second, from which unheralded Kim Jung Won of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was the biggest b
eneficiary.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 25, surprised the star-studded event by cruising home in
2:13:49, followed by Chang Ki-Shik of South Korea with a time of
2:14.07.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable with the weather conditions which are
very similar to those in Pyongyang." said Kim, whose personal
best was 2:13.20.
</P>
<P>
Kim, a university student of the physical education, was not
in the DPR Korea's roster for the Bangkok Games.
</P>
<P>
"There are three other athletes whose performance are even
better than his. Two of the three will take part in the Games."
said Pang Mun Il, vice president of the DPR Korea's athletics
association.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Envoy for Afghan Affairs Offers Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's special envoy on the
Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi has submitted resignation amid
differences in the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Afghanistan, an
Iranian daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News quoted an informed source
as saying that Boroujerdi's decision was based on the fact that
two policy-making centers exist in the Foreign Ministry on the
affairs in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Afghanistan requires unanimity within
the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the source said, adding that
Boroujerdi's resignation is meant to bring about unity in the
ministry vis-a-vis policies and decisions regarding Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The resignation has not yet been accepted, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi, former deputy foreign minister for Asia-Pacific
affairs, came under sharp criticism after eight Iranian diplomats
and a reporter were killed by the Afghan Taliban militia in August
in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He was blamed for inaccurate assessment about the situation in
the neighbor when the Taliban attacked the Iranian-backed
opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The envoy argued that the decision to keep 10 diplomats in
Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan on the eve of Taliban's
attack was based on previous experience that the group did not
offend Iranian diplomats in other cities they occupied.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Corn Prices Rise on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Soybean futures rocketed
higher and corn futures advanced remarkably Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
The soybean price for November delivery rose 23.5 cents to 5.64
U.S. dollars a bushel. The December corn price rose 4.25 cents to
2.215 dollar a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted the price increases occurred after the
U.S. government released its new estimates for the nation's crops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the U.S. Agriculture Department cut its
estimate for U.S. soybean production by 5 percent to 2.769 billion
bushels, and left virtually unchanged its estimate of 9.734 billion
bushels for corn production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also predicted the amount of soybeans
left over before the 1999 harvest will fall to 396 million bushels
from 485 million as predicted a month ago, and said farmers now
should fetch an average 5.7 U.S. dollars a bushel instead of 5.35
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most market analysts, however, had predicted the government
would slightly increase its previous estimate of a 2.91
billion-bushel soybean crop.
</P>
<P>
As for corn estimate, market participants had expected a sharp
increase, with some predicting a 10 billion bushel crop.
</P>
<P>
The government said the late-season dry and hot weather helped
sharply reduce pod counts.

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Bangladeshi Women, Children Smuggled out Every </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 15,000 Bangladeshi
women and children are smuggled out every year and the traffickers
use the country as a transit point of human trade, The Financial
Express newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a study conducted by the Center for Women and Children
Studies in Dhaka, the newspaper said massive poverty and AIDS-free
physique of Bangladeshi girls impelled the human traffickers to
smuggle and force them into flesh trade abroad.
</P>
<P>
The study suggests an integrated national policy against child
and women trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The trafficking in women and children for prostitution, forced
labor and slavery reached an alarming proportion now, the study
noted.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Bangladeshi under-aged girls trafficked to
different countries were engaged in prostitution in brothels, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
Children between six and 15 suffered sexual abuses, and some
died either from physical or sexual assaults or during journey
from their homes, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the key factors related to trafficking were identified
as poverty, gender discrimination and lower status of the girl
child, allurement of jobs and marriages, and strong networks of
traffickers both within and without the country, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcing agencies have a poor performance in combating
the human smuggling, and only nine percent of the missing children
were rescued by them, the study said.
</P>
<P>
From January 1990 to September 1997, the study said, some 2,622
children were missing and 845 kidnapped, and only 228 and 512 of
them were later rescued by the law-enforcing agencies. The rest
were still missing or lured for good jobs into mainly India,
Pakistan and the Middle East, the study found, quoting officials
at the Social Welfare Department.
</P>
<P>
The male children were made into jockeys for camel race in the
Middle East while the girls and women ended up in red-light
quarters or often forced into slavery, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 Bangladeshi women and children have been
trafficked to the Middle East and India in the past 20 years, and
around 20,000 Bangladeshi women are involved in prostitution in
Indian brothels alone, according to human rights organizations and
newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government is very much concerned about the
growing trend in women and children trafficking and has taken a
series of stern measures in this regard.

<HEADLINE> 142,500 Chinese Take Exams for Lawyer Qualification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China started the Tenth National
Lawyer Qualification Examinations simultaneously across the
country today.
</P>
<P>
A record of 142,500 applicants have registered for the test
this year, 28,000 more than in 1997. The two-day exam is held in
310 sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Gao Changli said in Beijing that since the
exam first introduced in 1986, 900,000 candidates have taken the
exam, and 110,000 of them passed and obtained qualification for
becoming a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Passing the test is a must for obtaining qualification as a
lawyer in China today.
</P>
<P>
"Practice in the past 12 years has shown that as the system of
rule by law is being enforced in China and the role of lawyers
brought into play in political and economic life, the profession
of lawyer has been paid more attention to and is what many young
people aspire to go in for," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the sharp increase of applicants in this
year's test lies in the restructuring and streamlining of
government bodies, an official with the Justice Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Many government employees are thinking about going into the
profession of lawyer once they are fired," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, lawyers account for 0.008 percent of the Chinese
population and cannot meet the needs of social and economic
development, therefore the needs for qualified lawyers is very
large, Justice Minister Gao said.
</P>
<P>
According to a government plan, China expects to have 150,000
lawyers by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Gao also said that the government is also concerned about the
quality and proficiency level of lawyers. His ministry is going to
do more to improve the examination system by learning useful
practices from other countries to ensure both the academic level
and equity, fairness of examinations.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to promote high-quality talents to meet increasing
needs," Gao.

from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea surprised himself
by beating a strong field to win the men's event at the Beijing
marathon races here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kim, following closely South Korean Chang Ki-Shik after the
33-kilometer mark, steadily pulled away in the last four
kilometers and cruised home in a time of two hours, thirteen
minutes and 49 seconds, 29 seconds outside of his personal best.
</P>
<P>
Chang came second in 2:14.07 and Brazilian Osmiro De Souza
Silva was third 2:14.26.
</P>
<P>
"I dedicate my success to our great leader Kim II Sung and the
people in our country," Kim said after the unexpected triumph,
"The weather conditions in Beijing are quite similar with that in
Pyongyang, so I feel very comfortable."
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old student majoring in physical education at the
DPR Korean University was running against a legion of
high-profile athletes including Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, who
still has the event's best time of 2:07.35 to his credit, local
hero and defending champion Hu Gangjun and a seven-man Kenyan
group headed by Peter Kimeli Chemei whose personal best is
2:09.53.
</P>
<P>
Under gray but calm skies, the race started to unfold at the
halfway point with a 10-man group breaking away from the rest of
the field.
</P>
<P>
By 35km, the leading pack had been reduced to two men and it
became clear the battle for men's gold and 20,000 prize money
came down to a fight between the diminutive DPR Korean and the
lanky South Korean.
</P>
<P>
The pre-meet favorite Abebe and Hu, who fell away after the
midway point, both finished outside top 10.
</P>
<P>
In the women's event, home favorite Wang Yanrong made a
explosive move just ahead of the finish line to steal the gold
from Russian Lioubov Mirgouonova.
</P>
<P>
Wang, whose personal best was 2:38.18, burst past the Russian
for the victory in 2:28.50, just one second clear of the Russian.
Jong Song Ok from DPR Korea claimed the bronze in 2:30.48.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Chinese runner, whose toes were bleeding
because of injury, attributed her win to courage brought about by
a cheering crowd at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
"Courage helped me win the race," she said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 people took part in the competition, biggest
ever in its 17-year history, which also included half marathon,
10km marathon and mini-marathon.

<HEADLINE> Post-Flood Investment Scope Makes Bangladesh's Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The recent severe floods, which
battered the economy of Bangladesh, could hardly affect the
banking sector as the need for post-flood rehabilitation and food
imports offered new business opportunities to avert possible
fallout of a disaster-driven economic stagnation, The Financial
Express daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the banks were affected anyway by the floods.
Rather, I see a lot of business opportunities in the coming days
to use their idle funds," the daily quoted a bank managing
director as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and private sector traders had been
importing huge amount of foodgrains following crop losses caused
by the century's worst floods, he observed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government was disbursing a huge amount of money
among the farmers through banks to enable them to overcome the
crop losses, he said, adding that the business relating to
rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure and affected sectors
would be an additional opportunity for the banks.
</P>
<P>
The banks would have to defer repayment schedule of loans for
the borrowing industries in line with the three-month moratorium
announced by the government recently, another bank managing
director noted.
</P>
<P>
It would be a loss from the banking point of view, he said,
pointing out that repayment of nearly 630 million taka (about 13.4
million U.S. dollars) loan to his bank alone would have to be
deferred due to floods.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the deferred repayment would hardly affect banks'
financial health, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The economic stagnation caused by the deluge had squeezed
business opportunities for the banking sector, but additional food
imports and post-flood rehabilitation activities would help
overcome the loss, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the banking sector would have to disburse
loans worth 30 billion taka (about 638.3 million dollars) among
farmers as part of the government's agricultural rehabilitation
plan and the central bank would refinance the banks.
</P>
<P>
The banks remained unaffected by the devastating floods as
exports after initial disruptions continued under special
arrangement and import of grains also helped them to overcome the
loss of business in other sectors, a central bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The post-flood rehabilitation would bring momentum in the
banking business, he said, adding that the need for working
capital to fix flood-caused damage to the industries would help
the banks to use their idle money.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector has now a liquidity surplus of 26.98 billion
taka (about 574 million dollars), the central bank official
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary estimate puts the total loss caused by the
ten-week-long devastating flood at around 4.3 billion dollars,
about 10 percent of the country's GDP (gross domestic product),
according to the latest figure released by the Planning Ministry.

<P>
TOKYO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea President Kim Dae
Jung concluded his four-day state visit to Japan and left Japan's
western industrialized city of Osaka for home on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Osaka, the last leg of his four-day visit to
Japan, Kim said his state visit to Japan was "a great success."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark to more than 700 Korean residents in Osaka,
home to the largest Korean community in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived in Osaka on Friday following what he termed a
successful visit to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
While in Tokyo, Kim and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
agreed to cooperate in building a "new partnership toward the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
In their declaration, Obuchi expressed Japan's "deep remorse
and heartfelt apology" to the South Korean people for the "great
pains and damage" inflicted on them during Japan's colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
This was Japan's strongest apology in 33 years. Japan exercised
colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Earns From Fish Products Export Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has earned 33 million
U.S. dollars from the export of fisheries products in the first
six months this year as against 30.2 million dollars in the same
period last year, according to the Fisheries Ministry here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fish and fisheries product sector in the country had been
identified as one of the priority sectors for development due to
its export potential and high employment generation capacity, the
ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years there had been a rapid development in
shrimp farming and a significant growth in the export of fish and
fisheries products.
</P>
<P>
Though the fisheries industry mainly caters to the local market
at present, high valued products such as tuna, prawns, lobsters
and crabs are exported to Japan, the U.S. and Europe, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years there has been a significant growth
of exports of fisheries products. In 1997, Sri Lanka earned 65.3
million dollars, a growth of six percent over 1996.

<HEADLINE> Italian President to Mediate Government Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro will have a busy agenda trying to resolve the current
government crisis in the wake of Prime Minister Romano Prodi's
resignation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prodi lost the vote of confidence in the Lower House of
parliament by 313 votes to 312. He then handed in his
resignation, which had already been accepted by President Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro asked Prodi to head a caretaker government pending his
replacement. The president has until November 24 to decide
whether to form a new government or call for early elections.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet first Senate Speaker Nicola Mancino and
then House Speaker Luciano Violante on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he will discuss with representatives from political
forces of both the opposition Freedom Front and the just-defeated
leftist Olive Tree coalition that formed Prodi's government.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro will also consult with former heads of state Giovanni
Leone and Francesco Cossiga.
</P>
<P>
The departure of Prodi, who came to power in May 1996, leaves
Italy without leadership at a time when crucial budgetary problems
loom and tough decisions need to be made on possible NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis and the country's
entry into the European single currency on January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> hke101013-India to Announce Anti-Dumping Duty on Hot-Rolled Coils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Union Commerce
Ministry is expected to announce anti-dumping duty on hot-rolled
coil imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) by
the end of this month, official sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian steel industry had filed for imposition of
anti-dumping duty in March 1997. The industry is planning to file
similar complaints against imports from other countries as well
once the decision on CIS imports is taken. On the firing line are
Japan, South Korea and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The domestic steel industry is passing through its lowest ebb
ever reflecting a similar trend in the global markets. What has
compounded the problem is the large-scale dumping of steel on
India. The duty is expected to help the troubled Indian steel
industry face competition from imports, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The global average ex-plant cost of production of steel is 301
U.S. dollars per ton. After the freight and shipping costs are
factored in, the landed price in India should be 361 dollar per
ton. The current price levels, however, are in the range of
220-240 dollars per ton, the sources further said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) Medical Commission has suspended the Acqua
Acetosa Laboratory in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the IOC Medical Commission, Prince Alexandre
de Merode, announced on Friday that the laboratory will not be
able to present itself for re-accreditation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) will, however,
be able to continue conducting doping control activities by
sending its samples to IOC-accredited laboratories, Prince de
Merode said.
</P>
<P>
Prince de Merode stressed that the Rome laboratory will, after
a period of three months, have the opportunity to present a new
candidature for accreditation, provided that the instructions
which have been communicated to it have been followed.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, CONI's medical commission said Acqua Acetosa
Laboratory will be shut down for allegedly cover-up of doping
tests in soccer.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the doping tests of Italian League soccer had not
been fully carried out and the results may have been hidden.
Documentation of anti-doping tests, which was required to keep at
least two years, was being discarded after two months, with five
in the case of positive tests.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Vows to Stabilize Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Moldova
will take every possible measure to stabilize its currency, the
governor of the central bank Leonid Talmaci said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that it is difficult to stop the
devaluation of the country's currency in the short term.
</P>
<P>
According to Rompress news agency, the Moldovan leu fell
sharply this week. The exchange rate of the leu to the dollar
dropped from 5.0055 to 1, to 5.2 to 1, below the "psychological
resistance line" of 5 to 1, and the devaluation is likely to
continue.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank are striving to keep its
currency no lower than 5.5 to the dollar. But financial experts
here said that the goal is hard to achieve in the absence of a
loan of nearly 100 million dollars the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund had earlier promised.
</P>
<P>
One month ago, the leu's value became unstable due to the
financial crisis in Russia. The central bank quickly stabilized it
by selling dollars in considerable amounts along with some
commercial banks and closed more than 20 foreign exchanges for
"disturbing the exchange market."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Forest parks will become a
pillar industry of the forest sector when the number of such parks
jump to about 2,000 by the year 2010 from the present 874, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
By then, the parks -- covering 19 million hectares -- will
greatly contribute to people's environmental awareness while
protecting forests, wild animals and plants, the daily quoted an
official of the State Forestry Bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, 292 of the existing forest parks have
become national parks authorized by the former Forestry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1997, forest parks across the country received
300 million visitors and brought two billion yuan (241 million US
dollars) of direct income.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, these parks contributed over one
billion yuan (120 million US dollars) to modernizing scenic spots
and building hotels and shops to cater to visitors.

COLOMBO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen percent of Sri Lankan
children are illiterate despite free education in the country
since the 1950s, according to the Education Ministry here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Most children keep away from school due to abject poverty and
are compelled to work instead for their home life, the ministry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Deputy Minister of Education Viswa Warnapala
as saying that schooling was not a privilege but a right of every
child and this right should not be denied to the child either by
the state or the parents.
</P>
<P>
The government will soon bring legislation to make schooling
compulsory for children between the ages of 5 and 14 years of age,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
To save the children morals must be inculcated as they mature
both in homes and schools. The responsibility must be equally
shared by the state and the parents as well as the teachers, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Cautious With Possible Kosovo Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will be cautious about
joining any possible military action in Kosovo, said Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has wanted Bulgaria to join an armed intervention in
Kosovo yet," Kostov said in parliament in response to a statement
of the Democratic Left pressing the government for a categorical
"no" to any request for intervention in the turbulent Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kostov said that the government has not received any request
from NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Secretary-General
Javier Solana, who has been authorized by the NATO Council to seek
permission from Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary
to allow NATO's aircraft to fly over their territories.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the government is ready to deal with such requests,
Kostov said the government will act very reasonably and cautiously
at this moment.
</P>
<P>
If such a request is made, the government will handle it
according to the procedures established by the Constitution as it
has always done, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Kostov reiterated that Bulgaria has joined the concerted
efforts of its neighbors for a peaceful solution to the conflict
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, the Left asked the National Assembly to
appeal to the parliaments of the southeast European countries to
find a comprehensive, just and peaceful solution to the conflict
in Kosovo and to voice unconditional support to the multinational
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Left believes that the conflict in Kosovo
threatens Bulgaria's national security," Socialist MP Ivan Genov
said at an earlier news conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Bulgarian media reports, cabinet members are
underestimating the danger of the Kosovo conflict and have
indicated their intention to revise Bulgaria's position, adopted
by a consensus in 1993, on non-interference and non-involvement in
military actions in former Yugoslavia in any form, either direct
or indirect.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Promote Issue of Export, Import Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Ministry of Commerce
will issue export and import licenses within 48 hours to exporters
 and importers in the country to facilitate their trade
activities.
</P>
<P>
It used to take about one week in the past.
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of the local "Myanmar Business News" published
by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry quoted the ministry as
saying that such licenses will be issued without delay if
applications are submitted in accordance with the prescribed
rules.
</P>
<P>
The move was made partly due to that the government wants to
cut down the state expenditure and promote private trading and
economic development, it added.
</P>
<P>
In April, the ministry drew up a new list of items of goods
designated for export and import as part of its policy.
</P>
<P>
Of the goods items approved for import, 14 are the first
priorities, while 8 others are the second priorities.
</P>
<P>
The first priorities goods items include machinery and spare
parts, industrial raw materials, agricultural tools, wheat,
construction materials, aquatic tools, transport vehicles,
medicine and equipment used in livestock breeding, electric power
materials, paper and some oil products.
</P>
<P>
The second priorities cover some consumers goods, household
appliances, textile, electrical and electronic goods.
</P>
<P>
For export through seaborne trade, four categories of goods
banned for private exporters and cooperatives are agricultural
produces, mineral and chemical products, animal products and
general commodities. For export through border trade, teak is
added to the restriction.
</P>
<P>
There were 9,250 exporters and importers in Myanmar by the end
of June this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, private sector's export and import
have been considerably boosted with its share of exports jumping
from 46.3 percent in the fiscal 1988-89 to 67.8 percent in the
fiscal 1997-98 which ended in March. Meanwhile, its share of
imports rose from 40.7 percent to 71.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official Economic Indicators, Myanmar's
 foreign trade, including the border trade, in the first six
months of this year sharply increased over the same period of
last year, reaching 1.898 billion U.S. dollars, 424 million
dollars or 28.8 percent more than that of last year which was
1.474 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> USOC Considers Independent Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Talk of
performance-enhancing drugs has dominated sports headlines this
year as much as sexual misconduct gossip dominated political
headlines.
</P>
<P>
Was the use of the supplement androstenedione, a precursor to
testosterone that is banned in many sports, fired Mark McGwire's
baseball home-run record?
</P>
<P>
And while track star Florence Griffith Joyner denied taking
performance-enhancing drugs, rumors that began with her startling
performances a decade ago, escalated with her premature death
last month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee has steered clear of much of the
controversy - it has no control over U.S. professional sports, or
cycling's Tour de France, which erupted in scandal over the use
of the synthetic hormone EPO this year.
</P>
<P>
But USOC controls U.S. Olympic hopefuls, and as it goes into
its annual Olympic Congress meetings this weekend in Phoenix, the
organization is considering a plan that could improve its drugs
testing methods.
</P>
<P>
Within the next few weeks, USOC President Bill Hybl will
appoint a committee to look at bids and study the feasibility of
hiring an independent agency to handle its drug testing.
</P>
<P>
It would conduct random tests, collect urine samples,
transport the samples to the two International Olympic C
ommittee-approved laboratories in the USA and nitify sports
federations if an athlete tests positive.
</P>
<P>
The idea, said USOC executive director Dick Schultz, is "to
get rid of the perception that we've got the fox in the henhouse."
</P>
<P>
The plan is similar to one proposed by the IOC, which runs the
Olympics and controls Olympic testing and financing.
</P>
<P>
In August, the IOC announced a plan to set up a independent
group to conduct worldwide random testing. But it will not start
to work out details until February 2 at a meeting in
Lausanne,Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
It faces a huge task of getting international goernming bodies
to agree to a standardized plan.
</P>
<P>
USOC's plan doesn't challenge the IOC's. "What we'd do would
be over and above," Schultz said, adding he'd like to get a
proposal together in time for consideration at the April 1999
Board of Directors meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Friday said his government would prioritize the
development of the agricultural sector due to its competitiveness
in the world market and its relative strength in the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with 22 governors and 246 regents and mayors here,
the president conceded the government had ignored the sector in
the past despite its absorption of a huge labor force.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the agricultural
sector was the only economic section which showed positive growth,
0.26 percent, in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The president summoned the officials to Jakarta to brief them
on the government's strategy to boost intensification programs in
agriculture, fishery and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
"Focusing attention on agricultural development is a part of
our efforts to empower the people's welfare," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He set five priorities in boosting agricultural production,
encompassing the provision of cheap credit for farmers, the
procurement of good quality seeds, fertilizers, and the
development of rural cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Habibie recently admitted that he had devoted too much
attention to the development of sophisticated technology,
including the aviation industry, during his 20-year tenure as
state minister of research and technology under president
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Habibie assumed the presidential office on May 21 after
Soeharto resigned amid a deepening economic crisis, protests and
an explosion of rioting in Jakarta.

unrest is a concern, the TAT was quoted Saturday by the Bangkok

<HEADLINE> Chile to Cut Defense Budget by 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chile's 1999 defense budget
will be cut by 3 percent due to a reduction in military personnel
and the impact of the Asian crisis on the country, a senior
defense planner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The military budget was also affected by a rising dollar
against the local currency, which will reduce the real spending on
military equipment by nearly 10 percent in terms of dollars, said
Francisco Encina, president of the Defense Commission in the
Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 defense budget stands at 1.71 billion dollars, most of
it for salaries, while what would be cut is the spending for
operations and expenditures of other kinds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Encina also said that military personnel must be reduced to

<HEADLINE> Sweden Urges Yugoslavia to Manage to Avoid NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Minister of Foreign
Minister Anna Lindh Friday appealed to Yugoslavia to avoid
possible NATO air strikes by accepting the demand of the
international community to end the bloodshed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the U.N. Security Council, Sweden is ready to
participate in the making of a decision on a military action to
force Belgrade to fulfill a binding Security Council resolution,
Lindh was quoted as saying by the Swedish news media.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
take steps to avoid the occurrence of such a situation," she said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
that the ongoing talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic over Kosovo on Friday in Belgrade were tough but
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Holbrooke told me that those were very intense
discussions and tough going. He did not, to me, characterize
either positively or negatively those discussions except to say
that they will resume," he added.
</P>
<P>
"He's highly focused on the matter at hand, which is trying to
persuade Mr. Milosevic to comply in a thoroughgoing, durable,
verifiable way. And it's hard work. And he's not there. And so he
remains in Belgrade," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke spent 3 1/2 hours trying to persuade Milosevic to
comply with U.N. demands on the province of Kosovo. Holbrooke's
previous rounds of talks with Milosevic made no progress.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asks Belgrade to comply fully with the U.N. Security
Council Resolution that demands Yugoslavia end fighting in Kosovo,
withdraw its troops, allow relief groups access to refugees and
begin negotiating a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a NATO official said Friday that the alliance was
expected to issue the order that would activate the phased air
strikes it has threatened for almost seven months.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of the activation order will not immediately lead
to actual air-borne attacks, the official hinted after the day's
two sessions of the North Atlantic Council, the decision-making
body of the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO has amassed a total of 340 warplanes including 260 from
the United States that provided the NATO air strike operation with
two B-2 Stealth bombers and six B-52 bombers.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
(IMF) President Michel Camdessus will visit Honduras next month, a
senior Honduran official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government is negotiating a program to make
financial adjustments with the IMF and is hopeful of a final
agreement before the visit by Camdessus, said Honduran Finance
Minister Gabriela Nunez.
</P>
<P>
The program, euphemistically called the "expanded structural
adjustment facility," would permit Honduras to obtain fresh
resources and would serve as a guarantee for the Central American
country to renegotiate its 1.2-billion-U.S.-dollar debt with the
Paris Club of creditors, an affiliate of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The IMF president is expected to arrive in Honduras on November
18. He will also participate in an anti-corruption forum here.

<HEADLINE> hke101004-Indonesia's Foreign Investments Drop by 48 Pct in Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing monetary crisis in
Indonesia has caused the decline in investments, especially
foreign direct investments which decreased by 48.6 percent in
value, the Indonesian Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Actually there are 565 projects with direct foreign
investments approved by the government, increasing by 25.5 percent
from last year's figure, but the value of the projects declined by
48.6 percent to 24 billion U.S. dollars," secretary of the
Investment Coordinating Board Mohammad Syukur said.
</P>
<P>
He said that domestic investment approvals this year reached
553 projects valued at 91.4 trillion rupiah (9.1 billion U.S.
dollars), meaning it declined by 57.5 percent in the number of
projects and by 40.2 percent in the value in comparison with the
figure for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decline on total investments has made the government focus
its policies in bringing back the investor confidence by creating
a favorable condition on the investment climate, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Consults IMF, WB on Capital Flows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
consulting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank (WB) over plans to implement a new system to monitor
capital flows, the Jakarta Post Saturday quoted a minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The government needed to get the views of various experts
before implementing the new system so that it would be effective
and meet the government's objectives, Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking the views of the IMF and the World Bank so that
whatever we do will be truly effective," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia's governor and the finance minister were also
discussing the plans with the international community in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We're still studying various (models) used in other
countries," he told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, he reaffirmed that the government will not impose
strict capital controls.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar explained that in principle, a freely floating
foreign exchange regime was the most appropriate for the country,
but said that improving the monitoring and reporting of foreign
exchange flows was essential.
</P>
<P>
News that the government plans to introduce some forms of
capital control reemerged earlier this week when Ginandjar was
quoted by local newspapers as saying that the government was
considering obliging exporters to report their hard currency
earnings to the authorities for monitoring purposes.
</P>
<P>
Market players and analysts were convinced that this meant the
government would make it obligatory for exporters to surrender
foreign exchange earnings to the central bank because a
non-obligatory approach would not be effective in strengthening
and stabilizing the country's currency rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that any rule forcing exporters to report or
surrender hard currency earnings to the central bank could be
interpreted as an undue control on the movement of capital.
</P>
<P>
However, the news has helped to send the rupiah to
significantly higher levels against the U.S. dollar over the past
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was closed at 8,850 against the U.S. dollar at the
Jakarta inter-bank spot market on Friday, ending the week 16.5
percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Spain to Participate in NATO Air Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish government announced
Friday that Spain will participate in possible air strikes against
Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, a government spokesman,
however, said NATO's use of military force against Yugoslavia can
be realized only when all political and diplomatic efforts have
failed.
</P>
<P>
Before the use of force, the NATO members must reach clear-cut
and unified understanding on whether all diplomatic channels have
been used out, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that this position of the Spanish government
and its offer to participate in possible air strikes are intended
to strengthen the ongoing "diplomatic efforts" to seek a peaceful
settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish military revealed earlier that four Spanish F-18
jets were placed on standby and were ready to participate in
military actions against Yugoslavia once NATO made a decision.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a NATO official said Friday that the alliance was
expected to issue the order that would activate the phased air
strikes it has threatened for almost seven months.
</P>
<P>
But the issue of the activation order will not immediately lead
to actual air-borne attacks, the official hinted after the day's

</P>
<P>
NATO ambassadors are due to meet for certain on Saturday and on
Sunday as well if need arises, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"Decision is imminent and decision can be taken quickly," said
the official who explained that the activation order would
authorize the supreme commander of Europe to deliver the planned
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
NATO has amassed a total of 340 warplanes including 260 from
the United States that provided the NATO air strike operation with
two B-2 Stealth bombers and six B-52 bombers.

jinx, is almost certain to make manager Hoddle's side after
coming through a tough fitness test.
</P>
<P>
It was feared Anderton's problem might have been similar to
the injury that wrecked his playing career in the two seasons b
etween his successful appearances at Euro 96 and the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to have been seeing faith healer Eileen Drewery
this week after picking up the injury.
</P>
<P>
Anderton's recovery is good news for Hoddle - but the coach is
without several other midfielders.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ince and David Beckham are suspended, David Batty has
only just returned after injury, Rob Lee is struggling with a
virus and Ray Parlour has been sent back to Arsenal after failing
to shake off an ankle injury.

<HEADLINE> Ince out Till June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- England midfielder Paul Ince
will not play a competitive match for his country until next June
after he was given a three-match ban following his sending off
against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Ince landed an automatic suspension for one game for the red
card.
</P>
<P>
UEFA's disciplinary committee gave him a further two-match ban
for comments he made in Italian to referee Pierluigi Collina as
he left the pitch in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
European football's governing body also decided to fine the
Football Association for crowd trouble at September's European
Championship match.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool star Ince will miss England's qualifying games
against Bulgaria on Saturday, Luxembourg next Wednesday and
Poland on March 27.
</P>
<P>
The next competitive game he will be available for is the
return qualifier at home to Sweden on June 5.
</P>
<P>
England manager Glenn Hoddle said: "It is bad news for England
but I can't say I'm surprised.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA rules make clear the ban that you get for insulting a
referee and that is the punishment which Paul has received. We
are unlikely to appeal.
</P>
<P>
"Once the next few days - and our games with Bulgaria and
Luxembourg - are over, I shall be talking to Paul again, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
Football Association director of public affairs David Davies
denied that the ban had anything to do with Ince's alleged
'V-sign'towards the England bench.
</P>
<P>
And he dismissed claims that England, who have had players
sent off in their last two matches, had become an undisciplined
team.
</P>
<P>
"It is always very easy when you have a spate of disciplinary
incidents like we've had in recent weeks to think that discipline
is getting worse," Davies said.
</P>
<P>
"But if you talk to professionals who were playing the game in
the '50s and 60s, they will tell you that discipline hasn't chan
ged at all.
</P>
<P>
"What has changed over the years is that the rules and the way
they are imposed and the media's focus on the game has increased
out of all recognition."
</P>
<P>
UEFA also decided to fine the FA 60,000 Swiss francs (27,000
U.S. dollars by UEFA for racist chanting by England fans at
Sweden's Henrik Larsson and damage caused to the Rasunda Stadium
in Stockholm by supporters.
</P>
<P>
But Davies said the FA would react to the decision: "We will
most certainly be appealing against the part of the fine that r
elates to racist chanting."

<HEADLINE> Support Rate for NZ Major Opposition Party Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the Major
opposition party in New Zealand, has vaulted ahead to 48 percent
support, according to the results of an opinion poll taken by the
National Business Review-Consultus (NBR) between October 1 and 6.
</P>
<P>
This is the first survey conducted after the New Zealand
National Minority government announced its "Policies For Progress"
last week.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheme, the government intends to lower the
floor for superannuation from 65 percent of the average wage to 60
percent, offending a lot of pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The NBR poll showed the support rate for the ruling National
Party slumped six percentage points to 31 percent, while the
Labor Party, which has led the assault against the changes to
future pensions, gained six percentage points in its support
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance and ACT both slipped in the poll by one percentage
point to eight percent and five percent respectively, while the NZ
First gained one point to three percent.
</P>
<P>
The results of the poll showed in Auckland, the National Party
trailed the Labor Party by 35 percent to 44 percent and in the
provinces it was also well behind on 32 percent compared to Labor
Party's 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Wellington, the Labor Party recorded 45 percent against
National Party's 28 percent and in Christchurch the Labor Party
was on 54 percent compared to the National Party on 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NBR said the National Party had majority support only among
top income earners, where it polled 43 percent to the Labor
Party's 29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Activist Working With Rape Victims of May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A volunteers for Humanity
activist working with rape victims of the May riots was found dead
at her Central Jakarta house on Friday evening, the Jakarta Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Martadinata and popularly known as
Ita, 18, was found with her neck slashed and stab wounds on her
hands, abdomen and chest.
</P>
<P>
"Ita's body was discovered by my husband at about 6 p.m. in her
room on the second floor," Wiwin, Ita's mother was quoted by the
paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiwin believed the murderers entered the house through one of
the doors, which was found damaged. There were no witnesses to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Central Jakarta Police Precinct Lt. Col. Iman
Harjatna arrived at the scene soon after the police were notified.
He said there were no signs that the murder was related to a
robbery since none of the family's belongings was missing.
</P>
<P>
Ita, a student of Paskalis Catholic senior high school, had
reportedly been active with her mother in counseling four rape
victims.
</P>
<P>
Several activists helping rape victims of the May riots have
complained that groups of individuals have tried to use terror
tactics to force an end to their involvement in trying to disclose
information relating to the cases.
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers for Humanity was the first organization to raise
the alarm about the systematic gang-rapes during the May riots.
Led by Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi, the non-governmental
organization reported to the National Commission on Human Rights
in July that at least 168 women and children were raped or
sexually abused during the riots in Jakarta and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The government established a team in July which includes
representatives from the Armed Forces (ABRI), government agencies,
the rights body and non-governmental organizations to investigate
allegations that the riots were masterminded. The team is expected
to complete its task later this month.
</P>
<P>
National Police Chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said in August that
some non-governmental organizations were exaggerating reports of
rapes and sexual assaults against Chinese-Indonesian women during
the riots.
</P>
<P>
ABRI Commander Gen. Wiranto has also repeatedly said as
recently as Sunday that ABRI had found no evidence to substantiate
the claims.

<HEADLINE> Agent Prepares to Filed Grievance for Some Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The unity that NBA players
have shown during the owner-imposed lockout could be at an end.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta-based agent Steve Woods said Thursday that he's
considering filing a grievance with the union on behalf of
several players who are concerned about the labor impasse.
</P>
<P>
Woods told union executive director Billy Hunter of the
unnamed players' concern and plans to file a grievance Monday
unless progress toward an agreement is made.
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to more than 10 players," he says. "The consensus
is their view on unity was based more on solidarity than an
understanding of the owners' proposal and an understanding of the
union's negotiating tactics. The lockout is abstract during the
summer. Now that preseason games are canceled, it's real."
</P>
<P>
Woods says "the union has done a great job representing the
interest of its board members. Playing or not playing does not
represent a real hardship for Ewing. But for a few hundred it
represents a real hardship."

<HEADLINE> Big Names to Compete in Chicago Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Moses Tanui of Kenya and
Khalid Khannouchi are the biggest names and fastest runners in
Sunday's Chicago Marathon.
</P>
<P>
But the race has a way of producing surprises. "It's wide
open," said Khannouchi, who ran 1997's best time of 2 hours 7
minutes, 10 seconds in Chicago. "I'm ready."
</P>
<P>
The strong field that puts the world record (2:06:05) in
jeopardy also includes Elijah Lagat (2:07:41) of Kenya, Gert Thys
(2:07:52) of South Africa and Jerry Lawson (2:09:35) of the United
 States.
</P>
<P>
A late-race duel between Khannouchi, a native of Morocco
seeking U.S. citizenship, and Tanui, a two-time Boston champion
who won in April in 2:07:34, won't surprise marathon great Bill
Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
"Tanui is a great strategist, but I think Khalid has the edge
in two ways," Rodgers says. "One, I think he can outkick Moses.
That's like his secret weapon. Two, I think he hasn't raced as
much. He doesn't have as many marathons in his legs. Moses could
beat him."

MANAGUA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 5.9
degree on the Richter Scale jolted western Nicaragua off the
Pacific coast Friday morning, but no damage or death were reported
so far, said government sources.
</P>
<P>
Sources from a Nicaraguan institute on territorial studies said
the quake occurred at 5:54 local time. The epicenter was located
11.87 degrees north latitude and 86.77 degrees west longitude, 98
miles southwest of Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Strong tremors were felt in nearby cities of Managua, Masaya,
Leon, Granada and Rivas. But till Friday afternoon, there were no
reports of damage or death caused by the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Local seismologists said the quake was an event related to the
movement of the Cocos and Caribbean tectonic plates.

<HEADLINE> Hearts Vow to Challenge UEFA Decision </HEADLINE>

LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Scottish club Hearts vowed on
Friday that they will continue their fight to remain in the Cup
Winners' Cup, despite UEFA turning down their appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Cup holders are furious that their appeal against
Real Mallorca over non-regulation goalposts was dismissed on
Thursday by UEFA's disciplinary committee on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
Hearts were told that their appeal had failed because they did
not register it in writing before the kick-off of the first-round
second leg match in Palma on October 1.
</P>
<P>
But Hearts chief executive Chris Robinson said on BBC Radio on
Friday: "This story has some way to run. Our appeal was dismissed
on a technicality but we are hopeful that now UEFA have the
evidence in front of their eyes, they might change their mind."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, a Free Market by Law: Finance Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's law provides that
it should remain a free market and actually it is, said Finance
Secretary Donald Tsang here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is still probably the freest economy in the world
with no restrictions on capital flows, a stable and freely
convertible currency, no restrictions on gold or silver trading,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has no duties payable on virtually all goods, no
trade quotas, he said, noting that what Kong Kong has is a low tax
system, the rule of law and a fast unfettered flow of news and
information.
</P>
<P>
Tsang made the remarks at a luncheon co-hosted by the National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the Hong Kong Economic and
Trade Office in New York.
</P>
<P>
Tsang is on a three-week tour of world financial and business
centers to give a factual picture of the economic situation in
Hong Kong and to exchange views on how to stabilize the world
financial market.
</P>
<P>
His trip, kicked off on September 27, has already taken him to
Frankfurt, Munich, the Hague, Amsterdam and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We thrive on a free market," he said. "We will not impose
capital controls, we have no intention of taking a covert position
in the stock market, we will not devalue the Hong Kong dollar."
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to judge our commitment to the free market by a
single, extraordinary battle at a time of great economic turmoil,
and when massive, secretive and destructive capital flows were
creating havoc in the markets," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
The battle was referred to the Hong Kong government's action to
buy shares in August to dispel a handful of speculators who
"threatened Hong Kong's very economic existence."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that about a week ago the government announced the
establishment of a separate company to professionally manage the
portfolio of shares purchased during the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government does not want to seek representation on
the board of those companies in which it has substantial holdings
and that it will disclose the share holdings in due course.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 business leaders attended the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Tsang will continue his journey in Boston and London and is due
to return to Hong Kong on October 20.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Talks with Milosevic is Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing talks between
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic over Kosovo on Friday in Belgrade were tough but
inconclusive, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said he spoke to
Holbrooke at about 1 p.m. local time (1800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Holbrooke told me that those were very intense
discussions and tough going. He did not, to me, characterize
either positively or negatively those discussions except to say
that they will resume," he added.
</P>
<P>
"He's highly focused on the matter at hand, which is trying to
persuade Mr. Milosevic to comply in a thoroughgoing, durable,
verifiable way. And it's hard work. And he's not there. And so he
remains in Belgrade," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Milosevic began a second meeting in Belgrade
later on Friday as Western leaders stepped up the pressure for the
Serbians to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke spent 3 1/2 hours trying to persuade Milosevic to
comply with U.N. demands on the province of Kosovo. Holbrooke's
previous rounds of talks with Milosevic made no progress.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asks Belgrade to comply fully with the U.N. Security
Council Resolution that demands Yugoslavia end fighting in Kosovo,
withdraw its troops, allow relief groups access to refugees and
begin negotiating a final settlement.

<HEADLINE> Global IT Spending Approaching 2 Trillion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Global spending on
information technology (IT) and communications, including internal
corporate spending, reached almost 2 trillion U.S. dollars in
1997, according to a new study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the U.S. market researcher
International Data Corporation (IDC) for the World Information
Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA), indicated that the IT
industry was growing at a rate substantially faster than worldwide
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the results of the study suggest that national GDP
grows when information and communication technology (ICT) spending
increases and that even in the face of worsening economic
conditions, the effect on ICT spending is muted, the WITSA said in
the news release. The WITSA is a consortium of IT industry
associations from economies around the world.

<P>
The study, based on data gathered in the 50 largest country
markets as well as four rest of region components, shows that the
"information economy" is not a vague abstraction but a powerful
force, contributing 6 percent of aggregate global GDP to the world
economy, the WITSA said.

By making a substantial contribution to productivity, the WITSA
said, information and communication technology is helping
countries and companies of all sizes reach their strategic goals.

In an interview with Xinhua in Los Angeles earlier this week,
IDC chairman Patrick McGovern said that computers and network
systems played a big role in raising productivity and enabling the
eight-year consecutive economic growth in the United States. In
fact, he said, IT makes knowledge available for individual workers
and information exchange and coordination possible and efficient
within and among the enterprises. The result is bigger sales and
profits without adding employees.
</P>
<P>
The new study also provides additional evidence of the
mind-boggling growth of personal computers and their influence on
education. At year end 1997, 118 million personal computers had
been installed in homes and educational institutions worldwide, up
from 35 million in 1992. According to IDC forecast, World Wide Web
utilization will hit 100 million people by the end of this year
and 320 million by 2002. Every year, an additional 50 million
people gain access to telephone lines in their homes.
</P>
<P>
In country to country comparisons, the study said that the U.S.
spent 643 billion dollars on ICT in 1997, twice as much as Japan
at 317 billion dollars. These two countries represent 53 percent
of the world marketplace. Other "top five spenders" are Germany,
Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific has been the fastest growing ICT market over the
last five years, with Japan, Australia, China and South Korea
among the top spenders. China, ranked in the top 10 ICT markets,
grew at a rate of 28.5 percent, the IDC study said. According to
McGovern, China is expected to become the world's largest ICT
market by 2008.

<HEADLINE> Global IT Spending Approaching $2 Trillion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Global spending on
information technology (IT) and communications, including internal
corporate spending, reached almost 2 trillion U.S. dollars in
1997, according to a new study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the U.S. market researcher
International Data Corporation (IDC) for the World Information
Technology and Services Alliance (WITSA), indicated that the IT
industry was growing at a rate substantially faster than worldwide
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the results of the study suggest that national GDP
grows when information and communication technology (ICT) spending
increases and that even in the face of worsening economic
conditions, the effect on ICT spending is muted, WITSA said in the
news release. WITSA is a consortium of IT industry associations
from economies around the world.

</P>
<P>
"This support is based on principles," he said when General
Abdulsalam Abubakar, the Nigerian Head of State, called on him at
the Castle, Osu, at the start of a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said Nigeria had faced international condemnation
because the international community did not understand its
complex situation.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the volatile situation during the regime of
late General Sani Abacha and congratulated Abubakar on his
efforts at reducing the tension.
</P>
<P>
"You have demonstrated outstanding leadership and it is our
hope that the international community will continue to support
you to give Nigeria a breathing space to sow the seed of a stable
Nigeria," Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Abubakar said in reply that "Ghana has been an
outstanding friend of Nigeria" and thanked President Rawlings for
defending Nigeria at various fora during its most difficult
times.

<HEADLINE> NIST Develops Instruments to Measure Rail Wheel Stress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a system that
could be used to test railway wheel stress that may lead to
cracking and derailment.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the NIST, Raymond E.
Schramm from the NIST's Materials Reliability Division, Boulder,
Colorado, has worked out a system whereby ultrasonic waves are
sent through a railroad wheel rim and echoed back. By measuring
the very small difference in travel time of two waves as they pass
through the rim of a railroad wheel, scientists can determine the
hoop stress and the conditions that could lead to cracking and
failure of the entire wheel.
</P>
<P>
The instrumentation package is compact, assembled largely of
commercial electronics, highly automated and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
Two possible uses of the system are in quality control at the
wheel factory and as a screening tool in a shop environment to
evaluate the condition of wheels during routine maintenance and
inspection.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry has expressed "astonishment"
at a statement made by Turkish ambassador in Amman, alleging that
Iraq has contacts with the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK), outlawed
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency Friday, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman termed the Turkish allegations as
groundless.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf War in which Iraqi troops were defeated, U.S.
and British aircrafts have been using Turkish military base to
enforce a no-fly zone in northern Iraq, under the name of
protecting Iraqi Kurds there. Baghdad has been mainly ineffective
in its control over the region.
</P>

Fighting since 1984 for autonomy in southeast Turkey, PKK
militants often launched cross-border attacks on targets inside

pledge was contained in an oral massage from Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad to his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel,
conveyed by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi who was on a
mediation mission.

<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering its rebel group
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and threatened to use force against
rebel camps inside Syria. Syria denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that there are PKK sympathizers among the
people. So, we can not stop the PKK activities immediately, but we
banned the PKK organization and we are arresting the PKK
militants," Assad was quoted as saying in the oral message.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Assad acknowledged that there were PKK
members in Syria and affirmed that he did not support them.

ABU DHABI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Crown Prince of Bahrain Sheikh
Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa met here Friday with visiting U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen to exchange views on the situation
in Middle East and related issues.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Manama, the crown prince, who is also
commander-in-chief of Bahrain's armed forces, also discussed with
Cohen ways of strengthening defense cooperation between the two
sides.

Bahrain, the central Gulf island state has provided facilities
for U.S. Navy warships for decades, and its role was important to
the U.S. Navy operations during the 1990 Gulf Crisis.

Cohen arrived in Manama Thursday night to start a tour of the
members states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups
Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudia Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Opposition: No Need For New Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's main opposition New
Patriotic Party (NPP) said Friday that that there is no need to
purchase a new presidential plane because of the many other
important issues confronting the nation.
</P>
<P>
The NPP said in a statement that the 40 million U.S. Dollars
to spent on the new plane could be used to provide better health
and education facilities, among others, a special report reaching
here from Ghana News Agency (GNA) said.
</P>
<P>
It said the excuse that President Jerry John Rawlings travels
on the plane to canvass for investment is defeated by the
partisan nature of his huge entourage.
</P>
<P>
The president and his huge entourage on those trips have cost
this nation more than the investments they have brought in. Apart
from the investments being mainly extractive, it has brought in
people accused of introducing "apartheid" into Ghana, the GNA
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the President and his wife need to travel, there are
commercial planes aplenty. When Queen Elizabeth (of Britain) had
to go to Brunei, she flew in a commercial plane and we have not
heard of any harm coming to her..." the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The NPP doubted the genuineness of the assessment that the
presidential plane was not air worthy because it was over-aged.
</P>
<P>
The NPP is aware that South African President Nelson Mandela
flies around in a plane that is said to be 40 years old, which is
at least twice as old as the presidential plane which the Council
of State and other government supporters have named "the flying
coffin," the statement said.
