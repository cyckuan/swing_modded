<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Youth Urged to Go Into Informal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Education, Sports and
Culture Minister Gabriel Machinga today implored school leavers
to go to the informal sector for their future, as jobs are
increasingly becoming scarce in the formal market.
</P>
<P>
He said the informal sector in Zimbabwe was expanding and now
employing more people.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of Bikita Informal Sector
Association in south Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to promote the informal sector because that is
where most jobs are now coming from, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Whereas in 1996 the formal sector employed 1.26 million
people, the informal sector employed a higher number of 1.56
million the same year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe churns out about 300,000 school leavers annually.
</P>
<P>
"Of all those children going out of school, only 25 percent
get jobs. The other 75 percent simply go into the world because
jobs are scarce, their only hope lies in the informal sector," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides jobs being scarce, education in Zimbabwe was
increasingly becoming expensive for both the government and the
parents, said Machinga.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ruling Party Demands Law-Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF)
today held a one-day conference to discuss the party constitution
and the country's national constitution in Gweru, central
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zanu (PF) Secretary for Legal Affairs Eddison Zvobgo said
misunderstandings in the party arose because provincial executive
members did not understand the constitution of the party.
</P>
<P>
He said if party cadres did not understand the rules and
regulations of the party, Zanu (PF) would always be bogged down
with squabbles.
</P>
<P>
"This should not happen in a party which is as old as ours,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by commissars, legal
secretaries and other executive members from the party's 10
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Zvobgo stressed it was important for all executive members to
understand the country's national constitution and the party's
constitution so that they would follow proper procedures when
dealing with matters in their respective provinces.
</P>
<P>
He urged Zanu (PF) members not to plant seeds of disunity among
party members, because the 1987 unity accord signed by President
Robert Mugabe and Vice-President Joshua Nkomo was "irrevocable".
</P>
<P>
The accord saw the merger of the country's main rival political
parties, the ruling Zanu (PF) and Nkomo's Zapu (PF).
</P>
<P>
Zvobgo said the legal conference was not capable of amending
the party's constitution as that could only be done by congress.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also discuss the restructuring of the
party, salient provisions of the constitution, the disciplinary
code of conduct, the legal framework of local government and
national elections.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Holds Referendum on Lowering Voting Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Botswana people went to
the polls today for a referendum to decide on key constitutional
changes, South African media reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments would lower the voting age from 21 to
18, allow citizens resident outside Botswana to vote and
introduce an independent electoral commission, South African
Press Association said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth amendment to the constitution, limiting the
president's term of office to ten years, was recently approved by
parliament and would not be subject to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has had only two presidents -- the late Seretse Khama
who died in office after serving for 14 years and Ketumile Masire
who has been in power for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
Although there is wide speculation that Masire, 72, will not
seek re-election in 1999, legally he would be able to serve for
two more five-year terms because the constitutional amendment is
not retroactive.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is seen by observers as a test for President
Masire's ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), whose majority
support has been declining in recent polls, said The Citizen
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The BDP, which holds 31 of the 44 seats in parliament, has
been formulating changes to the constitution since last year
following pressure from its youth members and opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Lowering the voting age could reduce BDP's share of voter
support, reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to official projections, lowering the voting age
will add eligible 53,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
The 1,600 voting stations, many of them in remote areas of the
Kalahari desert and the northwest of Botswana, opened at 6.30
a.m. local time (0430 GMT) and would close at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT)
today.
</P>
<P>
Only registered voters above the age of 21 were allowed to
take part in today's referendum.
</P>
<P>
Results from the remote areas would not be available in the
capital of Gaborone until late Sunday or early Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments have already been debated in
parliament and the ruling BDP and opposition Botswana National
Front have voiced their approval for the changes.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Reassured of Enduring Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Both Joaqium Chissano, President
of Mozambique and Afonso Dhlakama, Chairman of National
Resistance Movement of Mozambique (NRM), the biggest opposition
party, agreed today that the country could enjoy an endurable
peace.
</P>
<P>
Chissano and Dhlakama made the remark on an occasion marking
the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Rome General Protocol
for Peace between the government and NRM, according to Mozambican
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that the consolidated peace the country is
enjoying is not a fruit of either the government or any
individual, but a result of the combined effort of the whole
society.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no condition for a renewal of war in the
country, as no one in or outside of the country wish to see
another war in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Though there are still a few armed groups hindering the free
flow of personnel and materials, they could by no means pose as a
threat to the peace in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano added that consensus should be reached for a joint
action on these armed groups.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama also excluded the possibility of war in the country,
stressing that national reconciliation is the key to consolidate
peace.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the whole society should bear the
responsibility for peace and democracy in Mozambique, adding that
"peace depends on the understanding among the people in the
country. "
</P>
<P>
The president and the NRM leader urged people of all walks in
the society to join hands to keep the country away from war.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama denied that there are still NRM armed personnel
operating in the forests.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Considers Sanctions against S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council may impose a global oil, arms and travel embargo against
Sierra Leone to press the military junta to surrender as a draft
resolution is reportedly under discussion.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted UN diplomats as saying Friday
that the 15-member body aimed to adopt the measures before a west
African regional summit next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A British drafted resolution currently circulating calls on
the military junta which seized power in the May 25 coup this
year to "take immediate steps to relinquish power in Sierra Leone
and make way for the restoration of the democratically elected
government."
</P>
<P>
A similar demand was also made by the United States Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions aim to support the efforts of the 16-nation
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) targeted at
reinstating the government of ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
However, the measures envisaged are less broad than the west
African regional package of sanctions adopted at the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the international sanctions would
remain in force until the Kabbah government and "constitutional
order" are restored.
</P>
<P>
The council draft notably calls for a ban on the sale or
supply of "petroleum or petroleum products or arms and related
material of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military
vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment and spare parts".
</P>
<P>
It also provides for international travel restrictions against
"members of the military junta in Sierra Leone and adult members
of their families".
</P>
<P>
But humanitarian assistance will not be affected by the
proposed embargo.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft resolution under discussion, a
committee will be established to monitor the implementation of
the sanctions against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
African leaders, including President Kabbah, were pressing the
council to agree to the possible use of force to ensure the
application of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
This point, however, had not yet been agreed by council
members.
</P>
<P>
The west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) ordered by ECOWAS
to enforce economic sanctions and embargo on Sierra Leone has
announced that it will attack any violators of the ECOWAS
decision.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has reportedly dropped bombs against ships accused of
unloading arms and ammunition at the port of Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the force called on international organizations
intending to deliver humanitarian aid to Sierra Leone to get
clearance from it so as to be protected and assisted.

<HEADLINE> Indian Premier's Visit to Tighten Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral arrived in Uganda today to pay a two-day state visit
to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
He was received at the Entebbe international airport by
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and other high-ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
Gujral later today held private talks with Museveni and other
Ugandan officials.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Gujral accompanied by a group of
high-ranking officials and a delegation of businessmen and
industrialists will visit local factories.
</P>
<P>
He will unveil a monument to commemorate M.K. Gandhi, late
leader of Indian National Independence Movement at Jinja, 80
kilometers east of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his visit, Gujral will hold a joint press
conference together with Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and India have a long trade and social relationship.
However in 1972, the former Ugandan President Idi Amin expelled
more than 80,000 Asians mostly Indians who controlled the core
investments in the country and gave their property to Africans.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this policy of putting the economy in the hands
of Africans bungled and Uganda's once envied economy in the
region went down.
</P>
<P>
However when Museveni captured power in 1986 he launched a
campaign to lure back the expelled and dispossessed Asians to
Uganda. Many of them have regained their property and the
decaying factories have been revived.
</P>
<P>
Now there are a number of heavy and light factories all over
the country which are built by the new surge of Indian investors.

NICOSIA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- British helicopters and Cypriot
police helped evacuate tourists and crew members today from the
Cypriot registered cruise liner "Romantica" that caught fire some
100 kilometers off the southern coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
All 487 passengers and 186 crew members of the cruise ship
were safely evacuated and eventually arrived at the Limassol Port.
Most of the passengers on the three-day cruise to Egypt and

The Romantica, a 10,500-tonne Cypriot ship, was returning to
Limassol port from Port Said, Egypt when it caught fire.

<HEADLINE> Recruitment to Strengthen Liberia's National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
said today he would soon begin recruiting able-bodied Liberians
for training to strengthen national security.
</P>
<P>
"We shall shortly order the massive recruitment and training
of able-bodied men and women to protect and defend the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of this country," Taylor
said on his private radio station in the capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who was just back from his visit to Libya a day ago,
said the plan would include the restructuring of the national
army and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL).
</P>
<P>
Restructure of Liberia's army and security force is the final
phase in the implementation of the Abuja peace accord which
brought to an end the country's seven-year-old bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
The west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, which has
taken charge for ensuring security in Liberia since its
successful disarmament and demobilization of the warring factions
in the country, will help in the restructuring and training job,
according to the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor said his government would go ahead with the
restructuring of the army, arguing that the task lied within his
constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait for no one to restructure the AFL because it is
in my constitutional responsibility to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Defense Minister Daniel Chea last month backed out
on an attempt to restructure the Liberian army after ECOMOG Force
Commander Major-General Victor Malu warned that the task was the
responsibility of the force.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord, ECOMOG will remain in Liberia for six
months after the elected government took office on August 2 for
the restructuring and training mission.
</P>
<P>
But the job did not begin as scheduled for some reasons and
ECOMOG is expected to extend its stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor returned home Friday following a medical trip to South
Africa, a two-day visit to Nigeria and one to Libya as well as a
number of other African countries.

<HEADLINE> Africa Enjoys Better Image, Ethiopian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada said today that Africa's wretched image is now changing
for the better thanks to a host of measures being taken by
African governments and indigenous institutions.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the Ethiopian president in his
opening address to the 7th General Assembly of the All Africa
Conference of Churches (AACC) which opened at the United Nations
Conference Center here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The continued implementation of economic reform programs and
the strengthening of market-based and private sector-driven
policies, among others, have greatly contributed to the steady
recovery of the economies of a number of african countries,"
President Negasso said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "similarly, the process of transition to
democratic systems of government in many parts of the continent
has created a conducive situation for peace and stability and for
a favorable climate for economic and social progress."
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the many contributions made by the African
churches, which include the preservation of the African cultures
and the spiritual guidance to the liberation struggle from the
yoke of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
As the millennium closes in, he said the churches of Africa
"have a spiritual and moral obligation to exert maximum effort
towards the mobilization of resources from both inside and
outside Africa to address the pressing and immediate social and
economic needs of our fellow Africans."
</P>
<P>
Abune Paulos, patriarch of the Ethiopian orthodox church, on
his part said on the threshold of the 21st century churches in
Africa "should muster the resolve to address the social and
spiritual problems of the African peoples in the continent and
throughout the diaspora."
</P>
<P>
Desmond Tutu, President of AACC, in his speech stressed the
cooperation between African churches and governments, saying that
churches in Africa should cooperate closely with governments in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The 7-day 7th assembly of the AACC is being attended by more
than 800 participants from about 150 member churches from nearly
40 African countries.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects Israel to Release More Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official said
here today that Jordan expected Israel to release more
Palestinian prisoners following the release of Shiekh Ahmed
Yassin, founder of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
The release of Yassin would hopefully be the beginning of
"something good," Samir Mutawe, Minister of State for
Information Affairs, told the press after a regular cabinet
meeting, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Mutawe, Yassin would return to the Gaza Strip
within a week.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not elaborate on Israel's possible steps on
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israel released ailing Yassin, who was jailed by Israel in 1989
and spent eight years of a life sentence for ordering attacks by
Hamas guerrillas against Israeli targets, on Jordanian King
Hussein's demand on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has expressed the hope that the release of Yassin would
be the first step of a series of Israeli actions that might help
reactivate the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During the process of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations
which has been stalled since Israel started to build Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem in March, hundreds of
Palestinians, including Hamas members, were jailed by Israel for
wide-ranging reasons.
</P>
<P>
The number of the Palestinians jailed by Israel has not been
available till now.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel's
occupation of Palestine. Most Hamas political bureau members live
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is
one of the only two Arab countries that conceived peace
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian City to Recycle Solid Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Oyo state government has
decided to negotiate with foreign companies on how to recycle
wastes generated in the capital city of Ibadan, the second
largest in west Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Modalities are now being worked out for the processing of
solid wastes into in-organic fertilizer, according to Alhaji
Raimi Gbadamosi, general manager of the Ibadan Solid Waste
Management Authority (ISWMA).
</P>
<P>
ISWMA, set up four months ago, has received the state
government approval to negotiate with some foreign companies for
this end, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The general manager expected to begin commercialization of the
locally produced fertilizer six months after the take-off of the
project, adding that this would further alleviate the hardship
suffered by farmers in the procurement of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the state government had since June
committed the sum of about 24,000 U.S. Dollars to refuse
disposal.
</P>
<P>
However, he observed that ISWMA's equipment was inadequate to
cope with the volume of waste generated within Ibadan metropolis
and its environs.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted at the uncooperative attitude of the people
as the pay-as-you-dump policy had not been received well.
</P>
<P>
People would rather dump their refuse by the roadside than pay
to have them evacuated by officials of the authority, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia: Management Matters in Animal Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Wild life in Ethiopia's
Awash National Park, one of the foremost tourist attractions in
the country, is reportedly dwindling for lack of proper care and
protection, the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, cattle herders have now settled over
two-thirds of the protected area in search of grazing land due to
rain shortage in the locality.
</P>
<P>
The unwarranted settlement in the park has greatly impacted
the reproduction and the overall life style of the animals. The
habitat for over 580 mammals and bird species is now flooded with
flocks of cattle resulting in dwindling number of the much
coveted wild life.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a study as saying that the number of gazelle
in the park has dropped from 1500 to 215, deer from 600 to 84 and
that of oryx from 400 to 925 in a period of two decades. At the
same time zebras and bushbucks have long disappeared from the
park.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an earlier report by the Ethiopian News Agency said
that the number of animals in another national park in the
northern part of the country has increased due to discouragement
of the practice of tree-felling, protection of the forest from
fire as well as employment of 14 guards.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in Humera Park in the northern part
of the country, the number of elephants which has been limited
less than 70 in the past has reached 170 now.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the number of other wild animals such as
leopard, greater kudu, clip springer and bush duiker existing in
the park has also increased.

JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi,
Minister of Finance of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
today called on Israel to release the funds it owns to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The amount paid over by Israel to the PNA so far represents
only 40 percent of the total and another 110 million
U.S. dollars of funds still remain in Israeli hands, Jerusalem
Media and Communication Center quoted Nashashibi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The funds, namely all kinds of taxes and revenues, were
collected by Israel on behalf of the PNA. So far Israel has
announced three times to release the funds to the PNA due to the
improvement of security cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi said the PNA now has a deficit of over 116 million
dollars as a result of the Israeli closure imposed on PNA
territories. The donor countries also have not paid the amounts
they pledged to projects to build Palestinian infrastructure, he
added.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the difficulties faced by the PNA in economic
development, the Ministry of Industry has recently asked local
banks to purchase shares in companies.

JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli-Canadian
relationship has been damaged by an attack on Hamas (the Islamic
Resistance Movement of Palestine) leader last week in Jordanian
capital of Amman, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted political sources here as saying that only two
weeks ago, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy reached an
agreement with his Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy to enhance
cooperation between Israel and Canada and Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien accepted an invitation to visit Israel soon.
</P>
<P>
But now the Canadian prime minister's visit to Israel is in
doubt, the radio quoted the sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamas leader Khaled Mashal was attacked and injured on
September 25 by two attackers holding Canadian passports which
were proved to be forged ones.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Jordanian police has identified the two
attackers, one from Jerusalem, and another from a charity
organization in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The report said they were sent by Israeli security service
Mossad to conduct this attack, and a total of eight agents
entered into Jordan for this mission, three of them now have
taken refugee at the Israeli Embassy in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian authority so far has not confirmed whether the two
attackers are agents of Mossad or not, saying only that the
investigation is still going on.
</P>
<P>
Canada has taken this matter very seriously, and recalled its
ambassador to Israel Thursday for "immediate consultations."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry has expressed regret over the
recall of Canadian envoy and hopes to maintain friendly
relations with Canada.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli government officials, including Prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy, have so far
made no comment on this matter.

<HEADLINE> Britain, United States Heading for Row Over Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United States are
heading for a diplomatic row over the use of British companies to
circumvent international economic sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Some well-placed sources were quoted by the Observer newspaper
as saying that some of the equipment supplied to Libya might be
used in the manufacture of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has already taken legal action against a
number of American companies which have supplied computers and
pipeline equipment to Libya through British companies.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington has expressed concern that there had been
no similar prosecutions in Britain with U.S. Customs director
Michael Turner criticizing the London government's stance on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign governments, including the British, cooperate in
helping make cases against American companies, but when it comes
to making prosecutions in their own countries, they are
reluctant," Turner said.
</P>
<P>
In response, a British Foreign Office spokesman said, "No one
has been more vigorous in imposing United Nations sanctions than
us."
</P>
<P>
"If we had any reason to believe that British companies had
breached our obligations, we would take immediate action," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed recently that a British company had linked to
U.S. investigation into alleged violations of U.N. economic
sanctions against Libya.

<HEADLINE> Israel: No Comments on Hamas Leader Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet today
discussed the recent attack in Amman against a Hamas leader, but
shunning comments on the event which led to diplomatic strife with
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The government "refrains at this time from commenting on media
reports regarding activities against Hamas leader Khaled Mashal,"
said a statement issued after the first cabinet meeting since the
Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
Mashal, a political leader of Hamas, was attacked on September
25 by two "tourists" holding forged Canadian passports. Jordanian
police arrested the attackers and said they are Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
Local press and politicians have pointed that if the attempted
attack proved to be the work of the intelligence agency Mossad,
then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must bear the
responsibility as he was powered to issue the final order for such
operations.
</P>
<P>
The statement criticized the reports against Netanyahu that he
should resign if he ordered this attack, saying those
"irresponsible attacks at home on the Prime Minister...would harm
vital national interests of the State of Israel."
</P>
<P>
"False charges are being published, thus cynically exploiting a
situation in which the government is, at present, refraining from
comment," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government, declaring the use of its passports by
foreign agents to be unacceptable, recalled its ambassador to
Israel on Friday, threatening to consider further actions against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been hunting Hamas, or the Islamic
Resistance Movement which claimed responsibility for the two
bombing events against Israelis in July and September in
Jerusalem, killing at least 26 people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Emphasized Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
stressed the importance of environmental protection, saying
China's final goal is to make its environmental protection keep up
with what is required in its modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Li said that "We are soberly aware of the fact that China's
environmental protection is lagging behind what it should be in
many aspects, which urges China to further strengthen legislation
and supervision in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Li made these remarks today when meeting with foreign and
Chinese participants in the first meeting of the Second Phase of
the China Council for International Co-operation on Environment
and Development (CCICED).
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the recent 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party has listed a sustainable development and a
revitalization of China through science and education as a key to
development, which China should stick to in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The current government and the next will pay due attention
to the issue of environment and development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that anything that can destroy resources, and
damage the environment for the subsistence of our descendants
should be stopped, and the control-after-pollution lesson should
be drawn on.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the shift of the economic system from the
traditional planned economy to a socialist market economy, and the
shift of the economic growth mode from extensive to intensive, as
well as the improvement of the quality of China's economic growth
are closely related to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China pays equal attention to the developing and saving of
resources, and over the recent years, considerable progress has
been made as regard to energy saving, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China attaches great importance to the
legislation concerning environmental protection, and corresponding
laws and regulations directed against the water, gas, noise, solid
water pollution have been formulated.
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, those seriously polluting township
enterprises have undergone renovation, while in the cities,
progress has been made in different aspects such as the increase
of the gasification proportion, central heating, non-lead gasoline
usage, classified garbage disposal, foul water disposal and etc.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, measures have been taken to prevent the
desertification in the remote areas, Li said, adding China has
stressed the increase of forest coverage, and at present, China
has set up some 800 nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the CCICED, since its founding five years ago, has
done an effective job, and its foreign members have put forward
many constructive suggestions which are helpful to China's
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the foreign experts, with their
knowledge, speciality and experience, will continue to offer
consultations. The Premier also hoped that Chinese and foreign
members of the council will co-operate closely to score a greater
achievement.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Environmental Protection Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to improve
environmental protection, and will cooperate with other counties
to promote sustained sound development.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Song Jian made the remarks today during an
address to the closing session of the first meeting of the Second
Phase of the China Council for International Cooperation on
Environment and Development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has intensified ecological protection
and pollution control while expanding its economy. The government
has seriously implemented international environment conventions,
and has extended great efforts to reduce the rate of greenhouse gas
emissions. Related efforts have established environmental
protection with Chinese characteristics, said Song, who also
serves as chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Song thanked the China Council for International Cooperation on
Environment and Development for its major contributions to
furthering China's environmental protection, and expressed the hope

such as pollution control, protecting biodiversity and promoting
sustained agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
China has recored gratifying achievements in environmental
protection at a time when the nation's economy is in transition
from conventional to sustainable development. China's industrial
enterprises are replacing conventional backward technology with
cleaner production technology. In addition, China has also
recorded new progress in environmental legislation and has greatly
enhanced the general public's awareness of the need for
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, vice-chairman of the first meeting and chairman of
the National People's Congress Environment and Resources
Protection Committee, cited the achievements as a proof of the
fact that China's environmental protection efforts have entered a
new period of development.
</P>

The China Council for International Cooperation on Environment
and Development, established in 1992, consists of senior officials
and scholars from both at home and abroad, as well as officials
from relevant UN organizations in Beijing. The council advises the
Chinese government on environmental protection and development
issues.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the three-day meeting will discuss issues
ranging from China's environmental economics to energy strategies
for protecting biodiversity. The meeting is expected to provide
valuable recommendations to the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary in France Over South Command, Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen is on a four-day visit here since Saturday
over an Iran-France oil deal and a U.S.-France dispute over NATO's
South Command.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he will remind France of Washington's concern that
Iran could obtain technology for producing massive destruction
weapons with currency earned in oil deals with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
And he is expected to refuse France's demand that the NATO
South Command be headed by a European.
</P>
<P>
The French oil giant Total and its coalition partners, Russia's
Gazprom, Malaysia' Petronas signed a 2 billion dollar contract
with Iran last month on jointly developing an offshore gas field
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The deal is the biggest foreign investment in Iran since the
1979 revolution and defies U.S. threats that the contract would
trigger punitive action.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act passed in 1996,
U.S. President Bill Clinton is required to impose sanctions on any
foreign company investing more than 20 million dollars a year in
the two countries' energy industries.
</P>
<P>
Only one week after the Total deal, the Pentagon decided to
send the aircraft carrier Nimitz to the Persian Gulf. The
73,000-ton carrier, which usually carrier about 50 F-14 and F/A-18
combat aircrafts, would arrive the region by mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iran raided on based of the Mujahideen Khalq, the
main Iranian opposition group. One of the bases was inside the
no-fly zone imposed by the United States and its allies since 1992
over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Cohen is also due to meet French Defense
Minister Alain Richard. The discussion is likely to include
U.S. rejection of French demands that the United States turn over
command of southern NATO forces based in Naples to a European
officer.
</P>
<P>
France has put on hold its earlier-announced plans to rejoin
NATO's military structure, which it pulled out in 1966, because of
fight over the south command.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been heading the South Command and two
other supreme strategic commanding seats of NATO. Germany, Spain
and Italy also want the South Command to be headed by a European.

BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation

</P>
<P>
General Fu Quanyou, a member of the Central Military

<HEADLINE> Public Ownership Beneficial to Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese-American scholar
pointed out that owning to its public-ownership dominated economy,
China has advantages in controlling pollution and coordinate economic
development and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 14th annual International Pittsburgh Coal
Conference and Workshop of Clean Coal Technology and Coal
Utilization that convened here late last month, Chiang
Shiao-hung, director of the Center for Energy Studies at the
Pittsburgh University, said both developed and developing
countries are challenged by pollution problems caused by coal
mining, transportation and burning.
</P>
<P>
The best solution is to popularize the coal washing technology,
renovate emission installment of automobiles and use pipeline for
coal transport.
</P>
<P>
Because of different economic system, Chiang said, the developed
countries have a hard time for using the private land to build up
oil, gas and coal pipelines.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has no such headaches. The government can
mobilize the whole society in a well-organized manner to take part
in environmental protection projects. It can organize enterprises
to undertake environmental-friendly energy projects and popularize
anti-pollution technologies.
</P>
<P>
Chiang suggested China try to use pipeline to transport coal in
the future as it will encounter no problems in using the land for
such projects.
</P>
<P>
Chun Sun W, a senior advisor to the Department of Energy of the
United States said that China became the world number one coal
producer last year with 1.3 billion tons of output.
</P>
<P>
It has great potential in coal utilization and a high-level
research team to work on coal-related pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign specialists agreed that China has made headways in
both building up a legal framework for environmental protection
and promoting the coordinated development of national economy and
environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> National Check to Streamline China's Financial and Tax Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
highest governing body, will launch a nationwide check on taxes,
financial operations and prices this fall in order to ensure sound
financial order to support the country's economic upsurge.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli addressed a national meeting of
senior financial officials and urged governments at all levels to
participate in related efforts in order to ensure the
authoritativeness and precision of the check.
</P>
<P>
The check will begin this year and will basically be completed
by next Spring Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year's Day,
which falls on January 28, 1998. The check will focus on
violations of the country's tax and price laws during the
1996-1997 fiscal year, as well as on serious cases in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Institutions subject to the check will include major
contributors of value-added, consumption and income taxes, as well
as financial and insurance institutions, non-banking organizations,
grain departments, government enterprises, and shareholding,
collective and private companies with poor financial management.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the check, a financial management method with Chinese
characteristics, reflects the needs of the ongoing macro-control
effort and will help streamline the legal system governing the
country's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The central government will increase the effectiveness of the
check by abolishing internal checks completed without the
participation of impartial organizations, and will further
strengthen enforcement of the country's financial laws, according
to Liu.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Kuwait to Sign Two Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Turkey will
sign an agreement on the prevention of double taxation and a
cultural exchange program during a visit by Turkish President
Suleiman Demirel to Kuwait due Monday, Turkish ambassador to
Kuwait Ahmet Ertay said today.
</P>
<P>
Ertay told the official Kuwait News Agency that the cultural
protocol is planned to cover the next two years and added that "we
hope this program will help to reactivate the cultural relations
which have been neglected over the years."
</P>
<P>
Demirel's Kuwait visit, which comes in response to an
invitation made by Kuwaiti Amir, would be the second of its kind
since 1991. He last visited Kuwait in January 1993 when he was
Prime Minister of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ertay described the visit as one "between brothers and
friends," adding that "it will create the opportunity on the
highest level to exchange views on both regional and
international issues that concern both countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait attaches great importance to Demirel's visit. Kuwaiti
cabinet expressed warmly welcome to Demirel's visit at a
meeting earlier today, stressing the importance of the expected
meeting of Demirel and Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah in further boosting the distinguished bilateral ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey supported Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War which liberated
Kuwait from the seven-month Iraqi occupation and adopted a firm
position towards the Iraqi invasion. Since then the two states
exchanged many official visits.
</P>
<P>
Ertay said there are a number of high level visits between
the two countries that are pending and should be realized in the
near future. Trade volume between the two countries is 200
million U.S. dollars, Ertay pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the "visit will help to boost
economic and cultural relations between both countries."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Witnesses Economic Recovery in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Chen Cailin )
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) --Economic recovery in Africa
beginning in 1994 continued in 1996 with an average of growth
rate of 3.9 percent in that year, and experts at the United
Nations Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD) forecast
that economic recovery in Africa can be expected to maintain its
current growth trend in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The current growth trend on the African continent indicates
that Africa's economy has walked out the gorge which started in
1980s, said the UNCTAD in its 1997 "Trade and Development Report".
</P>
<P>
The significant development of African economy had several
characters: firstly, Africa's economic growth last year surpassed
the average growth rate of 2.8 percent of the whole world, thus
the continent was regarded as the second fastest in its economic
growth in the world, lagging only behind Asia.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, economic recovery has become more widespread in the
continent. In all the subregions, exception of the east and
central Africa, economic growth was faster than in 1995. In 11
countries it reached or surpassed the 6 percent target set by the
United Nations new agenda for the development of Africa in the
1990s, in 28 countries it ranged from 3 percent to 6 percent, in
12 it was still positive but below 3 percent, and in only 2,
their output declined abruptly.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the economic performance in the 33 African Least
Developed Countries (LDCS) was also encouraging last year. These
LDCS registered an average of growth rate of 4.6 percent last
year, 0.7 percent more than the average growth rate of whole
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the real per capita income in Africa is now
increasing. The fall in Africa's real per capita income that
began in the 1980s continued in the early 1990s, but it witnessed
a marked improvement over the past two years, when eonomies rose
faster than the population growth for the first time in many
years.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the 5.2 percent increase of agricultural
output in 1996, in contrast to almost no growth in the previous
year, is the highest since the beginning of the decade and has
been the major factor behind the strong eocnomic recovery in
Africa. At the same time, upturns in the prices of banana and
phosphates gained more than what compensated for the fall in the
prices of beverages, metals and non-oil minerals land raw
materials. As a result the region registered an increase of 8.7
percent from export last year than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery in Africa was due to peace and stability
prevailed in the continent in the past few years, and the eocomic
refroms and positive readjustment of economic policies in most of
African countries which encourage better economic performance in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the UNCTAD held that there are some favorable
factors for the continuing African economic recovery, as non-oil
commodity prices are expected to increase modestly on account of
favorable movement in food and agricultural raw materials prices
in the world market. Although economies in most African countries
are still fragile, but they predicted that economic recovery will
continue, probably stronger than that in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Nigerian State Worried by Lunatics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Residents of many towns in Osun
state, southwest Nigeria, can no longer walk freely at night
following the invasion of major streets by lunatics.
</P>
<P>
According to "New Nigeria" today, some of the lunatics,
especially the males, often terrorize residents in where they
stay, including the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper which noted the fears created by the
"ugly development" did not say where and why the lunatics came
from.
</P>
<P>
It said the lunatics had taken over most of the uncompleted
buildings in the state while some moved into commercial shops
thus scaring customers away.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a government official as saying the State
Ministry of Youths and Social Development was making every best
possible effort to arrest the situation.
</P>
<P>
However, the press officer said the ministry was handicapped
for the fact that it was not in the best position to identify who
"is a lunatic or not" as such could only be done by the health
authorities.
</P>
<P>
But the government would soon put in place necessary
modalities at ridding the state of lunatics, said sources at the
State Ministry of Health.

<HEADLINE> More Political Reforms Expected in Nigeria Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha is expected to announce a general amnesty of
political detainees in a nationwide broadcast next month to mark
the 4th anniversary of the current military administration.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution of the country may also be promulgated
into law on November 17, the "Sunday Vanguard" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abacha is also expected to put to rest all speculations about
whether or not he should run in the 1998 presidential elections,
the report said, quoting a highly-placed source in the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
All these are matters that have been in the expectation of the
nation which, however, was disappointed by Abacha as he mentioned
none of them in his speech four days ago to celebrate Nigeria's
37th independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
With regard to expressed disappointment by a cross section of
the citizenry on expectations from Abacha's October 1 broadcast,
the source said "the speech was basically a reflection of the
state of the nation, mostly the achievements of the
administration."
</P>
<P>
"But be rest assured that because certain expected
pronouncements were not made does not mean the head of state is
unmindful of the citizens' expectations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting that some people still could not understand Abacha's
style of leadership after four years, the source said: "I can
assure you that before November 17, the head of state could order
the release of some 'lesser' political detainees."
</P>
<P>
The "bigger" detainees shall breath the air of freedom on
November 17 through the magnanimity of the head of state, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In his 50-minute independence broadcast, Abacha spent most of
the time on talking about the achievements scored in the past
four years. He touched some of the problems facing the nation but
did not give any policies and measures to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
Prominent Nigerians and organizations have since expressed
unreserved disappointment over the broadcast which was generally
regarded as lacking substance.
</P>
<P>
The unconfirmed report may to some extent raise hope for the
nation that has been longing for a big stride toward political
reform and economic development.

BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
met today in the Great Hall of the People with a group of over 800
students from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The student delegation is visiting Beijing to learn more about

significance of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Wang met with the delegation together with Ngapoi Ngawang
Jigme, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese

</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability will rely on participation by its people, said Wang..

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Becomes Part of China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment has emerged
as a major part of China's economic development along with the
increasing influx of foreign capital, according to Wu Yi, minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wu told participants in today's meeting of the China
Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment (CAEFI) that
China has continually perfected policies and expanded the scope in
the use of foreign investment in recent years. She said related
efforts have been carried out in accordance with the principle of
active, rational and effective use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, China had used foreign investments of
204.425 billion US dollars, and approved 296,900 foreign-funded
enterprises. Over 145,000 foreign-funded companies are currently
in operation.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign investment flowing into China over the
past five years has accounted for 86.6 percent of the total for
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
China not only pays great attention to investments by
transnational companies, but also welcomes investments and
technology from small- to medium-sized ones, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
China has opened numerous industries and regions, with some
regions using diverse channels to introduce foreign investment,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China will continue to exert great effort to
enhance the quality and level of foreign trade by further
perfecting the structure of opening, and using foreign funds more
positively, reasonably and effectively.
</P>
<P>
China is changing from a potential into a realistic market
which will provide valuable investment opportunities for
businesses throughout the world, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
The CAEFI, established in 1987, is a nationwide organization
which serves both Chinese and foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Over 460 Mozambicans Repatriated From Swaziland </HEADLINE>

<P>
MAPUTO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 460 Mozambicans have
been repatriated from Swaziland since September 22, said Roque
Muquessuane, head of Mozambique's Namaacha County, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This means that more than 40 Mozambicans are forced to be
repatriated every day, according to local paper "Domingo" today.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate of the border county said that there are more
Mozambicans in Swaziland's prisons waiting to be repatriated,
adding that the move of the neighboring country has caused some
problems threatening social safety in his county town.
</P>
<P>
He said that along the Mozambique-Swaziland border, there
often occurs incidents of illegally crossing the border,
smuggling and cattle rustling, but in the past the two countries
had managed to solve the problems properly for the sake of good
neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican official said that they did not know why the
Swazi authorities repatriated Mozambicans, adding the move by the
Swazi side was out of expectation.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls on Arab Nation to Rally for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called upon the Arab nation to rally behind the goal of
peace as they did in achieving military victory.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab nation is capable of achieving victory in the battles
of war as in the battles for peace so long as its ranks are
rallied, its will is resolved and its intentions are pure and
honest to serve the Arab interests only," the Egyptian leader said
in a televised speech before noon.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation marking the 24th anniversary of
the 1973 October War victory against Israel, Mubarak said October
War has significantly changed conditions in the Mideast and ended
the no-war-no-peace state.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important lessons to be drawn from the October
war was its proof of the Arabs' capability to achieve victory in
all their battles so long as their ranks are unified and their
will is strong," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of late President Anwar Sadat, Egyptian
troops crossed the Suez Canal in October 1973 to recover territory
including the Sinai Peninsula lost in the "Six-Day War" of June
1967 when Israel quickly defeated neighboring Arab states
including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
After 18 days of fighting, a cease-fire was arranged. In 1974
and 1975 the U.S. negotiated disengagement agreements whereby
Israel evacuated territory in Sinai and Israeli and Egyptian
forces were separated by a buffer zone under the control of U.N.
forces.
</P>
<P>
"October victory adjusted the history of the Middle East," said
the president, adding that the military feat proved to the world
that the Egyptians and Arabs would never be "dead meat."
</P>
<P>
The war also showed that military supremacy is not monopolized
by any party in particular and that true security can never be
guaranteed by geographical expansion at the expanse of others, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
"The only guarantee to true security is objective dialog,
mutual trust and peaceful co-existence where the rights of all
parties are protected and respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the president accentuated the necessity of full
vigilance to face all perils threatening the security and
stability of the region as well as the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He warned of the absence of mutual trust between the parties
concerned and blamed it on unsound policies that lack common
sense, a sound future prospect and a true commitment to agreements.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called upon all parties to combine efforts to realize a
breakthrough and resume peace talks on all tracks in the Middle
East as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We pin great hopes on the sincere and constructive efforts
exerted by the friendly major countries that are interested in the
situation in the region and willing to help get the peace process
of the hook," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been blocked for six
months over the Jewish state's building of settlements in the
occupied Arab lands. But the two sides agreed last week in New
York to restart this month formal talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of renewed
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the Mideast peace crisis remains in place.
</P>
<P>
In statements to reporters after meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak, Moussa also played downed the pending negotiations under
the brokerage of Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The deadlock in the Middle East peace process is still there
as the Palestinian-Israeli meetings to be held are only small
steps that might not yielded any substantial results," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to break the deadlock in the process, it is necessary
to seriously dwell on the basic issues such as the Israeli
settlements and redeployment of Israeli troops in Palestinian
towns and others closely connected to the Palestinian problem, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who returned home Saturday from New York, presented a
report to Mubarak today on his visit to the United States and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
During his ten-day U.S. visit, the top Egyptian diplomat had
discussions with several of his foreign counterparts, including
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who made a recent tour
to the area, her first since assuming office early this year.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Egyptian stance expressed in his address before
the 52nd UN General Assembly meetings and U.S. officials is that
serious action should be taken by various parties, the Israeli and
Arab parties as well as the peace co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations had been blocked for six
months over the Jewish state's building of settlements in the
occupied Arab land. But the two sides agreed last week to restart
formal talks on October 6 and 13.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his report submitted to the president included a
number of other issues discussed during his visit such as the
Libyan crisis and the recent Arab League resolution in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is trying to help lift the sanctions imposed on
Tripoli for alleged involvement in the downing of an airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. A total of 270 were killed in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
As regards enlargement of U.N. Security Council membership, he
said that the third world and non-aligned states agreed that there
should not be any rush just because one country or two wanted to
get a seat in the council.

<HEADLINE> Beattie Quits Year-ending GP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Daryl Beattie's sad
year ended in dismay Sunday as illness prevented him from racing
in the season-ending Australian 500cc motorcycle Grand Prix in
Phillip Island.
</P>
<P>
Beattie was to have ridden his last race for the Lucky Strike
Suzuki factory team after being told earlier this month he was not
required in 1998 but he withdrew from the season finale because of
influenza.
</P>
<P>
Beattie has had a frustrating year on a bike he hasn't been
happy with, but team manager Garry Taylor said he had been keen to
race Sunday in what may have been his last ever 500cc GP.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said his team simply could not provide the Australian,
who was second in the world championship in 1995, with the machine
he needed.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, on another bike he might go better," Taylor

For the time being, three major river systems -- Huaihe, Liaohe
and Haihe, three lakes -- Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi, and the areas
suffering two environmental pollutants -- acid rain and sulphur
dioxide, which are widely regarded as national blackspots, have
been designated as major targets on which war against pollution is
to be waged.
</P>
<P>
Results of last year's efforts have begun to show
through. Water from Huaihe River and Taihu lake, to the west of
Shanghai, are potable again, while irrigation of the basin's
farmland with the river's water is now safe.
</P>
<P>
And a further 30.5 billion yuan (US$ 3.75) remains to be spent
on the pollution control project.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, a total of 5,717 pollution-control projects were
completed, with a total investment of 4.24 billion yuan (US$0.52
billion).
</P>
<P>
To preserve the ecological system, China joined "World Union of
Conserving Nature" last year and committed itself to the support
of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
So far, nature reserves comprise 7 percent of China's total
land area.
</P>
<P>
China is also a signatory to the Vienna Convention for
protection of the Ozone Layer (1989) and the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1991).
</P>
<P>
And China is the first country to submit to the United Nations
its Agenda 21 following the Rio Environment Summit in 1992.
</P>
<P>
By year 2000, according to the Ninth Five-Year Plan for
Environmental Protection (1996-2000), China has two objectives: to
limit pollution in 2000 to the level of 1995, and to implement the
China Trans-Century Green Project Plan which focuses on water and
air pollution control.
</P>
<P>
"That means while maintaining the momentum in economic
development from now to 2000, we should keep the growth rate of
pollution index at zero, so some polluted blackspots should be
cleaned up during the period," says Xie Zhenhua, director of NEPA.
</P>
<P>
"Quite simply, the essence of environmentally-conscious
development depends on the efficient use of natural resources,"
says Shi Yulin of Chinese Academy of Engineering Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"On one side we should control population and probe the
potential of human resources, and on the other we should establish
an economic system thriving on reducing consumption of natural
resources and tapping more alternatives."

<HEADLINE> Syria Keeps Door Open to Peace Process: Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Defense Minister General
Mustafa Tlass has announced that Syria still adheres to the peace
process and keeps the door open despite the intransigent policy of
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Tlass' statement came in a TV interview with the Syrian
Satellite Channel today on the 24th anniversary of the
Arab-Israeli 1973 war.
</P>
<P>
General Tlass, who is also Deputy Commander in Chief of the
Syrian Armed Forces, denounced the policy adopted by the
Netanyahu government for its rejection to peace and the
U.N. resolution and for its failure to commit itself to the
pledges made by former Israeli governments.
</P>
<P>
"Syria accepted the U.S. initiative which called for convening
a peace conference in Madrid on the basis of the relevant
U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, and still
adheres to the peace process," Tlass said.
</P>
<P>
"We are peace-seekers. The international community is
absolutely aware of our consistent attitude, and the whole world
is aware that it is Israel which is attempting to blast the peace
process and is subsequently responsible for the failure and has
to take the consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations should
resume from where they halted in May, 1996, but Netanyahu
government insists that these negotiations should start anew
without any preconditions.

NANNING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Guigang project on the
middle reaches of the Yujiang River in southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region is scheduled to stop the river in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the Guangxi Hydro-electric Power
Engineering Administration, which is responsible for the
construction work, has been preparing for the action. A group in
charge of preparatory work for blocking has been formed to study
technical problems that may crop up and to get all machinery and
equipment ready.
</P>
<P>
So far, 540 reinforced steel cages and 178,000 cu.m. of stone
have been prepared.
</P>
<P>
Guigang is on the middle reaches of the Yujiang River, a
tributary of the Pearl River that flows through south China. It is
the largest inland port in south China and an outlet for southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The navigation hub project being built there was listed as one
of the key state projects for the Eighth Five-Year-Plan Period

But more and more ordinary Chinese have realized the importance
of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by Canada's International
Environment Monitoring Co. Ltd. (IEML) on 24,822 people in 25
countries including China, USA, Russia and Japan early this year,
47 percent of the Chinese think that environmental protection
should be prioritized above economic development, while 32 percent
regard the two as equally important.
</P>
<P>
While the survey shows China is in terms of its citizens'
preference for environmental protection, it nevertheless leads
other developing countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The survey's findings reflect a new world environmental order
in which once sacrosanct quotas are no longer holy.
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer appropriate to judge an enterprise solely by
profit it achieves," says Mu Guangfeng, deputy director of the
Department of Law and Regulation of the National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA).
</P>
<P>
Mu, a prominent environmentalist who has been involved in
drafting most of the country's environmental laws, even goes as
far as to call for a redefinition of GDP into "green GNP."
</P>
<P>
In its calculation, the cost of cleaning up would be taking
from profits with the resultant index being a true indicator of
environmental defense proceeding alongside development.
</P>
<P>
With backing from the very top, that may well be possible.
</P>
<P>
"On no account should we pollute and waste first, and then heal
the environment," says Chinese President Jiang Zemin, pointing out
that during the course of economic construction, the country
should keep environmental protection as a basic national policy
and hold on to sustainable development as a guiding principle.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Exports 1.6 Million Barrels of Oil Per Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has managed to export 1.6
million barrels of oil per day, running against time under the
oil-for-food deal, an Iraqi oil official announced.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspaper "Al-Jomhouriya" today quoted Saddam Zein
El-Hassan, Executive Director of Iraq's Oil-Marketing Authority,
as saying that Iraq has managed in the past 22 days to export oil
valuing more than 50 percent as much as the value set for its oil
exports in the first 90 days of the second phase of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
El-Hassan added that the first three months period of the
second phase of the oil-for-food deal would expire today, and in
accordance with the amendment introduced to the U.N. Resolution
1111, the second period would start tomorrow and would last up to
December.
</P>
<P>
"It is a record time if it is taken into consideration that
several steps have to be taken after a contract for selling oil
is signed," the Iraqi oil official remarked.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agreed last June to extend its oil-for-food deal with
Iraq, but the later started exporting its oil only in mid-August
in protest against delaying the arrival of food and medical
supplies in Iraq.

<P>
The concept of sustainable development, defined as the
achievement of economic development without victimizing the
benefits of future generations, is the bottom line in the
so-called conflict between D &AMP; E -- development and environment.
</P>
<P>
Mu believes that the conflict is in fact a myth.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional notion of the environment and development
being contradictory is actually incorrect," he says.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the two may well be antagonistic initially, but later on
both should be in parallel en route towards a single goal --
sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations make sure development is kept under close
watch. Provisions include the general law of environmental
protection, and specific laws concerning the control of air or
water pollution, and laws and regulations focusing on specific
problem areas.
</P>
<P>
For example, the State Council's 1996 mandate to clean up the
Huaihe River was the first high-handed action targeted at a
regional environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out the mandate, all small factories convicted of
"polluting the environment, harming people's health, severely
wasting resources, and not up to specified scale" were shut down.
</P>
<P>
Closures have been widespread despite their unsocial
consequences of making township workers redundant.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 1997, 62,561 paper mills, tanneries and
their likes, major culprits of water pollution, had been closed
and destroyed -- to prevent use of plant elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
More significant, starting from October 1, 1997, harming the
environment will become a crime under provisions in the amended
Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.

</P>
<P>
This was disclosed recently by an official of the school in an

</P>
<P>
The "Future Teachers" is a normal school for training teachers
for the rural areas of Angola. After graduation from the school,
the graduates must teach in primary or middle schools in the
countryside to reduce illiteracy and promote development there.
</P>
<P>
The "People Aid People" is expected to set up 16 teachers
training schools in Angola to boost the development of education
in Angola. So far, three such schools including the "Future

But now people have come to see the negative impact.
</P>
<P>
Most of the factories are low-invested with the most basic
fixed assets, run by managers with little or no environmental
concern who are reluctant to re-invest profits to purchase
facilities to clean up their waste.
</P>
<P>
Fines have become more operating costs.
</P>
<P>
A small paper mill in the form of a township enterprise may
yield an output of a few hundred thousand of yuan a year, keep a
score of farmers in work and make its owner relatively wealthy.
</P>
<P>
But it might contaminate a whole water system, leaving the
source hostile to irrigation and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Natural resources are not only being exploited, but in a
damaging fashion.
</P>
<P>
In Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, coke-making fills the once
impoverished locals' pockets with cash.
</P>
<P>
Yet operations in the southwestern province are akin to those
described by Charles Dickens in Victorian England, characterized
by inefficiency, smog and industrial disease. Life expectancy of
miners has dropped to around 40 amid prevalent silicosis.
</P>
<P>
China's national average is 70.8 years.
</P>
<P>
"But coke-making pulls nearly 400,000 farmers, 40 percent of
the region's total poverty population, from the hell of extreme
poverty," says a local official.
</P>
<P>
Here again, primary needs of food, water and shelter seem to be
a louder cry than defense of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"If we push the policy of environmental protection to such an
extent that basic living for the common people cannot be
guaranteed, the policy just won't fly," says an environmental
scientist.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said
today that the total number of people allegedly missing after
being arrested by the troops or police in Jaffna Peninsula was
reduced from 2,568 to 730, due to the finding that some of the
names were duplicated.
</P>
<P>
In a news release this afternoon, the government said that the
Board of Investigations, established in November 1996, found that
the actual number of people alleged to have disappeared was 730.
</P>
<P>
The drastic drop from 2,568 was due to the fact that some of
the names had been reported many times. In one case, there were 98
reports of missing regarding the same person that was alleged to
have been arrested by the army.
</P>
<P>
Since June 1996, various international committees and
non-governmental organizations have reported to the Sri Lankan
government that many people disappeared after they were arrested
by the military or police, or after they were last seen at
barricades, road blocks, security camps or police stations.
Investigations are still underway to trace the whereabouts of
those alleged to be still missing, the news release added.

NEW DELHI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Last week's rally on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) was short-lived and speculatives
reacted sharply, bringing down the Sensitive Index (Sensex) by
over 77 points on renewed selling pressure and in the absence of
institutional buying during the week to October 3.
</P>
<P>
The week, which had only four sessions due to a national
holiday on October 2, saw restricted movements showing small
changes in the Sensex, except for the last day (Friday) that
witnessed heavy bull liquidation, partly induced by the suspension
of trading on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).
</P>
<P>
However, the hesitant approach taken by foreign funds and
domestic institutions kept the bulls under pressure.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tension in the Line of Control in Kashmir
following exchange of heavy shellings between Indian and Pakistan
troops during the week also affected the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The BSE Sensex moved in a narrow range of 3,964.03 and
3,833.92, before closing the week at 3,847.73 as against the last
weekend close of 3,925.24, showing a fall of 77.51 points.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index dropped to end the week at 1,669.46 from
1,703.63 in the previous weekend, netting a loss of 34.17 points.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Reserve Bank
of India Chakravarty Rangarajan has expressed optimism about the
performance of the Indian economy, saying that it will improve in
the second half of the current fiscal year (from April 1997 to

Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been substantial increase in bank
deposits and interest rates have shown a steady decline.
</P>
<P>
"These, coupled with tax incentives given in the government's
1997-98 budget and a better prospect for export growth, should
help accelerate the industrial growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the remarks on the background that the Indian
economy, especially industry and exports, has registered sustained
slowdown in growth over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China Strives for Sustainable Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- For almost two decades, China's
GDP, a conventional yardstick of a country's economic performance,
has witnessed an average annual growth rate of 10 percent or
higher.
</P>
<P>
While many are pleased with the progress the figure indicates,
decision-makers with foresight are no longer ease at mere GDP
growth. They are more and more conscious of the seemingly two
antagonistic conceptions: development or environment.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's development in this, the last decade of the
century, has outpaced many other nations' growth rate.
</P>
<P>
But no sooner have the Chinese got a nose for consumerism --
their first refrigerators, reliable power supplies and the lucky
few, family cars -- does the country find itself harboring a
severely damaged environment.
</P>
<P>
From Shenyang's choking air to the Huaihe River's stinking
water, from spreading deserts of Xinjiang to dwindling acreages of
farmland around Shanghai, the problems of urbanization,
industrialization, and intensive agricultural techniques have
rapidly combined to warn government planners as well as individual
citizens that sustainable development, which emphasizes
environmental protection in the efforts to achieve economic
growth, is the only road ahead.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the rural environment, village and township
enterprises, whose industrial output value amounts to as much as
42 percent of the country's total, are constituting major
headaches.
</P>
<P>
In the mi-1980s, these small-medium sized, low-tech operations
were hailed as creators of jobs to absorb surplus agricultural
labor force.
</P>
<P>
They also gave potential entrepreneurs a stage to flex their
long-dormant business acumen, and spared cities from even greater
influxes of migrant workers.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Shipbuilding Orders to Total $10 Billion in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean shipbuilders' order
receipts are expected to reach 10 billion U.S. dollars this year,
according to industry sources today.
</P>
<P>
Orders received by the nation's top five shipbuilders,
Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung, Halla and Hanjin, amounted to 5.31
billion dollars in first eight months this year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Given the 4.5 billion dollars in contracts about to be
concluded and the 500 million dollars in additional contracts
anticipated by the end of this year, the orders are set to surpass
the 10 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, Hyundai secured 1.2 billion dollars of intent
letters from world major shipping firms, followed by Samsung with
1.1 billion dollars. Daewoo garnered 800 million dollars, while
Halla and Hanjin held each about 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Amid the severe slump in shipping prices worldwide, South
Korean shipbuilders' remarkable business records were attributed
to a sharp depreciation of the nation's won currency and the
growing number of orders placed by foreign shipping companies with
South Korean shipbuilders, as Japanese shipbuilders have already
secured orders to last until 1999, the sources noted.

<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair is set to support the most
fundamental reform of the voting system for House of Commons
elections since women were enfranchised in 1918. The system, if
applied in a referendum, could keep the Conservatives in the
wildness for decades.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of key parts for Britain's Trident nuclear weapons
system have vanished. The disappearance prompted an immediate
investigation into the possibility that components for Europe's
most deadly weapon had fallen into the hands of criminals or
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Independent on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Tory nerves on the eve of its new leader William Hague's
first party conference have been shattered between pro-and
anti-Europe factions of the party.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Britain are heading for a diplomatic
row over the use of British front companies to circumvent economic
sanctions against Libya. It is feared that some of the equipment
supplied to Libya might be used in the manufacture of chemical
weapons.

GUANGZHOU, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of
south China's Guangdong province, has increased efforts to protect
its cultural relics, adding the item to its plan for urban
construction and annual budget.
</P>
<P>
This year, it plans to use eight million yuan (960,000 US

<HEADLINE> Hamas Prepares to Live With Jews: Yassin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) founder, said Saturday night that he
was ready to coexist with Israelis as long as Palestinian rights
are respected.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who was freed from life imprisonment here and flown
to Jordan three days ago, expressed his hope of coexistence
in an interview broadcast on Israel Television Channel 1's
Arabic-language service.
</P>
<P>
"We have a people, four million Palestinians in the diaspora,
who want to return to the homes from which they were expelled,
therefore we are prepared to live with the Jews, the best life,
in brotherhood and cooperation and coexistence, on condition they
do not gobble up our rights," Yassin stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We do not attack anybody. We do not oppress anyone,"
said the wheel-chaired Yassin, who is expected to return to
the Gaza Strip in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
Although he is nearly blind and speaks in a weak whisper,
Yassin, at 61, still commands a respected position in
Hamas. Yassin suffers from muscle atrophy, is nearly deaf, has
chronic respiratory problems and has been confined to a
wheel-chair since an accident in his youth.
</P>
<P>
Yassin told reporters at his hospital bedside in Jordan over
the weekend that he was "not deported "and that he intended to
return to Gaza. He said that he had asked Israel to give him "an
understanding of my right to return because I have a homeland and
I am not willing to abandon it."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Southern Command Yom-Tov Samia signed Yassin's
release from prison early on Wednesday. Yassin was flown directly
to Amman on a Royal Jordanian Air Force medical helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military court sentenced Yassin to life in prison in
May 1989 after he pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges in the
slayings of four Palestinians accused of collaborating with
Israel. He also was given a 15-year sentence for heading an
outlawed organization, incitement and weapons possesion. Yassin
also was suspected of ordering the kidnaping and murder of two
Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Minister on Sino-U.S. Economic Ties (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in the
interest of China as well as those of all other countries, and its
desire to enter WTO, which is a multilateral trading system
established on widely accepted international rules, fully
demonstrates its determination to open the country wider to the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, exclusion of China from the organization for a
long time will not be conducive to the consolidation and strength
of the global multilateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into WTO on the basis of balanced rights and
obligations will help creat a more stable environment for
Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations and will benefit both. The
United States, as an important signatory of WTO, should reason
things out, be conscious of the right course of action, keep its
promises, and play a positive role in China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. trade situation mirrors the different economic
structures, development stages, product structures, methods of
trading, calculation methods, and international division of labor.
</P>
<P>
From the market point of view, China's trade system is open
wider than at any other period of history and one side should not
blame the other for being the sole cause of the existing
Sino-U.S. trade imbalance. Factors like particular materials
imported for processing before export, the shift of some
industrial sectors to China by other fast developing Asian
countries, the unique status of Sino-U.S. trade via Hong Kong, the
differences of calcuation of statistics, and the U.S.'s direct
investment in China--all have a direct effect on the
trade imbalance.
</P>
<P>
China's current favorable trade balance is of historical
inevitablility just as was the balance in favor of the U.S. at an
earlier period. Both sides should view the matter objectively and
reasonably and avoid endless quibbling over figures while ignoring
the fact that bilateral trade has benefited both sides.

KUWAIT CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- "The Peninsula Desert Shield"
forces, joint armed forces of the Six Gulf Cooperation Council
states (GCC), is ready to rush to the help of any member country
threatened, a senior GCC military official has said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency today quoted Staff Major General Faleh
Abdallah Al-Shatti, GCC Assistant Secretary General for Military
Affairs, as making the remarks before attending a meeting of GCC
chiefs of staff due today in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
A GCC plan to raise the Peninsula Shield troops, based in Saudi
Arabia, from 8,000 to 25,000 and to establish a joint early
warning system has been under implementation since last year.
</P>
<P>
The member countries' final aim is to strengthen the
capability of the joint forces that requires purchase of new
compatible radars, missiles and automated communications, command
and control air defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shatti said the member states have agreed to increase the
number of troops and acquiring highly-advanced weapons, adding
that a new camp for this force would be built in Hafr El-Batin,
northwest of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He also said the meeting will tackle a wide-range of military
related issues, topped by the establishment of a radar link-up
among member states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Minister on Sino-US Economic Ties (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dealing with bilateral economic and trade problems on basis
of mutual respect, equality, and mutual understanding is a basic
principle of state-to-state economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the development of Sino-US relations, one can see
that they can grow smoothly when both sides handle problems in an
objective, reasonable and positive way, and if not, difficulties
can occur.
</P>
<P>
Experience tells us that no problem can be solved and there may
be adverse effects when economic and trade problems are used as
bargaining tools for domestic politics or if one side adopts an
unreasonable attitude and threatens the other with retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Sino-US economic and trade ties can only mature and develop in
a healthy way when the two sides eliminate non-trade factors and
resolve problems and expand cooperation, and that is in the
interest of the two peoples. Both governments need to adopt
necessary measures to encourage positive factors and overcome
negative ones and become firm backings to the development of
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made great efforts in developing
Sino-US trade and economic cooperation and has sent delegations
to the U.S. many times to try to improve the trade balance and we
hope that the U.S. will take action as soon as possible to restore
or enforce trade promotion programs to create a more favorable
environment for bilateral trade economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that there are many favorable conditions for
Sino-US trade and economic cooperation development. The
complimentary nature of the two economies, for one thing, is a
good basis for cooperation and people in industry and business
communities of both countries are enthusiastic about cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both governments fully recognize the importance of Sino-US
economic and trade ties and the existing cooperation offers many
examples of success for future growth. The strong growth of the
Asia-Pacific economies provide a good chance for cooperation
between China and the United States, both of which are on the
Pacific rim.
</P>
<P>
The recent 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party
provided a blueprint for future development in China, which will
open even wider to the rest of the world, creating new
opportunities for expanded economic cooperation and trade with
all other countries.
</P>
<P>
As long as both China and the United States cherish the hard-won
progress and act positively and in a spirit of trust, eliminate
prejudice, reduce differences, and create the future together,
they will push Sino-US economic and trade relations to a new level.

LUSAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will have
to merge ministries, drastically reduce foreign missions,
review education policy and cut rampant misuse of telephones
as part of measures to control outrageous spending for 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Finance Minister Ronald Penza at the
National Budget Conference for Permanent Secretaries in
Livingstons, southern Zambia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Penza said children of diplomats alone swallowed more than the
entire national recurrent expenditure for all primary schools of
the country, "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot go on helping a few people at the expense of
hundreds of Zambians," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to exercise very severe restrait on government
spending, including wages in the public sector, he said.
Trade unions will have to be made to understand the
government's good intentions to stabilize the economy and bring
down inflation from this year's projected 15 percent to a single
digit, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is aiming to reduce the
poverty currently at 70 percent to less than 50 percent by the

TOKYO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan has sacked national soccer
team manager Shu Kamo after Saturday's disappointing 1-1 World Cup
qualifier draw with Kazakhstan, officials said here today.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Okada will take control of the side when they travel to
Uzbekistan to play a qualifier on Saturday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Minister on Sino-U.S. Economic Ties (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations started to improve since the second half of
last year after going through a period of difficulty, and since
the beginning of this year, there have been frequent exchanges of
visits by senior officials of both countries. These have included
the visit to China of Vice-President Al Gore, of Speaker of the
House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, and of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. There have been visits to the U.S. by
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and Defense Minister Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-U.S. economic joint commission meeting was held in
September and it will be followed by one of the
Sino-U.S. Commercial and Trade Joint Commission, where the two
sides will discuss ways to strengthen bilateral economic and trade
cooperation. President Jiang Zemin's visit to the U.S. this month
will no doubt have a far-reaching impact on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The question of MFN has long stymied the development of
Sino-U.S. economic ties and trade, and the granting of MFN status
to China is at the core of Sino-U.S. trade relations and provides
a fundamental guarantee of bilateral trade development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is still conducting its annual review of MFN
status over China in accordance with the laws of the cold war
period, and this has created a feeling of instability among the
business communities of the two countries and has not been conducive
to bilateral trade development.
</P>
<P>
More Americans with vision have become aware of the fact that
only by settling this issue can Sino-U.S. trade relations have a
solid and stable base. We hope that concerned U.S. government
departments proceed from practice, respect the fundamental
interests and desires of the two peoples, and abolish the annual
debate over this issue.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Developing Domestic Waste Utilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in China's leading
industrial city have developed a device of automatically sorting
domestic waste and recycling certain items.
</P>
<P>
The device was developed by scientists of the Shanghai
Invention Association to sort inorganic waste like sand, stone,
brick, metal, and plastic materials for recycling.
</P>
<P>
The whole process takes place in sealed conditions so that it
does not produce pollution a second time.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the device has a daily waste disposal
capacity of 100 tons, from which combustible gas can be produced
for 500 households for daily use, along with 50 tons of quality
fertilizer, building materials and recycled rubber.
</P>
<P>
They said the device occupies only one hectare of land and can
be put either aboveground or underground. Its annual recycled
resources value could be from 2 million to 4 million yuan (250,000
to 500,000 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Formulate Decisive Policy on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
been called on to produce an explicit and decisive policy on AIDS
which would create a supportive environment for AIDS prevention.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sunday Mail on Saturday, National
Coordinator of the National AIDS Coordination Program Evaristo
Marowa said, "HIV/AIDS continues to have a serious impact on our
nation as 65,939 cases of full blown AIDS were reported up to the
period ending March 31 this year."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the actual cumulative number of AIDS
cases that occurred in this country during the period under
review is four-fold the reported figure and the cumulative number
of HIV cases are estimated to be more than 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation is very serious and it needs to be
resolved with a great sense of commitment, dedication and urgency
by all people including individuals and both the private and
public sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that on average 550 to 600 people die of AIDS and
HIV-related diseases every week and that more than 30,000 deaths
would occur as a result of AIDS this year.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics reveal that there is a significant rise
in AIDS cases in all age groups with the highest rise being
recorded in the 30-39 year-old category.
</P>
<P>
They also show that males are the most affected as they
constituted the highest number of cases in all age groups except
the 15-19 year age group.
</P>
<P>
Marowa said that Zimbabwe is fortunate in that many organizations
including churches, the media, the government and non
governmental organizations have joined hands to fight the
disease.
</P>
<P>
But there is a need to harmonize all the contributions from
these sectors through a sound coordination program, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
China is the largest developing country and the U.S. is the
largest developed country. Their difference in reserves of natural
resources, industrial structures, and levels of consumption
decides that the two countries can supplement each other
economically through trade, therefore two-way trade and economic
cooperation have certain natural advantages and bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
China's cheap and quality products are attractive to Americans
and American goods are well received in China. China's enormous
markets and abundent labor resources are major factors which make
many American companies to give top priority to China when
expanding their businesses overseas. At the same time, many Chinese
companies regard U.S. companies as ideal partners, with their
advanced science and technology, sufficient funding, and
efficient management skills.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the major suppliers of textile products, garments,
shoes, household appliances, toys, and luggage bags and cases for
the U.S. and an important market for America's aircrafts, power
equipment, machinery, electronics, instruments, telecommunications
equipment, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural products like
grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, one out of every 10 of Boeing's aircrafts
has been sold to China. By the end of last year, Boeing had sold
a total of 222 passenger planes to China.
</P>
<P>
China has also become the sixth largest export destination for
America's agricultural products, and more than 200 of the 500 top
companies in the U.S. have trade links and economic cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
The steady development of the Sino-U.S. economic ties and trade
is conducive to the economic prosperity of both countries and
two-way trade has created more than 300,000 highly-paid jobs and,
indirectly, almost a million jobs for the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
Two-way investment and bilateral economic cooperation have
helped the economic vitality and prosperity of the two
countries. Today with peace and development as the major attention
of the world, Sino-U.S. trade and economic cooperation becomes an
important factor for stabilizing bilateral relations and a source
for further advancement.

<HEADLINE> Opposition FORD-People Registered in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) --The Kenneth Matiba faction of
opposition FORD-Asili has been registered as an independent
political party, the Sunday Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new party is named the Forum for the Restoration of
Democracy for the People (FORD-People) registered last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The registration brought an end to a
protracted battle for supremacy and control of Opposition
FORD-Asili between Matiba and the Martin Shikuku group, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The development is reminiscent of the 1992 split in the
original FORD movement, following protracted disagreements
between Matiba and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.
</P>
<P>
The new party has Matiba as chairman, Stephen Musila as
vice-chairman, Kimani wa Nyoike as secretary-general and John
Chebii as treasurer.
</P>
<P>
FORD-P's registration brings to 12 the number of political
parties in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
The registration came on the last day of the deadline
set by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group reforms
package which gives 14 days from the day of adoption by the
registrar to process all pending political party applications.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-General Omondi Mbago is expected to go public on
Monday on the political parties he has agreed to register and
give reasons why others cannot be registered.
</P>
<P>
Ungistered Safina, the Islamic Party of Kenya, and others are
awaiting Mbago's decision.

<HEADLINE> China's Oil Production To Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- China's annual oil output
reaches 157 million tons following 40 years of development, making
it the world's 5th largest oil producer, and it will reach 200
million tons by 2010, according to Zhou Yongkang, president of the
China National Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
China has 350 oilfields and 110 gas fields, and 24 oil and gas
production bases such as Daqing, Shengli, Liaohe, Xinjiang,
Sichuan, Dagang and Bohai and the South China Sea. It also has
four major oil and three major gas producing regions.
</P>
<P>
Oil output of the Songliao region in 1996 accounted for 38
percent of the national total and contributed a great deal to the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The production of Bohai Bay in 1996 was 36.9 percent of the
national oil output. Xinjiang produced 14.3 million tons of crude
oil last year, 9.1 percent of the national total, and offshore
production was 15 million tons, 9.5 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, annual oil output of east China will be 110
million tons in 2010, and the annual oil output of 53 million tons
at Daqing, the largest oilfield, will stay the same until 2010.
</P>
<P>
Exploration will be accelerated in the west, with oil
production projected to rise to 50 million tons or more in
2010. Offshore oil production is estimated at 10 million tons or
more in 2010.
</P>
<P>
By late 1996, 2.5 million sq.km. of onshore areas had been
opened to foreign companies and 30 petroleum contracts were signed
with 35 foreign companies, worth 770 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 offshore contracts have been signed, with about 3
billion US dollars in foreign capital, accounting for 58 percent
of total investment in offshore oil exploration and development.

SHANGHAI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area handled
more than 5.7 billion US dollars in foreign trade in the first
eight months of this year, a nearly 20 percent rise over the same
period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
These include three billion US dollars in imports and nearly
2.8 billion US dollars in exports, a rise of 17.8 percent and 22.2
percent over the same period in 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 45 percent of the foreign trade, or 2.6 billion US
dollars, came from overseas-funded enterprises, and the
remaining 55 percent, from state businesses.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas-funded enterprises in the area
are the result of a push for increased foreign trade. The speedy
development of the processing trade has also helped boost foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
During the eight-month period foreign trade involving the
processing of imported raw materials by overseas-funded companies
was nearly 1.1 billion US dollars, a 64 percent increase over the

<HEADLINE> Iran Says U.S. D'Amato Law Now Into Abyss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has claimed that the
2-billion-dollar gas deal with French company Total has sent the
U.S. extra territorial law and unilateral sanctions into abyss,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying on his
return from the 52nd session of the United Nations General
Assembly on Saturday night that the inking of the deal by Total
was telling a big "no" to the U.S. D'Amato Law for its unilateral
unacceptable norms of practice in the world trade arena.
</P>
<P>
Iran entered into the 2 billion dollar contract with Total of
France, Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia to develop a
giant Iranian gas field at the end of September, risking the
possibility of U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Under the D'Amato Law signed by president Bill Clinton in 1996,
the U.S. would impose sanctions on foreign companies investing more
than 40 million dollars in Iran or Libya. The investment cap in
Iran reduced earlier this year to 20 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stated that "The agreement was a great triumph for
both Europe and Iran", he added.
</P>
<P>
"The accord heralded the era of greater contracts to be
signed in the near future," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Trade Minister on Sino-U.S. Economic Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua)--The upcoming visit of China's
President Jiang Zemin to the United States will strengthen
Sino-U.S. ties and understanding, promote the steady development
of bilateral relations, and no doubt bring new trade
opportunities to both countries, according to Wu Yi, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
In a by-lined article released today, Wu Yi urges to
cherish bilateral cooperation and make efforts to promote
Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations. Wu looks back on the China-U.S
trade relations and says "it is of great importance to review our
trade relations in the past and seize the opportunity to promote
the steady growth of the bilateral trade links."
</P>
<P>
Exerpts of the article are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic ties and trade have developed rapidly since
the two countries resumed high level contacts and opened the door
for further development of relations in 1972. According to
statistics from China General Administration of Customs,
Sino-U.S.trade in 1996 amounted to 42.84 billion U.S. dollars, 18
times the figure of 1979, the year when the two established
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
In the 18 years from 1979 to 1996, two-way trade totaled 260.6
billion U.S. dollars. Between 1979 to 1995, the United States was
ranked China's third largest trade partner and in 1996 it moved up
to the second place.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. statistics, bilateral trade was 63.5 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996 and totalled 376 billion U.S. dollars over
the past 18 years. China became the U.S.'s fourth largest trading
partner in 1996, up from the 24th place in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Despite differences in the two countries' calculation, the
statistics from both sides show the bilateral trade has recorded
an annual growth rate of 18 percent. In addition to the growth in
trade, two-way investment has also developed rapidly in the same
period. By the end of June, the U.S. had 23,250 approved
investment projects in China with contractual capital reaching
36.87 billion U.S. dollars, 15.67 billion U.S. dollars of which
was already in use.
</P>
<P>
China has made progress in direct investment in the United
States along with the country's reform and opening-up program and
plans to continue increasing investment and expanding cooperation
area in the United States in the future.

<HEADLINE> South China City Getting Tough With Drug Abuse In Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Shenzhen, in
Guangdong province, is keeping its eyes peeled for drug abuse in
schools as part of its war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Education offices, working with the Communist Youth League of
China (CYLC), set up an anti-drug agency to keep campuses
drug-free and an anti-drug campaign with documentary films, photo
displays, speeches, and symposiums have been supported by the
local CYLC committee.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is Hong Kong's nextdoor neighbor and has seen a rise
in drug trafficking and drug abuse and related crimes. But, by
focusing on drug-dealers, police officers have dealt with 578
cases of drug trafficking in less than six months, confiscating
202 kilograms of heroin, 4,685 grams of opium and 860 grams of
"ice".
</P>
<P>
Police in the city's Longgang District have tried to enforce
anti-drug laws among young people in the area, and the city's
Office against Drugs is considering stricter controls on drug
abuse among workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian outback's
world-famous dry boat race, the Henley on Todd Regatta, began
Sunday in Alice Springs after heavy rain forced a one-day
postponement for only the second time in its 36-year history.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some low clouds but my weather map tells me we
hopefully won't have any more rain," race organiser Bill van Dijk
said.
</P>
<P>
The bizarre race, which sees teams sprinting along the dry bed
of the Todd River near the central town of Alice Springs inside
bottomless boats, has gained international fame since it started
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
In May this year the Rotary Club of Staines in Britain copied
the idea and ran a dry boat race on the banks of the Thames.
</P>
<P>
Before the climax of the "Battle of the Boats Spectacular"
there will be a bathtub derby, a backpackers' challenge, boogie
board races, shovelling sand races and drinks' waiter races.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Snag Hits Indian Telecom Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Communication is completely
cut off from about 83 stations to the rest of India with the
failure of INSAT-2D, India's most advanced communication
satellite, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, basic telephone services of India's Department of
Telecommunications to remote and inaccessible areas of Northeast
India, Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir, hilly areas of Uttar Pradesh
and tribal areas of Madhya Pradesh have also been severely
affected.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, operations in some other services such as India's
National Stock Exchange are also out of gear.
</P>
<P>
INSAT-2D, launched on June 4 by the French Ariane-4 rocket, was
switched off indefinitely on Thursday following a major on-board
power failure.
</P>
<P>
Because of the snag, the satellite lost its earth lock, a
mechanism that directs the satellite towards the earth. This led
to the halt of normal functioning of on-board transponders.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Department of Space is attempting to allocate some
transponders on alternate satellite to meet the essential and
commercial telecommunication requirements.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production
was estimated to have registered a 12.8 percent year-to-year
growth in the first nine months of this year, a slightly lower
growth than the same period last year, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output registered a 13.5 percent growth in the
January-September period last year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial output in this period was estimated at
over 96,000 billion Vietnam dong (more than 8 billion
U.S. dollars), of which state-run enterprises turned out 48
percent or 46,178 billion dong (3.8 billion dollars) worth of
goods.
</P>
<P>
State-run enterprises' output grew by 10 percent over the same
period last year, while the production of the non-state sector
rose by 10.2 percent and the foreign-invested sector rose by 20.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower growth for the period was attributed to sluggish
sales in August and September, especially the sales of electronic
products, condensed milk, knitwear and cigarettes.

JAKARTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Asian football Confederation
gerneral secretary Peter Velappan has warned that smog and bribes
could wreck the Southeast Asian Games football tournament which
starts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The organizing committee should monitor the air pollution
index and warn the participating teams immediately if the haze
reaches an unhealthy level," the Jakarta Post quoted the Asian
football chief as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also warned football players that they could be approached
to throw matches at the Games, which start in Jakarta on October
11.
</P>
<P>
Widespread forest fires have been raging out of control across
the Indonesia over the past four months and have thrown up a
poisonous smog over large areas of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Velappan, expounding on the bribes threat, said "the AFC and
the Indonesian Soccer Association are not the FBI (the US Federal
Bureau of Investigation) nor the police."
</P>
<P>
"Although we've been fighting bribery for the last 10 years it
still exists," he said, adding that any bribery would have to
involve a player.
</P>
<P>
"The player should never take the offer," he was quoted as
saying.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan countries in
Africa have been urged to promote small scale mining to complement
agriculture which still enjoys more support.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by mining experts and geologists who concluded
their three-day international conference on small scale mining in Dar
es Salaam earlier this week, the Sunday News reported today.
</P>
<P>
They said small scale mining has big potential for the economies of
many countries if well developed.
</P>
<P>
They cited Tanzania where a bigger portion of the proceeds from the
mineral sector is generated through mining activities, while small
scale miners are scattered across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Our governments should ensure economic sustainability of small
scale mining by providing extension services and markets for the
minerals," the experts said in their resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They called on financial institutions, including the banks, "to
take more interest in mining business including floating shares in the
stock exchange".
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the environmental aspects of small scale
mining should be fully addressed through enforcement of relevant laws
and policies as well as sensitization of miners on environmentally
friendly mining techniques.

<HEADLINE> eds-Poverty-2 Feature: China Aims to Banish Poverty to History (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state has vowed to increase funding for poverty
alleviation. In 1996, of 10.8 billion yuan allocated for this
purpose, a little over 50 percent came from interest free loans.
More than four billion yuan will be added to the figure annually.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are also obliged to put aside money for use
in poverty elimination in their own regions. If they fail to
contribute between 30-50 percent of the sum provided by the
central government, those sums themselves will be cut accordingly.
</P>
<P>
"However difficult local finances are, contributions to the
poverty fund must be committed at the start of each year," Premier
Li Peng said at the 1996 conference.
</P>
<P>
Funds are currently helping to improve roads -- farmers believe
that access brings prosperity to a village. Another focus is
disaster control. Threats of flood and drought are being lessened
by better water conservation, while training courses make the
latest agricultural techniques known to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government is giving more priority to
the approval of large and medium-sized projects in hinterland
regions, where the majority of its poverty-stricken populace
reside. Of all projects launched last year, 43.7 percent were
located in the country's central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Coastal-hinterland cooperation is encouraged to narrow the gap
between affluence and poverty. In 1996, some 2,500 cooperative
projects were signed, involving the transfer of 30 billion yuan in
capital to township enterprises in central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Last year nine eastern provinces and a number of prosperous
coastal cities were directly called on for more help. Each is
being held responsible for assisting one western province or
autonomous region. Beijing has been "twinned" with Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, while Shanghai assists Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Bangladesh's Garment Industry Thrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ready-made garment
(RMG) industry which began from scratch is a success story, though
many had doubted in the late seventies that a least developed
country would be able to cope with the quality and business
standards of advanced Western markets.
</P>
<P>
The RMG industry earned over three billion U.S. dollars in the
last fiscal year of 1996-97, which constituted about 68 percent of
the country's total export earnings. The volume of RMG export from
Bangladesh is likely to increase at a rate of 20 percent per annum
up to the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The RMG industry is now employing 1.3 million people, most of
them women, and turning to be the country's biggest export earner.
</P>
<P>
As the industry develops fast, the demand for fabrics will
surely grow. About 60 percent of woven fabric now used in the RMG
sector are imported from different countries and regions including
India, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Malaysia
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is currently the 5th largest RMG supplier to the
European Community market and the 6th largest to the U.S. and
Canadian markets. President of Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers
and Exporters Association (BGMEA) Mostofa Golam Quddus said that
his body would make every effort to develop present markets and to
open new markets at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Favorable investment infrastructure, low inflation rate, easily
trainable vast labor force and flourishment of some new generation
entrepreneurs have turned the country's RMG sector into the
highest prospective investment focal point in the South Asia, said
the BGMEA chief said at the opening ceremony of a textile fair
held here from October 2 to October 5.

<HEADLINE> Trade Between Chile, Mercosur Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Chile and member
countries of the South America Common Market (Mercosur) has grown
since a free trade agreement between the two sides became
effective a year ago, according to the Central Bank of Chile.
</P>
<P>
In the nine months from last October to June, Chile's total
export to Mercosur amounted to 1.32 billion U.S. dollars, up 3
percent over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Its total import from Mercosur during this period was valued at
2.19 billion dollars, representing an 8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Farm and animal husbandry exports registered a high growth rate
of 11.2 percent, compared with the 3.3 percent growth in the
country's export to other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
The trade was stimulated by the reduction of tariffs. Under the
free trade agreement signed in June 1996, the average tariff for
Chilean exports to and imports from the Mercosur states should be
reduced to 3.2 percent and 5.7 percent respectively from the
original 8.2 percent and 11 percent as of October 1996.

Kumar Gujral and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif have
agreed to meet again later this month in Edinburgh, U.K., where
they will both be attending the Commonwealth Conference of the
Heads of Governments, the local press said today.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial production
was estimated to have registered a 12.8 percent year-to-year
growth in the first nine months of this year, a slightly lower
growth than the same period last year, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output registered a 12.1 percent growth in the
January-September period last year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial output in this period was estimated at
over 96,000 billion Vietnam dong (more than 8 billion
U.S. dollars), of which state-run enterprises turned out 48
percent or 46,178 billion dong (3.8 billion dollars) worth of
goods.
</P>
<P>
State-run enterprises' output grew by 10 percent over the same
period last year, while the production of the non-state sector
rose by 10.2 percent and the foreign-invested sector rose by 20.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower growth for the period was attributed to sluggish
sales in August and September, especially the sales of electronic
products, condensed milk, knitwear and cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Economic Downturn Drives up Suicide Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai mental health experts
believe that the country's economic downturn is a significant
factor in the increase of suicide cases in recent months.
</P>
<P>
At a time when there is no security of employment and business
opportunities and economic revival is not yet in sight, people,
particularly those who are deeply in debt and are paying
installments for their housing or vehicles, often feel frustrated
and may decide to take their own lives as a way to end all their
worries.
</P>
<P>
Many people found it difficult to adjust to the suddenness with
which security and affluence changed to debt, bankruptcy and
worry.
</P>
<P>
Since the float of the baht in early July, the Thais are worse
off by as much as more than 40 percent in terms of U.S. dollars,
apart from higher cost of living, rising prices, factory closures
and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in late August by the Mental Health
Department of the Public Health Ministry shows that people in the
property and finance sectors, the two most seriously ailing
sectors, are prone to stress and depression, which could induce
suicidal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that of the 410 respondents from various
occupations, 75 percent had financial problems. When people are
unable to cope with long-term economic problems, they are likely
to feel depressed and desperate and even 'punish' themselves by
taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bandit Sornpaisal, chief of the Work System Reform Office,
listed four major risk groups.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed, who may not yet feel heavy stress now because
they still have some money left in their pockets, will feel it in
the next few months when their savings run out and when consumer
prices rise further.
</P>
<P>
Business people, in particular those in the property and
finance sectors, will be over-stressed from debt problems and
bankruptcy. The stress will also affect their employees and family
members.
</P>
<P>
The uneducated are often at a loss what to do to manage their
lives and how to solve their problems. Those people often do not
have affluent relatives to turn to for help.
</P>
<P>
Divorcees, already hurt by failed marriages, do not have a
spouse to share the economic woes and to get moral and financial
support.
</P>
<P>
In terms of income, Dr. Bandit said high income-earners,
especially those who earn more than 100,000 baht (2,700 U.S.
dollars) a month, are vulnerable because they cannot adjust
readily to sudden changes in their lives.
</P>
<P>
These people have gotten used to all kinds of convenience and
luxury. When they lose them, they feel that they have lost
everything and do not want to live any more.
</P>
<P>
The Mental Health Department has urged the media, monks and
astrologers to try to boost the morale of those in trouble,
encourage them to live on and not to commit suicide to orphanize
their children and leave more burden to their relatives.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Reshuffles His Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard reshuffled his cabinet today following a two-week
government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister announced today his new ministry, dumping
Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone from cabinet and promoting
junior minister David Kemp to her portfolio. Senator Vanstone has
been demoted from cabinet to the junior portfolio of Minister for
Justice.
</P>
<P>
In other major changes, National Party MP Mark Vaile will
become minister for transport and regional development, and former
sports minister Warwick Smith will replace Judi Moylan as family
services minister, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Moylan was demoted to Minister for the Status of Women, while
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, Trade Minister Tim Fischer and
Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith all retained their
positions.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister John Fahey will become the minister for
Finance and Administration, with the Department of Administrative
Services abolished and its functions divided among several other
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister John Moore will take on the responsibility
for science.
</P>
<P>
National Party MP Warren Truss was named new Customs and
Consumer Affairs Minister and Deputy Leader of the House, Alex
Somlyay, as the junior minister for Regional Development,
Territories and Local Government.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Thomson, parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs
Minister Alexander Downer, was appointed Minister of Sport,
Tourism and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Senator Chris Ellison replaces David Kemp as the junior
minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was forced to reshape his cabinet following
the resignation late last month of former Transport Minister John
Sharp and Administrative Services Minister David Jull after
revelations that Sharp secretly repaid around 6300 U.S. dollars in
travel claims.
</P>
<P>
Science Minister Peter McGauran later resigned after he was
also forced to repay dubious travel claims, and question-marks
were raised over Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Scott's claims.

<HEADLINE> eds-Poverty-3 Feature: China Aims to Banish Poverty to History (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To improve the management of poverty elimination work, the
state now holds individual provincial governments responsible for
the planning and implementation of initiatives. Formerly, decision
making power and responsibilities rested with Poverty Alleviation
and Development Office (PADO) and similar offices at all levels.
</P>
<P>
"Every top official should go and spend several days in a
number of impoverished villages before they make decisions
concerning poverty alleviation," said President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
International cooperation is welcome and sought after. The
first phase of World Bank assisted projects, launched at the end
of 1995, involved a loan of 250 million U.S. dollars which was
allocated to 35 counties in southwest China, aiding 3.5 million
impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Fuhe, a divisional chief of PADO, the second
phase of World Bank projects, involving 180 million U.S. dollars
in loans, has gained approval and will begin in 1998 with funds
to be directed to Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Ningxia. The initiative
aims to lift 2.6 million people in 26 counties above the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
While international help is growing, all domestic social forces
are being mobilized. Many state departments launched various
aid-the-poor campaigns with various names.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission is mounting its "Project of
Eliminating Poverty by Promoting Education;", the Ministry of
Agriculture has a "Harvest Plan" while the "Spark Plan" of the
State Commission of Science and Technology aims to promote the
spread of agrotechniques.
</P>
<P>
Various non-governmental institutions are also active in the
endeavor, making contributions to programs such as Project Hope
which helps poor children complete their education.
</P>
<P>
China succeeded in helping seven million people out of poverty
last year. "We are confident of lifting 10 million people above
the poverty line this year," says Liu Fuhe.

<P>
ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian and Spanish authorities
arrested a top-level Mafia figure, Giovannello Greco, on the
Spanish island of Ibiza today, police said.
</P>
<P>
Greco, sentenced to 15 years in prison for Mafia association
and murder during the Mafia maxi-trial in the early 1980s, had
been on the run for 16 years before he was tracked down today by
police investigators of Sicilian capital Palermo.
</P>
<P>
Greco and others were said to be preparing their return to
Sicily to exact reverge on their sworn enemies and to organize the
forces who had lost the 1980s Mafia wars.
</P>
<P>
"The arrest of a top-level Mafia figure like Giovannello Greco
is an important investigative success," Palermo police chief
Antonino Manganelli said, adding that police were searching the
apartment in which Greco was found.
</P>
<P>
"In the next few hours, we should know what his role was (in
the Mafia) and the veracity of the `legend' that he was wanted in
Palermo to organize the losing forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Parliamentary anti-Mafia commission,
Ottaviano Del Turco, called the arrest "another big step in the
fight against what is left of the old guard of Palermo's Cosa
Nostra."

ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Some famous Italy's skiers said
Saturday that snow and weather conditions may effect some events
of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
World super giant slalom champion Isolde Kostner said:"Weather
can turn from sunny to rainy or snowy, from cold to warm, during
the race. This makes conditions completely different for a skier
starting among the top 10 and the 20th." The 21-year-old Kostner
will spearhead Italy's women's team in Alpine skiing.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up:  Economic Cooperation Between Myanmar and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The bilateral economic
cooperation between Myanmar and Singapore has strengthened
further following a two-day visit to Singapore by Myanmar leader
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
First secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration Council
(SLORC) Khin Nyunt, who ended his visit Saturday, attended in
Singapore the second meeting of the two countries' Joint
Ministerial Working Committee (JMWC) on Promotion of Economic
Cooperation, Trade and Investment.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, two agreements were signed. One was the
Maritime Transport Agreement between the two countries, the
another one was an Agreement of Cooperation between the Union of
Myanmar Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Singapore
Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation between Myanmar and Singapore has
developed rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited
Myanmar, prompting a large volume of Singapore investment in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The two countries initiated an agreement on bilateral economic
cooperation during a visit to Singapore by Myanmar SLORC Chairman
Senior-General Than Shwe in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Later in January 1996, a high-ranking Singapore economic
mission, led by Minister of Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong,
came to Yangon where the first meeting of the two countries' JMWC
on the cooperation was held.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996 meeting, the two sides explored new areas of
cooperation in investment, tourism, agro-business and human
resources development. They also reached a new aviation accord
amending the old one signed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1996, Singapore private sector has been engaged in
development of Myanmar's Thanlyin-Kyauktan industrial zone, 50
kilometers south of the capital of Yangon, with three firms
building 10 container wharves out of 17 at the zone's Thilawa
Port.
</P>
<P>
Some Singapore companies are also building factories in another
industrial zone of Hlaingtharya in the capital to produce
galvanized iron sheets for export.
</P>
<P>
Singapore invested in the most of the 39 foreign-invested
hotels and tourism projects in Myanmar. The latest involvement in
the sector was the building of a beach resort hotel at Palongitan
island in Kawthaung, the southern end of Myanmar bordering
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
To help Myanmar improve its tourism industry, Singapore Tourist
Promotion Board and Singapore Hotel Association Training Education
Center are providing training for Myanmar trainees on hotel
management and communication skills.
</P>
<P>
Trainees from Myanmar's five ministries, the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and private firms are also receiving
training in export marketing strategies and management from
Singapore Trade Development Board.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Singapore also cooperated in agricultural sector. A
Singapore firm reached a contract with Myanmar in December last
year to make reclamation of low-lying areas, cultivation of
high-quality paddy and establishment of rice mills.
</P>
<P>
Singapore plans to set up bio-technology development center in
Myanmar and carry out reproduction and cultivation of vegetable,
fruit and high-quality rice for exporting to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, one of Myanmar's five major trading partners, has a
trade volume of 467.75 million U.S. dollars with Myanmar in the
1995-96 fiscal year, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Singapore's investment in Myanmar
amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 56 permitted projects by
the end of July this year, ranking second after the United Kingdom
out of Myanmar's 6.36-billion-dollar total foreign investment from
22 countries and regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 32
policemen were killed in two ambushes in eastern Colombia by
suspected rebels in the past two days, the National Command said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's attack on a strong police patrol near the town of
San Juan de Arama in Meta Department, 21 policemen were killed and
four were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Another ambush Friday left 15 people dead. Among them were 11
policemen.
</P>
<P>
The National Command blamed the second attack on rebels
opposing the forthcoming municipal elections, but they were unable
to determine the perpetrators of the first attack so far.
</P>
<P>
The heavily jungled Meta Department is a stronghold of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which is calling for a
boycott of the October 26 municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 candidates and 31 politicians have been killed in
pre-election violence.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Official Proposes More Trade With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- October 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade cooperation between
Chile and China's Hong Kong has a great prospect, said a Hong Kong
trade official.
</P>
<P>
"It must be considered that the last area to develop in the
world in terms of commerce and investment will be Asia and Latin
America. All the other areas are well developed," Victor K. Fung,
chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said in an
interview with the Chilean weekly magazine "Que Pasa."
</P>
<P>
The Chilean market is small, "but we see it more as a door of
entrance because of its partnership in Mercosur, its possible
participation in NAFTA and the free trade agreements it has signed
with several countries," said Fung.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is the door to enter China, and Chile is,
undoubtedly, the entrance door to Latin America," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's profile in Asia is growing and the economies of Hong
Kong and Chile are very complementary, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Chile and China's Hong Kong region is
"a small figure, but it is growing," said Fung.
</P>
<P>
Fung inaugurated a new Hong Kong trade office in Chile and took
part in the 12th meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council held here from September 30 to October 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
The state has vowed to increase funding for poverty
alleviation. In 1996, of 10.8 billion yuan allocated for this
purpose, a little over 50 percent came from interest free loans.
More than four billion yuan will be added to the figure annually.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are also obliged to put aside money for use
in poverty elimination in their own regions. If they fail to
contribute between 30-50 percent of the sum provided by the
central government, those sums themselves will be cut accordingly.
</P>
<P>
"However difficult local finances are, contributions to the
poverty fund must be committed at the start of each year," Premier
Li Peng said at the 1996 conference.
</P>
<P>
Funds are currently helping to improve roads -- farmers believe
that access brings prosperity to a village. Another focus is
disaster control. Threats of flood and drought are being lessened
by better water conservation, while training courses make the
latest agricultural techniques known to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government is giving more priority to
the approval of large and medium-sized projects in hinterland
regions, where the majority of its poverty-stricken populace
reside. Of all projects launched last year, 43.7 percent were
located in the country's central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Coastal-hinterland cooperation is encouraged to narrow the gap
between affluence and poverty. In 1996, some 2,500 cooperative
projects were signed, involving the transfer of 30 billion yuan in
capital to township enterprises in central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Last year nine eastern provinces and a number of prosperous
coastal cities were directly called on for more help. Each is
being held responsible for assisting one western province or
autonomous region. Beijing has been "twinned" with Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, while Shanghai assists Yunnan Province.

COLOMBO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The South Koreans have shown
keen interest in investing in power plant projects in Sri Lanka,
President of Sri Lanka-Korea Economic Cooperation Committee
Lakshman Watawala said today.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean delegation was on its annual visit to Colombo
last week to promote mutual business interest and explore new
trade opportunities between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegates have expressed their interest in investing in a
115 mega-watt power plant in Sri Lanka, which is open for 100
percent foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government is in the process of getting cabinet
approval for the project.
</P>
<P>
Thilan Wijesinghe, director general of the Board of Investment
of Sri Lanka, said there was an urgent need to expand and improve
the transport and telecommunications networks, harbors, power
generation and other infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the budgetary constraints and defense spending,
investment in infrastructure such as power and roads were far from
enough.
</P>
<P>
To increase investment in infrastructure, the Sri Lankan
government has agreed to create opportunities for both foreign and
local investments in infrastructure development.

<P>
LIMA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Congressmen have rejected
the United States' pressure on Peruvian judicial processes.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian legislators said in statements published by the Lima
press today that Peru's sovereignty is above any kind of pressure
and they cannot accept U.S. intervention in Peruvian Judiciary
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Congressmen delegation is in Peru to meet Peruvian
authorities mainly to discuss the imprisonment of Lori Berenson,
who was sentenced to life jail nearly two years ago for her links
with the rebel Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Congress' second vice-president, Oswaldo Sandoval,
said that this is another of the much repeated incidents of the
U.S. State Department meddling in the domestic affairs of Peru.
</P>
<P>
"Peru does not need the tutorship of any foreigner to solve
problems such as terrorism," Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
"This (U.S.) congress delegation should explain to its people
that there are countries like Peru where any act of terrorism as
the one committed by Lori Berenson is punished in an exemplary
form," he said.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ferrero Costa, acting president of the Congress Foreign
Affairs Commission, said that any sovereign nation cannot give in
to pressure from abroad.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Peru Dennis Jett had said that a motion was
tabled in U.S. Congress to cut U.S. financing to military training
in Peru because of the Peruvian conviction of U.S. nationals.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson arrived in Lima in August last
year to intercede for Lori Berenson to serve her sentence in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressmen delegation plans to visit the Yanamayo
prison in the Puno Province where Berenson is detained to assess
the prison conditions.

BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of todays's major
Beijing-based newspapers are as follows:
</P>
<P>
 People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The country's leading newspaper frontpaged an editorial
urging the leadig members of China Communist Party to seriously
study Jiang Zemin's report made at the 15th National Party's
Congress. It says that Jiang's report has made a systematic study
and analysis of the country's politics, econmoy and culture, and
has enriched the Theory of Deng Xiaoping. It says that the report
has profound bearing over the country's reform, opening-up and
socialist modernization and construction.
</P>
<P>
-- Hainan Province, the largest special economic zone of China,
has attracted more than six billion US dollars of foreign
investment, and over 30 billion yuan of domestic investment during
the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese workers have dug a canal from the Yangtze River to
divert ships from the construction site of the Three Gorges Dam
where work will be be started early next month.
</P>
<P>
Starting October 6, normal navigation will be stopped on the
main stream of the Yangtze in the dam area and all the ships will
direct their courses along the canal named "Daoliu Ming Canal."
</P>
<P>
The country's navigation department today began to supervise
operation on the canal, which is 3,726 meters long, 350 meters
wide and 58 meters deep. The canal is said to be deeper and wider
than the Suez and Panama canals.
</P>
<P>
Business Weekly of China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- China's move to slash tariffs on car imports starting
October 1 has encountered mixed responses, triggering another
round of debate over what is the way out for the frail auto
industry. The tariff on sedans has been reduced from 120 percent
to 100 percent while the import tax levied on common cars has been
cut from 100 percent to 80 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- In rural China, an annual net
income of 580 yuan (about 70 U.S. dollars) currently defines the
official absolute poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Those who earn less than this figure are targets of an ongoing
nationwide campaign under the auspices of the Poverty Alleviation
and Development Office (PADO), which reports to the State Council,
China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The country has vowed to provide all citizens with enough food
and clothing by the year 2000, now less than 1,000 days
away. "However arduous the task, our determination should not
waver," Chinese President Jiang Zemin said at a national
conference on poverty reduction held in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, China has managed to reduce three fourth
of its poverty population. Its share in the world total poverty
population dropped from a quarter to less than one twentieth.
This is a remarkable feat, given the fact that China's population
has increased rapidly over the same period. It now stands at more
than 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
However, as the deadline approaches, the work becomes harder. By
the end of last year, China still had 58 million people who live
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, China has lifted an average of five
million people out of poverty. But to meet its poverty alleviation
target, it will have be about 1.6 times more effective until the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
China's remaining poor live in the most hostile environments of
its vast territory: in arid regions, on dusty loess plateaus
incised by deep ravines, and in high, inaccessible mountainous
areas, mainly in the country's southwestern, northwestern and
central regions.
</P>
<P>
Landscape and frequent natural disasters have combined to
handicap people's social and economic development in these areas,
bogging them down in extreme poverty. Many of the people
requiring assistance have net incomes of just 300 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Some poverty alleviation experts say that the new millennium
deadline can be met: in socio-economic terms the country's
national strength is growing while the social awareness of its
people is heightening.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian rescue workers are
scrambling to provide possible help to victims of the latest
string of earthquakes as fresh tremors struck the northern Umbria
and Marches regions last night and this morning.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 quakes of varying magnitude have hit Italy since
September 26 when two quakes in close succession killed 12 people,
left thousands homeless and caused irreparable losses to the
country's artistic and architectural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services were unable to cope with the growing number
of people forced to leave their homes and the rebuilding of
damaged property, an emergency services spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The recent quakes in the worst-hit regions had forced the
rescuers to start their work all over again "from practically
zero," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Serravalle del Chienti in Macerata, emergency
services superintendent, Marco Agnoloni, urged the people who can
return to their homes to return immediately as the agency cannot
provide enough beds. The new quakes had forced more citizens in
the town to abandon their homes and sleep outdoors.
</P>
<P>
With no prospect of an immediate end to tremors, worries are
growing over the seasonal drop in temperature.
</P>
<P>
In Foligno, more than 7,000 people slept outside last night for
fear of further seismic activities. In the nearby town of
Camerino, about 5,000 people were in need of alternative
accommodation.

Romantsev, who is also chief coach, lashed out at Friday's
decision by UEFA's control and disciplinary committee to replay
Spartak's first-round second-leg UEFA Cup match against Sion of
Switzerland because the goals in the Moscow leg were too short.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pure provocation," Romantsev told reporters after
Spartak beat Lokomotiv Nizhny Novgorod 3-2 in a Russian premier
league match.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big disadvantage for some of Europe's elite clubs to
play against us from a financial point of view. Therefore some
UEFA officials are purposely trying to eliminate the Russian
clubs from European competition and for that reason they are
instructing referees to be biased against us."
</P>
<P>
Spartak defeated Sion 3-2 on aggregate after a 1-0 win in
Switzerland and a 2-2 draw in Moscow, but the Swiss side
complained that the goals at the Lokomotiv stadium were 12 cms
short.
</P>
<P>
The match is to be replayed on October 15 but Sion have said
they will appeal against the decision. They say they are not
interested in a re-match and want to be awarded a 3-0 win and
advance to the second round.

MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Foreign Minister Ivan
Antonovich said today that his country is opposed to NATO's plans
to expand its military institutions.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment at the United Nations' General Assembly,
the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Belarus holds that NATO should become a peace- and
security-keeping organization, Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
It is of much importance for NATO to revise its military goals,
the top diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Minsk will have to reconsider its stand on
national defense if any unfriendly country or military
organization appears on its western border.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin also said last week that his
country hopes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should turn
into a political or at least a peace-keeping organization rather
than remaining as a military alliance, the Itar-Tass News Agency
reported Friday.
