UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Indian Major General
Vijay Kumar Jetley will head a 6,000-member U.N. peacekeeping
force being deployed in Sierra Leone, the United Nations said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He will take up his duties in the next week.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously on October 22 to
establish the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to help
implement a July peace accord aimed at ending a brutal eight-year
civil war in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The conflict claimed tens of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
A large part of UNAMSIL will comprise troops from a Nigerian-
led West African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, which helped
restore the elected government of Sierra Leone to power in 1998
and will be responsible for security in areas where it is
stationed, including around the nation's capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
A veteran Nigerian diplomat, Ambassador Oluyemi Adeniji, was

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not Opposed to Regional Cooperation: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is not opposed to economic
cooperation between Arab countries and Israel, Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's remarks came in response to claims by Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and Minister of Regional Cooperation Shimon
Peres that Egypt has changed its stand on cooperation in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Egypt had opposed economic cooperation between Arab countries
and Israel before substantial progress is made in Arab-Israeli
peace talks, a resumption of the negotiations between Syria and
Israel in particular.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Egypt by Peres on Thursday, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said Egypt is ready to host the Middle
East and North Africa economic conference early next year after a
hiatus of two years. The conference is designed to discuss
cooperation among the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa made it clear that progress in the Middle
East peace process is important for such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Forging peace ahead is important and it will open the door to
cooperation and positive relations" between Arab countries and
Israel, the minister was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Levy's recent call on Egypt not to take sides
toward the peace process, Moussa said "what Israel is asking for
is nothing but wishful thinking."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country's rejection of Israeli manipulation
of its peace talks with the Palestinians and making unilateral
gains.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli stand is inappropriate when it delays the
implementation of the signed agreements and force its offer to the
Palestinians, Moussa stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt disagrees with (the Israeli moves) and in case of any
suggestions that are unfair to the Palestinians, Egypt will
certainly speak out for the Palestinians," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Takes Measures to Protect Mekong River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Facing the increasing
deterioration of the Mekong River, the Cambodian government is
determined to take actions to protect the river from pollution.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the Mekong River has been deteriorating as
garment factories, old homes and restaurants located along the
waterfront have been polluting the water.
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, the residents could bathe in clean water in
the river, free from pollution, but now it is strewn with garbage
and sewage, according to Phnom Penh Governor Chea Sophara.
</P>
<P>
The Phnom Penh municipal government has asked factory owners to
sign a contract requiring them to equip factories with a water
treatment facility. At the same time, Municipal officials in
recent months have been educating factory owners and others living
along the Mekong River not to dump waste into the water.
</P>
<P>
Those who violate the environmental laws will be fined or
punished, according to a report of Cambodia Daily.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a subdecree aimed at reducing water
pollution was passed. The measure gave the Ministry of Environment
increased powers to fine or imprison anyone involved in harming
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Ten to twenty years ago, the Mekong and the Tonle Sap lake were
abounding in fish, in terms of both quantity and variety. But
nowadays, fish are much less abundant and some species have just
disappeared. This disturbing trend is also attributable to
pollution, overfishing and deforestation and other forms of
environmental destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry has decided to inspect the factories
for three to four times a year to see if they abide by
environmental rules. One factory near Phnom Penh has been
temporarily shut down because it was polluting a community's water
supply.
</P>
<P>
The government's next step is to deal with homes along the
river which cause a lot of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an environmental education center has been
established in Siem Reap province, a tourist destination where the
world-famous Angkor Wat is located, to raise local awareness about
protecting and conserving the natural resources of the Tonle Sap.
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the center is to provide a community
facility that promotes positive environmental activities.
</P>
<P>
Tonle Sap lake and the Tonle Sap river constitute a remarkable
ecological wonder of the world because of its changing current
direction during the wet and dry seasons. In addition, the Tonle
Sap has abundant supplies of fresh water fish.
</P>
<P>
According to a research of the area, there are some 190 species
of plants, 200 fish species, 100 bird species and other various
species.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Rival Parties Launch New Power-Sharing Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The 10 ministers to head the
first Northern Ireland government for 25 years were nominated on
Monday during a meeting of the multi-party assembly in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
It is a key step towards the establishment of a devolved,power-
sharing executive in the province with Sinn Fein and Ulster
Unionists sitting side by side.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists paved the way for Monday's historic events,
after backing party leader David Trimble on Saturday over a deal
on decommissioning and devolution. The deal emerged from a 10-week
review of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The executive includes three from the Ulster Unionists, three
from the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) and two from the
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and two from Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise was the nomination of Sinn Fein's Martin
McGuinness,a one-time IRA leader, to the education portfolio, and
his nomination sparked outrage from the DUP.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister was
reinstalled, despite publicly resigning in July.
</P>
<P>
Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the SDLP, was reinstated
following a motion by the leader of the Alliance Party Sean Neeson.
</P>
<P>
The motion was carried by 71 votes to 28 votes following more
than three hours of heated debate in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
Before the assembly met, Ulster Unionist deputy leader John
Taylor confirmed to the BBC that he did not want to be a minister
in the new executive. He said he wrote to party leader David
Trimble last week informing him of his decision.
</P>
<P>
The executive will take over the running of Northern Ireland's
affairs -- except for taxation and security matters --the first
time since 1974 that the volatile province has experienced home-
rule government.
</P>
<P>
It will become fully operational on Thursday when the national
parliament in London transfers "devolution" powers.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) is expected to announce its
representative to the International Decommissioning Body on
Thursday, when direct rule is expected to end and power is
devolved to the assembly.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Join NATO's Partnership for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ireland will become the 29th
European country in NATO's Partnership for Peace program when
Irish Foreign Affairs Minister David Andrews signs official
documents on Wednesday, the Irish government said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signing at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)
headquarters in Brussels, is taken after the Irish parliament
approved last month a cabinet paper.
</P>
<P>
The step would allow Ireland's defence forces to train with
other NATO forces for humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Irish cabinet paper on partnership reaffirmed
Ireland's traditionally neutral stance and said it did not intend
to join the Western defence alliance, a Reuters report monitored
here said.
</P>
<P>
Critics in Ireland said the Partnership for Peace was an ante-
room to NATO and feared it could lead to Ireland losing its
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Since 1958, Irish peacekeepers and military observers have
taken part in 37 United Nations peacekeeping missions and security
forces.
</P>
<P>
Irish forces are currently participating in U.N. missions in
Lebanon, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They have also participated on a voluntary basis in U.N.
refugee efforts.

<HEADLINE> Levy Welcomes Mandela's Initiative on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said Monday that he welcomes an initiative proposed by
former South African President Nelson Mandela to end the deadlock
on the Israeli-Syrian peace track.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mandela has tried to arrange a summit
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian President
Hafez Assad in the Jordanian capital of Amman to revive the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the initiative, Levy said although Mandela, now aged
81, retired as president early this year, he is still a respected
figure around the world. He added that Israel welcomes his
contributions to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin met with
Johann Marks, South African Ambassador to Israel on Monday and
discussed the Mandela initiative.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador told Beilin that though Mandela's initiative is
not a part of South Africa's foreign policy, South African
government supports it.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria are still at odds over how to restart their
talks frozen three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Damascus demands a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war, before the talks can be resumed. It says that the
late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made such a commitment
in previous talks in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied the existence of such a commitment, saying
that talks should restart without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Middle East region last month, Mandela
called on Israel to pay the price of peace and withdraw from all
the Golan Heights.

ATHENS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary elections in
Greece will take place in September 2000, Greek government

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that there will be

Nobody wants early elections and the Greek government's
position is to complete its term, he said.

Reppas said that the political climate is positive toward the
government led by Prime Minister Costas Simitis and optimism is
justified.

<P>
PARIS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday promised that France will show its greatest firmness in
defending its own interests in the forthcoming talks of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to be opened in Seattle Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made to young French entrepreneurs, Chirac said
that France will not be "timid," has many "trumps" and will defend
its interests with the greatest firmness.
</P>
<P>
"One should not expect the least weakness from France on this
or that point," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe will not agree that the talks are focused
only on agricultural issues, as is wanted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It (Europe) is ready to talk about agriculture on condition
that people talk about all the other subjects in the framework of
global negotiations," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid the risks of globalization, the French
president said that the negotiators should also spend a lot of
time discussing the problems of environment protection, food
security and social norms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem of culture should stay outside WTO
talks, because "culture is not merchandise" and cannot be traded.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed his confidence in the capability of the
European commissioner in charge of trade, Frenchman Pascal Lamy,
who will represent the European Union in the Seattle talks.
</P>
<P>
"In Seattle, Europe will be strong because it will speak with
one voice, that of its negotiator (Lamy)," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will have over one
million orphans as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Zambian
Education Minister Godfrey Miyanda warned here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in the capital Lusaka on the HIV/AIDS
issue, the minister urged Zambians to use the World AIDS Day,

He said the latest statistics indicate a rise in the cases of
AIDS globally, and it is estimated that by the year 2000, Zambia

SEATTLE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The opening of the Washington

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Recommends General Assembly Consider New U.N.Mission in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a report to the Assembly on the situation of democracy and
human rights in Haiti, Annan said that while the U.N. component of
the International Civilian Mission in Haiti (MICIVIH) has helped
put in place some of the essential building blocks of the rule of
law, Haiti is still in the early stages of transition towards a
full-fledged democracy.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite clear that there are still a number of areas in
which the United Nations can continue to provide technical and
other support in response to the request of Haitian authorities
for assistance in the strengthening of institutions and civil
society," said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
According to the report's recommendations, the new mission
would pursue the activities of its predecessor mission -- MICIVIH,
which is undertaken jointly with the Organization of American
States and set to expire on December 31, and the U.N. Civilian
Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) the mandate of which expires on
November 30.
</P>
<P>
The new mission, "limited in time and scope," would continue to
concentrate on the institutional consolidation of the police,
judicial reform, capacity-building and human rights advocacy and
verification.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended that it pursue a coordinated and
integrated approach to enhance the effectiveness of governance and
improve respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
Among some of the "structural and political obstacles" still
plaguing Haiti, Annan cited the "persistent professional and
ethical shortcomings" in the judicial system and lack of "
institutional maturity and self-confidence" of the Haitian
National Police as formidable obstacles to the country's reform
process.

JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said Monday that the Palestinian refugees will not
be permitted to return to Israel, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Israeli Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, Barak said Israel's position on the issue is very clear
and the problem should be resolved through final-status talks
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in three months that Barak attended a
Knesset committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak clarified his stand on the refugee issue after Yossi
Katz, one of his Labor party Knesset Members, said last week that
Israel should admit 100,000 Palestinian refugees to come back to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Katz also said that Israel should recognize and share
responsibility for the refugee problem. His remarks invited severe
criticism from the both Labor party and the right-wing Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinians were displaced and forced to find
shelters in neighboring Arab countries in the Arab-Israeli
conflicts in the past half century.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians insist that the refugees have the right to go
back to their homeland while Israel disagrees with the
notion.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Involve in Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Monday called on the people of the whole country to
get involved in the battle against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar which was attended by senior officials
from governmental institutions, Meles said that establishing an
anti-corruption institution by itself could not help avoid
corruption unless the public actively involves in the fight
against the practice.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the public should understand that bribing government
 employees in return to gaining benefits from them was a crime.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that taking and giving bribes were
equally crime, adding that if one is requested to offer bribe in
return for legal services from governmental institutions, he
should be able to refuse and struggle for his right by going to
concerned bodies.
</P>
<P>
Law executives on their part have the responsibility of
bringing those people who are engaged in promoting corruption to
justice, Meles said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the mass media to play a leading
role in uncovering corruption.
</P>
<P>
The newly designed civil service reform program is expected to
help minimize or totally avoid corruption, Meles said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Ruling Party Vows to Accept Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Monday pledged that the ruling Frelimo (Frente de
Libertacao de Mocambique) will accept the results of this week's
general elections whatever they may be.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Chissano criticized
spokesmen for the main opposition party, Renamo (Resistencia
Nacional de Mocambique), for their readiness to shout "fraud" even
before the polls open.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen if he won the presidency, but Renamo
and its coalition allies secured a parliamentary majority,
Chissano said under the constitution, he would still be entitled
to form the government.
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to have a government with minority support in
parliament," he said. "But another scenario would be negotiation
with part of the opposition to achieve a majority."
</P>
<P>
"What would be unacceptable is a government including both me
and parties opposed to me," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the president reaffirmed his conviction that Frelimo
is on the course for victory. "Our number of seats will increase
substantially," he said, adding: "Where we had fewer votes in
1994, we will have many more this time and in some constituencies
we will have a huge majority."
</P>
<P>
"This campaign has shown that the public is very aware of what
is going on," he said, observing that "there will be a much more
conscious and considered vote than in 1994" because "that was a
time of tension when we had just emerged from a war."
</P>
<P>
Despite the occasional Renamo threat, Chissano expressed the
belief that there is no danger of any post-election violence, let
alone a return to war.
</P>
<P>
Neither Frelimo, nor the rank and file of Renamo, has any desire
to go back to war, he said.

<HEADLINE> (More Details Added) Opening of WTO Convention Center in Seattle Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The opening of the Washington
State Convention and Trade Center, where the Ministerial
Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) will be held, was
delayed Monday morning because of Activities of protesters.
</P>
<P>
WTO spokesman Hans-Peter Werner told reporters the Secret
Service performed a second sweep in the early morning hours after
someone had apparently tried to break into the building where
negotiations among trade ministers from 135 nations will take
place this week.
</P>
<P>
Werner said he did not know how long that would take or whether
it would delay a symposium in which environmental, labor and other
organizations were to voice their concerns about world trade
policy to organization officials.
</P>
<P>
The convention center in downtown Seattle was supposed to open
at 6 a.m. local time but remained closed two hours later. The WTO
ministerial conference begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of reporters and delegates were kept waiting outside
as the Secret Service conducted a second security sweep of the
huge building. The center had been cleared of all reporters and
delegates Sunday night for a planned check for bombs and the
installation of metal detectors before the start of formal events
today.
</P>
<P>
Before the formal opening of the WTO meeting Tuesday, the WTO
had planned a full day of discussions among more than 700 non-
governmental organizations such as environmental groups and labor
unions in an effort to reach out to groups that have been critical
of WTO policies.
</P>
<P>
About two kilometers to the north of the convention center,
four demonstrators scaled a giant construction crane Monday to
hang a five-story banner protesting WTO policies on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Werner said a WTO symposium for outside groups to be heard,
which was to be presided over by U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky, would go on as planned once security
officials reopened the building.
</P>
<P>
WTO Director General Mike Moore, a former New Zealand prime
minister, met the opposition head-on Sunday, telling union
representatives that foes of free trade were trying to create a
false debate between organized labor and the organization.
</P>
<P>
The WTO nations will try to agree this week to launch a new
round of global trade talks, intended to boost world commerce by
breaking down barriers to free trade.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is to address the gathering
Wednesday, has staked much on the talks. His administration is
saying they must succeed, although WTO negotiators last week
failed in Geneva to agree on a format for a new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
The last world trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, wrapped
up in 1993 after eight years of negotiations.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Sultan Qaboos Bin Said
of Oman arrived here Monday evening for a brief visit to the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), the official WAM news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Qaboos arrived from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia,
where he and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders had
just ended their 20th summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The most important result of the three-day meeting is an
agreement on a long-awaited common customs tariff among the six
GCC countries, namely Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain
and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, to be implemented from March 2005, divided
goods into three categories: duty free, basic goods with a 5.5
percent duty and luxury goods with a 7.5 percent duty.
</P>
<P>
Other important issues, such as GCC relations with Iran,
the situation in Iraq and the Middle East peace process, were
also discussed during the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Qaboos would meet with President Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who was the only GCC leader
absent from the Riyadh meeting. UAE officials cited health
concern as the main reason for Zayed's absence.
</P>
<P>
Zayed, who was in his 80s, sent Dubai Ruler and UAE Vice
President and Prime Minister Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum
to the summit.

WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will visit the Middle East next week in a hope
that her trip would help nudge the peace process forward, the

</P>
<P>
During her five-day visit starting on Sunday through to

</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright's visit was arranged after President Bill

sides try to meet a mid-February target for reaching a framework
agreement on what Rubin called "extraordinarily difficult"
permanent status issues.
</P>
<P>
These issues include the future of Jerusalem and Jewish
settlements on occupied land and the borders of a Palestinian
state. Arafat and Barak have said they wanted to complete a full
treaty on the issues by next September.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright will stop in Damascus as she has committed

<HEADLINE> FM: Russia Needs No Outside Mediator in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov reiterated Monday that Moscow "does not need any third
countries' mediatory services" in solving the problem in its
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia stands ready to cooperate with international
humanitarian organizations to help the refugees fleeing Chechnya,
Ivanov said at a joint press conference with Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe chairman Knut Vollebaek, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people have fled Chechnya, where federal
troops are in the middle of a campaign against rebels. The
offensive was launched after Chechen rebel incursions into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of apartment explosions that
killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he briefed Vollebaek on Russia's efforts in
normalizing the situation and restoring peaceful life in parts of
Chechnya now under federal control, as well as plans being drafted
to address the humanitarian problem.
</P>
<P>
As to Vollebaek's proposed trip to the North Caucasus, Ivanov
said the Russian government still has to make a decision on the
tour, taking into consideration the expediency of such a trip and
on the condition that proper security guarantees are provided, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Every trip to the North Caucasus must be well substantiated
and thoroughly prepared for," Ivanov said. "It's a zone of
increased danger and it is the Russian government that makes the
decision on trips by any international representative," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also rejected a possible decision by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to condition the provision of
new loans to Russia on the situation in the North Caucasus."Russia
will not make decisions under pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership is interested in the resolution of the
Chechen issue more than anyone else. We don't have to be convinced
of that, taught or pressured," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the IMF "will act in accordance with
its charter and be guided by economic, not political
considerations."
</P>
<P>
"Russia has fulfilled all of its obligations to the IMF and now
the ball is on the IMF's field," Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Publicizes Corporate Strategy to Attract Shareholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 29 (Xinhua)-- German industrial giant Monday
publicized its business strategy aiming to persuade its
shareholders to reject the record-high hostile bid of 242 billion
marks (125 billion U.S. dollars) by Britain's Vodafone Airtouch
PLC.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone, the world's No. 1 mobile phone business, made the bid
earlier this month for Mannesmann. The British company said its
was" disappointed by the rejection Sunday evening by Mannesmann's
supervisory board of the bid but said the offer would still be
effective.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory board decided unanimously to reject Vodafone's
offer and called it "neither in form nor in substance acceptable."
</P>
<P>
In a faxed news release, Mannesmann said it would " reveal the
strong outlook for its key telecommunications businesses and will
present its case for the value of Mannesmann shares."
</P>
<P>
The firm based in Duesseldorff promised in the report big
growth and profits not only in mobile phone, but also in fixed
network and Internet service, saying its strategy is more than
focusing on mobile business as Vodafone's.
</P>
<P>
Mannesmann projected pre-tax earnings to rise at an annual rate
of more than 30 percent in coming four years for all of its
telecommunications activities. The pre-tax profits from mobile
phone business are expected to reach 7.7 billion marks next year,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
At an interview published in Monday's Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung newspaper, Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser said the
shareholders would support his strategy.
</P>
<P>
What his counterpart in Vodafone Chris Gent has said, that more
than half of Mannesmann shareholders are standing behind his offer,
is"part of Gent's propaganda," Esser told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the shareholders will reject the offer," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Mannesmann spokesman Manfred Sohnlein told
Germany's NDR television that shareholders accounting for
collected some 35 percent of the total Mannesmann capital had
vowed to support company executive and to reject Vodafone's offer.

Century," organized by Khartoum University on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The problems of Africa include the border disputes planted by
former colonial rule, the debt burden that cripples the African
economies, and the instability of political regimes due to lack of
resources for achieving development and peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The problems also include illiteracy, the backwardness of the
women sector and unemployment, said the Sudanese minister. He
added that the Sert Summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) was a bold step on the way to African unity.
</P>
<P>
He urged the foreign envoys to the conference to highlight the
problems of Sudan and convey to the West a true picture of what is
going on in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
There have been groundless allegations that Sudan was involved
in terrorism and slave trade.
</P>
<P>
The three-day event is being attended by representatives of the
OAU and other international organizations as well as envoys of
some African countries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Parliament Urged to Adopt Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Monday expressed the hope that the parliament will pass a
referendum bill so as to let the people decide whether they adopt
or reject the new democratic constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of a draft constitution by
Constitutional Commission Chairman Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku at
the State House here, Mugabe stressed that it is up to the people
to decide either to adopt or reject the proposed draft
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the referendum bill or law can be passed through the
fast track process to enable us to hold a referendum," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was his hope that the country would hold the
referendum soon and allow the people to have enough time to study
the draft before the elections scheduled for next year begin.
</P>
<P>
If the people vote yes, that would be the basis to hold
elections in March 2000, Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the commissioners for offering people a chance to
speak on key matters constituting the basis of the draft document.
</P>
<P>
"Personally I am happy that our constitution was based on the
people's own feelings, judgement, desires and wishes," he said,
adding that national consciousness should bind Zimbabweans to
defend the country against intrusive, destructive criticism from
outside.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Egypt Within Regional Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright is expected to visit Egypt early next
month for talks on Mideast issues, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry
official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albright will arrive in Cairo on December 9 within a regional
tour, which will also take her to Syria, Saudi Arabia, the
Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel, the official, who asked
not to be named, told Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
During her brief visit, Albright will hold talks with Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on the developments of the peace talks between
the Palestinians and Israel and the efforts surrounding the
resumption of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations before the end of
the year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Albright is reportedly to "get the first hand information" on
the progress made in the Palestinian-Israeli talks for a final
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
She is also expected to seek ways of reviving the
Syrian-Israeli talks suspended in early 1996. Both Syria and
Israel have expressed willingness to resume the talks, but
differed on where they are going to start from.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists a return of the Golan Heights Israel captured in
the 1967 Mideast War as a basis for peace negotiations, a demand
refused by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Albright will also deal with the international
efforts aimed at helping end the 16-year-old civil war and reach
national reconciliation in Sudan, MENA quoted the official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will expound an Egyptian-Libyan initiative on the
Sudanese peace process and urge the U.S. to reconsider its
opposition to it, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya have called for a permanent cease-fire between
the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army which has been fighting for greater autonomy in the mostly
Christian south. Sudan's two northern Arab neighbors have also
proposed a preparatory meeting on a Sudanese peace conference to
be attended by the related parties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., which wants to have a say in the issue, is opposed to
the initiative due to the participation of Libya. The U.S. and
Libya have long been at odds over many regional and international
issues.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Fall Sharply in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Sales of U.S. existing
homes declined in October to the lowest level in nearly two years
because of the rising mortgage rates, according to the National
Association of Realtors' report.
</P>
<P>
The Association said Monday that sales of existing single-
family homes fell for the fourth month in a row, falling a sharp 6.
6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79
million units.
</P>
<P>
But Association officials said despite the drop, existing-home
sales are expected to total a record 5.20 million units this year.
</P>
<P>
October's decrease reflects rising mortgage rates. The average
rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.85 percent in October,
up from September's 7.82 percent and much higher than the 6.71
percent rate for October 1998, the Association said, citing
figures from Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
Last month's drop in existing-home sales was sharper than the 0.
6 percent decline many analysts were anticipating.
</P>
<P>
The sales level in October was the lowest since January 1998,
when 4.59 million units were sold. The 6.6 percent decline
followed a 2.1 percent drop in sales in September. Sales have
fallen each month since hitting a record 5.63 million units in
June.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that sales were down in all parts of the
country in October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, the national median sales price for
existing homes rose 3.9 percent to 133,100 dollars in October over
the same month a year ago. However, October's median price is
slightly lower than the 134,400 dollars price in September.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Minister Defends Jailed Reformist Cleric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Monday openly
defended the prominent reformist cleric Abdollah Nouri who was put
into prison by the conservative Special Cleric Court Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of the preparatory session of the
Fifth Conference of the Islamic Information Ministers, Mohajerani
said that he agreed with Nouri on the fact that the Special
Cleric Court has no right to deal with press offenses.
</P>
<P>
"As officials of the Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry, we
regret the arrest of Mr. Nouri and closure of daily Khordad, we
are against this method and believe that we should not take
measures aimed at limiting freedom of the press," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not intend to question whether the court is legal or not,
but I agree with Nouri on this point that the court is not
qualified to deal with press offenses," he added, quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, former interior minister and vice president for
development and social affairs of the first cabinet of President
Mohammad Khatami, was sentenced to five years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
As managing director of the daily Khordad, Nouri was also
sentenced to five years of dismissal from his post and a cash fine
of 15 million rials (5,000 U.S. dollars) on charges ranging from
publishing anti-religious materials to insulting the late
spiritual leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Nouri was a victim of the country's
spiraling power struggles, since the conservatives attempted to
disqualify moderate hopefuls to ensure their dominance in the
coming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, a close friend of Nouri, underlined that the
verdict against Nouri could not provide a suitable atmosphere
both inside and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the jury of the Special Cleric Court are chosen by
the court itself while the jury members of the press court are
elected by head of the city council, Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance and head of the justice department.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani said that four dailies have been closed down since
the start of the current Iranian calendar year on March 21.
However, he said, 10 new dailies have obtained licenses for
publication and more will hit newsstands in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
He urged the press to observe their limits and not to provide
any excuse for restriction of their freedom.

<HEADLINE> GCC Summit Ends with Pledge on Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation
Council ended their 20th summit here on Monday, with pledges to
speed up the pace of Arab economic integration in the face of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The three-day annual summit reached an agreement on unifying
their customs tariffs as the first step toward the formation of a
regional market.
</P>
<P>
At the closing ceremony, the leaders from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain endorsed the
Riyadh Declaration, vowing to work out common strategies to meet
challenges arising from the growing tendency of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The document, read out by GCC Secretary General Jameel
Al-Hujailan, says the GCC leaders decided to work out a single
position on oil production to ensure balance of supply and demand
on the market.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf oil producers have agreed to keep their oil
productions cuts until the end of March next year. The cuts have
more than doubled the oil prices since they were adopted earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states account for nearly half the world's oil deposits
and rely on oil export for most of national income. They expressed
satisfaction with the recent developments on the oil market and
pledged more efforts to guarantee the stability of world markets.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts and consumers, however, warned high oil prices have
begun to curb world demand, and will eventually put downward
pressure on oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The GCC decided to start implementation of customs union as of
March 1, 2005 provided that the member countries reform their
customs duties gradually to the 5.5 percent level for staples and
7.5 percent level for the other commodities.
</P>
<P>
The GCC leaders adopted a customs code that would serve as a
guide for one year. The code will be revised in the light of
recommendations of the GCC members and will be put into force in
all customs departments in the GCC members by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
They endorsed the amendment of standards of receiving a
country-of-origin certificate and passed a resolution enabling the
local people buy real estates in the GCC members.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to amend the patent system among the GCC members in
the that of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The leaders entrusted the Committee on Economic and Financial
Cooperation to chart a long-term strategy for the talks between
the GCC and the regional and international organizations with a
view to usher in an era of Gulf One Voice on the international
arena.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Singapore Leaders Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji held talks
Monday and both pledged to further enhance cooperation between
their two countries and promote China-Singapore relations onto a
new stage.
</P>
<P>
The talks took place hours after Zhu arrived here for an
official visit to Singapore, the third leg of his four-nation
Southeast Asian tour which has already taken him to Malaysia and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders met twice when they were attending the third
informal summit between ASEAN (Association of the Southeast Asian
Nations) and China, Japan and South Korea in Manila Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Goh told Zhu that he was pleased to officially greet the
Chinese premier in Singapore, sources close to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said it was also a great pleasure for him to visit this
beautiful country again nearly 10 years after his last trip here
as the mayor of Shanghai in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that although it has not been long since China and
Singapore established diplomatic ties, their bilateral relations
are going on smoothly, with exchanges and cooperation developing
in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The two nations have also maintained good coordination and
cooperation on many international and regional issues, Zhu said
while expressing satisfaction with the momentum of development in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that next year will mark the beginning of a new
millennium and the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the
diplomatic relations between China and Singapore, Zhu said he will
join efforts with Goh in actively exploring new ways to deepen
bilateral cooperation in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance the bilateral relations, Zhu put forward his
four proposals.
</P>
<P>
-- Maintaining the current momentum of frequent exchange of
visits between leaders and government departments of the two
countries, which Zhu said has an irreplaceable role in deepening
bilateral understanding and enhancing bilateral relations. Zhu
officially invited Goh to visit China next year.
</P>
<P>
-- Furthering economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries. The Chinese premier said he believes there still exists
potential for expanding bilateral trade and mutual investments.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China welcomes Singapore companies to continue
investing in China, take a role in the reform of China's
state-owned enterprises and continue to open markets in the civil
housing area in which Singapore has gained rich experience.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu said China will encourage its enterprises to set
up independently-owned or joint ventures in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
-- Exploring ways for cooperation in the financial area. Zhu
praised Singapore for its rich experience in opening-up and
supervision in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the two sides could deeply explore ways to strengthen
regional financial cooperation and resist and prevent financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing cooperation with Singapore in training. Many
Chinese delegations and teams have visited Singapore and learned
quite a lot in the fields of economic management, city planning
and construction, environment protection, housing and legal
systems.
</P>
<P>
Goh said he agreed with Premier Zhu's suggestions, noting that
Singapore also believes that it is necessary to deepen and broaden
the economic and trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Goh accepted with pleasure the invitation to pay an official
visit to China next year.
</P>
<P>
Goh also hailed the recent bilateral agreement between China
and the United States on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO would play an even more active role
in formulating the international trade rules, the Singapore prime
minister said.

PARIS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- France Monday asked Albania to
help stabilize Kosovo and persuade Kosovo Albanians to respect the
United Nations resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine told visiting Albanian

The U.N. Resolution 1244, adopted after the halt of NATO

within the Yugoslav frontier and the establishment of a transitory
international administration in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the resolution is far from being
completed and is accompanied with violent incidents between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs, while a majority of Kosovo Serbs have fled

HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge Monday urged the Joint Military Commission (JMC) on
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) cease-fire to

<P>
He said: "We need to accelerate our pace not only in order to
make up for lost time but more importantly to avert the dangers
that may arise due to delays and prolongation of the process."
</P>
<P>
The JMC started the five-day meeting last Friday to map out the
final modalities of implementing the final phase of the Lusaka
cease-fire accord, which was signed in July and August this year,
to end the war in the DRC.

<P>
Over the weekend, the commission broke into four committees --
disarmament, disengagement, humanitarian and withdrawal -- to come
up with recommendations to be discussed in the plenary session on
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The JMC is composed of all belligerents in the DRC civil war:
with Rwanda and Uganda standing by the rebels, and Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia on the side of the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
The JMC meeting is a follow-up to two other meetings held
respectively in Uganda's capital Kampala and Zambia's capital
Lusaka. It is expected to end on Tuesday.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investments in Asian
emerging markets through mutual funds have rebounded this year
because of the economic recovery in the region, the U.S. newspaper
Investor's Business Daily said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Hong Kong &AMP; China Fund is up 63 percent this year,
Guinness Flight China &AMP; Hong Kong is up 55 percent and Matthews
Korea is up 98 percent, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Though Asian emerging markets were among the hardest hit in
recent years some American experts are most optimistic about the
region as most Asian countries and regions were undergoing
financial reforms and corporate restructuring, it said, adding
that some experts believe that it's a good time to get in the
region now.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Singapore were seen as two economies that have
investment potential, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It said China has been in the headlines as the country makes
progress in its bid to join the World Trade Organization. "As
China gains importance in the global economy, I think Hong Kong is
still going to be the way to go into China," said Michael Ward, a
money manager with International Assets Advisory Corp.
</P>
<P>
Mark Mobius, president and portfolio manager of Templeton
Developing Markets Trust for Franklin Templeton, said South Korea
and Thailand are showing the most promise, largely due to their
reform and restructuring plans.

"Thailand's reform and restructuring are progressing at a
slower rate than Korea but is still good," he said.

SINGAPORE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong hosted a banquet on Monday night in honor of visiting
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji at the Istana (the Presidential
Palace).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet, the Chinese Premier said China
appreciates Singapore's effective response to the impact of the
financial crisis and its promptness in bringing its economy back
to recovery.
</P>
<P>
Zhu wished the Singapore government and people new and still
greater achievements in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"Facilitated by historical origin, culture and language, the
Chinese and Singaporean peoples have developed friendly exchanges
for many many years," said Zhu, who arrived in Singapore earlier
in the day for a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Though it has not been long since the two countries established
diplomatic relations, Sino-Singapore cooperation has been
progressing smoothly, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no issue between China and Singapore that calls for
urgent solution," Zhu said, adding that the sound political
relationship between the two countries has paved the way for the
development of bilateral cooperation in the economic, trade and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
He said China is ready to work with Singapore to broaden and
deepen their bilateral relationship of mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong thanked
China for extending a helping hand to the region during the
financial crisis, with its sound economic performance and in
particular its pledge not to devalue the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Goh said China's role in dealing with the crisis has helped
contain the impact of the crisis and contributed to the region's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"China's resolve is most impressive and its contribution to
regional economic stability will be long remembered," Goh
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the conclusion of China's bilateral WTO (World
Trade Organization) negotiations with the United States earlier
this month, describing it as a "big step towards achieving the WTO
vision of global economic integration."
</P>
<P>
Goh also congratulated China on Macao's scheduled return to the
motherland on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Foreign
Minister S. Jayakumar and other Singapore senior government
officials attended the banquet.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Parties Concerned in Mid East to Press Peace Progress Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called on the parties concerned in the Middle
East to guard the fragile accomplishments of the peace process and
press it forward.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the occasion of the observance of the
International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people, Annan
said "I would like to commend Mr. Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of
Israel, and Mr. Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian
Authority, for their courage and wisdom in pursuing peace and
reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, there are still difficulties on the ground
continuing to pose obstacles to progress," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"So I would like to call on the parties to guard fragile
accomplishments of the peace process, to press forward and, above
all, to refrain from any actions that might prejudice the outcome
of the delicate permanent status negotiations," the U.N. chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said peace was much more likely to blossom in an
atmosphere of improving socio-economic conditions and he pledged
that bodies such as the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees and the U.N. Development Program would remain
deep involved in providing humanitarian aid, health care and
educational and in fostering agricultural, industrial and
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations family has supported the Palestinian people
throughout their many decades of suffering and remains strongly
committed to the cause," the Secretary-General said.
</P>
<P>
"On the 20th century's last International Day of solidarity
with the Palestinian People, let us dare to hope that one of the
new century's earliest achievements will be the long-awaited
moment when peace and prosperity can be enjoyed in full by
Palestinians, Israelis and all the people of the Middle East," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Involve in Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Monday called on the people of the whole country to
get involved in the battle against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar which was attended by senior officials
from governmental institutions, Meles said that establishing an
anti-corruption institution by itself could not help avoid
corruption unless the public actively involves in the fight
against the practice.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the public should understand that bribing government
 employees in return to gaining benefits from them was a crime.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that taking and giving bribes were
equally crime, adding that if one is requested to offer bribe in
return for legal services from governmental institutions, he
should be able to refuse and struggle for his right by going to
concerned bodies.
</P>
<P>
Law executives on their part have the responsibility of
bringing those people who are engaged in promoting corruption to
justice, Meles said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the mass media to play a leading
role in uncovering corruption.
</P>
<P>
The newly designed civil service reform program is expected to
help minimize or totally avoid corruption, Meles said.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital Monday and doctors
there suspected that he may be suffering from pneumonia, Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was diagnosed last Thursday as suffering from a viral
infection accompanied by bronchitis, but he traveled on from the
Central Clinical Hospital to his country home in Gorky-9 outside
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old president's health had appeared to improve in
recent weeks and had been fairly active. He went to Istanbul,
Turkey on November 18 to attend the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, delivering a forceful rebuff
to Western pressure on Russia to ease its military campaign
against rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was last hospitalized in October 9 for influenza and a
fever.
</P>
<P>
He has had health problems for years, including heart trouble
that led to multiple bypass surgery in 1996 and recurring bouts of
pneumonia and respiratory infections. He has also suffered from
back pain and a recurring ulcer in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Threaten to Quit Final-status Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian negotiators
threatened on Monday to pull out from the permanent-status talks
if Israel's settlement activities continue, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as the two sides began their six sessions of
final-status negotiations at the Neve Ilan Hotel outside Jerusalem
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Palestinians had raised the settlement issue at
almost every meeting with their Israeli counterparts, it was the
first time that they clearly threatened to quit negotiations
should the settlement activities do not stop.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian chief negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said that
if the settlement activities continue without any clear objections
from Israeli government, the final-status talks will certainly
face a real crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo also handed over a letter to his Israeli counterpart
Oded Eran concerning Israeli plans to build 1,026 new homes in
some settlements.
</P>
<P>
Eran said he recognized the sensitivity of the settlement
issue to the Palestinians. He promised to deliver Rabbo's letter
to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The settlement issue is one of the thorniest topics set to be
resolved in the final-status talks launched on September 13. The
two sides also have to resolve other issues, such as the status of
Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees, and water resources
division, during the talks for a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum signed in September, the
two sides should reach a framework agreement on final-status by
next February and a final peace treaty by September 2000.

<HEADLINE> GA President Pledges Support for Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- President of the United
Nations General Assembly Theo-Ben Gurirab on Monday pledged
support for the Middle East peace process, saying that the United
Nations continues to have a direct interest in the peace process
and upholds its responsibility for the question of Palestine until
a satisfactory settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Addressing on the occasion of the International Day of
Solidarity with the Palestinian People, Gurirab said for the
international community, this has become an occasion to renew its
pledge to continue supporting the legitimate aspirations of the
Palestinian people for self-determination and statehood, on the
basis of the United Nations Charter, the principles of
international law as well as the relevant United Nations
resolutions and declarations of various international conferences.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Palestine has been a major concern to the
United Nations for over 50 years. Regrettably, the General
Assembly's resolution 181 of November 29, 1947 ran into a pre-
meditated wall of defiance and unilateralism," Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long walk since then, and finding an amicable,
just and durable solution to the question of Palestine as well as
a comprehensive peace in the Middle East have remained elusive,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
"The singing of the Sharm- el-Sheikh Memorandum this year was a
major breakthrough. The international community was gratified that
the parties, assisted by the co-sponsors, finally succeeded in
breathing new life into the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
This achievement has made possible the resumption of further
negotiations, including progress on some of the outstanding
technical matters, the release of Palestinian prisoners, the
opening of safe-passage routes as well as an agreement on
modalities concerning issues such as a timetable and final status
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
For peace to take root and become viable in the Middle East, it
must be accompanied by social and economic development and there
can be no peace without development, Gurirab said.
</P>
<P>
Both the United Nations and the international community should
intensify their efforts aimed at providing the much needed
economic and technical assistance to the Palestinian people now
and in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
The International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People
is observed annually in accordance with a General Assembly
resolution adopted in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of Iraqi civilians
injured on Sunday when U.S. and British warplanes attacked a
primary school in northern Iraq has risen to 10, according to the
official Iraqi News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Iraqi military spokesman said Sunday night that U.S. and
British warplanes bombed a primary school in a residential
district in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, injuring eight
civilians, including women and children.
</P>
<P>
Foreign TV crew, photographers and journalists based in
Baghdad were rushed to the scene of the bombardment on Monday,
where they found four civilian houses and two cars near the
primary school were severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
A number of shops and houses nearby also sustained damage of
various degrees.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Addul-Qadir, governor of Neineva province whose
capital city is Mosul, told reporters that the area where the
primary school is located is free from any military site or air
defense units.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the "brutal U.S.-British bombardment of civilian
facilities and residential areas," saying the people in his
province will not be scared by their aggressions.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by Iraqi government, since
last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and British
warplanes have made more than 16,000 sorties to enforce the two
no-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, saying they
were unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain and not covered
directly by any U.N. Security Council resolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
Al-Abidine Ben Ali arrived in Cairo Monday for a two-day official
visit at the invitation of his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali was greeted at Cairo International Airport by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and other senior officials, and was
later accorded a red carpet reception by Mubarak, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ben Ali will hold talks with Mubarak and
senior Egyptian officials on ways to promote bilateral relations,
especially economic and trade cooperation, and regional issues of
mutual interest, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and Tunisia have attached importance to Ben Ali's
visit.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said on Saturday that his trip will offer "a good
opportunity" for the two presidents to discuss bilateral
cooperation, and the situation in the Arab world and the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit will also give a further momentum to the relations
between the two countries, which are exerting joint efforts to
intensify cooperation in both economic and political fields, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali's visit mirrors the keenness of the two countries'
leaders on boosting bilateral relations in all fields, Tunisian
Ambassador in Cairo Youssef Al Moqadim said.
</P>
<P>
Moqadim added that a symposium will be held in January to
discuss the role to be played by Egypt's private sector in
boosting trade in the light of a free trade zone between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will also deal with the prospects for the
establishment of a partnership between the two North African Arab
nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Tunisian trade relations witnessed a progress over
the past few years, with the trade volume rising to 75.4 million
U.S. dollars in 1998 from 3.29 million dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been making efforts to increase the trade
volume to 200 million dollars in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC crude basket average
climbed to 24.90 U.S. dollars per barrel this week from last
week's 24.35 dollars per barrel, said statistics issued by the
organization Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to cut production reached last March by the OPEC
members is still considered the essential driving force for the
surge. Those large oil producers and exporters also reached an
extensive agreement on extending the cut beyond next March,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC's firm policy to keep a tight rein on oil supplies has
led a balance between international oil supply and demand after
last year's oversupply.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the huge consumption of oil for heating in winter
and the slash of oil stocks in industrialized countries also help
push up the oil price.
</P>
<P>
Compared with February's price of 9.5 dollars per barrel, the
OPEC oil price has rocketed about 160 percent. Experts predicted
the price would continue to rise and reach a record high this
winter or next spring.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Determined to Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government Monday
vowed to bring the AIDS epidemic under control in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Acting Director-General
of the AIDS Commission (UAC) John Rwomushana said that his
organization would intensify the combat against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's achievements in AIDS prevention and control have been
 recognized internationally. It is the only country in sub-Saharan
Africa where the HIV infection rate is decreasing.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda has achieved a lot in this field. This is mainly due
to political involvement, government support as well as proper
legislation," the UAC chief said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that scientific research and vaccine development
also contributed to Uganda's exemplary performance in its national
fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the few countries in the world where AIDS was
first found and registered. The national HIV infection rate had
shot up to more than 30 percent five years ago and was brought
down to some 12 percent now.
</P>
<P>
Currently Uganda is estimated to have 1.8 million HIV-positive
people and some 600,000 people have died of AIDS since the first
case was recorded in the country in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The government official said that some good and affordable
anti-AIDS drugs would be available in the market early next year
and this would reduce the mother-to-child transmission by nearly
50 percent.

<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has
begun destroying more than 200,000 pigs to contain the outbreak of
the African swine fever in the country, according to a Panafrican
News Agency report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A source of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture described the
outbreak of the disease as a "national disaster", saying that the
government launched the safeguard measure at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tema and Ashaiman in the Greater Accra and the Awutu Bawjiase
area in the central region are the worst affected, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian government banned the slaughtering, sale and
movement of pigs in and out of the two regions in October last
year following the outbreak of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Proposes To Retain Executive President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Constitutional
Commission has proposed that the country should retain an
executive president who appoints a prime minister to assist him or
her.
</P>
<P>
According to the final draft of the constitution presented to
President Robert Mugabe on Monday, the prime minister would be
appointed by the president of the majority party in the national
assembly.
</P>
<P>
The executive shall be made up of the president, the prime
minister and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The president should be at least 40 years old, and his or her
term of office shall be a five-year period and for not more than
two terms.
</P>
<P>
The senate, as proposed in the constitution, can impeach and
remove the president from office for treason or wild violation of
the constitution, serious misconduct and inability to exercise the
functions of the office because of physical or mental incapacity.
</P>
<P>
However, a resolution to remove the president from office must
be passed by at least two-thirds of all the 60 members of the
senate.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the prime minister's functions
include directing the operations of the government and conducting
the government business in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister can be removed following a vote of no
confidence in the government passed by the national assembly and
when his or her party no longer holds the majority number of seats
in the national assembly.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Calls for Arab Economic Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Monday called for the establishment of an
all-out Arab economic, banking and monetary strategy to counter
world challenges.
</P>
<P>
Addressing ninth annual conference of the Arab Academy for
Banking and Financial Sciences, Abdel-Meguid said an investment
data base should be set up to follow up the regions and fields of
Arab investments.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum also underlined the
necessity to develop the Arab money markets as a channel to
attract investments.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also stressed the importance of encouraging
inter-Arab investment, which he said stood at 2.3 billion U.S.
dollars out of the total 128.8-billion-dollar Arab investments in
1998.
</P>
<P>
He is critical of Arab investments in foreign countries, as
Arab states have deposited 700 billion dollars in banks abroad
besides billions of dollars of investments.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting also discusses ways to increase inter-Arab
trade. Mostafa Hodeib, chairman of the Arab Banking Academy, said
non-oil inter-Arab trade stands at 11 percent of the total foreign
trade of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Arab trade is slim, compared with inter-European Union
trade, which reaches 60 percent, and inter-Asian trade of 40
percent, Hodeib added.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Arab countries to make joint efforts to raise
inter-Arab trade in a bid to promote the economic development and
upgrade people's living standards in the Arab world.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 29 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)'s Middle
East peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos arrived here Monday night
on a two-day visit to assess prospects for reviving peace talks on
the Lebanese and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat is scheduled to meet Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Tuesday as well as
ambassadors from European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos visited Syria and Jordan last week for the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The EU "is generally understanding the call by Lebanon and
Syria that Israel's pullout from the south be within the
framework of an agreement," a diplomatic source in Beirut said.
</P>
<P>
"Knowing very well that its mediation in the peace talks
is only complementary to that of the United States, the EU
seeks to support Washington's efforts to avoid a unilateral
withdrawal that may lead to military confrontations in the
south," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has repeatedly pledged to
withdraw his troops by July 2000 from south Lebanon, but didn't
say what he would do in the case of no agreement with Lebanon and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been opposed to an Israeli withdrawal only from
its south, hoping a similar one from the Golan Heights of Syria,
a undisputed power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied part of Lebanon since 1978 and set up
a self-declared security zone in the south with the claimed
aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
It captured Syria's strategic plateau of Golan Heights in the
1967 Mideast war.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 29 (Xinhua)-- Chilean President Eduardo
Frei and his Peruvian counterpart Alberto Fujimori signed Monday
here a joint statement for promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who arrived Monday to Santiago, is the first Peruvian
president to visit Chile following the break out of the Pacific
war in 1879 between both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed their will for the opening of
promissory stages of cooperation and integration between both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders considered that the recent signing of the Act of
Completion of all matters pending of the 1929 Lima Treaty bear
profound significance.
</P>
<P>
The presidents supported the intensifying of political,
cultural and economic ties with the region of the Pacific Basin,
whereby they agreed to promote cooperation between both nations.
</P>
<P>
Frei and Fujimori proposed joint action to encourage a rapid
free trade of the Pacific Basin in the context of both country's
participation in different Asia-pacific forums.
</P>

The leaders expressed their most energetic rejection of the
extraterritorial application of foreign national legislation as
these are incompatible with the principle of the sovereign
equality of States and non intervention.
</P>
<P>
Both heads of State reaffirmed their condemning all kinds of
terrorism.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Monday called for the first time for the use of condoms as a
way of controlling AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of AIDS has reached alarming proportions and must
not be treated casually; in today's world, condoms are a must," he
said at the University of Nairobi where he awarded degrees and
diplomas to 2,572 graduates.
</P>
<P>
The current upsurge in sexually-transmitted diseases requires
all means to combat, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
It is observed that the president's advocacy of condoms in the
fight against AIDS has drawn strong opposition from the Catholic
church.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop John Njenga of Mombasa said Monday that condoms were
out of the question for Catholics and the Catholic church still
insisted on abstinence for the unmarried and fidelity among
married couples.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Moi declared AIDS a national disaster and
ordered the immediate setting up of a national council to fight
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
He also directed schools and colleges to begin offering special
lessons starting from next January to prepare children for the
threat of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The deadly disease has killed 760,000 people in Kenya and a
further 1.9 million Kenyans have been infected with the disease,
according to Kenya's Health Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on Security Council to Renew Commitment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday called on the members of the Security Council
and the international community as a whole to renew commitment to
"effective prevention" of armed conflicts in the world.
</P>
<P>
Opening a debate on the Security Council's role in the
prevention of armed conflicts, Annan said, "Our efforts, however,
will fall short unless they are complemented by a renewed
commitment to effective prevention on the part of this Council and
of all Member States."
</P>
<P>
"Since becoming Secretary-General, I have made a priority of my
work: preventing armed conflict," which is "one of the greatest
challenges facing the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that prevention is one of the main tasks of this
Organization," he said. "And yet, far too often, we find ourselves
dealing with the effects of conflict rather than its roots."
</P>
<P>
"The case for prevention hardly needs re-starting," he said. "
Quite simply, it is cost effective, in financial as well as human
terms."
</P>
<P>
"Most people now recognize this, as a general proposition," he
said. "But in a particular case, cogent arguments for refusing or
delaying preventive action can always be found."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Annan have tried to strengthen our
capacity for preventive diplomacy, preventive disarmament,
preventive deployment and both pre-conflict and post-conflict
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we are seeking to improve our early warning and
analysis capabilities; improve co-ordination between the different
departments, funds and agencies; and intensify our co-operation
with governments as well as with regional organizations and NGOs(
non-governmental organizations)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. chief recommended that the 15-nation
Security Council take necessary steps in the field, including a
greater use of fact-finding missions at much earlier stages of a
dispute, and encouraging States which become aware of potential
conflict within or among their neighbors to bring the issue
promptly to the Council's attention.
</P>
<P>
The proposed steps also cover giving urgent attention to the
problems of States which suffer acute economic, environmental and
security strains, establishing an informal working group, or
subsidiary organ, to study early warning and prevention issues and
report back, instituting regular meetings on prevention, at which
the Council would identify areas that require urgent preventive
action, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations needs to address the issue of resources,"
he said. "Although cost-effective, preventive action is not cost
free, yet regrettably there is an endemic paucity of resources for
it."
</P>
<P>
"In the longer term it is even more important to address the
deep-rooted causes of conflicts, which often lie in the social and
economic sphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty, repressive and undemocratic government, endemic
underdevelopment, weak or non-existent institutions, political and
economic discrimination between ethnic or religious communities:
these are the long-term causes of many conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of each and every Member State to
prevent conflict by practicing good governance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Effective action would often require joint action by many
different organs and agencies, just as it requires joint action by
different government departments within Member States," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began the open debate on the Council's
role in the prevention of armed conflicts, during which
representatives of 36 countries, including China, took the floor
on the prevention of armed conflict.

<HEADLINE> Draft Document on Lesotho's Elections Ratified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The draft was discussed during day-long talks between Southern
African Development Community (SADC) delegations from Botswana,
Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe as well as representatives
of 12 political parties which constituted the interim political
authority (IPA), South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
An institution was established in November last year to
facilitate the holding of fresh elections in Lesotho within 18
months.
</P>
<P>
This was in the wake of the non-recognition of the may 23, 1998
election results by the opposition alliance, which resulted in
political rioting and looting in Maseru and two other lowland
towns in September last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao was quoted as saying
at the end of the meeting that the discussions were "very frank
and very open, and displayed continuous learning from each other's
experience."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the agreement would pave the way for
the holding of new general elections in Lesotho next year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reached consensus on the final draft of the
agreement which would be signed in Maseru next Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Lesotho government, political leaders,
chairman of the SADC and "hopefully representatives of the
commonwealth and the United Nations and probably representatives
of the Organization of African Unity" would sign the agreement,
simao said.

<P>
BONN, November 29 (Xinhua)-- A German court in Dueselldorff
Monday ruled former Serb paramilitary leader Maxim Sokolovic to
nine years in jail on charges of genocide relating to the war in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Sokolovic, a 59-year-old miner resident in Germany, was
sentenced "guilty of taking part in a campaign of genocide and
expulsions."
</P>
<P>
He was cleared German prosecutors' charges of murder because of
contradictory testimony.
</P>
<P>
Skolovic was the leader of a group of Serb paramilitary in 1992.
Prosecutors said his troop had brutally mistreated five Moslem
prisoners in his home town of Osmaci.
</P>
<P>
After Sokolovic was sentenced, German prosecutors who had
called for a life sentence said they would consider whether to
appeal. Skolovic denied all the allegations against him.

<HEADLINE> Advance Team of U.N. Peacekeeping Force Arrives in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- An advance team of the United
Nations peace-keeping force arrived in Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown Monday to kick off a large-scale operation in the war
battered West African country.
</P>
<P>
The team, which included nine Kenyan staff officers and
administrators in civilian clothes, arrived at Lungi airport by a
U.N. plane from Nairobi and were transported by helicopter across
the bay to the capital Freetown, according to information reaching
here on Monday from Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The flying in of the first unit of peacekeeping soldiers,
originally expected on Monday, was delayed due to logistical
reasons, U.N. officials said in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 peacekeepers are scheduled to arrive from Kenya,
India and elsewhere over the next few weeks, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by some 3,000 soldiers converted from the
Nigeria- led West African Peace-keeping force or ECOMOG, which has
been policing the Sierra Leone's peace since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The former ECOMOG soldiers will remain in charge of security in
the West African nation, while the newcomers will focus more on
monitoring adherence to the cease-fire agreement signed on July 7
by the government and rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 250 unarmed U.N. military observers already
deployed in Sierra Leone will monitor the disarmament centers, aid
distribution and military operations.
</P>
<P>
Indian Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley will head the
6,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force, the U.N. said in New York on
Monday, adding that he will take up his duties next week.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voted unanimously on October 22 to
establish the Mission in Sierra Leone to help implement a July
peace accord aimed at ending a brutal eight-year civil war in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The accord pardoned all former rebels in the country and
included their representatives into a unity government in exchange
for their handing out of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the civil war and
half of the country's five million population were displaced.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Carry Out More Active Role: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso said here Monday that his country should
carry out a more active and important role in the new world order.
</P>
<P>
During a talk on globalization at Brazil's Superior School of
War (ESG) of Navy School in Rio de Janerro, Cardoso criticized the
submission to market rules of western powers.
</P>
<P>
The President stressed as unacceptable the fact that a country
like Brazil, with the fifth largest territory in the world, with a
seventh world economy and one of the biggest populations in the
world is but a spectator of the new international order.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept the situation of victims. We are also actors,
with a right to build a new world, with the efforts of all Brazil'
s society and our armed forces", said President Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also attributed the devaluing of the real, Brazil's
currency, to the external crisis.
</P>
<P>
The President said that Brazil was forced to devalue its
currency, due to Russia's financial crisis in the second half of
1998..
</P>
<P>
The government began the "plan real" in 1994 for keeping the
real's value, but under the adverse effect of Russia's financial
crisis, Brazil lost 22 billion dollars of financial reserves only
in September last year.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Importance in Cooperation Between Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China said Monday that
the U.N. Security Council should recognize the important roles of
the various regional organizations in the prevention of armed
conflicts, but such a cooperation should be based on the purposes
and principles of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the
Security Council in an open debate on the role of the 15-nation
Council in the prevention of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council should recognized the important roles
that can be played by the various regional organizations and
cooperate more closely with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation, however, must be based on the adherence by
regional organizations to the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter and stipulations of Chapter VIII," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the guidance and monitoring of the U.N., regional
organizations will be able to win the cooperation of the world
body and even broader support from the international community,
thus playing a constructive role in preventive diplomacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began the open debate at 3:00 p.m. EST,
and representatives of more than 20 countries have inscribed to
speak on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Should Have Major Responsibility in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- China Monday said that
the U.N. Security Council should bear major responsibility in
preventing armed conflicts in the world because the body, under
the U.N. Charter, shoulders the primary responsibility in
maintaining international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
debate of the Security Council on the council's role in the
prevention of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Now with prevention of armed conflicts becoming an important
means of settling disputes peacefully, it is only natural that the
Security Council should bear major responsibilities in this area,"
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
However, "there seem to be a tendency in the work of the
council nowadays of putting much emphasis on intervention while
neglecting effective prevention," he said. "All too often, there
is heated debate on intervention and even invocation of Chapter
VII of the Charter, while neither the issue of prevention nor
serious study into the root cause of conflicts is given adequate
attention."
</P>
<P>
"There are various kinds of measures that can be taken to
prevent armed conflicts, but there is one general principle all of
them must abide by, that is, actions must be taken in accordance
with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we look back at the history of U.N. involvement in settling
regional conflict, we can very easily see that success has always
been the natural result of adherence to the Charter while
contravention of Charter principles would only lead to failure and
setback," he said. "This is the case in settling regional conflict
and it is also true with armed conflict prevention."
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of the ultimate goal of preventive
diplomacy, actions by the council should all be aimed at resolving
conflict peacefully instead of exacerbating the conflict or
touching off new ones," he said. "We are pleased to see that in
this connection the council has taken a series of positive
measures."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has sent facts-finding missions to
conflict regions, held more open debates on specific issues and
continued to put Article 99 of the U.N. Charter into practice in
encouraging the U.N. secretary-general to play his due role.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation maintains that all preventive measures
should only be taken under the prerequisite of respect for the
political independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
all countries and the will of the government and people of the
country concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of non-interference in internal affairs is the
primary principle guiding U.N. actions in conflict prevention," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential to obtain the prior consent of the country or
parties concerned on issues involving the country's sovereignty
such as setting up early warning systems or sending facts-finding
missions and other special missions," he said. "Before any major
decisions are to be made, the Security Council must listen to the
views of all sides in a neutral and fair manner."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his September report on
the work of the Organization submitted to the 54th General
Assembly session, said, "If the primacy of the Security Council
with respect to the maintenance of international peace and
security is rejected, the very foundations of international law as
represented by the Charter will be brought into question. No other
universally accepted legal basis for constraining wanton acts of
violence exists."
</P>
<P>
Annan also stressed that "conflict prevention, peacekeeping and
peacemaking must not become an area of competition between the
United Nations and regional organizations."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation fully agrees with the secretary-general
in these points," Qin said. "We believe that any attempt to
replace the council in its leading role in conflict prevention is
tantamount to replacing the council in its primary role of
maintaining peace and security."
</P>
<P>
"Such attempt would not only weaken the authority of the
council but also end up severely damaging the effectiveness of
conflict prevention measures, or even leading to the breaking out
or escalation of conflicts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the council also has its limits," he said. "It is
not a panacea."
</P>
<P>
"As is known to all, the root cause of the conflicts is the
unreasonable old international political and economic order," he
said. "Changes to this situation would only be realized by
concerted efforts by the council, the whole U.N. system and the
entire international community."
</P>
<P>
The international community should be soberly aware that
although conflict prevention does not look as glorious as conflict
resolution, the input needed in successful conflict prevention is
even more immeasurable, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations should demonstrate strong political
commitment and allocate adequate resources to ensure successful
implementation of preventive measures," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Old Int'l Order as Major Cause of Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qin told an open debate at the Security Council, "For too long,
the unreasonable international political and economic order has
seriously hindered the economic development and social progress of
developing countries, putting them at a disadvantageous position
in the new globalization wave."
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years between 1989 and 1999 alone, there have been
more than 100 armed conflicts in the world, the majority of which
occurred in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is no coincidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is undoubtedly the major cause of the turbulence and
frequent conflicts in some developing countries," he said. "
Therefore, to prevent armed conflicts from occurring in the first
place, we must take a long-term perspective and take meaningful
steps to help developing countries in their economic development."
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, preventive measures would only cure the symptom
rather than eradicate the root cause and there would only be one
passive reaction after another," he said. "Thus, promotion of
economic growth of developing countries is of important practical
relevance in preventing armed conflicts."
</P>
<P>
"Peace in different regions of the world is an indivisible and
related whole," he said. "In deliberating the issue of armed
conflict prevention, the council should treat all regions in the
world equally, especially Africa."
</P>
<P>
"There should be no preferential treatment to one and neglect
of another," he said. "The tendency in the U.N. of playing only
lip service to Africa should be reversed. The U.N. must put more
human and financial resources to preventive diplomacy in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began an open debate on its role in the
prevention of armed conflicts Monday afternoon. The Security
Council, under the U.N. Charter, has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of peace and security in the world at large.

<HEADLINE> America's Children Threatened by Teen Pregnancy, Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- America's children are
facing main threats such as teen pregnancy, child abuse and a lack
of health care at the turn of the new millennium, a report issued
by child advocates said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report also listed poverty, absent parents, crime,
environmental dangers, inadequate child care, dangerous forays
into sex and drugs and poor schools as the other main threats.
</P>
<P>
"America's future is clouded by significant risks confronting
our children today," Clarence Anthony, president of the National
League of Cities and mayor of South Bay, Florida, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
The study was completed jointly by the National School Boards
Association, the National League of Cities, Joe DiMaggio Children'
s Hospital, Youth Crime Watch of America and the National
Association of Child Advocates.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 14.5 million American children, nearly
one in five, experience poverty.
</P>
<P>
During 1997, 3.2 million children were reported to authorities
as abused and neglected.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1996, more than 75,000 American children and
teens were killed and an additional 375,000 wounded by firearms,
more deaths and casualties than American troops suffered during
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 11.1 million children younger than 18 had no health
insurance. And each year, 3 million American teens are infected
with AIDS, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday signed a 390-billion-U.S.-dollar budget package which
provided money for more teachers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to sign a bill that I believe will give us a
stronger, better America for the 21st century," Clinton said at
the signing ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House.
</P>
<P>
He spoke with uniformed police and about a dozen teachers
behind him on the dais.
</P>
<P>
"We value education and this budget truly puts education first,
continuing our commitment to hire 100,000 highly qualified
teachers to lower class size in the early grades," Clinton said.
Funds to put more cops on the street "will make America a safer
place," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The omnibus spending bill also included money to pay U.N. dues
and protect more sensitive lands from development. But Clinton
failed to win support for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare
or changes to shore up the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
The measure also included language that would allow direct food
aid to rebels fighting against the Sudanese government. Clinton
has not made a decision on the food aid, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says "Worried" over Russian Campaign on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that it was "worried" over Russia's campaign against
terrorism in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russia has said that its military action in breakaway Chechnya
is a broad campaign against criminals and terrorists, but U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the United States
was worried about what he called "indiscriminate damage."
</P>
<P>
"We are all deeply and profoundly troubled by what is going on
in Chechnya," Rubin told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
And he said Secretary of State Madeleine and Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov would hold telephone talks and the issue on
Chechnya would be a topic of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Republicans, including leading presidential contender
George W. Bush, have urged the International Monetary Fund to halt
its loans to Russia unless Moscow stops its campaign against
terrorism and splitism
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus has said that the fund
could not pay if member countries did not want the loan to go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the IMF's largest single shareholder, has a
major influence on the actions of the IMF executive board and if
it impose pressure to delay a payment to Russia the IMF would be
possible to take some action.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin sidestepped the issue of whether the United States
would make any effort to force the IMF to delay new money to
Russia because of its fighting against breakaway of Chechnya, only
saying Russia still had to meet economic conditions for IMF cash.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved a $4.5 billion loan to Russia last July, and a
$640 million installment from the loan is already overdue and
Russian officials have urged the IMF not to bow to political
pressure.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha
volcano, 10 kilometers west of Quito, registered Monday a burst
with the subsequent expulsion of gas and ashes.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which occurred at 13:30 local time, was stronger
than that of last Thursday and the emitting of volcanic material
was less prolonged, said Quito Mayor Roque Sevilla.
</P>
<P>
The wind dragged the ashes north and east and later toward the
south of the volcano's crater, he added.
</P>
<P>
The mayor considered it possible that the ashes do not fall
upon the city this time.
</P>
<P>
Quito sits in what locals call "volcano alley" -- a ring of
nine active volcanoes which surround the city cradled in a 2,881
meter-high valley in the Andes mountains.
</P>
<P>
Guagua Pichincha, or "baby Pichincha" in the Quechua Indian
language, is one of those volcanoes and has been rumbling since
September. It has shut the airport six times since then.
</P>
<P>
The volcano belched out a massive mushroom cloud of steam and
smoke in early October.
</P>
<P>
Schools and airport of Ecuador's capital city were shut Friday
due to the explosion of the volcano on the previous day.

TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday refuted an allegation that
Iranian military advisors are on a business delegation to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that the allegation made by Colombian Defense
Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna was "astonishing," the

</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian companies had invested in Colombia to
install and operate a factory for manufacturing cold storage
hardware upon the request of the Colombian side.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation program will help strengthen economic
relations between the two countries in the interests of both, the
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramirez charged on Saturday that there was possibility
of the presence of Iranian military advisors among experts who
have gone to southern Colombian for installing cold storage
facilities.
</P>
<P>
A rebel group affiliated to the Revolutionary Army of Columbia
in southern Columbia is currently fighting against the Colombian

<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- In the first nine months, the
sales of China's farm vehicles and large and medium-sized tractors
witnessed steady growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Agricultural Machinery Circulation
Association indicate that from January to September, the number of
farm vehicles sold jumped 9.1 percent over the same period last
year to 112,651, while the number of large and medium-sized
tractors rose 5.5 percent to 51,229.
</P>
<P>
An official of the association predicts that the country's
demand for large and medium-sized tractors will continue to grow,
especially the tractors above 73.5 kilowatts, as China is stepping
up construction of agricultural infrastructure and flood-control
facilities.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months, the number of combines sold
dropped 1.8 percent to 35,182, however, the market still looks
promising as more farmers are eager to use modern equipment, the
official said.

<P>
ANKARA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey has ruled out any tradeoff between its position on
the Aegean and Cyprus issues and the European Union's declaring it
a candidate member. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit made it clear on
Monday, declaring that Turkey would never enter into such
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on what Turkey's attitude would be as
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou threatened to veto the
Turkish candidacy if Greece's expectations were not met at the
EU's Helsinki Summit, Ecevit said that it was EU's business to
decide how to resist Greek pressures or how to please Athens.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that it was out of the question for
Turkey to compromise on national issues such as the Aegean
problems with Greece or the Cyprus issue for the sake of being
declared a candidate for EU accession.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- France, known as the closest country to the understanding of
Turkey, has shifted from its policies towards the EU membership of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
France announced that the priority is the admission of a united
Cyprus to EU, but the membership of the island to EU can not be
hindered if the problems in the island were not solved at that
time.
</P>
<P>
The policy change of France came to surface after its EU
Affairs Minister Pierre Moskovici held contacts in Istanbul and
Athens. He said that when the day of admittance of Cyprus into EU
come, France will look at the stand taken by both sides and will
decide who has blocked the process (of unification). "That is to
say, the political situation of that time will be assessed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- State Minister in charge of human rights Mehmet Ali
Irtemcelik declared that he opposes Ocalan's execution. He said
Ocalan had caused great damages and big misery, but his existence
will be beneficial for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision of the European Court of Human Rights will
not be given before two years if the court accepts to see the
case.
</P>
<P>
"It is important from which point of view one looks at the
issue. Will we concentrate on Ocalan or the necessities of being
a member of the EU? We have certain international obligations,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> University Teachers to Become High Earners (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- University teachers are most
likely to become the new idols of China's younger generation, not
only for their analytical thinking skills and the technology they
have access to, but also because they'll be earning more money
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Teachers in China, historically underpaid, have been regarded
as "candles" that selflessly burn themselves down for the
enlightenment of their students.
</P>
<P>
However, a newly-published reform package initiated by the
Chinese Ministry of Education will change this imbalance between
output and income.
</P>
<P>
The reform package is aimed at rejuvenating China's education
and upgrading the overall quality of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Chen Zhili has vowed to raise the quality,
salary and status of China's vast legion of teachers, setting
teaching as the most respected and admired job in society.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Chinese government will give 1.8 billion yuan
(220 million U.S. dollars) to prestigious Qinghua University and
Beijing University, respectively, in a fresh move to make them two
of the best schools in the world.
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the money will go to raise the salary and
allowances of teachers in the two Beijing-based universities.
</P>
<P>
Starting this month, Qinghua University will give special
allowances to all its teachers and staff. And some 100 outstanding
scholars of the university will receive a yearly allowance of up
to 50,000 yuan. This, combined with the base salaries, will give
them an average yearly wage of 70,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In China's largest industrial and commercial city of Shanghai,
the ministry and local government have decided to use one third of
the 1.2 billion yuan that is allocated to Fudan University there
to raise teachers' wages.
</P>
<P>
The well-known Shanghai Jiaotong University has promised to
give each of its "master-level" professors 200,000 yuan in
allowances each year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Beijing-based People's University and Beijing Normal
University, and Jinan University in Guangdong are all drafting new
incentive plans for their staffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's predicted that in the near future, China will boast a
large number of university teachers whose salaries and allowances
amount to well over 50,000 yuan per teacher annually.
</P>
<P>
For ordinary Chinese, 50,000 yuan a year is no small sum. A
nationwide poll conducted early this year shows that the average
yearly income of a Chinese household stands at 11,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Professors in China were once the envy of society. Famous
university professors were big earners, with their yearly income
dozens of times that of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
Recent survey results indicate that the present average monthly
salary of Beijing teachers in various kinds of schools is 1,320
yuan, compared with more than 2,340 yuan which is the highest per-
capita income of certain other trades covered by the survey; and
31 percent of university teachers have considered switching to
other professions.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenshen, assistant president of Beijing University,
stressed that the teachers at his school have made enormous
contributions to society, yet their salaries are quite low.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers are also facing the impact of the market economy,"
Chen noted, saying that raising salaries for teachers will play an
important role in stabilizing and attracting advanced talent.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, 200,000 of China's academics have gone
overseas for advanced education, yet only 70,000 of them have
returned to China.
</P>
<P>
A third of the top graduates from the physics department of
Beijing University opt to study abroad every year, with more than
500 going to the United States.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is taking legal
action to recover debts from Eritreans who have left the country
as a result of the border conflict between the neighboring
countries, the Monitor newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Haile Kiros claimed that hundreds of
Eritrean businessmen owed tens of thousands of U.S. dollars in
outstanding bank loans or unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has no option other than to take legal
action against the Eritrean defaulters as their agents in Ethiopia
failed to clear their debts, Haile said.
</P>
<P>
Haile did not elaborate what action will government take.
</P>
<P>
A border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in May
1998. The two sides have been accusing each other for confiscating

from December 20, 1999 when it resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao, grant, in principle, continued visa-exemption
treatment to those persons of other countries or regions traveling

Administrative Region may apply immigration controls on entry into,
stay in and departure from the Region by persons from foreign
states or regions", a list of the countries and regions to enjoy
visa-exemption treatment and the specific measures concerning the
visa application by persons from countries or regions which are
not granted visa-exemption status shall be decided and announced
by the Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region.

<P>
In recent interviews with Xinhua, the majority of university
students expressed strong support for raising teachers' incomes
substantially.
</P>
<P>
A postgraduate at Qinghua University said that his tutor spent
over 12 hours a day on teaching and scientific research. "Several
thousand yuan is too little for his heavy workload," he complained.
</P>
<P>
In raising the overall incomes for the teachers, the Ministry
of Education stressed that incomes should be directly linked with
their duties and performance, and those who do better work should
be entitled to more money.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the ministry will clamp down on inferior
teachers, making it difficult for them to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
For the next two or three years, all the teachers at higher
education institutions in China will be either appointed or under
contract. The ministry has also unveiled a long-term plan, under
which the ratio of university teachers to students should reach
the world level of 1:14.
</P>
<P>
This will mean a heavier workload for the majority of Chinese
university teachers, said a ministry official.

<HEADLINE> Scholar On Macao's Irreplaceable Cultural Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Macao hopes that it will
become irreplaceable in terms of its cultural importance after its
return to the motherland, Chinese scholar Yang Kuanghan wrote in a
recent article.
</P>
<P>
Yang said in the article, published in the Graduate School
Transaction of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, that the
future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China will
have close connections with both the world and the country's
interior areas, and thus can help bridge the western and oriental
cultures.
</P>
<P>
"Macao should be a growth pole for various new cultural and
artistic ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to social and economic prosperity, he said, Macao
should also try to make cultural development one of its major
goals.
</P>
<P>
In order to do so, the scholar suggested, Macao should
significantly improve its cultural facilities, further enhance
cultural exchanges with the interior of China and the world, and
give more priority to the development of art and literature after
the return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
More researches should be done on the culture of native-born
Portuguese who will continue to be Macao's citizens after Macao's
return to the motherland, Yang said, adding that their traditions
will become part of the culture of the entire Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Advance Team of U.N. Peace-keepers Arrives in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- An advance team of the United
Nations peace-keeping force arrived in Sierra Leonean Monday,
kicking off a large- scale U.N. operation to safeguard a fragile
peace in the war-battered west African country, information from
Freetown said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The team including nine Kenyan staff officers, administrators
in civilian clothes, arrived at Lungi airport by a U.N. plane from
Kenyan capital Nairobi and were transported by helicopter across
the bay to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The flying-in of the first unit of peace-keeping troops,
originally expected Monday, was delayed due to logistical reasons,
U.N. officials said in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 peace-keepers are scheduled to arrive from Kenya,
India and elsewhere over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
They will join some 3,000 soldiers converted from the
Nigeria-led west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG which has been
policing the Sierra Leone' s peace since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The former ECOMOG soldiers will remain in charge of security in
Sierra Leone, while the newcomers will focus more on monitoring
adherence to the cease-fire agreement signed in Togolese capital
Lome on July 7 this year by the government and rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 250 unarmed U.N. military observers already
deployed in Sierra Leone will monitor disarmament, aid
distribution and military operations.
</P>
<P>
Indian Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley will head the
6,000-member U.N. peace-keeping force, U.N. officials said in New
York Monday. Jetley will take up his duties next week.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on October 22 to
establish the mission in Sierra Leone to help implement a July
peace accord aimed at ending the brutal civil war in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The accord pardons all former rebels and includes their
representatives into a unity government in exchange for their
handing out weapons.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year civil war had killed tens of thousands of
civilians and turned half of the country's five million population
into refugees.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP Predicted to Increase in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 30 (Xinhua)-- The National Bureau of
Statistic (BPS) predicted Tuesday that Indonesia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita this year would increase to 5.4 million
rupiah (771 U.S. dollars) from 4.6 million rupiah (657 U.S
dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, per capita Gross National Product (GNP) was expected
to reach 5.03 million rupiah (718 U.S. dollars) from 4.2 million
rupiah (600 U.S dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economy has recovered since early this year from
the monetary crisis that started in mid-1997. In 1998, the
country's economic growth was contract around 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of BPS Sugito Suwito told parliament that in 1999 GNP
would still be lower than GDP because of lake of national
productivity and the weakening rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Besides there are still huge of net transfer incomes conducted
by foreign investors. The transfer, however, influences our GNP
figure," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Suwito was confident that Indonesia's GNP figure could be
higher than its GDP if the country's conglomerates which invested
abroad transfer their incomes back home.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Indonesian Minister of Trade and Industry Yusuf
Kalla predicted that Indonesia's economy would grow by 4 percent
in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Namibian General Elections Kick off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANESBURG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma cast his vote in Windhoek Tuesday kicking off the general
and presidential elections in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said he was confident of victory for his ruling South
West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has been in power
since winning an armed struggle for independence from South Africa
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"Now we need to work harder, to tighten our belt and the future
of Namibia is certainly bright. I see a bright future for all
Namibians," Nujoma told reporters as he voted at Suiderhof in
Windhoek South constituency shortly after polling opened at 7:00
a.m. (5:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"We are a small population occupying a huge country the size of
France and Germany put together," said the 70-year-old struggle
veteran, seeking a third term as president.
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to do now is train and educate our people
in order to effectively eradicate poverty from the face of Namibia
and create a happier Namibian nation," Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
Long queues had formed since early morning outside many polling
stations in the capital Windhoek, particularly in the black
township of Katitura, a traditional SWAPO stronghold.
</P>
<P>
As many as 500 people had gathered outside some stations up to
two hours before they opened. Some voters told reporters they had
arrived as early as midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who arrived in a motorcade of around a dozen cars,
escorted by motorcycle outriders and two army vehicles carrying
troops, was accompanied by his wife Kovambo Theopoldine
Kat-Jimune.
</P>
<P>
They waited outside the station afterwards for his frail
mother, Helvi Kondombolo, who observers said is over 100 years
old, to finish casting her ballot.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said he was "sure it will be a free and fair election"
as Namibians are "politically mature."
</P>
<P>
"We know precisely what we want and how to get it," the
incumbent president added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Urges S. Africa to Extradite Mengistu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has urged South
Africa to extradite former Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam,
the Monitor newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the government of South Africa to extradite
Mengistu to Ethiopia so that he can stand trial for the genocide
and gross human rights violation he committed," the government
spokesman Haile Kiros was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe just before his government was
overthrown on May 28, 1991. He travelled to South Africa to
receive medical treatment earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu's government has been blamed for the death of hundreds
of thousands civilians during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has
been demanding that Mengistu be brought to stand trial for human
rights atrocities during his period of rule.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Mengistu include the killing of 1,823
identified victims, bodily harm to 99 identified victims and the
enforced disappearance of 194 others.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia currently has no extradition treaty with South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Open New Millennium Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada will switch on the giant Parol (lantern), or the Milenyo
(millennium) Filipino marker, at the Rizal Park in Manila on
Wednesday to open the Philippine celebration to welcome the year
2000 and the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta of the Department of Tourism, who
chairs the Committee on the Turn-of-the-Century Celebration, said
Tuesday that the president will light the 30-foot (9.14 meters)
tall Milenyo Filipino marker that symbolizes hope and joy in the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The schedule of Milenyo activities was firmed up during a
recent meeting of the Turn-of-the-Century Committee, which is part
of the Presidential Commission on the New Century and the
Millennium, said Araneta.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada established the New Century Commission to
plan and oversee all activities aimed at greeting the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said a brass band exhibition, scheduled Wednesday, will
precede the ceremonial lighting of the Parol marker.
</P>
<P>
A dance company will do an interpretation of the Aliwag, a rich
and colorful Filipino tradition of conveying good wishes at the
ceremony, said Araneta, adding that the company will also
entertain the crowd with their renditions of Philippine tribal
rituals.
</P>
<P>
According to Araneta, before the president delivers his
message, a festival of lanterns will be held and a fireworks
display will follow the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
Araneta also said the Turn-of-the-Century Committee is
finalizing details of the week-long Milenyo Filipino activities
that will start on December 26 and culminate in the millennium
countdown at the Rizal Park on the New Year's Eve.

<HEADLINE> Housing Industry Continues to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's housing industry
continued a downward trend in October, with the real estate index
dipping by 0.05 points over September and 2.74 points over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS), the drop was due to diminishing growth of the
total area of land development, newly-started housing construction
and investment in real estate development.
</P>
<P>
However, prices of houses and apartments in October registered
the largest monthly rise in the past four months. The housing
price index increased by 0.99 points over September to 91.92
points.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the area of newly-completed houses and
apartments increased markedly in October, pushing up the total
area of completed houses to 74.46 million square meters for the
first ten months of the year.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Net Service Price War Heated in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's internet service
providers (ISP) have had a rough ride over the last few months,
after a cut-throat price war began in September.
</P>
<P>
The price war began when Banque Audi, the country's leading
bank, acquired part of Inconet, a key ISP in Lebanon, and started
offering "free" internet access to anyone who opened a Net Account.
</P>
<P>
Audi's Net Account is not exactly free. Clients pay an account
maintenance fee of 10,000 Lebanese pounds (about 6.66 U.S.
dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
Cyberia, the largest player with almost 40,000 subscribers,
responded by slashing the price on unlimited access from 29
dollars a month to 12.99 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ISP pack soon followed suit, dropping rates on unlimited
access to levels as low as 9.99 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Two months later the dust has begun to settle, but not without
leaving some casualties.
</P>
<P>
A few smaller ISPs, including Inter, Bridge and Magnarama,
have reportedly been forced out of business, while most of the
remaining ISPs have to tighten their belts and wait to see who
will sink and who will sail on.
</P>
<P>
"You just put in your money and hold your breath," said Sam
Lutfallah, executive director of Inconet.
</P>
<P>
His company's partnership with Banque Audi angered many in the
business who feel banks should stick to banking and ISPs to the
internet.
</P>
<P>
"If Banque Audi was offering a free service, then I think
there is a legal issue that needs to be addressed," said Abude
Omari of Cyberia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the deal started a trend as other ISPs are
teaming up with banks.
</P>
<P>
Byblos Bank, the country's another powerful financial
institution, has aligned itself with Data Management, while
Credit Libanais struck a partnership deal with Terranet and Data
Management.
</P>
<P>
In a desperate battle to win new customers and greater market
base, ISPs have also begun diversifying their products and
services so as not to rely exclusively on the volatile dial-up
market.
</P>
<P>
Some offer extra services such as internet roaming, internet
faxing and web design services, except internet calls, which are
currently banned by the Communication Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The cash-strapped Lebanese government has been worrying that
the revenues generated from its monopolized international phone
calls will be grabbed by the cheaper online phone service.
</P>
<P>
Data Management recently announced that it was going into the
net commerce business with Credit Libanais.
</P>
<P>
Terranet and Inconet said they have plans to do the same
within the next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough times, most ISPs say that they intend to
remain in the game.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, we see tremendous potential. That's what
keeps us in the business," said Suheil Zurub, general manager of
Terranet.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, there are some 20 ISPs and 60,000 to 100,000
internet users, the highest per capita in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Bans Corporal Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka High Court has
banned all forms of corporal punishment and declared null and void
all provisions in the constitution which provide for the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Judge Elliot Chuulu made the order on Monday in a case in which
the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) through lawyer Henry Chanda
were challenging the constitutionality of corporal punishment,
according to local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
This is the case in which Chanda appealed on behalf of John
Banda who was sentenced to 10 strokes of the cane for malicious
damage to government property.
</P>
<P>
Chanda appealed against the sentence saying the 10 strokes is
too brutal, inhuman and barbaric.
</P>
<P>
Chanda also urged judge Chuulu to abolish corporal punishment
as it infringes on the rights of his client.
</P>
<P>
Chuulu said sections 24(c) and 27 of the penal code which
provide for corporal punishment contravene Article 15 of the
constitution, the supreme law of the land which states that no
person shall be subjected to inhuman or degrading punishment, and
so it should be declared null and void.
</P>
<P>
Chanda said Chuulu's judgement meant that the two sections have
ceased to exist in the Laws of Zambia and any other provisions of
the law which provide for corporal punishment are also null and
void with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said even in schools or other institutions, corporal
 punishment has now become illegal.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Control on Sea Sand Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Land Resources
has issued a circular in a fresh step to strengthen supervision
and administration of sea sand mining in China.
</P>
<P>
A large scale check of the disordered sand mining activities
will be conducted by the ministry and the State Oceanic
Administration in the coastal areas soon, and any illegal mining
operations will be forced to stop by the end of this year,
according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Pan Xinchun, an official from the administration, said that the
problem began recently in China's coastal areas as a result of
increasing demand from home and abroad for the sand.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of China's construction materials
market, the need for sea sand is especially surging at home, Pan
said.
</P>
<P>
No legal regulations currently are in place for China's sea
sand mining. Some fishermen and small enterprises engage in the
work with crude equipment, and have nearly destroyed local fishery
production and the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Anyone found illegally mining of sea sand will face punishment
after the inspection, Pan said.

improved, a law system has begun to take shape, and the role of
the principle of law has been respected by the whole nation," it

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Orders to Contain Student Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has directed public universities to contain the frequent
student violence which has threatened to undermine higher
education in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Curbing indiscipline would ensure stability and save time to
allow for the attainment of academic goals, Moi said at Nairobi
University Monday.
</P>
<P>
Public universities had experienced three unnecessary student
riots and the ensuing temporary closures in the past month.
</P>
<P>
The country could not afford to cope up with such mindless
disorder, the Kenya Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president advised university authorities to put more
emphasis on maintaining high-quality education so that the
graduates are able to cope with the challenges of their academic
fields both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that college students are required to master
English and other languages such as French, Portuguese, Spanish,
German, Arabic and Japanese in order to get access to
international labor market.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has five public universities with more than 30,000
students. However, most students can not find a job in a short
time after graduation.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Current Account Deficit Climbs to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Australia's current account
deficit climbed a further 288 million Australian dollars (190
million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter this year to 9.27
billion Australian dollars (6.12 billion U.S. dollars), the worst
deficit on record, AAP said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The news coincides with a 10-billion-Australian-dollar (6.6
billion U.S. dollars) blowout in the country's net foreign debt to
239 billion Australian dollars (158 billion U.S. dollars), just
short of the all-time record, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
However, retail sales figures showed no sign of Australians
ending their spending spree, with sales up another 0.5 percent in
October and 7.0 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was quoted as saying
exports rose slightly in the third quarter this year, but were
again dwarfed by imports of goods, leaving Australia's trade
balance of 4.6 billion Australian dollars (3.0 billion U.S.
dollars) in the red.
</P>
<P>
The blowout in the foreign debt wiped out the
10.7-billion-Australian-dollar (7.1 billion U.S. dollars)
improvement of the previous six months, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The blowout was due to 9.4 billion Australian dollars (6.2
billion U.S. dollars) in additional borrowings with another 2.4
billion Australian dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) added to the
debt by a slight deterioration in the exchange rate, it added.

<HEADLINE> Financial Reforms Across Asia, Great Chance for Australian Business: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The enormous financial
reforms across Asia in the wake of the region's economic crisis
had created great opportunities for Australian businesses, a
government report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asia's Financial Markets, a report by the East Asia Analytical
Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), found
the crisis has prompted the most dramatic change in East Asia's
financial markets in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's good economic performance throughout the crisis and
greater international recognition of Australia's advanced
regulatory framework make Australia attractive as a regional
financial center and should increase its financial service
exports," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Banks across the region had collapsed, forcing governments to
dramatically overhaul financial regulations, curtail monopolies
and open up their formerly closed banking and finance sectors to
foreign investment, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said although most economies in the region are
recovering, these reforms are likely to continue, further
underpinning financial reforms and ensuring the recovery is
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
This will ensure financial services continue to be a major
growth industry in the region, more than doubling to 450 million
U.S. dollars over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"Tapping into this growth provides major opportunities for
Australia," the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, significant barriers still remain in the
region to Australian investment, and the great instability in the
region makes it more risky for business.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has also increased actual and perceived investment
risks," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
although the region was moving into a period of growth there was
no room for complacency.
</P>
<P>
"This is a time to continue the process of reform or else that
growth will falter, so I think it's fragile growth," he told
reporters on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Pirated VCDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government departments
concerned have cracked down on copyright infringement,
confiscating more than 3.16 million pirated video compact discs (
VCDs) in their latest sting operation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they have effectively curbed rampant piracy of
overseas publications, an official with the Ministry of Culture
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, criminals have coordinated their
activities for illegally copying and publishing audio-video
products, which were well-packaged and appeared to be copyrighted
VCDs. Fake brands such as Golden Wanner, Jinlong Movies, Global
Movies and 30 others have been prohibited by the government, said
Chen Tong, a ministry official who oversees the publication
markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, 70 percent of the recently-captured VCDs
were from underground warehouses and specialized markets.
</P>
<P>
Police raided the pirated VCD markets in Guangdong, Zhejiang,
Beijing, Yunnan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Shanghai, seizing more than
100,000 discs in each of the provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Before the coordinated operation, police had already seized 240,
000 and 460,000 discs in Beijing and Guangdong, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, the task force uncovered two workshops for
making counterfeit labels in Cangnan County of Zhejiang Province,
east China, and found two underground warehouses storing 1.6
million illegal discs in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Various localities have strengthened the management of their
audio-video product markets after the campaign. Yiwu City, also in
Zhejiang, is encouraging people to report piracy to local
administrations. A reward of 0.5 yuan (six U.S. cents) will be
offered for each confiscated disc.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown campaign followed that launched by the Chinese
customs, which resulted in a reduction in the influx of pirated
discs from the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Chinese customs seized roughly one million
discs and 170,000 video cassettes between January and June this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The cost of transport between
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member
states has been reduced by up to two percent thanks to the various
traffic facilitation measures put in place so far, a Zambian
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the introduction of a carriers licence,
the harmonized road traffic licence, customs document and the
yellow card scheme,he newspaper, The Post quoted Zambian Deputy
Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Norman Chibamba as
saying.
</P>
<P>
 Steady progress has been made in traffic facilitation, the
minister said when opening a joint Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and COMESA workshop on motor vehicle insurance
(yellow card) scheme in Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba said trade and transport facilitation instruments are
indispensable tools for economic integration and a pre-condition
for the success of the COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA yellow card scheme is a transit traffic facilitation
 instrument that provides prompt compensation to accident victims
in the region.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Assistant Secretary-General Sindiso Ngwenya said the
main objectives for the scheme, which is operational in 12 COMESA
member states, is to facilitate the speed and smooth movement of
the road vehicles, persons and goods.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Unlikely to Hold City Polls This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- There is little possibility that
elections to Bangladesh's four city corporations and upazilla
(sub-districts) will be held within this year, The Independent
daily newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has requested the government to make
necessary amendments to the laws providing for an extended
time-frame as it is failing to hold the elections within the
stipulated time.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing laws, elections to the Khulna City
Corporation are to be held by December 28, to Rajshahi by December
30, to Chittagong by January 4 and to Dhaka by January 27, 2000,
and upazilla elections are due to be completed by December 27 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Unlike city corporation polls, the commission can extend the
time for upazilla elections without calling for amendments to the
law.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced in late October that polls to Khulna,
Chittagong and Rajshahi would be held on December 6 this year, but
later had to postpone the schedule following a Supreme Court
order. No new schedule has been set for the polls so far.
</P>
<P>
An Election Commission source was quoted as saying the
month-long Ramadan, the month of fasting starting December 11, was
the reason for delaying the elections.
</P>
<P>
Holding the elections requires 40 to 45 days' time for
preparations and the available time is not enough to complete the
formalities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance comprising the major opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamaat Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity
Front) has threatened to boycott all elections under the present
chief election commissioner.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Issue Code of Conduct for MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Nearly a decade after
democracy was restored and parliamentary multiparty system
established in Nepal, lawmakers elected on political party
platforms could soon be confined to a code of conduct being
prepared by parliamentarians themselves.
</P>
<P>
A code of conduct drafting committee presented a draft of their
proposals Monday suggesting clauses that would make it mandatory
for members of parliament to declare personal property before and
after their tenure, The Kathmandu Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drafting committee suggested that lawmakers be required to
abide by the constitution, declare property within three months of
taking office, restrain from abusing authority for personal,
monetary or physical gain, avoid excessive consumption of alcohol
and behavior that would damage the character of the society.
</P>
<P>
During an interaction program on Monday, leaders and
representatives from prominent political parties expressed the
view that the code of conduct is necessary to reverse the damage
caused by their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, lawmakers have been the target of
criticism for misuse of facility and privileges such as selling
diplomatic passports, narcotics smuggling and cashing in on
falsified medical bills.
</P>
<P>
The most damaging of all was the trading of MPs for money while
shaky governments were being formed and ousted between 1995 and
1999 when most governments were either coalition or minority.
</P>
<P>
Until the parliament adopted an Anti-defection Act, members of
smaller parties had defected or joined one bigger party or another
while new governments were in the making.

<HEADLINE> Siberian Tigers Found in Wild Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Groups of Siberian tigers,
thought to be gone from the wilderness area of northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, have been spotted again.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses recently have reported several sightings of tracks
of a group of tigers in the eastern Wandashan Mountains of
Heilongjiang, formerly a major natural habitat for Siberian tigers.
</P>
<P>
On October 21, a driver driving along a mountain road saw a
tiger and summoned wildlife experts who later found traces of
tigers on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts claim that wild tiger groups might still exist
in the region, and estimate that a group of two to four female
tigers and their cubs are living in the mountain areas.
</P>
<P>
Less than 20 Siberian tigers currently live in the wild in
China as a result of the deteriorating ecological environment. The
figure was determined following a two-month joint investigation by
wildlife experts from China, the United States and Russia from
January 16 until late March.

CHONGQING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's largest
municipality in southwest, imported 589 million U.S. dollars worth
of goods in the first ten months of this year, up 36 percent over
the same period of 1998, and its exports stood at 362 million
dollars, down 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Customs Office authorities attributed the
achievements to the country's policy of increasing investment for
spurring domestic demand. And this has led to the recovery of the
city's motor vehicles, electronics and telecommunications
industries, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing mainly imported auto parts, data-processing equipment,
spare parts of piston internal combustion engine and machine tools.
</P>

In September alone, the municipality's imports and exports were
up 35 percent and 27 percent respectively as compared with the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cracks Down on Corruption, Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An increasingly sophisticated
rise in official-level corruption in Vietnam has been met with a
tough response by courts, the local English daily Vietnam News
(VNS) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,100 government officials and business people
appeared in courts in the year up to September for their
involvement in 526 corruption cases, VNS quoted Chief Judge of
Vietnam's Supreme People's Court Trinh Hong Duong as saying.
</P>
<P>
Duong told the current National Assembly session that eight of
the accused were given death sentences, 13 jailed for life, 75 for
between 10 and 29 years, and 653 for between seven and 10 years
while others were given lesser sentences.
</P>
<P>
The judge told the National Assembly session that the number of
increasingly complicated drug cases, too, had been met with severe
sentences to match the increasingly sophisticated operations of
major criminal syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The courts of the country this year handled 8,030 drug-related
cases involving 16,608 people, a quarter up on last year. Of these
cases, 82 were sentenced to death, 137 jailed for life and 2,975
jailed for 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge of Vietnam's Supreme People's Court urged increased
efforts to prevent drug trafficking through border and sea ports
and an upgrading of technology and equipment to deal with
smugglers.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Urges Developed Countries to Open Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore urged developed countries to
open their markets to the least developed countries and provide
additional assistance to them.
</P>
<P>
"A major challenge facing the WTO as we enter the 21st century
is to ensure that developing countries not only participate in the
multilateral trading system, but derive real and tangible benefits
from it," Moore told trade ministers of the least developed
countries Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from about two dozens of the least-developed
countries closed a one-day meeting on Monday as ministers from 135
WTO members meet November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
"Study after study has shown that even after the successful
implementation of the Uruguay Round, a substantial number of
barriers remain," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Reductions in tariffs in sectors such as textiles, clothing,
and agricultural products are among primary interests to
developing countries."
</P>
<P>
WTO trade diplomats failed to reach agreement on the agenda for
the new round of global trade talks, the Millennium Round, and
left the thorny issues to their ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will try to launch the round in Seattle. Some
diplomats are still pessimistic about the meeting although the U.S.
has repeatedly affirmed its confidence that the new round will be
launched.
</P>
<P>
Moore also stressed that technical assistance for the
developing countries should also be on the agenda. "Developing
countries, and particularly the poorest among them, need access to
the trading system itself, and to the WTO's institutional
machinery."
</P>
<P>
About 48 nations are named the least-developed countries and 29
of them are full WTO members. They have a total population of 600
million, or about 10 percent of the world.
</P>
<P>
The least developed countries also seek a fast-track entry into
the WTO because they have a simple economy.
</P>
<P>
Moore said there is a need to make explicit lines between
demand and supply or between access to markets and capacity to
benefit from this access.
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating trade barriers will not be enough unless we also
reduce the supply-side barriers, which many developing and least-
developed countries face -- from infrastructure and institution
building, to health care, education, and social policy," Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the rich countries to do more on debt relief to
help least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Seattle, advanced countries have an opportunity to
match debt relief with free market access for as many heavily
indebted countries as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moore urged building a bridge between North and South in new
technologies. "Developing countries need better access to modern
technology and services, such as telecommunications, financial
services, information technologies, and electronic commerce."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of seeing technology as a barrier between North and
South, we should see it as a bridge -- and we must build this
bridge together, not only in the name of social justice, but
because we are all, in the end, each other's customers."

<HEADLINE> Rockets Olajuwon out 3-4 Weeks with Groin Strain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Houston Rockets star center
Hakeem Olajuwon will miss three to four weeks due to a groin
strain, the team announced today.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon suffered the injury early in the third quarter of
Friday's 91-88 overtime loss at Portland and was sent back to
Houston for further examination. An MRI today revealed no tear but
confirmed the strain.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets (3-11) is one-half game behind Vancouver in last
place in the Midwest Division.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in the last three seasons that Olajuwon,
a 16-year veteran, will miss a large chunk of the season with an
injury. In the 1997-98 campaign, he missed 35 games due to knee
surgery and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, 36, is one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players but his
production has diminished this season. He is averaging only 14.8
points and 8.3 rebounds per game, well below his career marks of
23.6 points and 11.8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
The long-term absence of Olajuwon may force the Rockets to
abandon their inside-outside attack for more of a transition game
that would feature the talents of younger players Steve Francis
and Shandon Anderson.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ordered the police to immediately investigate an
attack on the headquarters of the main opposition United National
Party (UNP).
</P>
<P>
An armed gang of about 15 men on Monday morning arrived in
three vehicles and stormed the UNP's headquarters at Kotte, about
10 kilometers from Colombo, damaging the window panes and walls of
the building, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They had also destroyed a life-size cutout of the party's
leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and posters and banners both inside
and outside the premises, the reports said, adding that they had
later escaped in their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The UNP leader is the incumbent President Kumaratunga's main
rival in the upcoming presidential election due on December 21.
</P>
<P>
Several eyewitnesses to the incident had made statements to the
police and given the plate numbers of two of the vehicles in which
the attackers had arrived and departed, police said.
</P>
<P>
A special police team has been deployed to trace the vehicles
and the attackers under the president's order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Police Elections Secretariat
said the number of election-related incidents of violence had
risen to 223 by Monday since the president has announced that the
presidential election will be carried out on December 21 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Of these incidents, 112 had been reported by the UNP. The
ruling People's Alliance had lodged 83 complaints while the
balance were by other smaller parties and independent candidates.

DHAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
banned the commercial import of methanol in an effort to stop
alcohol poisoning in the country, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have died in the country after drinking
alcohol products tainted with methanol.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Home Ministry were quoted as saying
unscrupulous businessmen mix methanol, which costs just 26 taka
per liter (about 50 U.S. cents), with "safe" but more expensive
ethyl alcohol products, such as brandy, vodka and whiskey, to
maximize their profits.
</P>
<P>
The report said businesses can still import methanol for
industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
The businesses must apply for permission from the ministries of
industry, commerce, and home affairs, and their application must
state the amount of methanol required and how it will be used.
</P>
<P>
A special dye will be added to industrial methanol to
distinguish it from commercial varieties, the report added.

loans (NPLs) still hangs over the country's fragile banking
system.
</P>
<P>
Will the recovery help the banks get rid of the NPLs, or will
the banks become hurdles on the road to a sustainable recovery?
</P>
<P>
Thailand's macroeconomic situation has shown a significant
return of stability and improvement so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth forecast has been revised upward in a V-shape
to more than 4 percent this year, buoyed by better-than-expected
exports and a revival in consumption and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
This marks an unexpected turnaround, given the severe recession
in 1997 and 1998 when many feared that the difficulties would drag
on for several years.
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to the favorable conditions of the economy,
the country's banking system obviously has not recovered from the
crisis and may thus hinder the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand reported early this month that the NPLs of
the Thai banking system totaled 2.57 trillion baht (67.6 billion
U.S. dollars) at the end of September, or 45.33 percent of the
total outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
The Thai commercial banks have also recorded net losses
amounting to 600 billion baht (15.7 billion dollars) from 1998 up
to now due to provisioning requirements. New NPLs are also
appearing in the system and some restructured debts are turning
non-performing once again.
</P>
<P>
The banks have to recover loans before they start booking new
ones. They're also loath to lend to companies still strapped with
large debts and an uncertain cash flow.
</P>
<P>
The only way many corporations have been able to survive has
been through the underground lending market, paying 10 to 20
percent more than official lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Especially hard hit are small and medium-sized companies, many
of which supply parts to key export industries such as electronics
and cars.
</P>
<P>
Failing to fix the banks, in other words, could choke off Thai
exports, which consist of nearly half of the gross domestic
product of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand's chief economist Achana Asikhuamdee
pointed out that a sustainable recovery of the Thai economy
depends on the financial restructuring and the ability of the
banking system to resume lending.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also warned that without proper resolution of the NPL
problem, another banking crisis could happen in Thailand in the
next five to six years.
</P>
<P>
To solve the NPL problem, the Thai government has adopted a
series of measures and made some progress.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand followed the international standard,
changing the definition of NPLs from those on which interest or
principal repayments are 12 months in arrears to those of three or
more months in arrears.
</P>
<P>
The new definition made the NPLs swell a lot but helped
increase the transparency of the Thai banking sector.
</P>
<P>
To help strike deals on debt negotiating cases, the central
bank also established a debt restructuring advisory committee,
which has created new procedures by establishing inter-creditor
and creditor-borrower agreements.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has also adopted a bankruptcy law and a foreclosure
law, which allow creditors to seize assets from delinquent
debtors. Analysts said these laws helped the foreign investors
regain confidence in the Thai banking sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, bank recapitalization has shown good progress, with
commercial banks raising a total of 800 billion baht (21 billion
dollars) in fresh money from 1998 up to now. The banks have also
set aside around 60 to 70 percent of the central bank's full
requirement.
</P>
<P>
In fact, banks are required to reserve only 60 percent against
loan loss by the end of this year and private banks need only
about 100 billion baht (2.6 billion dollars) to meet the
provisioning requirement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the strategic NPL problem, which refers to the
clients who have the ability to pay but refuse to do so, is
expected to be settled soon after a national credit bureau is set
up early next month.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, asset management companies are also about to be
established and this would help banks get bad loans out of their
balance sheets, paving the way for them to resume lending to the
real economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Both the Thai government and the banks hope that the favorable
macroeconomic conditions will be conducive to conserving the
financial institutions' strength to cope with the NPL problem and
the recovery will have spillover effects on the NPLs and bring
them out of non-performing status.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts pointed out that although the recovery may
help absorb the damage resulting from the NPLs, the banks should
not place too much hope on the recovery. If banks do not
recapitalize, restructure their debts and resume lending to
cash-strapped companies, the economic recovery will not be
sustainable.

HAVANA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
announced Monday that he will not attend the third conference of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) scheduled to start on Tuesday
in Seattle, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Castro's decision was made public in a letter addressed to U.S.
Congressman Jim McDermott, who has been encouraging the Cuban
president to attend the Seattle meeting.
</P>
<P>
Castro said he noticed the opposition of U.S. authorities to
his presence at the trade meeting and the U.S. official support
for a right-wing group of Cuban origin, which, he said, intends to
provoke a confrontation between Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
He expressed fear for a "bloody armed conflict between Cuba and
the United States, which, in this case, would be an inevitable
consequence of any intent to hold me back by force in Seattle,
with first combat possibly taking place in that peaceful city."
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Minster Felipe Perez will lead the Cuban
delegation to the WTO meeting. Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo
Cabrisas will also attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Reaffirms Sea Limits at Parallel 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Honduran Foreign Ministry
said Monday that a treaty made with Colombia in 1986 on the
demarcation of sea limits does not infringe upon Nicaragua's
sovereignty or territory.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, Honduras' maritime limit with Nicaragua is
divided at parallel 15, but Nicaragua claims the limit should be
at parallel 17.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, Honduras reaffirmed its historical rights at
parallel 15, which is also recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
It said "in no way does it (the treaty) damage Nicaragua's
legitimate rights" in response to Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman's remark on Monday that his country does not accept nor
will ever accept this treaty that "tramples on Nicaraguan
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The communique confirmed that the treaty with Colombia will go
to Congress on Tuesday. If passed, Nicaragua will lose the 30,000-
square-kilometer area between parallel 15 and 17 it now holds.
</P>
<P>
It noted that this treaty coincides with the one signed and
ratified between Nicaragua and Colombia in the 1920's, and that it
was not till 1980 that Nicaragua rejected what it had signed with
Colombia and intended to expand its sea limit with Honduras to
parallel 17.
</P>
<P>
The intended expansion damages Honduras' historical right in
this respect, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In view of Nicaragua's threats to go to the International Court
of Justice at The Hague, Honduran Foreign Minister Roberto Flores
Bermudes proposed on Monday negotiations on a definitive
demarcation of the maritime border between the two neighboring
countries.

WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Urges Tariff Liberalization Despite Protests in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- A new round of tariff
liberalization will boost world economic output by 3 percent, or
over 1.2 trillion U.S. dollars, Mike Moore, director-general of
the World Trade Organization, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries will benefit most. India's GDP will
grow by 9.6 percent, China's by 5.5 percent, sub-Saharan Africa's
by 3.7 percent," said Moore, who was addressing non-governmental
organizations in opening the Seattle Symposium on International
Trade Issues in the Next Decade.
</P>
<P>
Before the formal opening of the WTO ministerial conference on
Tuesday, the WTO planned a full day of discussions among more than
700 non-governmental organizations, such as environmental groups
and labor unions, in an effort to reach out to groups that have
been critical of WTO policies.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders and environmental activists, who are concerned
that this week's WTO conference will seek to weaken worker's
rights, health and environmental safety standards in the pursuit
of corporate profits, have been planning for months to disrupt the
Seattle gathering.
</P>
<P>
Anti-WTO protests that began over the weekend increased on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
About a mile to the north of the convention center, four
demonstrators scaled a giant construction crane Monday to hang a
huge banner protesting WTO policies regarding the environment.
</P>
<P>
Several protesters, part of a crowd of 400 to 500, attacked a
McDonald's Corp. restaurant in central Seattle to vent their rage
against global trade talks starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moore admitted there are problems, such as unemployment,
discord over health and environmental safety standards, but
insisted that a global economy benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not suggesting that the pain and the problems associated
with technological and economic changes are not real. They are.
And we must address them with the appropriate domestic policies:
that's the function of governments," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that WTO is not a world government, but without the
multilateral trading system, "it would be a poorer world of
competing blocs and power politics -- a world of more conflict,
uncertainty and marginalization.
</P>
<P>
"Trade is not the answer to all our problems, but it provides
part of solution," the WTO chief said, noting that the 135-nation
WTO ministerial conference in Seattle is fighting for a
multilateral trading system that is an essential component of the
architecture for international cooperation -- a firm foothold in
an uncertain world.

<P>
TIANJIN, November 30 (Xinhua)-- An investment park designed to
create a more suitable environment for medium-sized and small
overseas enterprises will be set up in this biggest port city of
Tianjin in north China, according to Vice-Mayor Wang Shuzu.
</P>
<P>
In a recent seminar on the relationship between medium-sized
and small enterprises and China's future economic development, Wan
said that these particular foreign businesses will be able to
flourish in the park, which will have an investment environment
similar to those in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently preventing the medium-sized and small overseas
enterprises from entering the Chinese market are lack of capital,
concerns about technological infringement, the language barrier,
different cultural backgrounds, and the general lack of awareness
about China, Wan concluded.
</P>
<P>
The new park will help overseas businessmen solve capital
shortages, simplify administrative procedures, provide
construction assistance, and oversee office affairs and property
security.
</P>
<P>
"Establishing the park is the simplest and most convenient way
to get past all the obstacles faced by these enterprises, and the
municipal government supports the idea of offering special service
to them," Wan said.
</P>
<P>
Wan did not reveal the scale of the new park during the seminar.

PRAGUE, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Czech Vice Prime Minister Egon
Lansky announced his resignation on Monday in the biggest
government reshuffle since Prime Minister Milos Zeman took office
in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lansky, 65, was in charge of the Czech Republic's entry into
the European Union. In recent months he has been accused of "not
working effectively" by opposition parties and even his colleagues
of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Media reports alleged that Lansky has secret accounts in
Austria in connection with tax evasion and might be prosecuted by
judicial organs. However, Lansky denied the allegations and
insisted that his resignation was made out of his "health problems.
"
</P>
<P>
Czech President Vaclav Havel is expected to accept Lansky's
resignation in Prague Castle on December 1.
</P>

It is not clear who will succeed Lansky as vice prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Looking Forward to Invitation to EU Entry Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov said Monday that his country would be invited to the
European Union (EU) entry talks "without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
"The goal has been achieved. Bulgaria will be invited to EU
accession talks without preconditions," Kostov said after meeting
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen in Sofia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"With the negotiations we have been conducting so far, we could
be invited to become an EU member candidate, which we expect to
take place in Helsinki on December 10, but such negotiations alone
will not get us into the EU, it will take a lot of hard work," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are embarking on a road we must follow to the end,"
Kostov said. "This is the first and probably the most difficult
step, but it opens up good prospects for this country."
</P>
<P>
Kostov said a memorandum of understanding will be signed later
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen, who also met President Peter Stoyanov and Foreign
Minister Nadezhda Mihailova during his one-day visit, said: "I am
sure that our meeting today will open the door to Bulgaria in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that the EU Council in Helsinki will invite
Bulgaria to start negotiations with the European Union for
accession," he said, describing this as "a historic event for this
country."
</P>
<P>
Verheugen said Bulgaria could be a "useful member" of the EU,
and the invitation is based on the country's political and
economic progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that "Bulgarians should realize that they
are thus assuming both the rights and the obligations of the EU."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat said Monday that "minimum rights acceptable" in a
final settlement with Israel included East Jerusalem as the
capital of a Palestinian state and Israel's withdrawal from the
entire West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the International Day of Solidarity with the
Palestinian People, read by the Palestinian U.N. observer, Nasser
al-Kdwa, Arafat said, "I am confident that Palestine will
participate in the forthcoming Millennium Summit of the United
Nations as a member state."
</P>
<P>
On the talks with Israel on so-called "final status" issues,
Arafat said they would include matters that were "important and
difficult but are also unequivocal in terms of the minimum rights
acceptable to the Palestinian side."
</P>
<P>
"They include our rights with respect to east Jerusalem as
part of the territories occupied in 1967 and as the capital of our
Palestinian state, the right of the Palestinian refugees to return
or to receive compensation in accordance with General Assembly
resolution 194 and our right to the territory occupied in 1967
with the requirement that Israel should withdraw completely
therefrom in implementation of Security Council resolutions 242
and 338," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the support and assistance of the international
community was needed "if we are to perform the difficult tasks
entrusted to us and arrive at a definitive solution " by the
agreed time of September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine have set September 2000 as a target for
the completion of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall On Weaker Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Monday on a weaker dollar against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 40.99 at 10,947.
92. The blue chip index fell as mush as 102 points during the
session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index fell 8.79 at 1,407.83 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 26.44 at 3,421.37.
</P>
<P>
The market moved down as the dollar remained weaker despite a
Japanese effort to boost the U.S. currency. After the Bank of
Japan bought dollars, the U.S. currency bought 102.22 Japanese yen
Monday, up from 101.64 Friday in New York trading and the rate
Monday was still much lower than 104.53 last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investors were concerned about the dollar because a weaker
dollar will make U.S. imports more expensive, increasing pressures
on inflation. A weaker dollar also decreases the allure of U.S.
investment.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.45 at 636.50 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 1.99 at 456.95. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.72 at 832.12.
</P>

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,120 down, 1,004 up and 444
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 863.90 million shares from 310.20

<HEADLINE> Archeologists to Re-erect Stolen Ancient Pagoda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists are
devising a way to re-erect an ancient pagoda which was knocked
down by vandals earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The nine-story, 13-meter-tall pagoda was built in the early
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) in Shouyang County of Shanxi Province,
north China. The second through ninth stories were pulled down
with a rope and stolen by the thieves, who were several farmers
from neighboring Henan Province, central China.
</P>
<P>
Precious stone Buddha statues in the pagoda were also taken by
the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the foundation of the pagoda was not
damaged. They are trying to re-attach the broken stories onto the
original base by attaching them to a wood pole inside the pagoda.
</P>
<P>
According to the local sources, the structure is known as the "
shadowless pagoda," because it casts no shadow at noon on the
Summer Solstice, which falls on June 22.
</P>
<P>
Police have detained the suspects and are investigating the
matter.

<P>
HEFEI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China
reported an influx of 456 million U.S. dollars of foreign
investment in the first ten months of this year, more than double
the figure for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the province actually
utilized 339 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds over the ten-
month period, up 61.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of large projects has been growing. Statistics show
that each of the foreign-funded projects involves an average of
three million U.S. dollars of foreign funding, 2.2 times that of
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Authorities attribute the increase to the upgrading of the
investment environment, more preferential treatment for foreign-

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Malaysian Ruling Coalition Wins Big Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling
coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) has won an
overwhelming majority of parliamentary seats in the 10th general
election held on November 29.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
secured 148 seats out of the total 193 seats contested, 19 more
than the two-thirds majority, as declared officially Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But, the BN lost control of the eastern state of Terengganu to
Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) which also retained the Kelantan
state government for the third term.
</P>
<P>
PAS, which contested the general election by partnering three
other opposition parties to take on the BN one-on-one in most of
the 193 parliamentary and 394 state seats at stake, was the
biggest winner among the opposition front, Barisan Alternatif
(Alternative Front).
</P>
<P>
PAS won 27 parliamentary seats, more than triple their previous
tally of eight.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir accepted the BN's defeat in Kelantan and Terengganu
but said it was caused by the scare tactics used by PAS on
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir, who retained his Kubang Pasu parliamentary
seat for the seventh time, told reporters that the BN victory with
more than two-thirds majority in the 10th general election shows
that the BN is still enjoying high popularity.
</P>
<P>
The election was costly for the BN despite the resounding
two-thirds majority win, as four of its ministers lost. They
include Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Megat Junid
Megat Ayob, Entrepreneur Development Minister and Second Finance
Minister Mustapa Mohamed, Land Development Minister Annuar Musa
and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Hamid
Othman. Several deputy ministers also failed to retain their
seats.
</P>
<P>
On the opposition side, opposition Democratic Action Party
(DAP) won 10 parliamentary seats, but its Secretary-General Lim
Kit Siang, who was the opposition leader in the dissolved
parliament, has conceded defeat after failing to win both the
parliamentary and state seats he contested in the northern state
of Pulau Pinang.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Parti Keadilan Nasional (National Justice Party)
President Wan Azizah Ismail, wife of Jailed former Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim was elected to the parliament by winning
the Permatang Pauh seat, last held by her husband, Anwar. Her
party won five parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
Polling for the election which lasted from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
in peninsular Malaysia and from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Sabah and
Sarawak, two states in East Malaysia, was conducted smoothly
without any untoward incidents nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The turnout was estimated at 70 percent of the total 9.6
million voters eligible to cast their votes in the election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,238 candidates including 1,200 put up by 21
political parties contested both parliamentary and state seats.
</P>
<P>
The BN placed candidates in all parliamentary and state
constituencies at stake.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Barisan Alternatif put up 170 candidates for
contesting parliamentary seats and 391 for state seats.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BN and the opposition front headed for straight
fights in nearly 80 percent of the 193 parliamentary
constituencies at stake in the election.
</P>
<P>
The number of the straight contests was said to be the highest
since the first election in 1959.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52,000 policemen were on duty Monday throughout the
country to ensure incident-free polling.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament and legislative assemblies of the 11 states in
peninsular Malaysia were dissolved on November 11 while state
legislative assemblies of Sabah and Sarawak, which hold state
elections separately, are not. Sabah had its state election last
March while the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly expires only in
2001.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election held in April 1995, the ruling BN
coalition won 162 of the total 192 seats in the parliament.

Football Association of England.
</P>
<P>
Northumbia police confirmed they are compiling a report on
complaints from Newcastle fans at Sunday's St James' Park clash.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman confirmed they had received complaints from
around a dozen Newcastle fans: "Several complaints were made by
supporters regarding the behaviour of Ginola and Sherwood during
the match. As a result a report will be compiled and passed on to
the FA."
</P>
<P>
Newcastle fans gave French star Ginola a hot reception
following reported comments he made about England captain Alan
Shearer to the Oxford Union last week, saying that the 15 million
pounds Magpies striker is now "playing only on his name". And when
Spurs, who were beaten 2-1, equalised just before half-time Ginola
raised his arms in a clenched-fist celebration that brought a
furious reaction from home supporters.
</P>
<P>
Sherwood also incurred their wrath after a challenge on
Newcastle's Nolberto Solano. Newcastle fans claimed Sherwood was
at fault but in fact it was Solano who was booked by referee Paul
Alcock.
</P>
<P>
Geordie fans also claimed that Sherwood directed foul language
at them following Tottenham's equaliser by Chris Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
Sherwood and Ginola were two of six Spurs players booked and
manager George Graham hit out at referee Alcock - the man
infamously pushed over by West Ham's former Sheffield Wednesday
striker Paolo di Canio at Hillsborough last season - saying, "It
was sad to see the inconsistencies from the officials. It was
unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
Sherwood and Tottenham team-mate Mauricio Taricco collected
their fifth yellow cards of the season in the game and will be
suspended when the teams meet again in a third round FA Cup tie at
White Hart Lane a week on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's Patrick Vieira - currently banned for six matches
after a spitting incident at West Ham and an alleged clash with a
police officer in the players' tunnel there - was fined 20,000
pounds by the FA last season after police reported him for making
V-sign gestures at Sheffield Wednesday supporters at Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
The FA say they have no knowledge yet of the impending police
report about Ginola and Sherwood while a Tottenham spokesman said:
"If this is happening we would expect to be informed about it."

<HEADLINE> Leeds Chief "Stunned" by Spartak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale admited that he was "stunned"
by the alleged double standards of Spartak Moscow officials in the
wake of the latest dirty tricks scandal.
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale and boss David O'Leary have both vehemently denied
claims by Spartak coach Oleg Romantsev just days ahead of the two
sides' rearranged UEFA Cup third-round, first-leg tie in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Following the postponement of last week's game at the Dynamo
Stadium, which was called off due to a dangerous frozen pitch,
Romantsev has suggested he was offered a financial inducement to
play the match in England.
</P>
<P>
Anfield was mentioned as a venue, according to Ridsdale, but it
was an offer made by Spartak who then later rejected it as they
plumped for the Bulgarian capital.
</P>
<P>
Romantsev has also allegedly accused O'Leary of "dishonesty"
and added: "It's worth noting the generous offers of the Leeds
coach.
</P>
<P>
"He suggested that we play both games in England and under very
good financial conditions too. His 'generosity' smells of
dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
"I won't attend Press conferences either in Bulgaria or in
England because I feel disgusted at the very thought that I would
have to sit at one table with a man capable of such low actions.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of my whole team I say that we'll do everything
possible to kick Leeds out of the Cup."
</P>
<P>
A UEFA spokeswoman, however, confirmed they have not yet
received any official complaint from Spartak.
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale, meanwhile, will turn to European soccer's ruling body
if he finds Romantsev has been accurately quoted, adding: "I've
not seen his comments in full yet, only what he is purported to
have said."

LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- American Stevie Johnston

Schwer battled on to take the fight the 12-round distance but
all three judges made the champion a clear victor by 118-110 for
his 30th professional win.

<HEADLINE> EU: No Limits on Foreign Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is set to
announce that an unlimited number of foreign players can play in
the Premiership, despite FIFA and UEFA pressure to change the
rules.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC reports on Monday, the commission report
published on 10 December will show that the Freedom of Movement
principle - called the Bosman ruling with respect to football -
will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
But under an alteration to existing regulations, smaller clubs
will be partially reimbursed if players they have developed leave
due to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter and UEFA's Lennart Johansson
recently lobbied the European Commission for Culture and Education
for restrictions on the numbers of foreigners allowed to play in
domestic leagues.
</P>
<P>
An EU spokesman said their position had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
"The Freedom of Movement ruling is a sacred principle for us,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although FIFA and UEFA may want to restrict the number of
foreigners, it's not an issue on our agenda."
</P>
<P>
The EU's decision will be a relief for teams like Chelsea and
Liverpool, which are heavily reliant on foreign stars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that if freedom of movement was
abandoned for football, it would spread to other sports and the
principle would collapse.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't our job to tell FIFA or UEFA what to do and if they
want to impose their own rules, that's fine. They've talked about
restricting clubs to just six foreign players, but we are not
involved in this at the moment," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
That said, any such change would be open to challenge in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, smaller clubs will be compensated to some extent if
young players that they have invested in developing move elsewhere
under the Bosman ruling.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Players in Fake Passport Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- British Home Office immigration
officials are investigating the suspected use of fake passports by
foreign footballers signing to British clubs.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after it was confirmed that Derby County's
Argentinian striker Esteban Fuertes was refused re-entry to the UK
because he was travelling on a bogus Italian passport.
</P>
<P>
The player was stopped at customs while returning from a club
trip to Portugal and was forced to return to South America.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office refused to confirm newspaper allegations that
two more players were under investigation, however, a spokesman
for the government department said: "I am sure the Immigration
Enforcement Agency will be interested in other possible
irregularities."
</P>
<P>
The concern is that players who are unable to meet the strict
conditions for a British work permit may be acquiring fake
passports giving them bogus citizenship for the UK or another
European Union country.
</P>
<P>
The English Premiership is a popular target because of high
wages, transfer fees and sizeable commissions for agents.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association
Gordon Taylor has called for a Football Association investigation,
saying that Fuertes could be just "the tip of the iceberg".
</P>
<P>
"The Fuertes case smacks of an underworld trade in passports,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The FA should be concerned. It is their duty to look after the
home-grown player and English nationals."
</P>
<P>
The FA said "our sympathy is with Derby who unwittingly are the
victims in this situation".
</P>
<P>
Media relations manager Steve Double said Fuertes was the only
instance of passport forgery that they were aware of, adding: "It'
s a matter for the immigration service in terms of what happens
now."
</P>
<P>
"The Fuertes case created serious problems for Derby County,
and we will do everything we can to make sure it doesn't happen
again," Double added.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua to Attend The Hague Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 29 (Xinhua)-- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Montealegre said Monday his country will attend the
International Court of Justice of The Hague if Honduras and
Colombia ratify a treaty of sea limits hurting Nicaragua's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre told the press he requested the Central American
Court of Justice the adopting of precautionary measures, that is
measures of protection of Nicaraguan territory and of Central
American territory.
</P>
<P>
Honduras congress will ratify a treaty of sea limits signed
with Colombia in 1986, in which Bogota recognizes that Honduras'
sea border with Nicaragua is parallel 15, while Managua considers
that its limits in this zone are on parallel 17.
</P>
<P>
Between these two parallels are about 30,000 square kilometers
Nicaragua holds it would lose if Honduras ratifies the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The treaty in question damages Nicaragua and intends to
deliver or recognize Nicaraguan territory to third countries",
said Montealegre.
</P>
<P>
"I say of Central American territory, because (this treaty)
damages also Central America's patrimony, handing over a part of
Central American land to a third country like Colombia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official exposed that Nicaragua is in the best disposition
to sit down and talk and discuss on this matter, and asked
Honduras' congress not to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua won't accept this treaty between Honduras and
Colombia and if Honduras' congress ratifies it, Nicaragua can go
to the International Court at The Hague, said Nicaragua's Foreign
Minister.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas destroyed
Monday 17 towers of electric energy in the northeast of Colombia,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The Medellin Public Enterprises said in a communique that the
supply of electricity is guaranteed in the area in spite of the
sabotage performed at dawn Monday against energy towers east of
Antioquia.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen of the Police and of the Medellin Public Enterprises
attributed the attack to the guerrillas as the rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (
ELN) are operating in this zone.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the guerrillas have destroyed
so far this year 612 energy towers in Colombia. The FARC and the
ELN are the main rebel groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Medellin Public Enterprises and Electric Interconnection (
ISA) are owners of the majority of electric lines sabotaged by the
guerrillas in the zones of conflict.

<HEADLINE> Oil Risks Discarded Regarding Y2K: Major Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 29 Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia, Mexico and
Venezuela said Monday here their oil production isn't at risk as
regards the Informatic Failure of the Millennium, also called Y2K.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique made known in this capital said, "If
problems present themselves associated with the failure of the
situation they considered highly improbable, the three countries,
in coordination with other oil exporters, would respond in
adequate manner to any interruption in the world offer of crude."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela want to assure participants
of the international oil market that oil production in their
countries isn't at risk, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Exhaustive proofs and simulations have been carried out in
these three countries in order to take necessary previsions to
maintain an uninterrupted offer of the product during the coming
months, it added.
</P>
<P>
The three countries commit themselves to guarantee a balanced
market where prices remain stable and at levels in the interest of
producing and consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.S. government said it is prepared to sell crude
from its strategic reserves, if problems related to the Failure of
the Millennium affect supply.
</P>
<P>
Petroleums of Venezuela (PDVSA) has said it will halt its oil
vessels for 10 hours at about midnight on December 31.
</P>
<P>
This is a preventive measure against possible failures due to
Y2K. Other exporters will take similar measures which would have a
small impact on crude availability.

<HEADLINE> Italy, U.S. Test AIDS Vaccine on Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 29 (Xinhua) -- An Italian-American Aids vaccine
has been tested in Italy on healthy people as well as on HIV
positive patients without any negative collateral side effects.
</P>
<P>
The results of the three-year experiment, carried out by
Alessandro Gringeri at Milan's Maggiore Hospital, were presented
at a conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tests were on five healthy Italian volunteers and 60 people
who were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine is based on the TAT protein and was the result of
collaboration between the American group headed by Roberto Gallo,
at the University of Baltimore, and the French group of Daniel
Zagury, of the Curie University in Paris, and Gringeri's group in
Milan.
</P>
<P>
The results on the security of the vaccine regarded the first
two phases of the experimentation. The third phase, to verify the
vaccine's effectiveness which, Gringeri said, may begin in the
spring-summer of 2000 on several hundred people with HIV and some
100 who are healthy.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine developed by Gallo, Gringeri and Zagury is based on
the TAT protein that is the "motor" that allows the HIV virus to
multiply itself and it is also used once it has been disactivated.
</P>
<P>
According to the report presented Monday by Gringeri, the first
two phases of his experiments showed that their vaccine did not
produce collateral effects, the level of infection was stabilized
and the direct production of antibodies against the TAT protein
was observed.
</P>
<P>
"The definitive answer can only be given at the end of the
third phase of experimentation," Gringeri added, "but there is
great optimism."
</P>
<P>
The HIV positive volunteers in Gringeri's experiments are all
Italians between the ages of 18 and 45, and the five healthy
volunteers were between 30 and 50.
</P>
<P>
Experiments using the same vaccine had up until now only been
conducted of HIV positive patients in France, Belgium and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Boeing Company,
embarrassed by a recent string of production lapses, will join the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in examining its production
and quality-control systems.
</P>
<P>
The decision to conduct the separate but simultaneous reviews
comes a month after the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767,
but results from other incidents.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has said it found
no mechanical cause for the EgyptAir crash, in which all 217
people aboard died when the plane plunged into the Atlantic Ocean
off Massachusetts' Nantucket Island on October 31, and
investigators suspect that a relief pilot left alone in the
cockpit may have intentionally crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
The FAA review will begin on December 2 and continue through
February at the company's three manufacturing plants in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The agency will study everything from aircraft engineering to
parts receiving and the manufacturing process, including how
engineering changes are incorporated, while Boeing will focus on
its quality-control procedures.

<HEADLINE> China on Question of Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 29 (Xinhua) -- Only when the question
of Palestine is resolved and all legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people, including the right of an independent state,
are restored, can the Middle East enjoy real and lasting peace,
China said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Shen Guofang said the question of Palestine is the core of
the issues in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Palestine and Israel reached understanding on the
implementation of the Wye Accord and negotiations in the final
status of Palestine and signed the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum,
thus removing the obstacles in the way of implementing the Wye
accord, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Relaunching the permanent status talks and opening of safe
passages in the Palestinian Autonomous Area are yet another
achievement by the Palestinian and Israeli sides after serious
negotiations, and China welcomes such development and hopes that
the parties concerned will continue with this flexible and
pragmatic attitude, implement earnestly the various agreements and
understandings, direct their actions on the basis of relevant U.N.
resolutions and the principle of "land for peace," overcome the
various disturbances and push forward the peace process, the
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Autonomous Area is still facing tremendous
difficulties in developing its economy and the livelihood of the
Palestinian people still leaves much to be improved, and China
maintains that helping the Autonomous Area in its economic
development will enable the Palestinian people to have a taste of
the happiness to be brought by peace and thus boast their faith in
the peace talks, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
For years, the Chinese government has given staunch support to
the just cause of the Palestinian people, providing assistance to
the best of its capacity to the Palestinian people through various
multi-lateral, bilateral and other channels and made untiring
efforts and contribution in pushing forward the Middle East peace
process and the Chinese government will, as always, work with the
international community to continue to strive for a just and
reasonable settlement of the question of Palestine, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The third plenum of the
Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy
(CAPD) was convened here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his work report at the plenum, Xu Jialu, chairman of
the CAPD Central Committee, said that over the past year, the CAPD
has stood firm politically and made a series of good proposals to
the central government.
</P>
<P>
Xu, also vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress, said that the CAPD has paid much
attention to field studies across the country.
</P>
<P>
The studies of 20 provinces and municipalities have helped the
CAPD to formulate its proposals on energy-saving, a new anti-flood
system along the Yangtze River, and against pseudo-sciences.
</P>
<P>
The good work of the CAPD has won the praise of the ruling
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council,
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
As for its future tasks, Xu said that the CAPD should build
itself into a high-quality party so that it can meet the
challenges of the next century.
</P>
<P>
As one of the eight non-Communist parties in China, the CAPD
should also improve its participation in government and political
affairs, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cases Up in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The total number of people in
Cyprus tested HIV positive by last October has increased to 323,
with 193 cases registered in Cypriots and 130 cases in foreigners.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1998, Cyprus saw an average of 23 new cases every
year. The number has begun to fall from a peak of 39 new cases in
1994 to 19 in 1998, but it rebounded to 21 so far this year, the
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not say how many are just carriers of HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus), which causes the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and how many have developed full-blown
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
A ratio of six to one marks the gender distribution of the
fatal disease, with a total of 165 Cypriot men and 28 Cypriot
women infected.
</P>
<P>
Most of the sufferers are relatively young, with 78 percent of
carriers aged between 20 and 40 years old. Two children are among
the known cases of HIV.
</P>
<P>
Almost 90 percent of cases contracted HIV sexually, 45 percent
through homosexual encounters. The remaining 10 percent
contracted the disease through either drug use, blood
transfusions, at birth, or under unknown circumstances, said the
paper.

<HEADLINE> SOCOG Releases Annual Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Olympic organizers
spent almost 1 million Australian dollars (660,000 U.S. dollars)
more on senior executive salaries in the last financial year than
for 1997-98, annual report of the SOCOG released Tuesday in Sydney
said.
</P>
<P>
In the report tabled in the New South Wales state parliament,
it was revealed the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games (SOCOG) spent 6,719,623 Australian dollars (4,434,951 U.S.
dollars) on wages for 25 executives in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
This amount was up from 5,733,039 Australian dollars (3,783,806
U.S. dollars) for 23 executives the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But a SOCOG spokesman said most of the increase came about
because nine of the executives were employed during 1997-98, so
only a percentage of their salaries was included in the annual
report for that year.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG's two highest paid executives earned between 450,000
Australian dollars (297,000 U.S. dollars) and 460,000 (303,600 U.S.
dollars last year and 20 made more than 200,000 (132,000 U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Advised to Normally Use Power, Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian National
Steering Committee for the Y2K has advised people all over the
country to make normal use of electricity and phone calls on the
eve of the New Year.
</P>
<P>
More calls and over-expenditure of electricity in houses would
eventually lead to overloading of equipment, said David Sawe,
adviser to the steering committee and coordinator for Y2K in the
east African countries.
</P>
<P>
Many people would be anxious to monitor different changes that
might happen around the world at the turn of the year, thus
prompting excess use of electricity and phones, the Guardian
newspaper Tuesday quoted Sawe as saying.
</P>
<P>
He assured people that Tanzania will not face shortage of
electricity or phone problems caused by Y2K problem because the
Tanzania Electric Supply Company and the Tanzania
Telecommunications Company have agreed to give normal service
around the new year.
</P>
<P>
Awareness on the issue has already been made all-over the
country, Sawe said, adding that what people need to know is to
adjust expenditure during the New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
To some other small companies who fear what could happen on the
date, Sawe advised that the best thing they can do is to close
down their services three days before and some other days after
the New Year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Steps up Law-making on Unrest Delta Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited bill on
development of Nigeria's Niger Delta may be passed this week by
the country's National Assembly, a Nigerian newspaper said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the Senate and the House of Representatives committees
involved in fine-tuning the bill accelerated their work on it
about two weeks ago, the Guardian reported.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Na'aba, Speaker of the House of Representatives, had
reportedly given a deadline to the tripartite committee of
Petroleum, Environment, and Human Rights and Judiciary to present
their recommendations to the committee of the whole House for
final scrutiny and passage.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Environmental Committee Mrs Almona Isichei, who
also heads the tripartite committee of the House on the bill, said
that "mark-up" work has been completed on the bill.
</P>
<P>
Many other members of the committees including Abayomi Sheba
and Nonyelum Macebuh also confirmed the bill would soon be passed.
</P>
<P>
The bill and another bill on anti-corruption are the first two
bills submitted by President Olusegun Obasanjo to the country's
top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly has been under attack for its tardiness
in making laws urgently needed for the country battered by years
of mismanagement of the military regimes.
</P>
<P>
The Niger Delta bill was submitted by Obasanjo after his visit
to Warri in June, the first visit he made out of the capital
Abuja, following an ethnic riot had claimed several hundred lives
there.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposed comprehensive development programs for the
oil- producing, yet poorest area in the most populous African
country.

Nigeria and intended to drill more exploration wells in the ultra
deep water areas.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Contraband Active in Nepal: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's open border with
India continues to be the safe haven for illegal trade in such
endangered species as tiger, leopards and rhinos, due to the lack
of legislation and coordination between the concerned authorities,
the Kathmandu Post reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report as saying that illegal trade of
bones, horns, hides, musks, and other organs extracted out of such
endangered animals like royal Bengal tiger, elephant, one-horned
rhinoceros, musk deer, snow leopards, and python are active in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal's open borders with India through the east, south and
west make it very difficult a job to investigate into whether or
not such illegal trades take place along the Indo-Nepal border,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared on the basis of field research and
interviews in Nepal's wildlife reserves by biologists from Britain
and a journalist from Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Nepal became the signatory of the Convention on Illegal Trade
in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1975. The signatories are obliged
to strictly curb and combat illegal trade in endangered species,
besides regulating borders prone to such trades.

<HEADLINE> China Holds Symposium on Maritime Industry Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An official symposium on
developing China's maritime industry through science and
technology was held here today in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology,
the State Oceanic Administration, the State Development Planning
Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture as well as
representatives from 17 coastal provinces and cities exchanged
their views and experience on the matter at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that the exploration of maritime
resources, which involves high risk and bulk investment, should
depend on high technology and comprehensive management by the
government.
</P>
<P>
China has over 18,000 km of coastline and 14,000 km of island
coasts with abundant maritime resources. The maritime industry has
become a new economic growth point for China's fast-developing
coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of "Developing Maritime Industry through Science
and Technology" was brought forward in 1994 with hundreds of
thousands of yuan in government funding for research.
</P>
<P>
The industry generated 327 billion yuan of output value or 5
percent of the country's total GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
During the years to come, the Ministry of Science and
Technology will step up the coordination with coastal regions in
the exploration to stimulate a more healthy development of the
industry.

<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- "Qiushi", or Seeking Truth, a
leading ideological magazine sponsored by the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, says the current international and
domestic situation is generally favorable for China's ongoing
reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
In its 23rd issue of the year, to be published on December 1,
the biweekly carries a commentary titled "Be Aware of the
Situation and Tasks", which contains a general assessment of China
's current international and domestic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
As the tendency toward multipolarization continues in the world,
the international situation has generally started to relax, while
peace and development have remained the main themes of the era,
the commentary says. It notes that a new world war could be
avoided for many years to come, even though factors for unrest
still exist globally.
</P>
<P>
The world is experiencing economic restructuring and rapid
progress in science and technology, and a greater role is being
played by transnational companies. Also, economic globalization
continues to have a profound impact on different nations, the
magazine says.
</P>
<P>
China, which is facing both new opportunities and daunting
challenges, should make full use of the favorable international
circumstances, take hold of the opportunities and stick to the
principle of making economic development its focal point. China
should engage in the modernization drive wholeheartedly to
strengthen the country's own economic power, national defense
capabilities and national cohesive force.

downward trends in the early months of the year, a constant
improvement in the people's living standards, and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The economic goals China set in the beginning of this year are
expected to materialize, it says.
</P>
<P>
However, there still exist certain prominent problems and
contradictions in China's economy, such as the inefficiency of
effective market demands, an increasing pressure of unemployment,
the slowness in the growth of farmers' income, and an irrational
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has achieved a relatively high economic
growth amid the complicated international and domestic situation
shows that the ruling CPC, which managed to achieve a "soft-
landing" for the country's overheated economy and inflation in the
mid-1990s, is also capable of dealing with the current deflation
under the new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It shows the ruling party has been able to manage a complicated
economic situation and tackle major economic issues, and meanwhile
its level of macro-economic management has been fundamentally
improved.

<HEADLINE> Tsang Welcomes Rating of HK as World's Freest Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang welcomed the news that Hong Kong has
retained its rating as the world's freest economy in the 2000
Index of Economic Freedom released by the Heritage Foundation and
The Wall Street Journal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a recognition that Hong Kong continues to adhere to
the free-market principles that have provided the opportunities
for our entrepreneurial and hard-working community to generate
such remarkable economic growth," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He said, "keeping our place at the top of this table of the
world's freest economies is a good way to see out the old
millennium and welcome the new."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he was delighted that Hong Kong had been rated the
world's freest economy every year since the Index was first
published in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Index of Economic Freedom was based on an analysis of
50 economic variables in 10 broad categories across 161 economies.
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted concerns raised in this year's report about the
1998 stock market incursion and the suggestion that the government
was favoring some sectors at the expense of others.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the concerns that were expressed when the world'
s freest economy was forced to intervene in the stock market in
1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it has now been widely accepted that the decision was
taken during exceptional circumstances that carried potentially
devastating consequences for our currency and economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was never our intention to hold onto the stocks and the
government has recently successfully disposed of some of the
shares through the TraHK Fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to disposing of a significant majority of
these holdings over time and in an orderly and transparent manner
so as not to disrupt the market," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the government had not departed from its long-held
philosophy of minimum intervention in economic management.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the government would favor one
section of the economy over another," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are, however, conscious of our responsibility to provide
the necessary infrastructure in response to market demands,
especially those arising from the ongoing shift to a knowledge-
based economy."
</P>
<P>
"We must recognize opportunities when they arise and act as a
facilitator to provide the new information-age infrastructure to
make this happen."

<HEADLINE> 100 Courts to Be Set Up In Pakistan on Corruption Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf said Tuesday that 100 courts will be
established throughout the country to try cases of corruption and
loan defaulters.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a local function in Turbat, southwest of Balochistan
province, Musharraf said six to eight courts will be set up in a
week's time to take up cases of corruption and loan default.
</P>
<P>
"We will recover the looted money and loans from corrupt people
and punish them for their deeds," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell you the truth. Corrupt people have looted this
country mercilessly. The treasury is empty and Forex reserves are
declining," he said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf stressed that his government was determined to
correct this situation by recovering bank loans from defaulters,
tax evaders and corrupt people.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow robbery any more and will take all those
responsible to task," said Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf assumed the office of Pakistan's Chief Executive
after a military coup on October 12 which toppled the 31-month-old
government of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has put fast and effective accountability including
recovery of defaulted loans on top of his agenda.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan has revealed that the amount of
defaulted loans stands as high as 210 billion rupees (4.1 billion
U.S. dollars), about 10 billion rupees of which have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
The new Pakistani government has so far established six
accountability courts to try the cases involving corruption and
loan default.

<HEADLINE> Beijing: Home of Prehistoric Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese
archeologists recently discovered traces of 47 cultural ruins
dating back 20,000 to 600,000 years ago, said Li Chaorong,
associate professor with the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology
and Paleoanthropology of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
"The most stunning find was the excavation of Paleolithic tools
during the construction of the Oriental Plaza in downtown Beijing,
" Li said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Peking Man who dated back 400,000 years might be related to
Beijing residents of a much later period," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese paleoanthropologist Pei Wenzhong stumbled upon the
fossilized skull of Peking Man in 1929 in Zhoukoudian, a Beijing
suburb.
</P>
<P>
Pei's discovery instantly made Zhoukoudian one of the world's
most important research center in the field.
</P>
<P>
However, little was known of Peking Man's descendants because
few further finds were made near Zhoukoudian, so many authorities
guessed that Peking Man had died out and had no descendants.
</P>
<P>
The 47 ruins are scattered in the suburbs and downtown
districts of the Chinese capital, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said further work could unravel the mystery of Peking Man
and their possible descendants.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Tunisian FMs Discuss Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa held talks on Tuesday with his Tunisian counterpart Habib
Ben Yahia on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Ben Yahia arrived in Cairo on Monday, accompanying Tunisian
President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The talks tackled the Middle East peace process and Arab and
international efforts aimed at helping advance the Arab-Israeli
peace talks, especially on the Palestinian track, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are negotiating for a final peace
agreement on the thorny issues including Jerusalem, refugees, the
Jewish settlements and borders. Syria and Israel have yet to
resume their talks suspended in 1996 due to disputes over the
return of the Golan Heights that Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Yahia examined inter-Arab relations, activation of
Arab joint actions and settlement of differences that stand in the
way of achieving Arab solidarity through setting up an Arab
mechanism, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia called for the establishment of the mechanism for
peaceful solution to Arab disputes at a meeting of the Arab
Foreign Ministers Council earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the issue of Iraq, which has yet to resume
cooperation with the United Nations Security Council in
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
They dealt with the Mediterranean security and stability in
light of cooperation between the two countries as partners in the
Arab Mediterranean group.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed bilateral cooperation within the Barcelona
process.
</P>
<P>
Twelve countries on the eastern and southern coast of the
Mediterranean Sea, including Egypt and Tunisia, and the 15
European Union nations kicked off the process during a 1995
meeting in Barcelona, Spain, which was aimed at forging close
cooperation among participants in the political, economic, social
and security fields.

<P>
TOKYO, November (Xinhua) -- European silver medalists Russia
won over Cuba to take a big step toward their first major title at
the World Cup men's volleyball tournament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, who have not won any of the sport's three major
events since 1991, played a solid game characterized by iron-fence
blocking to score a 25-15, 25-23, 25-18 victory.
</P>
<P>
With a display of good blocking on Cuban serves, the Russians
led 4-0 and 10-6 respectively to take the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
With the Cubans leading 3-2 and 5-3 in the third, Russian
Serguei Tetioukhine's powerful serves contributed three straight
points to his side for 8-6. They sealed the match and their win
in 64 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Russia lost to Cuba in three sets to finish runners-up in the
women's World Cup two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Russia stood with eight wins against one defeat, ahead of Cuba
and the United States, each with a 7-2 record in the 12-team round
robin. The top three teams earn a berth in the Sydney Olympics.

record and Brazil 5-4, keeping their hopes of qualifying for the
Sydney Olympics alive.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Fresh Turkish Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday vehemently condemned the fresh aggression carried out by
Turkish armed forces in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the Iraqi
News Agency that Turkish armed forces estimated at two brigades
launched on November 23 a fresh aggression against northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops, which were stationed in northern Iraq's Matin
Mountain and Cara Mountain regions, were involved in the fresh
military action under the pretext of cracking down on rebels of
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), he said.
</P>
<P>
Such aggression constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and infringes on the
U.N. Charter and international law, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq demands the Turkish government pull
out its aggressive forces from Iraqi territories and refrain from
repeating such hostile acts," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Iraq utterly rejected the "flimsy pretexts and
excuses" made by Turkey to justify its action.
</P>
<P>
The new round of attack came as part of a string of aggressions
committed by Turkish troops against Iraqi territories since the
"U.S.-led aggression" in 1991, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It coincides with the aggressive military acts by the U.S. and
Britain against Iraq to interfere in its internal affairs and to
perpetuate the abnormal status in northern Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi government lost its control
of the northern Kurdish autonomous region, and Turkish government
troops often launched cross-border offensives against rebels of
the PKK who have been seeking shelter there.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that "Iraq preserves its full right to
define time and venue to reply to such aggressive Turkish act."

CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Metropolitan Bank has been taken over by
the international bank Standard Chartered in a deal worth 25
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed in London on Monday between Murshid
Baaklini, Chairman of Metropolitan, and Patrick Gillam, Chairman
of Standard Chartered, the Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Baaklini said the deal was a vote of confidence for Lebanon
because it showed that interest in investing in the country was
not dented despite the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
With customer deposits of 81 million dollars and assets of 98
million dollars and a profit of 544,000 dollars in 1998,
Metropolitan is ranked 49th in Lebanon's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered, which employs 26,000 people in 500 offices
in more than 40 countries, made a half-year profit before
provision of 818 million dollars last June.
</P>
<P>
The bank has assets of more than 86.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Middle East Airline (MEA), Lebanon's flag carrier,
has obtained an international license to carry out repair work on
Airbus aircraft of international and regional airlines.
</P>
<P>
MEA's maintenance department received the approval early this
month from the Safety Group of Civil Aviation, which groups 34
countries, to repair A310s, A320s and A321s.
</P>
<P>
"We consider this deal to be a gold mine for the carrier,
because it would generate between 3 million U.S. dollars and 4
million dollars in revenues each year,"said Riad Mikaoui, head of
MEA's technical department.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Ministry of Economy has notified the
country's Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Mines to avoid
levying double taxation on foreigners, Iran Daily reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The law prohibiting double taxation on foreign nationals still
remains valid, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
A foreigner residing in Iran for less than 183 days will be
reimbursed the deducted tax after submitting necessary documents
and the taxpayer's declaration is compared with the contents of
the said law.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Arab Microsoft Company has recently launched a

</P>
<P>
The event was staged within the framework of a policy of making

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, which borders Hong
Kong in the neighboring Guangdong Province, is pushing more of its
fledgling high-tech companies into international and domestic
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
The city, which has one of the only two bourses in China, is
selecting well-performing technological companies for listing in
the second stock exchange, the Growth Enterprise Market, in Hong
Kong, which started trading last Thursday targeting startup high-
tech firms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preparations for establishing its own high-tech
stock trading board have already been underway, according to an
enlarged meeting of the municipal government held here today.
</P>
<P>
Officials agreed to adopt preferential policies to enable the
listing of more technology companies on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange, but did not give any details or timetable.
</P>
<P>
The city has created a framework for the venture capital market
by setting up the Shenzhen New Technological Investment Co. Ltd
and China (Shenzhen) High-Tech Foundation to give financial
assistance to promising technological companies.
</P>
<P>
There are now 120 technology companies listed on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange, accounting for 15 percent of the exchange's total
listed companies.
</P>
<P>
With an annual investment of 3.2 billion yuan for the
technological sector, which accounts for 2.29 percent of the total
gross domestic product, the city has become China's boomtown for
high-tech development. It hosted the country's first international
high technology fair in October.
</P>
<P>
The city can expect the high-tech sector to generate 80.4
billion yuan of output value this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Island Province Tackles Stockpiled Housing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Southernmost Province
of Hainan, which built more houses than it could sell this decade,
is putting some of the stockpile on the market at a national real
estate fair which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 real estate agents from across the country
attended the first day of the fair, with about one billion yuan
worth of business deals being struck, according to information
from the fair.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Island is considered the worst-hit by China's real
estate craze of the past few years. Though the island province is
home to just a fraction of the country's total population, the
backlog of housing accounts for one tenth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than seven million sq m of open-market housing
remains unsold, which has caused the stagnation of well over 40
billion yuan of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The houses were built during the real estate development mania
from 1993 to 1994, and China's biggest special economic zone then
became the country's largest housing construction site. In 1990
alone, the investment for real estate in Hainan climbed to 410
million yuan and then soared over the following four years.
</P>
<P>
The total construction scale of open-market housing in Hainan
stood at 36.69 million sq m from 1988 to 1997, of which 16.86
million sq m had been finished and only 9.74 million sq m had been
sold, leaving about half of the completed apartments empty.
</P>
<P>
The stockpiling in real estate has enormously affected the
healthy development of Hainan's economy. Since 1995, the real
estate blitz suffered a drastic cool-down, and investment in this
sector plunged by more than 30 percent for two years.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's economy has now entered a sluggish period, and the
province ranks low in the country in terms of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The situation also has caused the growth of non-performing
assets in Chinese banks. Negative impacts such as growing
financial risks and working capital difficulty in enterprises are
reported in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou cities and Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the country's highest governing body,
decided in July to designate Hainan as the national center to
experiment with handling the oversupply of real estate.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a State Council plan, the State will earmark
special funds for the experiment, and Hainan will market the
stockpiled housing at fixed prices. Preferential policies will be
introduced to encourage purchase of housing. Ordinary apartments
will be turned into affordable housing and a certain portion of
land transfer fees will be refunded.
</P>
<P>
State-subsidized housing, which used to be distributed at low
rental cost among government workers or workers of State-owned
enterprises, will be put onto the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to Liu, the funds account for well over 40 percent of
the non-repaid loans in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has encouraged banks to retrieve assets that belong to
them by seeking loan repayments and clarifying property rights.
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers should repay in cash the loans they
borrowed or use the real estate they bought to offset the loans.
Enterprises will be declared bankrupt if their loans exceed their
assets. Enterprises that operate other investment projects in
addition to real estate will be allowed to renew their mortgage
and repayment plans.
</P>
<P>
Asset management companies established by the four commercial
Chinese banks have all opened business offices in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan branches of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China,
Bank of China and China Construction Bank have retrieved more than
900 million yuan from the stockpiled housing in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Hainan has reclaimed 629 hectares of idle land
to start a province-wide registration program of clarifying the
property rights of stockpiled real estate. The registration
program will be finished this year.
</P>
<P>
As an experimental move, Haikou, the provincial capital, has
put on sale housing with a total floor space of 210,000 sq m at
fixed prices this month and flats with an aggregate floor space of
30,000 sq m have been sold. In eight other counties and cities
where stockpiling of open-market apartments is also serious, 980,
000 sq m of unoccupied flats are also for sale.
</P>
<P>
However, there is difficulty of completely wiping out all the
problems left over by an inflated real estate industry in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Xia Enshu, a local official in charge of rural and urban
construction, said that "it is impossible to fully rely on the
island market to absorb well over seven million sq m of stockpiled
housing, as per capita living space of urban residents in Hainan
reaches 14.8 sq m, the highest in the country."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, support is needed from the Chinese market outside
Hainan Island, and departments and real estate companies in Hainan
have begun exploring the potential outside the province, Xia said.

<HEADLINE> W.B. Recommends Anticorruption Measures for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday released
its preliminary report on recommendations that were submitted to
Philippine President Joseph Estrada to help his government
strengthen its fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
The basic strategy being recommended in the report is that the
government should intensify its efforts to reduce opportunities
and motivation for corruption and make corruption a high-risk,
low-reward activity.
</P>
<P>
The report also identifies some elements as essential to fight
corruption in the country, where corruption is a factor that
inhibits foreign and domestic investment and erodes the country's
competitive position.
</P>
<P>
Increasing the public's oversight to allow citizens to know
what officials are accountable for and how to judge their
performance is also an essential element for combating corruption,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said it is not enough to have a good anticorruption
strategy, adding that effectiveness in implementing the strategy
will be a key determinant of success.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are based on an ongoing study by a team of
experts from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in
response to the Philippine government's request to provide advice
on this matter.
</P>
<P>
The whole study is expected to be completed in early 2000, said
the report.

Great Hall of the People.

Chinese Party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu

</P>
<P>
Addressing the gathering, Wei Jianxing, one of the seven top
policy makers in China, said that over the past 50 years the China
Law Society has made a series of achievements in building a
socialist democratic legal system, and has provided powerful
theoretical support for the formation of a set of principles for
ruling the country by law.
</P>
<P>
There is no set example that China must follow, but rather, the
country will find its own road in accordance with its national
condition and socialist system. It should not blindly copy the
model of Western countries, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"We should highly value the establishment and development of a
legal system with Chinese characteristics. The experience of China
shows that only under the guidance of a legal theory with Chinese
characteristics can the country march forward along a correct path,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Party to lend great importance to the study of
social sciences, the same as it does for the natural sciences.
</P>

enhance guidance and create a better environment for legal
research, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Denies Link between Spy Cases in U.S., Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Spokesman Alexander
Zdanovich said Cherry Leberknight, a 33-year-old female staffer of
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was briefly held by the FSB after
being caught on the spot receiving classified military-strategic
materials from a Russian citizen.
</P>
<P>
The detention came after a U.S. Navy officer, Daniel King, was
charged with espionage for allegedly supplying Moscow with
information about the bugging of Russian submarines.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely nothing links these two cases. We do not even know
anything about the King case," the Interfax news agency quoted
Zdanovich as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We do no want to link these two events if only for the sole
reason that the eye-for-an-eye principle is alien to us. It's a
Cold-War principle," Zdanovich said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on reports that Leberknight had
collected information about Russia's nuclear potential.
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that she was detained in Moscow's Izmailovo
district when she was waiting for a Russian citizen. She was taken
to the FSB reception office at Kuznetsky Most where
representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the U.S.
Embassy had been invited." he said.
</P>
<P>
"Her future will be decided through diplomatic channels," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted experts in the Russian Foreign Ministry as
saying that in such cases the diplomat in question is usually
declared a persona non grata and then sent out of the country.
</P>
<P>
On the King case, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service refused
to confirm or deny assertions that King had cooperated with the
service.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with international practice we do not comment on
whether an individual is or is not connected with the Foreign
Intelligence Service," said Boris Labusov, a spokesman of the
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive Proud of HK's Title as World's Freest Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's title as the
world's freest economy will be the cornerstone that will guarantee
its continued economic success and competitiveness in the next
millennium, said Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Heritage Foundation and the
Asian Wall Street Journal, Tung said Hong Kong is certainly very
proud of having the title.
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly delighted today to hear that the Heritage
Foundation/Wall Street Journal has published its "2000 Index of
Economic Freedom" and named Hong Kong as the world's freest
economy - for the sixth straight year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After experiencing a period of nearly two years of
exceptionally difficult period, we have weathered the storm of the
Asian financial crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following a 0.7 percent growth in GDP in the second quarter of
this year, preliminary figures released last week show a robust 4.
5 percent GDP growth in the third quarter, said Tung, noting that
it is a pleasant surprise to almost all economic forecasters and
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Tung also pledged to provide the infrastructure in the next
century to meet the need of the information age and the knowledge-
intensive economy.
</P>
<P>
"But hardware is not enough, we need equally good software to
drive the hardware. To produce the knowledge workers needed for
the knowledge-based economy, we need to reform our education," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Exposing Falun Gong Sect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Scholars, scientists,
educators and former Falun Gong practitioners gathered in Beijing
today for a seminar to expose the anti-science nature of the Falun
Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guidian, a professor and dean of the Philosophy Department
of Beijing Teachers University, said that what Falun Gong sect
leader Li Hongzhi advocated was not based on science, and that the
main reason so many Falun Gong practitioners, even some
intellectuals, had no doubt about Li Hongzhi was a lack of
understanding of science and the humanities.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhuping, a graduate student at the People's University of
China, attributed his 10-month practice of Falun Gong to three
elements. First, the sect acted under the cloak of scientific
research. Second, Falun Gong said it stood for "truthfulness,
benevolence and tolerance." And third, he and many other
intellectuals had buried themselves in professional research and
neglected political study.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shulin, a professor at Qinghua University, said Falun Gong
is similar to sects in other countries which oppose the government
and society and spread the fallacy of doomsday. It is entirely
correct that the government banned the activities of Falun Gong he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Fangzhou, a research fellow of the Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences, said that it is imperative to raise the
scientific and cultural awareness of the entire nation, since this
has a bearing on China's development, stability and ultimate
destiny.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Hongying, a graduate student at Beijing University, said
the May 4th Movement of 80 years ago helped the Chinese people
embark on the road to revolution and science, and that it is a
long and arduous task to raise the public's awareness of
scientific method and see that they are able to reject
superstitions and sects, both old and new.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by the People's Daily and the
Guangming Daily.

promote its cooperation with Southeast Asian countries to "jointly
create a more bright future of Asia".
</P>
<P>
Noting China is a large nation with one-third population and
one-fifth territory of Asia, Zhu said its stability and prosperity
is vital to the whole continent's peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
More important, the premier said, China has been sticking to
the foreign policy of developing the friendly relations with other

existence.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is here for a three-day visit and in the third leg of
his Southeast Asia trip, said that China's economic progress
relied on Asia's development, and meanwhile the progress would
play an important and positive role in promoting Asia's
development, strengthening its capability against risk and
boosting the world's confidence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the past twenty and thirty years, Asia, especially East
Asia has enjoyed an economic boom and become one of the most
vigorous areas in the world, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu meanwhile put forth six proposals for keeping Asia's peace,
stability and prosperity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He first stressed China and other Asian states should develop
the good-neighboring and mutual-trust partnership under the
principles designed in the Joint Communique signed by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and the ASEAN leaders in 1997 and other
relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries should pay great attention to the trend of
economic globalization and take active and appropriate measures to
deal with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out education's basic status, Zhu urged great efforts
by Asian countries to promote the scientific level and the
capability of technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
Describing finance as the core of modern economy, Zhu, called
for the creation of a sound, steady, efficient and safe financial
system. He meanwhile stressed the essential function of the market
and the government in a country's economic developing process.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also reaffirmed China's policy to further tap the
cooperation potential with the ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
When dealing with differences and disputes between the two
sides, Zhu said China would set great store by the regional peace
and stability and solve them through equal and friendly
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Praising Singapore as the monetary and trade center in
Southeast Asia, Zhu hoped it would play a more important role in
improving the all-round cooperation between China and the ASEAN.

TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic world needs a
powerful information dissemination system in order to propagate
its viewpoints on global issues and confront foreigners' cultural

future strategies, the cooperation between China and Southeast
Asian countries and Sino-Singapore ties.
</P>
<P>
One of the strategies, according to Zhu, is to "implement the
strategy of an all-out development of western China and speed up
the development of its central and western regions."
</P>
<P>
"China's West covers a vast territory, boasts abundant
resources and a potentially big market and enjoys big potentials
for development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To open up the West and speed up the development of central
and western parts of China is a major policy decision that China
has made to usher in the new century," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Just as China's more prosperous east coast has contributed to
the benefits of the whole country, he said, the development of the
West will not only bring good to the eastern and central parts,
but also lead to greater prosperity of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here on Monday on a three-day official visit. He
met with Singapore President S.R. Nathan, Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the third leg of his four-nation Southeast Asian
tour which has already taken him to Malaysia and the Philippines.
Zhu will leave Singapore Wednesday for Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Resumes Open Debate on Conflict Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- An open debate on the U.
N. Security Council's role in the prevention of armed conflicts
Tuesday entered its second day as representatives of nearly 40
countries voiced their wish to take part in the debate.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council is expected to adopt a
presidential statement at the end of the debate, which began at 3:
00 p.m. EST Monday.
</P>
<P>
The debate is seen as part of the Council's ongoing effort to
enhance its effectiveness as the United Nations chief organ
responsible for the maintenance of international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Council at the outset of the debate, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday that while prevention was
one of the main tasks to the United Nations, far too often the
Organization found itself dealing with the effects of conflict,
rather than its roots.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the Security Council should bear the major
responsibility for the prevention of armed conflicts in the world
at large.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security.

<HEADLINE> Zhu: China to Continue Reform, Opening-up Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
reiterated here Tuesday that China will continue its reform and
opening-up policy in its development.
</P>
<P>
"Reform and opening-up are the only way leading to China's
modernization," Zhu said. "We will unswervingly push forward
reform and open China wider to the outside world."
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is here on a three-day official visit, made the
statement in a speech at the 17th Singapore Lecture. The Lecture
series was inaugurated by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies
in 1980 and designed to provide an opportunity for distinguished
statesmen and leaders to reach a wider audience in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to readjust and improve the ownership
structure to fit in with the socialist market economy to be put in
place through reform, and further encourage and guide a sound
development of the non-public sectors without prejudice to the
dominant role of the public ownership," he told an audience of
over 1,200 people including Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
and some senior government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that opening-up is a long-term basic state policy
of China, adding that China "will provide foreign businessmen with
more investment opportunities in the banking, insurance,
telecommunications, tourism, retail, foreign trade, legal
consultance and other services."
</P>
<P>
"We will also accelerate the opening-up in the energy,
transportation, communications, environmental protection and other
infrastructural areas," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, efforts will be made to encourage the
participation of foreign investment in the restructuring and
technological upgrading of state-owned enterprises in various
forms, improve services to foreign-funded enterprises, simplify
procedures of review and approval of such projects and improve the
efficiency, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said he believed China will become one of
the world's most attractive regions for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu flew in Monday from the Philippines, where he also attended
the third informal summit meetings between ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) and China, Japan and South Korea, and
between ASEAN and China.

<HEADLINE> China Outlines Three Strategies for Continuous Growth, Says Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said here Tuesday that China has outlined three strategies for
sustained economic development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the statement at his speech entitled "China and Asia
in the New Century" at the 17th Singapore Lecture. Zhu said the
Chinese economy has maintained a good momentum of development
despite new problems and challenges such as the Asian financial
crisis and last year's floods in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is on a three-day visit to Singapore,
said China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.8 percent in 1998
from that of the previous year and it gained a 7.4 percent growth
in the first nine months of this year, compared with the
corresponding period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Chinese currency Renminbi has remained
stable and the country's foreign exchange reserves have reached
152 billion U.S. dollars and the living standard of rural and
urban Chinese is continuously improving, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chinese premier said, "the Chinese economy is still
facing some difficulties and problems, among which mainly are a
lack of effective demand, a protruding structural contradiction
and pressure of rising unemployment."
</P>
<P>
Aiming at resolving these problems and keeping in mind the long-
term development in the next century, Zhu said, China has decided
to adopt three strategies: continuing to expand the domestic
demand, optimizing and upgrading the industrial structure and
speeding up development in Central and West China.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand the domestic demand and boost economic
growth by increasing investment and encouraging consumption, the
Chinese government will continue to implement an active financial
policy and let the monetary measures to play their role while
using other macro-control methods, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to launch long-term development bonds next
year to convert part of the huge bank deposits by Chinese into
construction funds, a bulk of which will be spent on building
basic infrastructure facilities, upgrading technologies in
factories and increasing fund for education as well as science and
technology development.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned commercial backs will lend more to basic
infrastructure projects, ensure money-making enterprises to have
enough floating capital and increase loans to medium- and small-
sized businesses, and pay more attention to the demand for loans
for education and housing, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China will make strategic adjustments to the economic
structure and work hard to bring about a structural optimization
and upgrading.
</P>
<P>
China will concentrate on upgrading enterprises by relying on
technological innovation and progress and being guided by demands
from domestic and foreign markets, he said. More emphasis will be
put on the development in the service sector, especially in
information, tourism and community service.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said backward production capacities and equipment will be
discarded resolutely and new hi-technologies will be widely
applied to revitalize those traditional industries, whose products
have a good market demand.
</P>
<P>
China needs to speed up the development of hi-tech industries
in an effort to build an information-based national economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the strategy for economic development in Central and West
China, the Chinese premier said the focal point for now and time
to come is placed on speeding up basic infrastructure construction,
improving environment and raising the educational and scientific
and technological levels to create favorable conditions for a
rapid economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The western region (of China), which is wide in area and rich
in resources, has tremendous market and development potentials,"
Zhu said, adding that China invites and welcomes foreign investors
to invest in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived Monday in Singapore, the third leg of his four-
nation Southeast Asia visit which has taken him to Malaysia and
the Philippines. He is scheduled to leave Singapore for Vietnam on
Wednesday.
