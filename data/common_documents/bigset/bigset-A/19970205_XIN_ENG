<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Settle Liquor Tax Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Taxes on European whisky,
brandy, gin, vodka and other spirits entering Japan will be
slashed soon following the settlement of a long-running dispute
over Japanese liquor tax, a European Commission spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
The current tax levels on imported brown spirits such as whisky
and cognac is 600 percent higher than that for local products.
But the gap will be narrowed to three percent as taxes on European
spirits are slashed and taxes on Japanese products are increased.
</P>
<P>
For white spirits like vodka and gin, currently taxed 250 percent
higher than local products, tax discrimination will be completely
scrapped, with both being taxed equally in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Intensive discussions between the European Union (EU) and
Japan have led to an agreement under which tax on imports into
Japan will be reduced and brought closer to tax levels on local
spirits," the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The changes will be introduced in two stages with the first on
October 1, 1997, and the second a year later, the Commission
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Addresses Figures of Non-Communist Parties(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary and
President Jiang Zemin, at a gathering of personages of
non-communist parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce today, discussed Hong Kong's return to the motherland and
the convening of the Party congress later this year, describing
the two events as of great significance in the history of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the get-together marking the Chinese New Year that
Hong Kong's return has been a long-held wish of all the Chinese
people and the successful resolution of the Hong Kong issue
represents a great accomplishment for China in carrying out the
"one country, two systems" policy put forth by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the event will produce a great and
far-reaching impact on the reunification of the motherland and
immensely inspire the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party, to be convened in autumn this year, will
sum up the Party's experiences in reform, opening to the outside
world and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Also, the conference will further develop a strategic plan
concerning the major issues of reform, development, and stability,
with a view to deepening reforms and strengthening Party building,
so as to push ahead with the great cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics in an overall manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party,
observed that the non-communist parties and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce are in a period of transition,
with the young replacing the old.
</P>
<P>
The election of a new generation of leaders is of strategic
importance to the continuation and perfection of the system of
multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the
Chinese Communist Party, he said, adding that it has a direct
bearing on the carrying forward of the fine traditions and the
full performance of the functions of the non-communist parties,
too.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it is not only a matter of personnel
change, but also a politically important changing of guards.
</P>
<P>
This should be accomplished with a view to further development
of the political programs of those parties, to expansion of their
close and cooperative relations with the Communist Party, and to
the carrying forward of the firm political beliefs, fine qualities
and styles of the old generation of the parties' leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed confidence that the new generation of leaders
of the non-communist parties and the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce will shoulder the historical responsibility
of leading all their members in adhering to and perfecting the
system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led
by the Communist Party and making greater contribution to the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Zaire's Neighbors Against Invading Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- France today issued a warning to
Zaire's neighbors against their invasion of Zairean territory,
following a new defeat suffered by the Zairean government forces
from the Tutsi rebels in the eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The countries of the region say that they are attached to the
respect of the territorial integrity of Zaire. The possible
presence of the troops of foreign intervention was contrary to the
respect of the principles of attachment to the territorial
integrity of Zaire," said French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman,
Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is very careful about any indication which
could confirm the presence of foreign troops in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the demand by Zaire for military help from Morocco,
the spokesman said that Zaire has the right to self-defense.
</P>
<P>
But he said that France is observing the arms embargo imposed
by the European Union on Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Zaire said that the Tutsi rebels are now
approaching the copper-bearing province of Shaba in southern
Zaire, after capturing the strategic port of Kalemie bordering the
Tanganyika Lake.
</P>
<P>
Shaba, formerly called Katanga, tried to secede from Zaire upon
the latter's independence in 1960 from Belgium, and saw a
rebellion in 1977, which was suppressed by Zaire with support from
France, Morocco and Egypt.

<P>
Jiang stressed that unity constitutes an important guarantee
for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the reunification
of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Referring to achievements of 1996, Jiang said that a good
beginning was made for the Ninth Five Year Plan period
(1996-2000), as the country enjoys economic prosperity, social
stability and national unity. Practice has proven the Party
Central Committee's major policies and decisions to be correct, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, many new problems and difficulties remain in
the course of development, which in general have emerged against
the backdrop of reform, opening and the change of the economic
system.
</P>
<P>
While traditional methods and practice still apply, it's more
important to explore new methods, new measures and new practice
amidst new historical conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was presided over by Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and Chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech himself, Li said that remarkable progress
was made last year with a full range of undertakings, with
breakthroughs made in some areas, under the leadership of the
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Also, fresh experience was accumulated in practice, which will
play an important role in future development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The successful accomplishment of the two major events in 1997
asks for doubled-up efforts of the whole nation, Li said, calling
on the non-communist parties and the federation of industry and
commerce to work hard towards greater achievements.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the non-communist parties and the All China
Federation of Industry and Commerce spoke on ways to fulfill the
tasks of 1997, saying they will be closely united around the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party with Jiang Zemin
at the core, conscientiously serve the overall interest of the
nation, and ensure a successful changing of guards and political
transfer in their respective parties.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Nawaz Sharif, who headed Pakistan's government once before,
appeared to have won in elections that would make him Prime
Minister. The voter turnout was the lowest in Pakistan's history,
reflecting a widespread disillusionment with the country's
democracy.
</P>
<P>

expects troops from other African countries to help its army
contain an uprising by Tutsi-led rebels in the eastern part of the
country.

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he will warn
President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in Washington
this week that a rapid expansion of NATO into central Europe
threatens to undermine the Yeltsin government and will fuel
extremist demands in Russia for a return to armed confrontation
with the West.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
provided pledges of cooperation to the nation's governors' on
Monday, but provided few assurances to relieve governors' fears

on the states.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Manufacturing marched at a slightly slower pace in January
than in December, the first indication of what many analysts
believe will be the overall economy's trend in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
-- Production at Toyota Motor Corp.'s plants in Japan, which
build 16,200 vehicles a day, has virtually ground to a halt and
could be suspended for up to a week or more after a fire at a
brake maker's plant cut off the supply of three brake and clutch

</P>
<P>
The overall deficit is expected to be 6.1 billion U.S. dollars,
with revenues reaching 123.3 billion dollars and expenditures
totaling 129.4 billion dollars.
</P>

ROME, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian national team coach Cesare
Maldini announced the Italian squad for the World Cup qualifier
against England at Wembley on February 12.
</P>
<P>
Maldini made two changes to his first international outing,
calling Enrico Chiesa and Christian Panucci.
</P>
<P>
The two players failed make the Italian team in the friendly

</P>
<P>
Chiesa is one of the top scorers in the Italian first
division. Last season he scored 22 goals for Sampdoria.
</P>
<P>
But Chiesa is unlikely to start against England as Maldini will
probably field the combination of Pierluigi Casiraghi and
Gianfranco Zola in the front.
</P>
<P>
Following are the 21-player Italian team for the Italy-England
World Cup qualifier:
</P>
<P>
Goal-keeper: Angelo Peruzzi; Francesco Toldo

<HEADLINE> Foreign Auto Makers Shows Biggest Gains in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign auto makers showed
the biggest sales gains in the U.S. auto market last month as the
strong dollar continued to help them offer low prices.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine auto makers which reported their January sales
Monday, sales rose by 2.3 percent from a year ago, according The
New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
But foreign auto makers saw their combined sales increased by
10.9 percent in the month while U.S. Chrysler Corporation's sale
was up by only 1.5 percent and GM sale down by 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japanese auto makers were major winner in increasing their
sales in the U.S. market last month. Among them, Honda's sales
increased by 21.1 percent and Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy
Industries, up by 24.5 percent. Nissan's sale gained by 10.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota Motor Corporation and the Ford Motor Company will
announce their sales today.
</P>
<P>
The market share of Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda and Mitsubishi
combined is likely to reach 21 percent in the U.S. in January, up
from 19 percent a year ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the quick increase of Japanese cars and
trucks sales in the U.S. market resulted from a continuing rising
of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has risen 52 percent against the Japanese yen from
its low in April of 1995. A strong dollar makes it cheaper for
Japanese auto makers to ship cars to U.S. from overseas.

<HEADLINE> US, France, Britain Agree on Freezing Nazis Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Britain
and France have reportedly agreed to freeze the distribution of 68
million U.S. dollars in gold bars that were looted by the Nazis
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The agreement could lead to the creation of a fund to
compensate the Nazi victims, local newspapers today quoted senior
U.S. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The gold bars have been stored in the vaults of the U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank in New York and at the Bank of England since
Switzerland, Sweden and other nations turned them over to Allied
powers, the New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 400 tons of gold looted by Nazis was returned to
central banks of the European nations soon after the end of World
War II. But the Tripartite Commission, which was created under a
1946 agreement to determine how to return the assets, still keeps
four tons of the gold.
</P>
<P>
The decision to freeze the gold, the Washington Post said,
could represent "an important breakthrough in the impasse" over
how to compensate survivors who claim that they have been unable
to retrieve assets that were deposited in Swiss banks during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has been under pressure since last year
from Jewish organizations, which accuse the Swiss banks
unresponsive to claims by Holocaust survivors for the money and
assets left in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> European Banks Slow in Preparing for Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LONDON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Only one in four European banks
and other financial institutions has begun to change its computer
system to handle the European single currency, according to a
survey carried in today's Financial Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Gemini Consulting, revealed although
85 percent of the bankers surveyed believed the single currency
could be introduced on time, 91 percent said that they had still
received no clear statement from their software suppliers about
what needed to be done to make their programs handle the single
currency named Euro.
</P>
<P>
Six out of ten believed that British banking industry would
still be unprepared for the European Monetary Union (EMU) by
January 1 1999 when the EMU is scheduled to be formally launched.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 percent of those surveyed noted that they had started
work on systems changes, another 26 percent said their assessment
of the impact of the EMU was complete.
</P>
<P>
However, 48 percent said that they were still "getting
organized" while 11 percent admitted they had not even started.
</P>
<P>
Jo Owen, vice-president of Gemini Consulting, said that the
survey contained a stark message about the preparations for the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
"Although the current debate is sharply focused on its
macroeconomic and political aspects of Euro, the underlying
reality is that the banks and other financial institutions may not
be ready to handle the Euro," he said.

The gain was strongest in the Northeast with an increase of 36.4
percent. They rose by 12 percent in the South, 11.2 percent in the
West and 9.6 percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
But the sales were down by 1 percent in December from the month
before.
</P>
<P>
In last December, sales shot up by 46.7 percent in the Midwest
to the highest monthly level for that region in three years. Sales
fell by 16.7 percent in the West, 6.7 percent in the South and 3.3
percent in the Northeast.

<P>
The housing industry has been one of the chief sources of
strength of U.S. economy during its six-year expansion.
</P>
<P>
Strong new home sales have reduced the inventory of completed
but unsold homes to a 5.2 months supply at the end of last year,
down from 6.6 months a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes in the U.S. also have been strong as
well. According to a previous report by the U.S. National
Association of Realtors, existing home sales totaled 4.09 million
last year, up by 7.5 percent from 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today
further eased the closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, allowing more Palestinians into Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, additional 5,000 work
permits have been issued to Palestinians from the Gaza Strip,
which brings to 27,000 the number of work permits issued to the
Gaza residents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, entry permits have been granted to 800
Palestinian businessmen from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as
well as 100 Palestinians who work in the tourist industry inside
Israel from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza trip
following a series of suicide bombing attacks in February and
March last year, which left more than 60 people dead and over 100
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The almost one-year-old closure has barred tens of thousands
of Palestinian workers from returning to their jobs inside
Israel, causing serious economic problems in the Palestinian
self-ruled West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air-Safety Panel Recommends New Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A White House commission is
recommending a sweeping set of air-safety measures including the
installation of electronic anti-missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
The commission, in the draft recommendations, urged the U.S.
government to "prepare for use of surface-to-air missiles by
terrorists," The Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The commission called for the Defense Department and Federal
Aviation Administration to work with defense contractors and
airlines over the next three years to install electronic
anti-missile defense systems on those "civil aircraft facing the
greatest threat."
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are contained in a draft report prepared by
the 21-member air safety commission headed by Vice President Al
Gore and the final report could be released as early as next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission was set up following the July 1996 explosion of
TWA Flight 800 which killed all 230 people aboard the Boeing 747.
Investigators have not determined whether a missile, a bomb, or a
mechanical malfunction caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
Other safety proposals include more detailed inspections of
aging aircraft and new fees for upgrading air traffic control
systems.

<HEADLINE> Animal Diseases Rampant in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, FEBRUARY 4 (Xinhua) -- African Farmers and
veterinarians are very much concerned about animal diseases,
which have brought considerable econom2h[%D/')}}|Z,Untries on
the continent, a top official of an African veterinary society
said today.
</P>
<P>
Paul Bosman, Acting president of Office International Des
Epizooties (OIE)' African Commission, said a number of animal
diseases which are already under control on other parts of the
world, are still rife in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Bosman, heads from African VA4arinary Services
throughout Africa held a forum in Pretoria, the administrative
capital of South Africa, last week to foucs on the worsening
problem. The four-day meeting ended at weekend.
</P>
<P>
The popular epizootic diseases include rinderpest, swine
fever, foot-and-mouth disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
and African horse sickness.
</P>
<P>
Such diseases have "severly penalized livestock production and
in many stances prevents numerous African countries from
exporting to markets of Europe, Asia or the Middle East", Bosman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most serious problem facing African countries
appeared to be the spread of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia,
which killed a large number of cattle, reduced their fertility
and supply of milk, meat and manure.
</P>
<P>
The weekend veterinarians' meeting have made recommendations
that veterinary public health actions be strengthened in OIE
member countries and international programs for disease control
be set up. enditem

<HEADLINE> Stolen Parthenon Rock Returned to Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Cultural Minister
Evangelos Venizelos today took delivery of a small piece of marble
removed from the famous Athens Acropolis more than 40 years ago by
an unidentified German who last month returned it by mail to the
Greek embassy in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"This gesture is of little material consequence but of
enormous symbolic significance," Venizelos said.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for the return of the Parthenon marbles is not just
another case of cultural objects being returned to their place of
origin. It has to do with the restoration of the aesthetic
integrity of one of the greatest monuments of world civilization,
which was chosen by UNESCO as its logotype and emblem. I hope the
message is clear to all internationally," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister later handed the marble over to the archeological
service. the piece, about the size of a large pebble, is believed
to have been removed by a German tourist or occupation soldier.
</P>
<P>
In a type-written letter accompanying the marble, the anonymous
German wrote:
</P>
<P>
"this rock belongs to Greece. Many years ago I removed it
</P>
<P>
... I am returning it now because due to my age I am not likely
to visit Athens again. Please make sure it is returned near the
temple of Athina..."
</P>
<P>
Successive Greek governments have sought the return of the
Parthenon marbles from the British museum. the ancient sculptures
were removed in 1806 by British ambassador to Constantinople,
Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin.
</P>
<P>
The estimated 253 pieces include the Parthenon frieze by
Phidias, a caryatid and a column from the Erechtheum.

ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The counting of votes for

217-seat National Assembly.

</P>
<P>
The PML(N) chief, Nawaz Sharif, is set to become Pakistan's new
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
By getting an unexpectedly low number of 17 seats in the
National Assembly, the PPP led by former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto is to take a back seat after having played a major role in
the country's political arena for the past three decades.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: PML(N) Wins 1997 General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- After having been in
opposition for more than three years, the Pakistan Muslim League
(PML-N) led by Nawaz Sharif is set to become the ruling party
following its landslide victory in the general elections held on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Having crushed its arch rival the Pakistan People's Party (PPP)
in the fifth general elections since the lifting of the martial
law at the end of 1985, the PML(N) is now cruising on to gain a
two-third majority in the National Assembly with the support of
its allies and others.
</P>
<P>
According to the results announced so far, the PML(N) has won
an overwhelming victory in the national polls by getting a
majority of 134 seats in the 217-seat National Assembly and Sharif
is set to become Pakistan's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) has unexpectedly won 211 seats in the 248-seat
provincial assembly of Punjab, its power base. It has also secured
31 of the 83 provincial assembly seats in the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP).
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) is now set to form its government in both Punjab and
NWFP with a solid majority.
</P>
<P>
The PPP led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has now
virtually been reduced by the PML(N) to a provincial party. It has
so far got merely 17 seats in the National Assembly and
astonishingly only two seats in the Punjab Provincial Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The PML(N) has also performed well in Sindh Province, the power
base of the PPP, getting 14 seats, while the PPP has so far won 34
seats there.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted that it is the worst defeat the
PPP has suffered in the general elections in Pakistan's history.
With announcement of three National Assembly seats still awaited
from the Election Commission, it is expected that the PPP this
time will get no more than 20 seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's PPP will have to take a back seat after having played
a major role in Pakistan's political arena for the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
Though Bhutto herself has been successful in securing the two
National Assembly seats she had contested, many of the PPP's
prominent figures have vanished from the election arena.
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note that cricketer-turned-politician
Imran Khan has been badly defeated in almost all the eight
constituencies he contested while his newly-formed Pakistan
Tereek-e-Insaaf Movement of Justice also failed to fetch any
national and provincial assembly seat.
</P>
<P>
The PML Junejo faction (PML-J), which had broken away from the
Nawaz Group to help the PPP from the federal government and the
provincial government in Punjab after the 1993 polls, has been
swept away this time in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Another important aspect of the 1997 elections is that
religious political parties have lost public sympathy, resulting
in their failure to obtain a considerable number of national and
provincial assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
The Haq Parast Group, widely known as the Mohajir Qaumi
Movement (MQM), which boycotted the elections in 1993 in protest
against alleged administrative interference, has returned to
Pakistan's political mainstream in Monday's polls and is closely
behind the PPP with 12 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Awami (People's) National Party (ANP), which has
been allied with the PML(N) for a decade, has given an impressive
electoral performance in NWFP. It has so far won nine seats in the
National Assembly and 28 seats in the NWFP assembly.
</P>
<P>
As one of the new faces, Ghinwa Bhutto, widow of Benazir's
brother Murtaza, could not manage to get the votes in her
contested constituency and lost the seat to her mother-in-law
Nusrat Bhutto, widow of the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Ghinwa's party, the PPP (Shaheed Bhutto), got only one seat in
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, the unprecedented interest shown by the Pakistani
women in politics has sent five of them to the National Assembly
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Women this time came out in as many as 36
constituencies in the largely male-dominated hustings. Never
before had women contested the National Assembly elections for
general seats.
</P>
<P>
Monday's general elections were largely peaceful except for
scattered incidents of violence. However, the estimated voter
turnout of less than 30 percent is believed to be among the lowest
in Pakistan's history.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Warns NATO Expansion Causes Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vikto
Chernomyrdin indicated that a rapid NATO expansion could bring a
return to armed confrontation with the West.
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about Russia," Chernomyrdin was quoted by today's
Washington Post in an interview as saying. "Developments in Russia
could take an ominous turn."
</P>
<P>
The West "wants us to explain to our people that there is
nothing to fear. How can we explain this? Nobody is going to
listen to any explanations", the Russian premier said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who is due to arrive here on Thursday, stressed
that the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into
central Europe threatens to undermine the Yeltsin government.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that NATO sign with Russia "a binding treaty, with
verification" that would commit the alliance to change from a
military body into a "political organization" that would not treat
Russia as its main threat and enemy.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders including Yeltsin have denounced NATO's
expansion plans from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The west is planning to sign an informal security charter at
the NATO summit scheduled in July.
</P>
<P>
Opposing firmly NATO'S expansion and the informal charter,
Chernomyrdin demanded a NATO-Russian treaty that would be
verifiable, "transparent" and ratified by the legislature of
signatories.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to sign a charter, just another document...
for the sake of signing it," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO must commit itself to being "of a completely different
content. If it's a political organization, please, anybody is
welcome to join. Whoever wants to join, please," the Russian
premier said.
</P>
<P>
But NATO leaders "cant't explain what is the meaning of reform,
what are the objectives of NATO today", he added.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian PM to Visit Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula
Horn will visit Canada from February 9 to 13, Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien announced today.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be the first official one ever made to Canada by
a Hungarian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Horn's presence "will mark a significant step
forward in the warm and friendly relations between Canada and
Hungary," Chretien said while announcing the visit.
</P>
<P>
"The visit will be an opportunity to explore how we can build
on this solid foundation, and tap the exceptional potential for
expanding trade and investment links," Chretien added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Horn is scheduled to meet with Chretien,
Governor General Romeo LeBlanc and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade ties between Canada and Hungary are
expanding. Government figures show that Canadian private sector
has invested over 150 million U.S. dollars in Hungary, and trade
between the two is growing steady.

<P>
Ngawang Cheophel confessed to his wrongdoing, and was
sentenced to 18 years in prison by the Xigaze Intermediate
People's Court. He was also deprived of his political rights for
four years, Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
After the initial ruling, Ngawang Cheophel, appealed the
sentence to a higher court, and the second hearing is going on,
Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals like Ngawang Cheophel, who endanger state security
and engage in espionage, would be punished in accordance with the
law in any country with a sound legal system," Tian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It is a complete distortion of the truth for the United States
government to call a person engaging in espionage as a visiting
scholar and his punishment an example of China's violation of
human rights," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
Tian gave another example of the US government's accusing China
of intolerance in relation to human right groups in the report,
claiming that Wang Dang was given an 11-year prison term in 1996
for intending to investigate human rights conditions in China in
1994.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tian said, Wang's conviction was upheld because of his
activities where he intended to "conspire to subvert the
government", something that was backed by evidence provided by
Wang himself.
</P>
<P>
"The United State government was expecting to repeat its lies
so often that it would make it sound real," Tian explained.
</P>
<P>
A number of scholars pointed out that the so-called "evidence"
provided by the report was mainly based on Western media reports,
the statements of overseas "democratic movement activists", and on
distortions of speeches of Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
A human rights report based on this kind of "evidence"
obviously arises from ulterior motives and is irresponsible, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Refute US Human Rights Report (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dong Yunhu, a professor at the Central Party School of the
Chinese Communist Party, said that the United States government in
its report found fault with China for "violation of
internationally accepted norms," and "absence or inadequacy of
laws providing for fundamental human rights."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chinese constitution contains more articles on
human rights protection than the American Constitution does, and
the Chinese stipulations and measures are more concrete. "The US
side is simply not qualified to comment on human rights protection
in China," Dong noted.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of the United States does not even acknowledge
economic, social, and cultural rights as part of human rights, and
still does not provide for the principle of ethnic and sexual
equality, as well as equality of rights for all citizens, Dong
said.
</P>
<P>
There is not one word in its constitution calling for or
entitling the government to promote human rights, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The United States' constitution is below the international
level in terms of human rights protection," Dong quoted a US
constitutional scholar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United States tops the world in violent crimes, which
victimize 6 million people annually and kill 24,000 of its
citizens, according to a recent US report. The death rate from
violent crimes is ten times that of China.
</P>
<P>
There are currently over 1.63 million inmates in the country,
or 6.15 per thousand of the total population, and over 5.36
million people or 2.8 percent of the adult population serving a
sentence at the moment, accordint to latest official US statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The figures are times higher than those in China," Dong said,
adding that "this demonstrates the judicial system's inability to
compete with Chinese justice in cracking down on crimes and
safeguarding individual human rights and citizens' freedoms, and
that the US government is not qualified to find fault with China
in this respect."
</P>
<P>
Liu Wenzong, a professor at the Foreign Affairs Institute of
China, and Liu Nanlai, a research fellow with the China Academy of
Social Sciences, said that the world is made up of sovereign
states, and that one state cannot put itself above another.
</P>
<P>
The US State Department has been issuing yearly Human Rights
Reports, they pointed out, making unreasonable accusations against
other countries but without saying just which international
organization, international conference, or country has given it
the right to be "human rights judge of the world."
</P>
<P>
The US government is not "a government of the world, nor does
it have the status or the right to spread irresponsible comments
and accusations against others," Liu Wengzong said.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the United States itself is plagued with notorious
racial discrimination, violence, terrorism, an AIDS outbreak, an
increasing number of single parent families, homeless people,
prejudice against women, abuse of children, and other human rights
woes, Liu Nanlai said.
</P>
<P>
Its criticisms have no legal, moral or factual basis and are
bound to meet with opposition from an increasing number of
countries, and strong condemnation from the entire international
community, he said.

<HEADLINE> No Irregularity in Pakistan's Election: Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 5 (Xinhua) -- European observers today
expressed satisfaction over the conduct of the February 3 general
elections in Pakistan and said they did not see any irregularity.
</P>
<P>
"The results reflected the wishes of those who voted," Tana de
Zuleta, leader of the European Union observers group, told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. group was among those invited by the Pakistani
government to monitor the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Zuleta said they did have a considerable discussion with their
colleagues from the Commonwealth and there was absolutely no
discrepancy in the view that the overall impression was positive.
</P>
<P>
The "shortcoming" observed and incidents reported in a small
proportion of voting stations "did not in the view of the observer
group alter the final outcome," Zuleta said.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the voters were properly served by the election
officials, she said.
</P>
<P>
The observers expressed their delight at the inclusion of the
tribal areas among those enjoying the franchise but said there
were some difficulties because it was the first time.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. observers group included 41 representatives and
experts from seven E.U. countries -- France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Britain.

BONN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The German government today gave a
cautious welcome to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's
decision to recognize opposition victories in local elections
last year.
</P>
<P>
Calling Belgrade's decision "a first positive signal", German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, stressed in a statement that much
still needs to be done to put Serbia on a firm path to democracy.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed a long-awaited acknowledgement from
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday of his Socialist
Party's loss in the capital Belgrade and other 13 localities where
the opposition claimed victory in last November's elections.
</P>
<P>
But Kinkel called on Belgrade to take further steps, including
the opening of a dialogue with opposition forces, more media
freedom, creation of fair conditions for Serbian general elections
at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic's refusal to accept the results of the November 17
elections triggered an unprecedented wave of protests that went
into their 77th day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition victories were confirmed by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which Milosevic invited to
the country in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the international community and the mass
demonstrations which had grown increasingly violent in recent days,
Milosevic publicly issued a directive on Tuesday to restore the
original outcome of the elections.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to give a
management know-how test to directors of all state-owned
enterprises this year to winnow away unqualified personnel and
improve state industry performance.
</P>
<P>
This message from a State Economic and Trade Commission
official, coming as it does just two days before the annual Spring
Festival on February 7, will surely send a chill down the spines
of managers in money-losing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked that his name not be mentioned, said
that China will also provide training sessions on the latest
management theory for heads of 1,000 major state-owned enterprises
this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that of all the country's money-losing enterprises, 60
percent are the result of poor management, and that "Some
enterprise leaders see reforms as busying themselves making deals
with foreigners, going overseas for inspection tours, and starting
new projects, without paying much attention to the intricacies of
management."
</P>
<P>
He said that the State Trade Commission will also prepare
measures to improve supervision of management in state-owned
enterprises this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Refute US Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scholars
have strongly criticised the US State Department Human Rights
Country Reports for the year 1996, which was released last week.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar in Beijing today, the scholars maintained that the
January 30 State Department report violates the goals and basic
principles of the UN Charter and completely ignores the progress
that China has made in protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
This malicious and slanderous attack on China's human rights
record only serves to expose its real intension of interfering in
other countries' internal affairs under the excuse of human
rights, according to human rights researchers and experts in the
fields of history, philosophy, law, social sciences, and
journalism.
</P>
<P>
"The report is full of groundless accusations and intentional
fabrications," Tian Dan, deputy secretary-general of the China
Society for the Study of Human Rights, commented. He cited the
report's allegation that "Chinese authorities also detained
foreigners visiting Tibet, searched them", claiming that a
visiting foreign scholar, Ngawang Choephel, was detained by
Chinese authorities and sentenced to 18 years in prison for making
a documentary film about Tibetan's performing arts.
</P>
<P>
The facts, however, are somewhat different. According to Tian,
the 30-year-old native of the Zanda County of Tibet's Ngari
Prefecture, who used to be a teacher in the song and dance troupe
of the Dalai Lama's "government in exile," was sent by the Dalai
Lama clique in July of 1995 to gather information in Tibet under
the guise of making a documentary about Tibetan performing arts,
with equipment and funding provided by a certain country.
</P>
<P>
Ngawang Choephel followed an 'outline for intelligence
gathering' that had been prepared, in Lhasa, Shanna, Nyingchi and
Xigaze in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Chinese security
departments obtained ample evidence to prove the espionage charge
and arrested him in accordance with the law, Tian noted.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Herbert Liang, president of
the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong (CMA), has
voiced full confidence in Hong Kong's economic prospects in
Toronto, Canada, CMA sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong now enjoys a favorable macroeconomic environment,
with both the internal and external factors improving," Liang said
 in a speech Tuesday at a dinner reception of the Toronto Hong
Kong Lions Club. "Our competitiveness as an investment
destination for overseas has become more appealing."
</P>
<P>
He presented an optimistic view on the economic achievements of
 Hong Kong in 1997, with the real gross domestic product up 5.3
percent, exports 9 percent and inflation 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The uncertainties hovering over Hong Kong's political scene
have been cleared" after the election of the first chief executive
 of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the formation
of the Provisional Legislative Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
And in 1997 Hong Kong will host two major international events,
 including the celebration of the return of Hong Kong to its
motherland and the annual conference of the World Bank, he said,
adding that both will attract many business travelers and tourists
 to the territory.
</P>
<P>
As for the favorable external factors, Liang stressed that the
China factor has been a significant driving force of Hong Kong's
economic growth and that Hong Kong's economic integration with the
 Chinese mainland will be even more intensive after the handover.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, an increasing number of overseas investors
have recognized the vast development potentials of Hong Kong and
set up their regional headquarters and representative offices in
the territory, he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Now there is strong confidence from both Hong Kong people,
foreign investors and economists in the future of Hong Kong,"
Liang concluded.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Should Be Strengthened, Reformed: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) should be
strengthened and reformed in order to meet challenges
effectively.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, head of the Chinese government delegation, was
speaking at the 19th session of the UNEP Governing Council opened
on January 27.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the UNEP has played a positive role
since the 1992 Rio Conference in coordinating the global
environmental affairs and promoting sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The environmental agency has done a great deal of effective
work in monitoring and assessing the state of the global
environment, promoting international environmental legislation,
conserving natural resources and so on, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Xie pointed out, the role and position of the UNEP in
dealing with the global environmental affairs is being weakened
due to lack of coordination among U.N. agencies and drastically
dropping contributions to the UNEP by some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He appealed these countries to contribute adequate financial
resources to the UNEP without imposing any conditions so as to
ensure the UNEP should fulfill its functions and implement its
programs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official pointed out that necessary adjustment and
reform of the governing structure of UNEP is needed to make it
more efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the UNEP should play an
irreplaceable and leading role in promoting the global
environmental cooperation and coordinating the implementation of
multilateral environmental conventions.

<HEADLINE> Coca-cola Announces Huge Investment in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-cola Company announced
here today a 60 million U.S. Dollars capital investment program
designed to double its business in Zimbabwe over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to create thousands of direct and
indirect jobs in the country with a serious unemployment rate of
over three million out of a population of 11.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on the investment
plan, President of the company Douglas Ivester said the project
will expand operations and increase capacity in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The investment will finance the commissioning of production
lines, packaging, cold drink equipment and other sales equipment
to satisfy a growing consumer thirst for coca-cola products
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Ivester said the company is investing a total of 500 million
U.S. Dollars in African countries which include South Africa,
Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The first coca-cola plant in Zimbabwe, which is currently the
fourth largest sub-Saharan market in Africa, began production in
1948 in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Since then sales have grown from about 1,000 cases in 1948 to
more than 30 million per year in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China on US Media's Attacks Over Tibet Issue  (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any person who has some knowledge of Tibetan history is aware
that the Dalai Lama, described as a "non-violence activist" and a
"compassionate-hearted" man by The Philadelphia Inquirer and some
other U.S. mass media agencies, was the top serf owner and the
ruler of old Tibet, where political and religious power were
combined and dictatorship by aristocrats was enforced.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of the Dalai Lama, the serfs and slaves, who
accounted for more than 95 percent of Tibet's total population,
were simply destitute and had no basic personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
The serf owners could wilfully sell, buy or transfer serfs, and
give serfs to others as gifts or take them as mortgage assets or
as goods for exchange.
</P>
<P>
Serf owners often maltreated serfs viciously by removing their
skin, gauging out eyes, and chopping off their hands. Evidence of
these atrocities can be seen in extensive photo collections and
films.
</P>
<P>
The true reason behind the Dalai Lama's 1959 rebellion is that
he did not want to reform the inhuman and human-rightless
serfdom. But he was against Tibetan people's strong aspirations
for social change and advancement.
</P>
<P>
History, therefore, has proven that the Dalai Lama is not
qualified to talk about "human rights," "democracy" and "freedom."
Describing Tibet in the post-democratic reform era as being in
total darkness is tantamount to praising the defense of the system
of slavery in the south of the US provided by the capital of the
confederacy, Richmond, in the past, the articles notes.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States are important countries in the
world. It is of great importance for the promotion of world peace
and in the basic best interest of the two countries to safeguard
and develop the bilateral friendly relations.

Facts have shown that the Philadelphia Inquirer and some other
mass media agencies are bent on creating public opinions and lies
in support of the Dalai Lama's separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
The acts are not only detrimental to the U.S. best interests,
but they will also seriously undermine the reputation and
credibility of those mass media agencies themselves.

<HEADLINE> China on US Media's Attacks Over Tibet Issue (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that new and high technology does not help The
Inquirer, but only illustrates the "cloven hoof" of the newspaper
which cooked up stories to strike at China.
</P>
<P>
Some US mass media such as The Inquirer have frequently
fabricated stories in their reports on Tibet because of their
conceit and their deep-rooted prejudice against China, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the reports in the Inquirer series said
"the United States is the only nation with the political and
economic leverage to pressure China into curbing human rights
abuses."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper continued that the US "has condemned China's
human rights policies, but has not taken tough measures such as
economic sanctions." The US poses itself as the world's human
rights judge, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that such arrogance and bias has led
some of the US mass media completely astray from the cardinal
journalistic principles of ovjectiveness, truth and fairness in
news reporting, and departs from the basic moral standards for
newsmen.
</P>
<P>
Tibet was part of the Chinese territory as early as 500 years
before the United States was formed, and the central government
has assumed territorial sovereignty over Tibet for more than 700
years.
</P>
<P>
Nothing but endless attacks on China can be found in these
reports, which alleged that China occupies Tibet and assumes
colonial rule in Tibet, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper failed to tell people that following the
democratic reform in late 1950s, one million surfs then in Tibet
were emancipated. It also did not mention the fact that great
progress has sine been made in the social and economic development
of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not report that it was precisely during the
dark years of the Dalai Lama's rule that the human rights issue
truly became a significant problem, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has implemented a policy of free
religion in Tibet, and poured in huge amounts of funding into the
repair of sites of religious activities, including the Potala
Palace, the Johkang Temple, and Samyai.
</P>
<P>
There is no such things as justice or truth to speak of in the
reports concerning Tibet by some of the US media, like The
Inquirer, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Posts 4.24 Percent Inflation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia posted an inflation
rate of 4.24 percent during the 1996/97 fiscal year, which ends in
March, Information Minister Harmoko said here today.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko, speaking after a monthly cabinet meeting on the
economy chaired by President Soeharto, said January inflation
reached 1.03 percent due to an increase in prices for food,
garments and housing.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, January's inflation rate was extremely low
compared to the corresponding period of last year when the figure
was recorded at 2.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the trade situation, Harmoko said that during the
January-November period in 1996, the country's export reached some
45.085 billion U.S. dollars and imports 39.094 billion dollars,
showing a surplus of 5.99 billion dollars.

<P>
TOKYO, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar continued its
rise against the yen in Tokyo today, breaking through the 123 yen
barrier for the first time since February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 123.00-03 yen at 5 p.m., up
from 122.65-68 yen at 9 a.m., after moving between 122.48 yen and a
four-year high of 123.19 yen.
</P>
<P>
Traders said institutional investors and importers are now
rushing to buy the dollar because the U.S. currency's rise seems
to be holding.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said Japan will
take appropriate action to prevent the yen from plummeting against
the dollar and dampening the economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks lost ground today, with a drop in
Nippon Credit Bank shares pulling the Nikkei average down amid
nagging concerns over Japan's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stocks Average of 225 selected issues on the First

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Rejects U.S. Accusations on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has denounced the United
States for interfering in other countries' internal affairs under
the guise of "human rights" issues.
</P>
<P>
The Communist party newspaper Nhan Dan published a commentary
today condemning last week's worldwide annual human rights report
by the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
The report portrayed Vietnam's human rights record as poor,
with political and religious freedom limited by the government.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said the U.S. has given itself the right to
judge and impose its views on human rights on other countries for
many years, hoping to force other countries to follow its
"teachings".
</P>
<P>
But in fact, said the paper, the U.S. is the greatest violator
of human rights, launching some 70 wars against other countries in
its 200-year history, including the Vietnam war which former
Defense Secretary Robert McNamara later admitted was a serious
mistake.
</P>
<P>
It added that the U.S. is still the only country which has used
a nuclear weapons in war. It has also imposed economic embargoes
against Cuba and other countries, intentionally depriving them of
their development rights.
</P>
<P>
The commentary reiterated the Vietnamese government's stance on
the human rights issue, which views the implementation of human
rights as first and foremost the responsibility and right of each
country and nation without being judged by any outside authority.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Urge Rival Faction to Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 5 (Xinhua) - The Afghan Taliban militia
today urged one of its opponents to hold negotiations and not to
fight each other.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban would rather negotiate with Karim Khalili than
fight his Hezb-i-Wahdat Party based in central Bamyan Province,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The Khalili faction is part of the anti-Taliban alliance led by
 military chief of the ousted Afghan government Ahamad Masood and
northern warlord Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
"We will solve the problem of Bamyan without fighting," a
Taliban spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have advanced to the doorstep of Bamyan Province
following a lightning offensive.
</P>
<P>
A Khalili spokesman in Peshawar recently termed the Taliban
religious militia "an undeniable reality which controls most parts
of the country."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces, which moved into the Ghorband Valley after
hard fighting through the strategic Salang Valley over the past
week, have taken the Sheikh Ali district, 140 kilometers northwest
of Kabul, and are now poised to attack Bamyan Province.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Lashes Out at U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today lashed out at a
U.S. report on human rights in the country, saying a great part of
the report is unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said his office has always studied
such a report which is out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said in its annual human rights
report on January 30 that Indonesia continued to commit serious
human rights abuses in 1996, including in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The report faulted the Indonesian government for continuing "to
impose severe limitation on freedom of assembly and association"
and said that "In anticipation of the 1997 general elections, the
government took a number of actions to intimidate political
opponents."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will instruct the Indonesian Embassy in
Washington to respond to the U.S. State Department report.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Advancing Sino-Sri Lankan
friendly and cooperative relations not only serves the basic
interests of the people of the two countries, but also helps peace
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
A senior Chinese diplomat, Qi Huaiyuan, made the statement at a

Lankan diplomatic relations, which was held in Beijing today by
the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign

Qi, president of the association, said that China and Sri Lanka
are two ancient civilizations, and their peoples had enjoyed a
traditional friendship, noting that bilateral cooperation in every
area has been increased since the two countries opened diplomatic
ties 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Ambassador to China, T.H.W. Woutersz, said Sri
Lankan-Chinese friendship dates back to ancient times, and

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Peace Process in Mindanao Will Sustain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said here
today that the peace process in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, would not be affected by the killing of a bishop in
the area.
</P>
<P>
He said he had received reports that the situation has been
under control and things are normalizing today after Tuesday's
killing of Benjamin de Jesus, chancellor of the apostolic vicar of
Sulu and Tawi-Tawi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has ordered the military and the police in Mindanao to
look into the case and apprehend the perpetrator or perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
"I have assured the family of the late bishop that the
government would exert all efforts to ensure the perpetrators of
this senseless killing are apprehended, prosecuted and put before
the bar of justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos voiced confidence that the peace process will sustain in
Mindanao, where a 24-year-old war ended last year with the signing
of a peace agreement by the government and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), a mainstream rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is being pursued in accordance with
preliminary agreements with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), a breakaway faction of the MNLF, he said.
</P>
<P>
A government peace panel is scheduled to have another round of
talks with the MILF on February 9 on a possible comprehensive
cease-fire and the framework of their future formal talks.
</P>
<P>
The president also announced on Tuesday that the government and
the National Democratic Front, another insurgency group in
Mindanao, have resumed peace talks.

MOGADISHU, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people have died for
famine in South Mogadishu's Hodon and Wadajir districts in three
weeks time, according to the Somali faction led by Osman Hassan
Ali Atto today.
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary of Osman Atto's faction Abdi Hassan Awale
Qeybdid said the eleven people, mainly refugees from the
neighboring regions, died after they could not find food to eat.
</P>
<P>
When speaking to reporters in South Mogadishu, Qeybdid made an
appeal for international assistance to the people in Mogadishu
and the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation will go out of hand like that in
1992 if an emergency humanitarian assistance is not delivered by
the international community very soon.
</P>
<P>
Qeybdid said they're welcoming any assistance from the relief
agencies and that the Jezira airstrip, about 7 km south of the
capital, is open for the aid deliveries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the security of the aid agencies is guaranteed
by their faction since the Jezira airstrip is under their
control.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Fighters In Chinese City Reclaim Their Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Thirty cancer patients have
been given the title of "Cancer Fighting Star", in Nanjing, the
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, to commend them in their
refusal to give in to the disease, which is taken to be a death
sentence by many people.
</P>
<P>
The thirty patients were chosen from 1,120 members of the
Nanjing Cancer Patients Friendship Association, a rehabilitation
organization organized cancer patients, with their indomitable
spirit in the struggle against the disease and devotion to the
society.
</P>
<P>
The oldest of the thirty people is 85 years old, and the
youngest 19. Fourteen of them have survived more than two
operations, and they include two couples. Every one of them has
suffered both physically and mentally, and most have lost one or
more organ to the disease.
</P>
<P>
Wu Ruike, 72, who was diagnosed as having bladder cancer 32
years ago, and who fell prey to intestinal cancer two years later,
survived two operations to become the longest-surviving cancer
patient among the group. He expressed his wish to continue the
struggle and donate his body for scientific research after he dies.
</P>
<P>
Tong Guorong and Shi Suzeng, a couple who both suffer from the
disease, have provided encouragement and support for each other
for years. They went on with their daily work routing even when
they were receiving treatments, and when they retired, they took
part in social work, working on the neighborhood committee.
</P>
<P>
An attempt to make a contribution to society and to transcend
the limits of their lives is often a kind of spiritual prop that
encourages cancer patients to continue fighting in the war against
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Meide, a senior engineer at a Nanjing factory, has
written two books and more than ten papers, and a doctor who is a
cancer patient has looked for effective ways to treat the disease,
bringing many people back from the brink of death.
</P>
<P>
The association provides patients with a chance to unite
together, and it has arranged many free consultations and seminars
to help them learn more about the disease.
</P>
<P>
"It gives us courage and strength to fight against the
disease," said one patient.

<HEADLINE> criticing an editorial of the New York Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the Times' editorial writer has one special skill: the
ability to confuse black and white and to call a deer a horse, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that socialism has taken root, bloomed
and born fruit in the hearts of the Chinese people, and the reform
and opening-up drive in the past 20 years has brought
earth-shaking changes to China, it said.
</P>
<P>
The material and cultural life of the Chinese people has
improved significantly, millions of millions of people have
enjoyed broad democratic rights and China's legal framework is
being improved, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
"All these are facts recognized by the whole world," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Times' editorial writer, wearing rose-colored
glasses, looked at but didn't see the great achievements scored by
the Chinese people. Instead, he said that Communism in China is
"mutating into a new form that tolerates economic liberties while
still suffocating political freedom," the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This is sheer nonsense," it noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is known to all that China's reforms are comprehensive,
covering both the economic sector and the social and political
areas," the article said. "This is obvious to all the people of
insight in the world."
</P>
<P>
The February 1 issue of International Herald Tribune carried an
article by Tony Saich, a representative of the Ford Foundation,
who writes that the majority of the Chinese are "enjoying greater
personal freedom than ever before."
</P>
<P>
"For most urban Chinese," he wrote, "the changes have been
significant in terms of choices of work and lifestyle. ... there
has been a steady advance toward increased individual liberty for
a majority of urban Chinese. ... There have also been advances in
rural areas. Farmers, ..., have a greater say over what to grow
and where to sell their produce than in the old days. ... Also in
the last few years, villagers throughout China have been taking
part in an unprecedented experiment in local self-governance
through village elections."
</P>
<P>
"Is the International Herald Tribune article also propaganda of
the Communist Party?" the commentary asked the Times' editorial
writer.
</P>
<P>
The venom of the New York Times editorial lies in the fact that
it runs counter to the tide of the times, and seditiously creates
an atmosphere that will poison the relationship between China and
the United States at a time when there is a tendency toward
improving the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It goes even further to openly press the Clinton Administration
to "push China hard on human rights and internal political
reform," and maintains that Washington does need to be "less
willing to sacrifice American principles for American commerce in
China."
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," said the commentary, pointing out that the
New York Times is "nothing more than a newspaper in a big US city
and your knowledge of human studies and history is very limited."
</P>
<P>
"What qualifications do you have to talk about these issues in
front of the Chinese people, who have a 5,000-year-old
civilization?" it asked.
</P>
<P>
"You're well advised to give up your guru's airs -- the sooner
the better -- and learn more about the development history of
mankind," the commentary said. "Then it won't be too late for you
to pick up your pen again and write editorials."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Population Reaches 200 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's population hit an
official record of 200,008,778 following the birth of at least
8,778 babies throughout the country on Tuesday, a senior official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Population Haryono Suyono said President
Soeharto has named the country's 200 millionth citizen Wahyu
Nusantara Aji, one day after he was born in one of the cities in
West Nusatenggara Province.
</P>
<P>
Suyono said the 200 millionth citizen was chosen from
Nusatenggara because the province is known for its high birthrate
and high infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have now been able to start reducing the rates,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The successful control of the population growth is mainly
thanks to the national family planning program.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1990, the country's population growth was
recorded at 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate is expected to decrease further to 1.2 percent between
2000 and 2005 and to 0.6 percent between 2020 and 2025.
</P>
<P>
With a population of more than 200 million, Indonesia is the
world's fourth most populous nation after China, India and the
United States.

<HEADLINE>   Cyprus President Outlines Positions on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has outlined the Greek Cypriot side's positions on main
aspects of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference for the four Cypriot TV
channels Tuesday night, President Clerides disclosed that no
decision has been taken about the deployment of Greek military
aircraft in an air-base under construction near the island's
western coastal town of Paphos.
</P>
<P>
"The air base is expected to finish by the end of the
year and we have not yet decided whether Greek military planes
will be deployed there or just use the base for refueling
only," the president said, clarifying the U.S. claims that he has
committed himself not to deploy Greek fighter aircraft to the
base.
</P>
<P>
It was reported previously that the military base in Paphos
was being built for the deployment of Greek military jets
under the defense pact between Cyprus and Greece, signed in
November, 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was also believed the Cypriot government's recent decision
to purchase Russian surface-to-air missiles was taken to protect
the Paphos base.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the proposed U.S. peace initiative, the
president said he will not accept a confederal solution and
warned that "any American initiative leading to this objective
is bound to fail during my term in office."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has proposed that the divided island should be
reunited under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state, which has
been accepted by both sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
On direct negotiations, Clerides said "we shall not
accept to enter a dialogue if we do not ensure that the
other side (Turkish Cypriot side) is prepared to shift from
the intransigent positions they have been maintaining."
</P>
<P>
This view is now backed by the U.N., the U.S. and
Britain, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the thorny issue of security, the Cypriot President said
the U.S. and Britain recognize the need to have an
international force in Cyprus, with a U.N. mandate, whose
composition is subject to discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept Greek or Turkish military participation in
this force, if troops from Greece and Turkey maintain a
military presence here," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
The Turks press for participation in the force and a
separate military presence in Cyprus, he explained.
</P>
<P>
On the refugee issue, President Clerides said he cannot
sanction the view that the Turkish Cypriot administered part of
a future federation should be around 29 percent plus.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash must accept that he
will administer a smaller area, in terms of territory, to
enable the maximum possible number of refugees to return home
and be under Greek Cypriot administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 200,000 Greek Cypriots have been
driven out of their homes by the Turkish troops since their
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his position on the presence of Turkish settlers
in the northern part of Cyprus, President Clerides made it
clear "the Greek Cypriot side believes no settlement can be
reached unless the settlers leave."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also spoke about his prospective candidacy
for a second term in office, spelling out the three preconditions
he laid down before announcing his candidacy as health,
public popularity and developments on the Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections on the island are scheduled to
be held in the first half of next year.

<HEADLINE> China on US Media's Attacks Over Tibet Issue  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A bylined article released by
Xinhua News Agency today challenges the US media's ongoing attack
on China, which has been fueled by The Philadelphia's Inquirer's
series of reports on Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The article signed by Wen Yi says that some of the US media
have established a trend of stirring up feelings against China by
manipulating the Tibet issue. A typical example, it notes, is a
series of six reports published last December by The Inquirer of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper vilified China by fabricating "individual cases"
mingled with a great deal of comments and launching vicious
attacks upon China, including fallacies saying Tibet is "a land
occupied by China."
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, "torture and intimidation are facts
of life for Tibetans caught up in a Chinese campaign to eradicate
Tibet's religion, nationality and culture." The Inquirer also
states that "China has destroyed thousands of Tibetan monasteries."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper invented detailed descriptions of "tortured
Tibetans," telling people that China is a "very malicious" country.
</P>
<P>
The article says that many of the same or similar lies and
sophistry, which have already been disproved by stark facts, can
be found in other US newspapers and are difficult to believe.
</P>
<P>
But The Inquirer is unique in that it not only concocted
nonsense, but boasts that it used advanced technology to do so,
the article says.

The newspaper also stated that the accounts of the Tibetans
interviewed by their reporters in India, Nepal and Tibet "have
been verified by medical examinations and polygraph tests." It
also included a short article that discussed the circumstances of
the individual interviewees who took the polygraphs, and the
background of the former FBI agent who issued the tests.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that The Inquirer also commissioned a former
FBI agent as polygrapher to perform lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the commentator's article went on to say, the
FBI has had a bad reputation in its history.
</P>
<P>
The case histories that the FBI enumerated, as well as the
persecution of people that took place 40 years ago, are still
fresh in people's minds, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to prove credibility and truth based on such
information is laughable, and only reflects the the weakness of
these reports by The Inquirer, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The Inquirer reporters worked hard to create false accounts of
people who are said to have been "jailed and tortured in Tibet."
However, a thorough investigation of every current and former
prisoner in Tibet's three jails shows that the people named in the
Inquirer articles do not exist, the article notes.

SHIJIAZHUANG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Hebei Province has
increased its campaign against iodine deficiency, and is getting
more of its people to eat iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
The province sold 272,000 tons of iodized salt last year, up 40
percent over the year before. According to one survey, 93 percent
of its citizens now eat standard salt.
</P>
<P>
The province was plagued by an iodine deficiency for years,
with 77 counties and 23 million people suffering from related
health problems.
</P>
<P>
Regulations and a strategy have been worked out to increase
supplies and the use of iodized salt, and the province has
established the first professional prevention and treatment center
in the country to clamp down on small-scale production and selling
of salt. It seized 8,600 tons of privately produced salt last year.
</P>
<P>
Publicity campaigns have also been held to enhance people's

NANCHANG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The annual net income of

<HEADLINE> ILO Holds Workshop on Poverty Alleviation Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor Office
(ILO) opened a three-day Asian regional workshop on macro policies
and micro interventions for poverty alleviation here today.
</P>
<P>
Despite reports about fast economic growth in some Asian
countries and regions, the Asia-Pacific region has the largest
concentration of poverty in the world as more than 800 million
poor people live in the region and about 500 million of them live
in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
The situation is particularly alarming in South Asia, where
almost half of the people are estimated to live below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
The workshop forms part of the UNDP-funded regional poverty
alleviation program for Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to build up capacity at the government and
community levels and encourage participatory approaches by
empowering the poor.
</P>
<P>
Special measures will be taken to move women out of poverty and
promote their full participation in all dimensions of
socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation is one of the ILO's priorities in the
Asia-Pacific region. The aim is to help governments develop
coherent national and social policies and promote action to
overcome social exclusion, especially of vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
ILO programs include the generation of employment and
development of human resources through education and training,
bringing the concerns of women workers into the mainstream and
encouraging the growth of small enterprises and micro-enterprises.

<HEADLINE> criticizing an editorial of the New York Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
released a commentary titled "Donkeys' Lips Don't Match Horses'
Jaws," criticizing a recent editorial in the New York Times that
compares the collapse of the Berlin Wall with what is going in
China.
</P>
<P>
The Times' January 30 editorial, titled "The Berlin Wall and
China," said that "The demise of Communism may come someday in
China...." It then contradicted itself by saying "There is already
abundant evidence suggesting that Communism in China is not
dying," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Berlin Wall was an important symbol of the
disintegration of a package of socialist states, one after the
other, in the former Soviet Union and East Europe, the Xinhua
commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that the New York Times perspective is
influenced by its class interest and capitalism, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it compared in the same breath the collapse of the
Berlin Wall with prosperous socialist China, which, just as
donkeys' lips don't match horses' jaws, is an incongruous
comparison.
</P>
<P>
It reasons that China, "unlike those (countries) behind the
Berlin Wall, is gaining economic strength, not losing
it. Communism is not maintained by an outside power but by the
Chinese Government itself."
</P>
<P>
Faced with an ever-stronger China, the editorial writer had
recourse but to offer illogical accusations.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Fulfill Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China today appealed developed
countries to demonstrate their political will to fulfill their
commitments made at the Earth Summit held five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 19th session of the Governing Council of the
U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP), Xie Zhenhua, head of the
Chinese government delegation to the session, today noted that
some developed countries are far from fulfilling their
commitments.
</P>
<P>
These developed countries evade their political commitment to
providing additional financial resources and environmentally
sound technologies in favorable and concessional terms to
developing countries, Xie added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official told the ministerial meeting of the
two-week UNEP Governing Council session that failure to fulfill
their commitments is the most outstanding problem in the
follow-up to the U.N. Conference of Environment and Development
(UNCED).
</P>
<P>
The problem has seriously restrained the capacity of the
developing countries in implementing Agenda 21 adopted at the
UNCED and impeded the process of the global sustainable
development, added Xie, administrator of the National
Environmental Protection Agency of China.
</P>
<P>
He told the session which opened here on January 27 that one
principle must be reiterated, that is, countries have common but
differentiated responsibilities with the developed countries
bearing greater responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Xie expressed the hope that UNEP would request the U.N.
Special Session to be held next June to pay special attention to
this and other principles.

<HEADLINE> Youths Under 18 Barred From Tobacco Use in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Youths under 18 in
Malaysia will be forbidden to use tobacco, including its
possession, chewing and smoking, under regulations to be
introduced soon, Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said today.
</P>
<P>
Offenders could be fined up to 1,000 ringgit (about 400 U.S.
dollars) and compounded a sum of 50 ringgit (about 20 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new regulations -- amendments to the Tobacco Products
Control Regulations 1993 -- have already been approved by the
cabinet and will be submitted to the Attorney-General's Chambers
before they are gazetted next month, the minister told reporters
at his office here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the amendments are necessary as under the
present regulations, those under 18 are barred from buying
cigarettes but there is no mention of use and possession.
</P>
<P>
Youths under 18 are now still allowed to sell cigarettes or
tobacco products as many retail traders have the help of their
children in the business.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations are aimed at helping prevent youths from
being addicted to smoking as several studies conducted locally and
overseas found that the younger one begins smoking, the more
difficult it is to give it up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chua said the regulations for youths will be tightened because
the government feels smoking should be curbed early.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will also designate as non-smoking areas
banks, institutions of higher learning, public service counters,
shopping complexes, government premises, schools, air-conditioned
shops and sports complexes in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry and local authorities have 1,740
enforcement officers to enforce the regulations, he said, adding
that the number is expected to double by the end of the year to
ensure wider enforcement, he said.

NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
announced here today that China has begun to implement the plan
of the total-amount control of main pollutants and closed more
than 60,000 heavily polluting enterprises in the second half of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that this action is "unprecedented whether
in developing countries or developed ones."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ministerial meeting of the 19th session of the
U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) Governing Council, Chinese
delegation leader Xie Zhenhua said that this action indicated the
political determination of the Chinese government to follow the
path of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China attaches great importance to
the integration of the environment and economic development,
noted Xie, administrator of the National Environmental Protection
Agency of China.
</P>
<P>
After the Rio Conference in 1992, he pointed out, China took
the lead among the world nations in formulating China's Agenda
21, a White Paper on the Population, Environment and Development.
</P>
<P>
China has incorporated the strategy of sustainable development
into the master plan for social and economic development, the
Chinese official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has taken accelerated steps in environmental
laws and regulations, and signed and ratified a number of
international environmental conventions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Xie said, "we are clearly aware that we face an
enormous task of environmental protection and pollution
prevention and control."

<P>
TEHRAN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of two strong
earthquakes in northeastern Iran Tuesday reached 72 and more than
200 others were injured, the state-run Tehran Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The strong earthquakes measuring 6.1 and 5.4 on the Richter
scale destroyed 73 villages and there are no rescue operations
available to 21 villages because of closure of roads after the
quake, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran University's Geophysics Institute said that the quakes
occurred at 13:24 (09:54 GMT) and 14:09 (10:39 GMT) respectively
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that an aftershock
with a magnitude of 5.7 degrees on the Richter scale rocked the
northern cities of Khorassan province at 11:24 (07:54 GMT)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seismographical base of the Mashhad Geophysics Institute
registered the epicenter at 250 kilometers northwest of Mashhad,
in Bojnourd, about 500 kilometers northeast of Iran's capital of
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the seismographical center of northeastern Iran
said Wednesday that more than 160 aftershocks have hit the
region following the first quake Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The center said that there is still the possibility that more
aftershocks will struck the area in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
The report said that relief supplies, including more than 20
tonnes of foodstuffs, 5000 tents and blankets, a considerable
amount of garments and heaters, were immediately dispatched to
the quake stricken regions.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake caused wide-spread panic and people rushed to
the streets for safety.
</P>
<P>
Much of Iran is earthquake-prone and tens of thousands of
people had died in earthquakes in the country in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, 1990, an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter
scale struck the northern provinces of Gilan and Zanjan, leaving
40000 dead and around a half million homeless.

The insurance policy, presented to Marwa on Tuesday by

It is believed that the bomb blast was a revenge for Marwa's

<HEADLINE> HK to Deploy Artificial Reefs in Marine Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Agriculture and
 Fisheries Department will deploy artificial reefs in two marine
parks this year to help conserve marine environment and enhance
fisheries resources.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Lee, director of the department, said today that
following the Finance Committee's approval for a 100 million HK
dollar (12.82 million US dollar) allocation last year, planning
work had already begun for deploying artificial reefs in suitable
locations within five years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the consultancy study on fisheries resources and
fishing operations in Hong Kong waters would be completed in the
middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Data obtained will enable the formulation of a long-term
fisheries management plan for conservation, development and
sustainable use of fisheries resources in local waters," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, last year's establishment of three marine parks
and a marine reserve would certainly help long-term marine
conservation and fisheries resources enhancement, he noted.

<HEADLINE> HK Unveils New Government Badges, Insignia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Government
today released the new designs of badges and insignia to be worn
by uniformed officers after the handover of Hong Kong to China on
July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that a working group had been set
up three years ago to review badges and insignia on government
uniforms, and the purpose was to identify all badges and insignia
bearing connotations of British rule and to prepare new designs to
 replace them.
</P>
<P>
The disciplined services were principally concerned in this
exercise although several other departments were also
involved. All new designs have been prepared by the departments
themselves and the Chinese side had been consulted, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether two million separate items of the new badges and
insignia are involved at an estimated cost of some six million HK
dollars (769,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new badges and insignia will be worn with effect from
midnight on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said all uniformed officers may keep one set
of their existing badges and insignia free of charge as souvenirs,
 while the remaining badges and insignia will be handed in for
disposal.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Tough Tasks Lie Ahead for Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 5 (Xinhua) -- It is no surprise that the
Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) led by Nawaz Sharif won Monday's
general elections in the country. What is surprising, though, is
the staggering margin of its win.
</P>
<P>
The PML-N has almost crushed all its rivals, including its
strong opponent -- the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), through the
direct contest in the national polls with a much better than
expected result.
</P>
<P>
The PML-N consolidated its position by clinching a two-thirds
majority seats with the support of its allies in the National
Assembly and a clean sweep in the Punjab legislature.
</P>
<P>
In the 217-seat National Assembly, the PML-N has pursed a
lion's share of 134 seats while its once formidable rival, the PPP
led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, had to eat a humble
pie with only 18 seats.
</P>
<P>
By bagging a record of 211 seats in the 248-member Punjab
Provincial Assembly, the PML-N has attained an absolute majority
with the PPP trailing far behind with a dismal two seats.
</P>
<P>
Besides improving its position in North West Frontier province
where it claimed 31 provincial assembly seats, the PML-N also made
in-roads in the PPP's power base Sindh province. A total of 15
seats fell to the PML-N in Sindh, Benazir's hometown, against 34
seats for the PPP.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Benazir's PPP, which plunged to its
worst defeat ever, has now been forced by the voters to take a
back seat after having played a major role in the national
politics for the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
Serious economic crisis and public perception of rampant
corruption are believed to be among the main factors that
contributed to the PPP's stunning defeat.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the PPP, which had ruled the country for a little
more than three years and has now virtually been reduced to a
provincial party, has lost its popularity.
</P>
<P>
As Benazir conceded in her first post-election press
conference, the PPP party voters, who were disillusioned by her
government's poor performance, did not come out to vote on a large
scale.
</P>
<P>
The major cause of the low turn-out is that people crushed
under the weight of high prices of all goods and services are so
deeply afflicted by their economic wounds that election is of a
secondary importance to them.
</P>
<P>
The election results also exposed the kind of crisis the PPP is
faced with, analysts said. Resentment and differences among PPP
members visibly shook the party organization.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the PPP no longer enjoys the wide national support
that it did in the late sixties. Since then, considerable erosion
has taken place in its popularity, both horizontally and
vertically.
</P>
<P>
As the principal loser, analysts said, the PPP would have to do
a lot of soul searching why the soup soured so sharply.
</P>
<P>
Yet for the PML-N, the winner, it is necessary to convert
victory into national healing and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
To be a prime minister in today's Pakistan, as an analyst put
it, is more of a curse than a blessing as he would inherit an
economy totally in shambles, almost on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister-elect, vowed on Tuesday that
his government will initiate bold economic reforms for the rapid
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said the revival of the country's
economy would be a hard nut to crack.
</P>
<P>
The most difficult task ahead for the coming government will be
to ensure documentation of economic activities and a taxation
system that will bring into the tax net all the incomes beyond
legitimate limits, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
And it will be the litmus test for the success or otherwise of
the coming government how it raises revenues, reduces crushing
loan burden, improves the efficiency of government functionaries
and curtails corruption at all levels, they said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abacha Breaks Silence on Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha has finally broken silence on the wide speculations
that he may drop his uniform and run for the presidency next
year.
</P>
<P>
"I have not put my mind to it," he said in a recent interview with
the US-based Washington Times, the content of which is carried
on Nigerian newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said that all his efforts are currently geared towards
ensuring the success of this administration's economic, social
and political programs.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is my own constituency's. It is not new in Africa.
Neither is it new in the (west Africa) sub-region, where military
people have stepped into politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
There have been wild speculations and heated debates on the issue
since former Chief of Justice, Justice Mohammed Bello, said last year
that General Abacha has the constitutional freedom to participate in
the country electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Coming to power in 1993, General Abacha announced a three-year
transition to civil rule program in 1995, in which he pledged to give
power to an elected president in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his point of view, the transition program has been
successful so far, with every promise of his, the constitional
conference, the local government election on a non-party basis
having come to true.
</P>
<P>
The head of state saw no merit in the international community's
criticism of Nigeria's human rights records, dismissing such as
"unfair and unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the recent bombings in the country, he said those
behind the bombings are seeking to sabotage the political transition
program and are responsible for the delayed local government
election on a party basis.
</P>
<P>
"One reason we had to delay the local government elections is
because in reports we received, these same people were planning to go
to various polling centers and start bombing innocent people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He wondered how people who wanted democracy could
be sabotaging a democratic process. "They claim they are for
democracy, but they do not want democracy to succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and other oppositions
terrorists and claimed that they are aided by some foreign elements.
</P>
<P>
He defended his government's achievements in other fields as
well, saying that "the economy is getting healthier, even prices
of food stuffs are going down. The value of the currency has
stabilized. There is order".
</P>
<P>
The head of state also criticised the US government's hostile
policy towards Nigeria and demanded it to remove its sanctions against
the country.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will soon have its
first mineral refinery plant and avoid the shipping of minerals abroad
for refining, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gray Mwakalukwa, the Commisioner for Minearl Resources in the
Ministry of Energy and Minerals, told reporters here on Tuesday that
the plant would deal with the refining of gold, silver and platinum
and was expected to be positioned at Mwanza where such minerals were
abundatly found.
</P>
<P>
He further said although the final arrangement had not yet been
made, the German Multinational Metal-Technic has been showing keen
interest in investing an estimated three million U.S. Dollars
in the project.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had had no mineral refining plant despite its rich
mineral resources and the plant would enable the mineral dealers
to have their minerals refined in the country, instead of being
shipped to London as it used to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mineral resources commissioner obseved that there were many
deposits of titanium minerals around Bagamoyo beach, amounting to 33.5
milion tons.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy to Grow Rapidly in 1997, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will rank fifth
among the 20 fastest growing economies in the world in 1997,
according to the latest "World Outlook" issued by the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU).
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen of the world's economies will grow by about 6 percent
this year," the EIU is quoted by "The Economist" magazine as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the booming economies will be in Asia, according to the
EIU which reckons Iraq, aided by limited oil exports under United
Nations supervision, as the fastest growing economy with a
30-percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
China is the second fastest growing economy, followed by
Vietnam, Albania, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and
Singapore, the EIU said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was expected to chalk up a decade of superlative
growth as its gross domestic product was forecast to grow at a
rate of 8 percent this year, compared with 8.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate is expected to drop to 3.5 percent
in 1997 from last year's 3.6 percent, and the current account
deficit is also likely to decline to 11.5 billion ringgit (about
4.6 billion U.S. dollars) from 14.77 billion ringgit (about 5.9
billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will face the challenge of ensuring sustained economic
growth with greater price stability, the EIU said.

<HEADLINE> Rasali: UNEP's Role as Global Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official said
today that the role of the United Nations Environmental Program
(UNEP) as a global environmental watchdog remains essential.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ministerial meeting of the 19th session of the
UNEP Governing Council, the official noted that the recent
publication of "Global Environmental Outlook" is testimony to the
role.
</P>
<P>
Razali Ismail, the President of the U.N. General Assembly, told
delegates from more than 100 countries that UNEP should use the
U.N. Special Session to be held next June to strengthen itself
and develop "a stronger identity".
</P>
<P>
Defining a future role should place UNEP in the position of
"prime environmental actor", as it used to be, the U.N. official
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that UNEP had achieved the objectives of its
original mandate by establishing the intellectual base for global
environmental issues, by sensitizing public and political
opinion, by acting as environmental catalyst within the
international community and by laying down the foundations for
global agreements and the coordination of international
environmental law.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. Special Session, Razali stated that the meeting
must transform the conceptual analysis and political commitment
of the past five years into action.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that developing countries are being
disappointed at the unfulfilled commitments on financial
assistance in Agenda 21 adopted at the Earth Summit held in Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, five years ago.
</P>
<P>
"New and additional financial resources" now seem "pipe dreams"
in the light of ever diminishing official development assistance
levels, the U.N. president stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Special Session must attempt to remove the
obstacles that have impeded the "transfer of
environmentally-sound technologies on concessional and
preferential terms".
</P>
<P>
Next June, world leaders will gather at the U.N. Special
Session for the sole purpose of reviewing and appraising the
progress of implementation of Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
The on-going UNEP Governing Council meeting is making
preparations for the Special Session.

HAVANA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban farmer has harvested a
big yam weighing 130 pounds (about 60 kilos) in his courtyard, a
miracle in the yam production in the world, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Oreldis Rodriguez, a farmer who lives in the Vicente Town of
central Cuba's Ciengo de Avila State, has always planted yams
along with bananas in the courtyard without applying any
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Yams, originating in Africa, are one of the main stable foods
in Cuba and other Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
With fine natural conditions, a yam usually weighs 30-40
pounds, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa to Draft Peacekeeping Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is drafting a White Paper on peacekeeping policy, said
a source here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry on Tuesday in
Cape Town, the issue had been discussed at a recent meeting between
Foreign Affairs Minister Alfren Nzo and his senior management.
</P>
<P>
Operational issues raised at that meeting had included South
Africa's role in the Great Lakes region and other African crisis
points such as Sudan, Angola and Nigeria, said the source.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement did not give any details about the drafting
of the White Paper.
</P>
<P>
Since its returning to the world family after the 1994 general
elections, South Africa has been under pressure from the international
community, especially the African continent, to take an active role in
the international peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, however, has been reluctant to send its military
force overseas to perform the peacekeeping mission, citing as reasons
the self-defence nature of its armed forces and the notorious record
of military interferring in its neighbouring countries during the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Last year, President Nelson Mandela also gave a cold shoulder
to a proposal by the United States to establish an African crisis
response force to provide humanitarian assistance in case of some
African countries striken by violence and armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said South Africa would only send its military forces
overseas to carry out the peacekeeping mission under the
authorization by the United Nations and under the leadership of
an African commander. enditem

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Yasur 2000 Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yasur 2000 transport
helicopter is the workhorse of the Israel Air Force (IAF). In a
collision of two helicopters of such type in northern Israel
Tuesday evening, 73 armymen were killed.
</P>
<P>
Yasur is a Hebrew name for the U.S.-made Sikorsky CH-53. The
1960s vintage aircraft has been upgraded by the IAF.
</P>
<P>
The heavy transport helicopter is capable of carrying up to 50
passengers, but due to the 1977 tragic crash of the CH-53 in
which 54 paratroopers and crewmen were killed, the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) restricted its maximum seating to 35 soldiers plus
a three-man crew.
</P>
<P>
The upgraded Yasur 2000 is equipped with sophisticated
avionics which allows it to operate at night in most weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Yasur is not equipped with a "black box" as are all
commercial planes, but its internal cockpit conversations are
recorded and investigators are likely to use this to determine
the causes for the crash. However, the cause of the previous
crash of a Yasur last April was never determined.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders to Stabilize Sugar Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has authorized the National Food Authority to help stabilize sugar
prices in the domestic market, the Presidential Press Office said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the office said the president had already
issued an order for this, which took effect on January 31 and
remains valid until June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The press release said there is an urgent need to stabilize the
prices of sugar, which have been dropping since last October.
</P>
<P>
The farmgate price of sugar has dropped to 500 pesos (19.1 U.S.
dollars) per 50-kilo bag from 750 pesos (28.6 dollars) to 800
pesos (30.5 dollars) per bag last year because of a glut in the
supply of sugar due to the dumping of some 500,000 tons of cheap
imports.
</P>
<P>
Economists have warned that the sugar industry will probably
lose up to 7 billion pesos (267 million dollars) should farmgate
prices continue to drop.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producers have urged the Ramos administration to waste no
time in taking necessary steps to save the ailing industry and its
estimated 500,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> Why Once-Strong Deutsche Mark Turns Weak? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The deutsche mark weakened further
at the beginning of this year, raising concerns in the world
financial market.
</P>
<P>
It fell to 1.64 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday from 1.54 a
month ago, or 14 percent lower than at the start of last year.
</P>
<P>
The mark also lost ground against European currencies, slipping
from 2.24 against the pound at the start of 1996 to 2.65 by the
end of that year.
</P>
<P>
The mark depreciation is also seen in its exchange rate drop
against Greek drachma, Italian lira and some other currencies,
disappointing many who have felt proud for what used to be one of
the strongest currencies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Experts have attributed the mark depreciation mainly to three
factors.
</P>
<P>
The first is the slow economic growth rate in the country which
is registered at 1.5 percent in 1995, 1.4 percent in 1996 and
again an estimated 1.5 percent only this year.
</P>
<P>
The globalization of economic development is regarded as
another challenge to Germany's economic status in the world. A
record unemployment, high labor cost and slow development of
science and technology have crippled the competitiveness of the
German products in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Investors are discouraged by a possible drastic change in the
policies of high salaries, high taxes, high welfare, high deficits
and high debts, which are unlikely to continue. Germany's share in
the world economy is withering as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
With the progress in the setting up of a European Economic and
Monetary Union, European currencies are definitely to be replaced
by a single European currency which is planned to be launched in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsch mark that will be replaced has lost its past glamor
and strength and far-sighted enterprises are already making
preparations for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Although the mark's depreciation will help promote German
exports, which will in turn offer job opportunities and relieve
Germany of its unemployment predicted at 4.5 million this year,
German imports would be more expensive.
</P>
<P>
What is worse is possibly in the psychological aspect. The
German people are bound to feel disturbed by the sudden weakening
of what used to be one of the strongest currencies in the world.

<HEADLINE> Chopper Collision Prompts Reactions, Netanyahu Cancels Trip to Jordan (By Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Following the worst air
disaster in the Israeli army's history, Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu called for unity at a time of tragedy and canceled
his trip to Jordan scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three Israeli soldiers and airmen were killed Tuesday
evening when two Yasur 2000 helicopters ferrying troops to south
Lebanon collided over Moshav She'ar Yashuv in the Galilee
Panhandle, northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unimaginably grave tragedy. The hearts of the
nation are with the victims. The whole country weeps today
over the loss of these young fighters," Netanyahu said in a
statement issued by his office.
</P>
<P>
The two aircrafts, carrying eight airmen and 65 soldiers,
including 13 officers, were carrying troops from Israel to
south Lebanon as part of a troop rotation.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, helicopters have been used increasingly as
a way to minimize the use of roads in south Lebanon and
the risk of roadside bombs set up by Hezbollah fighters,
Israeli army officials said.
</P>
<P>
After the incident occurred, Netanyahu phoned Jordan's King
Hussein, who sent his condolences upon learning of the tragedy,
and informed the king that he had canceling the scheduled visit
to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier also received a condolence phone call
from Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report this morning, the
meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat scheduled for Thursday at
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip was also
postponed.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of unity, Netanyahu called upon all 120 members
of the Knesset (Israel's parliament) to fan out across the
country to attend the funerals of the fallen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli President Ezer Weizman, a former Israeli
Air Force commander, said that it was "the worst tragedy the
air force has known in its 50-year history."

<P>
Weizman appealed to the Israeli public "not to jump to
conclusions," adding that he had full faith that the truth
would come to light on the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference earlier this morning, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai announced the establishment of an
independent commission of inquiry to determine the cause of
the collision.
</P>
<P>
Following the air disaster, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Netanyahu Tuesday night to express condolences on
behalf of the Clinton administration, and offered to help in any
way possible.
</P>
<P>
The White House released a statement saying that U.S.
President Bill Clinton sent a message to Netanyahu extending,
on behalf of all Americans, "sincere condolences to the
families of the victims and the people and Government of
Israel."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's opposition leader Shimon Peres said that
while he weeps with everyone in the tragedy, he could not
ignore that the disaster was linked to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Although Israel could not withdraw from south Lebanon
unilaterally, said Peres, who is currently visiting Switzerland,
"neither could the Israeli army remain there indefinitely."
</P>
<P>
"We must be a brave people and accept that there is a
price to be paid for peace with both Lebanon and Syria,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter disaster occurred at a time when Israeli
public, including some senior government officials, were calling
for a unilateral withdrawal from the Israeli self-declared
security in south Lebanon, so as to avoid more Israeli casualties.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Israelis have been killed since the beginning of
this year in fighting with Hezbollah fighters in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Although the Israeli defense establishments opposes a unilateral
pullout from Lebanon, Tuesday's disaster would probably lead to
more debates over whether the army should remain there.

<HEADLINE> Jury Finds Simpson Liable in Wrongful Death of Ex-wife, Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A civil jury found former
American football star O.J. Simpson liable for the wrongful death
of his ex-wife and her friend, according to television report from
Santa Monica, California on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, 49, was acquitted in October 1995 in the criminal
trial for the slashing murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson
and her friend Ronald Goldman, but the victims' relatives filed a
civil wrongful death suit against him, seeking monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
The jury ordered him to pay 8.5 million U.S. dollars in
compensatory damages and will return Thursday to decide whether to
award millions more in punitive damages.

Earlier Tuesday, the jury in the wrongful death suit was read
back statements by several witnesses, including testimony
pertaining to Simpson's whereabouts on the evening of June 12
1994, when Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were killed outside

<HEADLINE> Inflation Slows Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The annual inflation rate in the
Philippines slowed down to 5 percent in January this year from 5.2
percent last December, indicating that price rises in the current
year will not exceed the government target of 6 percent to 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Measured from a year ago, the national inflation rate slowed
down to 5 percent in January 1997 from 5.2 percent in December
1996," the National Statistics Office said in a report released
here today.
</P>
<P>
On a month-to-month basis, it said, prices went up by 0.6
percent in January, slower than the 0.8 percent increase in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, consumer prices in the Philippines rose 5.1
percent from a year earlier and 0.8 percent from a month earlier,
bringing average inflation rate for 1996 to 8.4 percent, just
within the government's target of 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Services slowed down by 0.8 percent to 12 percent in January
from 12.8 percent in the previous month, and fuel, light and water
to 10.5 percent from 10.7 percent; and food, beverages and tobacco
to 2.2 percent from 2.5 percent, the statistics office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the clothing inflation rate in January remained at
its previous month's level of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by the latest inflation data, economists say that
consumer price increases this year will be boxed into the
government's target of 6 percent to 6.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Train S. African Medics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would send
students to Cuba to study medicine in an attempt to ensure the
achievement of the government's goal of free medical care for
all, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on her arrival at Johannesburg
International Airport from a week-long visit to Cuba, Zuma said
the Cuban government had agreed to train the students for South
Africa beginning in 1997, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said she and Cuban Minister of Public Health Carlos Dotres
Martinez had signed the extension of the collaboration agreement on
health between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the agreement, these students would be expected to
return to the country after completing their studies in Cuba and
work in their respective fields of expertise for the Department
of Health for at least six years.
</P>
<P>
A pilot group of 10 students from Mpumalanga Province were
already in Cuba to learn Spanish, Cuba's national language, for
eight months before beginning their medical training, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zuma also said she had invited more Cuban doctors to
come to South Africa to help improve the medical service in
the disadvantaged areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
About 200 Cuban doctors are now working in the rural areas
of South Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Extends Festival Greetings to HK, Macao and Taiwan Compatriots  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen today
extended his Spring Festival greetings to the overseas Chinese,
foreign nationals of Chinese origin, compatriots of Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan and other Chinese friends working overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival, which falls on February 7, is a
traditional festival of the entire Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Qian expressed his
heartfelt thanks to them for their long-time support and
assistance to China's reform, opening up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
He wished them a merry Spring Festival, good health, happiness
for their families and success in business.
</P>
<P>
Qian said 1996 was the first year for China to carry out the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) of the national economy and
social development.
</P>
<P>
During the year, he noted, the country's economy continued to
maintain a sustained growth momentum, with its gross national
product increasing by 10 percent and the inflation rate controled
to six percent.
</P>
<P>
The economy successfully achieved a "soft landing" and its
foreign exchange reserves surpassed 100 billion U.S. dollars,
ranking at one of the top positions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Qian added, China is now politically stable with
national unity, and the Chinese people are content with their
lives and work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China adheres to an independent foreign policy of
peace, attaining fruitful outcome in its diplomatic work, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Chinese leaders visited 36 countries on the
five continents, strengthening their country's friendly and
cooperative relations with them in the fields of politics, economy
and culture.
</P>
<P>
China has received support from many developing countries in
upholding state sovereignty and territorial integrity and opposing
interferences from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that a series of victories have also been
scored in international struggles, and the cause for peaceful
reunification of the motherland continued to advance.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China's socialist modernization will enter a new
period for comprehensive development with the coming spring of
1997.

<P>
He said the Chinese government will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, when Hong Kong will return
to the embrace of the motherland. As a result, the disgrace and
humiliation China had suffered from for more than 150 years
will disappear, while the aspirations of several generations of
Chinese people will come true.
</P>
<P>
This is a great event for the Chinese nation, and the will of
the Chinese government to implement the principles of "one
country, two systems," the "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and a high degree of autonomy stands rock-firm.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Jiang Zemin as reaffirming during his
recent meeting with Tung Chee Hwa, the first Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, that the principle of
"one country, two systems" is not an expedient measure, but rather
a policy set by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that with the powerful backing by the motherland and
common efforts of six million Hong Kong residents, Hong Kong will
be well governed by the first government of the Hong Kong SAR
under the leadership of Mr. Tung Chee Hwa, and continue to
maintain its long-term prosperity and stability," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian's festival greetings were broadcast by China Radio
International today.

<HEADLINE> Cattle Die of Tickborne Disease in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A tickborne disease has killed
over 50 cattle in Mkushi District of Zambia's Central Province in the
past two weeks, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a local official, Langson Nsele, as saying
that the dying of animals has left the farmers in a dilemma as
they have nothing now to use in ploughing.
</P>
<P>
Nsele appealed to the government to send donkeys to the area
to help farmers plough the land and transport their agricultural
input and produce to markets.
</P>
<P>
In replying to the appeal, Central Province Deputy Minister Abel
Chambeshi advised small scale farmers to apply for loans to buy
donkeys through agricultural lending institutions to replace the
dying cattle.
</P>
<P>
The tickborne disease, commonly known as ''denkete'', invaded
the district in 1994, leaving most farmers without oxen to use.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Develop Optical Fiber Cable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Post and
Telecommunication Corporation (VNPT) will replace the existing
communications network with optical fiber cable by the year 2000,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The company will expand its optical fiber cable network this
year, with priority given to major cities and provinces as well as
important local trunk lines.
</P>
<P>
The first domestic line to use optical fiber cable in Vietnam
was built in 1991 linking Hanoi and Noi Bai International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The use of the optical fiber cable is playing an increasingly
important role in domestic and international information
transmission in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The VNPT formed joint ventures with South Korea's Gold Star
Group in 1994 and with Germany's Siemens in 1995. These two
factories produced a total of more than 1,000 kilometers of
optical fiber cable last year.
</P>
<P>
A number of inter-provincial and local communication lines have
been built with use of optical fiber cable in Hanoi, Hai Phong,
Quang Ninh, Tay Ninh, Hao Thanh and Ho Chi Minh City.

<HEADLINE> Hyacinth Affects Electricity Production in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Power production at the Owen
Falls hydraulic station is being affected by decomposing water
hyacinth, reported the local daily the New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Simon d'Ujanga, Acting Managing Director of the Uganda
Electricity Board (UEB), was quoted as saying power supply to the
country will from time to time be switched off to enable workers
to flush out the weed which blocks water supply to the turbines.
</P>
<P>
He said the weed has no physical danger to the dam of the power
station, but when it rots its silt keeps breaking the water supply to
the power machines.
</P>
<P>
He said a feasibility study had been done for a barrier to
be erected near the Owen Falls to prevent the weed coming into
the power station.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that in conjunction with the Agriculture
Ministry, the UEB spends over 12,000 US Dollars monthly to fight
the hyacinth at the dam.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth has now strangled 90 perceent of the shoreline
of rivers and lakes in Uganda, a stretch of about 2,000 km. The
weeds are covering all the bays of Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga,
River Nile in Uganda and, to a small extnet, Lake Albert, causing
a calamity in social and economic areas. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. African Aids Research to Get Government Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma has confirmed that the government would offer funds for
further research into an Aids drug named Virodene P058.
</P>
<P>
"After certain technicalities are dealt with, the scientists
should receive government funding," Zuma was quoted as saying by
the local daily The Citizen today.
</P>
<P>
A group of medical scientists in Pretoria University announced at
a cabinet meeting on January 22 that their latest development of
Virodene P058 had produced far better results for curing Aids.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of local medical experts expressed doubtfulness
towards the "breakthrough invention", saying that it was almost too
good to believe in such miraculous discovery.
</P>
<P>
In response to the doubtfulness, Zuma said the Pretoria University
scientists should be encouraged if they can help to restore and
extend the lives of Aids sufferers, and to control the disease.
</P>
<P>
"The reason I took them to the cabinet (to announce their
discovery) was because their research has not only produced exciting
results, but also had implications for manufacturing at an affordable
price," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
The woman minister said the government would decide how best to
support the initiative.

<HEADLINE> China to Have 1.3 Billion Population by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China will hopefully control
its population within 1.3 billion by the year 2000, achieving its
set goal of the Ninth Five-Year (1996-2000) Plan, latest
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistical Bureau, during this period,
20.6 million more babies will be born, a net increase of 12.11
million, or an annual growth rate of 9.78 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the total population of the country will
reach 1.272 billion. The populations of Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macao are not included in the figure.
</P>
<P>
Analysts claim that although China's family planning has scored
great progress and the birth rate has dropped to the lowest point
since the 1980s, the country's program of birth control still has
a long way to go, especially in rural areas where the social
insurance system is not adequate.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that if the population growth is not put under
tight control, China's population may exceed the 1.3 billion
target by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The country's birth rate in 1996 was down slightly from the
previous year, at 17 births per thousand. The birth rate of second
children decreased steadily, and that for single children went up
slightly.
</P>
<P>
China has a state policy of one child per family.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma Chairman
Gennady Seleznev discussed a variety of issues including bilateral
ties, European security and NATO expansion with Polish leaders
during his Poland visit which concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to continue to maintain dialogue and promote
the development of trade, economic and cultural ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the divergent stances Between the two countries on NATO's
eastward expansion remained unchanged with Seleznev reaffirming
Moscow's protest against the Western alliance's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military bloc was a stale product of the Cold
War and Russia would not change its stance on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
However, he didn't rule out the possibility of seeking an
solution which will eliminate Russia's worries over the NATO's
expansion to include the former Warsaw Pact countries.
</P>
<P>
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said after meeting the
Russian guest that NATO's eastward expansion was logical
continuation of the 1989 changes in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the organization's enlargement would
consolidate security in Europe instead of endangering it, as
Russia held.
</P>
<P>
Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz echoed the
president by saying that Poland's position on joining NATO was
unchangeable. It should not have a negative effect on
Poland-Russia relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> hke - U.S. President's State of Union on Balanced Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
called on the Congress today to help reach the balanced budget but
opposed the balanced budget constitutional amendment proposed by
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union speech to the joint session of the
U.S. Congress, Clinton said that the U.S. must "complete the
unfinished business of our country", among which the balance of
the budget was the first one.
</P>
<P>
He said the Republican proposal for a constitutional amendment
for a balanced budget was "unnecessary and unwise," saying, "We
don't need a constitutional amendment. We need action."
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the U.S. government and Congress over how
to balance the budget resulted in two partial government shutdowns
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that the government and Congress must "be
partners, not partisans."
</P>
<P>
He will recommend 100 billion U.S. dollars in middle-class tax
cuts over five years and various tax-cut measures to realize the
goal in the budget plan for fiscal year of 1998 to be announced on
February 6.
</P>
<P>
The tax-cut will be offset by 80 billion U.S. dollars in tax
increases on corporations and airline travelers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he wanted to make health care available to
more Americans by broadening coverage for unemployed workers and
needy children.
</P>
<P>
However, he proposed no major reforms of either Medicare or
Medicaid programs.
</P>
<P>
Over the last four years, more than two million people have moved
off the welfare rolls, Clinton noted. He set a goal of moving two
million more people off the rolls by 2000 with tax incentives for
businesses to hire the needy and reopen last year's welfare law to
restore benefits to legal immigrants.

UNITED NATIONS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan condemned on Tuesday the ambush killing of four U.N.

Cyangugu prefecture, approximately 200 miles southwest of Kigali
on the Zairean border.
</P>

WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States must

Bill Clinton declared here today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was delivering his first State of the Union
address in his second term, said: "We must pursue a deeper
dialogue with China.
</P>
<P>
"An isolated China is not good for America.
</P>
<P>
"I will go to China and I have invited China's president to
come here, not because we agree on everything, but because
engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges,"
Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policies, Clinton stressed that the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) must expand by 1999, while building "a
stable partnership between NATO and Russia".
</P>
<P>
"When Europe is stable, prosperous, and at peace, America is
more secure," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries
that were once our adversaries can become our allies," Clinton
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that NATO would start the expansion plan at its
special summit in July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the U.S. would play a prominent role as a
stabilizing force in Asia while taking part in regional
peacemaking efforts such as in the Middle East, Bosnia and
Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Thai Commerce Ministry Cuts Import Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Ministry of
Thailand has sharply revised this year's import growth from 15
percent to 7 percent due to the slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
In the latest forecast this week, with revised import growth of
7 percent, down from 15 percent projected last November, imports
bill for 1997 will total 1,970 billion baht (78.8 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The export growth projection remains unchanged at 10 percent
with shipments estimated to total 1,570 billion baht (62.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 1997 trade deficit is now forecast to be about
400 billion baht (16 billion dollars), down 3 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
Measures to reduce the government expenditure in this fiscal
year or delay spending in both the government and state enterprise
sectors are among the factors that will sharply reduce import
bills.
</P>
<P>
Among major projects which will be affected by budget cuts or
changes are delayed government arms procurements, suspension of
Thailand tobacco monopoly's new factory and construction of an
eight-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
The second Bangkok international airport is also likely to be

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Education Top Priority in State of Union Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton, in his State of the Union address today, gave top
priority to education.
</P>
<P>
He promised to upgrade the nation's education in his
second-term and urged Congress to approve a huge increase in
education aid to meet the goals.
</P>
<P>
"My number one priority as president for the next four years --
is to ensure that Americans have the best education in the world,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
In the televised address before the joint houses of Congress,
Clinton proposed to increase education spending by 20 percent, to
51 billion U.S. dollars for fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
The president called for expanding investment in technology,
medical science, space exploration and the scope of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Under his education program, which would increase spending to
nearly 60 billion dollars a year by 2002, the nation should meet
these goals: "Every 8-year-old must be able to read, every
12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet, every
18-year-old must be able to go to college and every adult American
must be able to keep on learning."
</P>
<P>
The proposed educational assistance includes a 1,500
U.S. dollars tax credit for the first two years of higher
education if a student maintains a B average. Alternatively,
families could opt for a tax deduction of up to 10,000 dollars a
year for higher education or job-training tuition.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also took the opportunity to appeal for racial
harmony. "For no matter what our differences -- in our faiths,
our backgrounds, our politics -- we must all be repairers of the
breach. We may not share a common past, but surely we have a
common future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also promised to complete campaign finance reform
before July 4 and to reopen last year's welfare law to restore
benefits to legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
On other domestic issues, the president promised stronger
efforts to fight against street crimes and stop drug addiction, as
well as continued work for environment protection.

<HEADLINE> Italy Sees A Daily Race Intolerance Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 4 (Xinhua) -- An Italian study shows that an
average of one case of racial intolerance or violence takes place
each day.
</P>
<P>
Of 365 cases reported in 1996, 24 percent involved immigrants
against immigrants, and 50 percent happened in the world of
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Milan and Rome, where most of the immigrants live, witnessed
most of the racial intolerance or violence cases, with
respectively 68 and 64 cases reported last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Italy: Intolerance and Xenophobia" report,
cases of violence climbed significantly compared to the one every
two days in 1995, and there were about 60 cases of intolerance,
half of which involved physical aggression.
</P>
<P>
Milan research institute director Massimo Todisco said the 365
cases last year were "emblematic and represent only the tip of the
iceberg". The head of the Rome city office for immigration, Silvio
Di Francia, said the 365 cases showed that Italy was "a nation
where racism was now ordinary, and intolerance no longer provokes
any reaction."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the second half of 1996 saw a sharp
increase in violence against prostitutes, from 23 to 31 cases, and
against minors, from 13 to 35.
</P>
<P>
In the case of intolerance, 163 were cases personal offense, 65
cases were race-related and 84 involved living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The report also looked at the illegal alien problem. It estimated
the number of immigrants without residence permits at 150,000, while 70
percent of immigrants who were victims of violence did not hold
residency permits.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Chechnya mission
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
was expelled from Chechnya this evening, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Tim Guldimann, a Swiss diplomat, was compelled to leave
Chechnya after Chechen "Foreign Minister" Ruslan Chimayev earlier
today called him in and declared him persona non grata, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said Guldimann was expelled for his recent public
statements that Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Guldimann arrived in the Ingush Republic this evening and the
other members of OSCE are still staying in Chechnya, one of the
republics of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Guldimann took up the post of the head of Chechnya mission of
OSCE a year ago. During his efforts to help find a solution to the
Chechen crisis, he had often tilted to the Chechen opposition,
which was disapproved by the Russian authorities.

<P>
SOFIA, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's political forces
agreed today to hold early national elections in late April, which
will be organized by a caretaker government to be appointed by
President Petar Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
The move not only averted further worsening of a social crisis
marked by mass rallies and strikes, but also paved the way for
various political forces to reach basic reconciliation, Stoyanov
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned his countrymen not to expect the ending of
Bulgaria's serious crisis in a matter of months as many
difficulties remain.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement after crisis talks between the ruling
Socialists and opposition parties said they had agreed Stoyanov
"should set early general elections in the second 10 days of
April".
</P>
<P>
The Socialists agreed to elections just hours before their
seven-day mandate to form a new cabinet expired. Opposition groups
intensified protests in recent days to mount pressure for the
Socialists to quit.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists, elected to a four-year term in 1994, have been
criticized for the crumbling economy, with inflation at 50 percent
a month and the lev plummeting.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's total foreign
trade volume stood at 861.2 million U.S. dollars, 3 percent less
than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of the country was 15.4 million dollars,
derived from 422.9 million dollars of exports and 438.3 million
dollars of imports.
</P>
<P>
Boldbaatar, director of the Bureau of International Trade and
Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attributed the
mounting trade deficit to lower copper and cashmere prices on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China and Japan are Mongolia's largest trade partners,
accounting for 27.6 percent, 16 percent and 13 percent of the
total respectively, Boldbaatar said.

<HEADLINE> Government May Limit Processing Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A huge increase in China's
processing trade is creating problems, and moderate 11 percent
growth in the sector last year suggested the State may slow down
the sector's development, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report from the General Administration of
Customs as saying that the processing trade totaled 146.6 billion
US dollars, accounting for 50.6 percent of China's foreign trade
last year.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time processing trade exceeded general trade
to become China's main foreign trade contributor, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade covers commodities imported for processing
and re-exported with added value. It accounted for 40 percent of
foreign trade in 1990 and has steadily expanded since.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the processing trade does not only bring added value,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some East Asian and Southeast Asian countries are making use of
the processing trade to transfer the blame for trade surpluses to
China.
</P>
<P>
Countries intending to erect trade barriers against China will
intentionally calculate the total value of the re-exports as
trade gains for China. On the basis of their exaggerated
statistics they complain of trade deficits with China, it said.
</P>
<P>
Surging re-exports also pose a threat to domestic manufacturers
as identical products compete for overseas market shares.
</P>
<P>
They also make it harder for China to monitor the imports and
exports of some strategic and sensitive products.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 65 percent of China's
processing trade last year, five percentage points more than in
1995.
</P>
<P>
State-run enterprises were having a shrinking role, in part
because some of them introduced foreign investment to become
foreign-funded and in part because foreign investment companies
are very strong in the trade, it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cigarettes Sweep Across Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Billboards of American cigarettes
have become a landscape in Ukraine with Philip Morris Inc. and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. having captured 85 percent of the
country's tobacco market.
</P>
<P>
Back to the summer of 1990, an economic crisis trapped the
tobacco industry in then Soviet Union. Smokers in Moscow,
St. Petersburg, Kiev and other cities complained of deficient
cigarette supply.
</P>
<P>
Apart from firing the minister in charge of the tobacco
industry, then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev imported 34
billion packs of cigarettes from Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds,
which later took full advantage of the situation, nearly seizing
all tobacco markets in Central Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
American companies bought a number of tobacco factories, either
bankrupt or in red in the former Soviet republics, and then
carpetbombed with ads on television, radio and billboards.
</P>
<P>
The companies are making a real fortune.
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds alone could sell cigarettes worth 50 billion
dollars a year in the former Soviet republics, according to the
latest reports carried in Ukrainian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, with a population of 52 million, second only to Russia
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, is particularly
attractive to Western companies.
</P>
<P>
When most Western companies still hesitated over Ukraine's
bureaucracy, unstable monetary policy and unpredictable
legislature, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds had controlled the
nation's market at one stroke by buying the stocks of its five
largest tobacco factories.
</P>
<P>
"It's risky to enter the Ukrainian market, but the market
potential is tremendous," said Ronny Lindkvist, Reynolds' general
manager in its Kiev branch.
</P>
<P>
Though anti-smoking movement is sweeping around the globe,
including Ukraine, stacks of dollars in the hands of American
tobacco giants are irresistible to the country. They have brought
in investment and technology.
</P>
<P>
"We are improving the country's ailing economy and social
welfare through the tobacco industry," added Lindkvist.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Public Health Ministry is deeply upset about the
ready market of American cigarettes, accusing the companies of
hurting the Ukrainian society which is already unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
It complained that American companies trapped young men and
women into smoking with flashy advertisements. Almost one third of
Ukrainian women smoke now.
</P>
<P>
To ban cigarette ads, the Public Ministry, the Red Cross and
some Ukrainian celebrities pressed the parliament to adopt a law
prohibiting all kinds of cigarette ads.
</P>
<P>
However, the American companies reportedly lobbied legislators
and submitted to the parliament a 40-page document, saying it
would cost Ukraine 400 million dollars if cigarette ads were
banned.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the parliament passed a compromise law on July 3,
1996, barring cigarette ads only on television and radio.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Understands Malaysia's Border Closure: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta understands Malaysia's
decision to close 12 check points on its land borders with
Indonesia on Borneo island, a senior Foreign Ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government's action appeared to be intended to
protect its internal security in light of recent mass riots in the
Indonesian province of West Kalimantan which shares a land border
with Malaysia's Sarawak state, Izhar Ibrahim, the ministry's
director general of political affairs said here last night.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Malaysia closed off 12 border posts in the
south Sarawak which borders two Indonesian provinces.
</P>
<P>
The sudden closure stranded several hundred Indonesians working
or traveling to neighboring Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
Riots triggered by inter-ethnic friction erupted in Sangau
Ledo, West Kalimantan, last December 3 and lasted until January 2.
They caused a considerable damage to the people's property and
claimed a number of human lives.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, dozens of soldiers have been deployed to the
west Kalimantan province to ensure security, and the scope of a
curfew has been extended, after the wave of violence in some local
districts.
</P>
<P>
The military presence was introduced following the arrest of 11
people linked with the unrest and widespread rumors that further
riots would occur in the province.
</P>
<P>
Izhar could not predict when the crossing points would be
reopened.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta would like to see the crossing points reopened once the
unrest has subsided, he said.

colossal joint chemicals project in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Weak Yen Reduces Philippines' Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine foreign debt stock
has been reduced by 570 million U.S. dollars due to the
depreciation of the Japanese yen from 114.9 to 121.4 against the
U.S. dollar from the end of 1996 to February 3.
</P>
<P>
The weak yen also reduced the U.S. dollar equivalent of
yen-denominated loans approved in 1996, valued at about 2.1
billion dollars based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of
approval, by 219 million dollars, today's newspaper Malaya quoted
central bank governor Gabriel Singson as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 yen loan approval is earmarked predominantly for
project financing, which takes five to seven years to disburse,
depending on the project.
</P>
<P>
As of September 1996, the country's total yen obligations
amounted to 1.223 trillion yen, roughly the same as that of the
April 1995 level, when the yen was at its peak at around 80.61 to
one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1995, the dollar value of the Philippine yen
obligation has dropped by about 4.8 billion dollars, according to

in the election system, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Such a law should authorize the use of computerized voting
machines starting with the 1998 presidential, congressional and
local elections, Comelec Chairman Bernardo Pardo was quoted as
saying by Manila Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said the computerized voting machines, if used all over
the country, could cost billions of pesos, but then the people
will see candidates winning in free and clean elections and the
losers gracefully conceding to their defeat even before the final
results are announced.
</P>
<P>
He said the Comelec found this out during the last elections in
the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Although the ARMM
was regarded as a critical area, there were no election related
killings or violence and the results were known within days of the
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has fallen
"dangerously" behind, Asia and the United States especially, in
the world market's most promising industry, telecommunications and
information technology.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Netherlands, the EU's rotating presidency at
present, shows that the Union is "losing ground".
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1995, the EU climbed 2.4 percent in production in
the sector of telecom and infotech, while the U.S. increased 9.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite an overall trade surplus, the 15-nation bloc had a
deficit of 23 billion ECU (about 27 billion U.S. dollars)
in this sector over five years.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of telecom and infotech products sold in Europe
fell from 68 percent to 60 percent during 1990-1995.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20 leading software companies in the world,
only two European ones -- the SAP and AG -- were represented.
</P>
<P>
Europan Union experts urged speeding up the coordination of its
internal markets, standardizing its products and strengthening
research and cooperation in the integration of telecom and infotech
products.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Backs to Bulls After All-Star Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Bulls forward Dennis
Rodman, suspended for 11 games by the National Basketball
Association for kicking a cameraman, was reinstated by the league
on Tuesday and will return to the Chicago Bulls on February 11.
</P>
<P>
But NBA commissioner David Stern warned that Rodman could face
carrer banishment from the league if he persists in such conduct.
</P>
<P>
The suspension, his ninth since 1992 and third since last
March, costed Rodman more than one million U.S. dollars in salary
and incentives. Rodman is eligible to play against the Charlotte
Hornets, the Bulls' first game after the All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, who has led the league in rebounding the last five
years, received his longest suspension after kicking courtside
cameraman Eugene Amos during a game between the Bulls and
Minnesota Timberwolves on January 15.
</P>
<P>
After he was suspended January 17, Rodman reached an
out-of-court settlement with Amos, agreeing to pay him 200,000
U.S. dollars.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) will ask for official recognition by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) of its increasing negotiating capacity as a
bloc.
</P>
<P>
Official Mercosur sources said that aspect and other matters
related to this tariff union were on the agenda of the Common
Market Group (CMG), the Mercosur's technical body which has been
meeting in Asuncion, Paraguay since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur was formed in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay. It was joined recently by Chile and Bolivia as
associate members, and is placing emphasis on the consolidation of
its international projections during the six months in which
Paraguay is the secretary, sources say.
</P>
<P>
During the opening deliberations of the CMG, Paraguayan
Foreign Minister Ruben Melgarejo Lanzoni stressed the progress
made by the regional integration process, which was generated in
the atmosphere of other international economic forums.
</P>
<P>
Melgarejo pointed out that the economic and political liberties
that prevailed in partner countries presented Mercosur as a solid
bloc with a favorable outlook before the international community.

<HEADLINE> UN Loans Relieve Poverty In Remote Yunnan Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A Miao minority woman living in
absolute poverty in Jinping, a remote county in southern Yunnan
Province has been lucky enough to get a 500 yuan loan without
security, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Li Ermei used the money, a specially designed United Nations
Development Program loan aimed at helping the rural poor, to
purchase and process agriculture products, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Just 12 days later, she handed in the first 15 yuan she has
earned from her businesses to UNDP workers, but in the past, the
newspaper said, it was impossible for poor rural individuals like
Li to ask for bank loans because of the lack of credit guarantees,
the newspaper cited local poverty experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Even such small loans offer new hope for the rural poor who
have been locked in poverty for many generations. The lack of
primary funds had always held back their economic development.
</P>
<P>
The new type of loans, featuring small scale and long repayment
terms without security, is becoming more and more popular in
Yunnan's poverty-stricken Jinping and Malipo counties.
</P>
<P>
The loans, also known as "Bangladesh Loans" as they were
initiated by Bangladesh's Grameen Trust, provide small cash
advances directly to poor farming households. They have been
granted by UNDP since last June to farmers in the two counties.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, more than 300 farming households in
the two counties have become prospective borrowers through joining
356 credit groups in which five households organized in a
voluntary group to shoulder the credit guarantees together as UNDP
requires.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, all loans in the two counties have been
repaid as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
So far, UNDP has poured some 100,000 US dollars into such
loans, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Unemployment Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate sank to 5.9 percent in the last quarter
in 1996 from 6.3 percent in the preceding quarter, shows the
latest Household Labor Force Survey conducted by Statistics NZ.
</P>
<P>
Figures indicate that in December last year, 106,000 New
Zealanders were unemployed, 9,000 fewer than in September.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that among the jobless people, the number
of long-term unemployed, meaning those out of work for more than
26 weeks, dropped by 4,600 or 11.6 percent in the year to December
to 34,900.
</P>
<P>
The present unemployment is at its lowest level since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the latest quarter came against the expectation of
most economists, and is attributed to the change in the benefit
structure allowing beneficiaries to earn more income within a
three-month period.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Peter McCardle, a keen promoter of
work-for-the-dole schemes, welcomed the fall in unemployment,
especially considering slower economic growth late last year.

BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has urged
that the protection of intellectual property rights be stepped up
in 1997, after the country closed 26 illegal CD production lines
in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Duan Ruichun, who is in charge of the IPR Office under the State
Council, was quoted by today's "China Daily" as saying that more
improvement is required to clarify the ownership and sharing
interests of research findings.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, he said, the country should determine the value
of invisible assets in trade negotiations, jointly-funded programs
and technological co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the authorities launched 37,300 checks
across the country to crackdown IPR infringement last year. A
total of 1.38 million pirated tapes, 485,000 laser discs, 84,700
softwares and 1.14 million books were confiscated.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- China's saker falcons decreased
by about 7,000 between 1990 and 1996 as a result of rampant
poaching, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper revealed that between 1992 and 1995, about 3,000
people from neighboring countries were arrested in China for
illegal hunting of the bird, and some 1,000 saker falcons were
seized.
</P>
<P>
The saker falcon is a rare wild bird with class two
state protection. One saker falcon can eat 2,000 rats a year,
playing an important role in maintaining an ecological balance,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The official English language paper quoted officials from
public security and other departments as saying that the poachers'
illegal activities have harmed China's wildlife resources.
</P>
<P>
The country will launch a crackdown on falcon theft, the paper
said. Foreigners who commit crimes in China will be punished
according to Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
It added that China welcomes foreigners to invest, to carry out
exchanges and co-operation in various fields, and to go
sightseeing, but they must abide by Chinese law.

cost of more than 900 million yuan (about 108 million dollars),
said Cai Qihua, deputy director of the provincial bureau of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The funds earmarked for the construction exceeded last year's
sum by 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, most of the funds were raised by local
governments or came from farmers, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 490 million man-hours of labor have gone into the
province-wide construction since last September, a water official
said, adding that 410 million cubic meters of earth and stones
have been removed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a record 144,000 machines were put into use to make
up for the labor shortfall in areas where many rural residents
either worked for local rural enterprises or engaged in businesses
outside the province.
</P>
<P>
Cai made it clear that "the construction aimed at improving
agricultural production and protecting this year's harvest will be
continued until Spring Festival, which will fall on Friday."
</P>
<P>
The completed water-control works and irrigation facilities
were expected to increase or improve irrigation of 198,000
hectares of farmland, improve about 147,000 hectares of drainage
area, and ensure water-saving irrigation in 22,000 hectares of
grain-growing land.
</P>
<P>
Such a large-scale construction would also contribute to the
province's efforts to reduce soil-erosion, improve low-yield
farmland and lay a solid foundation for the province to ensure
good grain harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Sitting on China's north-to-south geographical dividing line,
Anhui has been suffering frequent floods, waterlogging in its
plains in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and middle
reaches of the Huaihe River and droughts in its hilly lands.
</P>
<P>
Annually, 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion dollars) worth of
damage is caused by the floods in the province, while its existing
water conservation projects have been proven to have reduced some
40 billion yuan worth of damage in the last two year.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's total foreign
trade volume stood at 861.2 billion U.S. dollars, 3 percent less
than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of the country was 15.4 million dollars,
derived from 422.9 billion dollars of exports and 438.3 billion
dollars of imports.
</P>
<P>
Boldbaatar, director of the Bureau of International Trade and
Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attributed the
mounting trade deficit to lower copper and cashmere prices on the
international market.

Russia, China and Japan are Mongolia's largest trade partners,
accounting for 27.6 percent, 16 percent and 13 percent of the
total respectively, Boldbaatar said.

Engineering Institute to celebrate China's traditional Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
The once-a-year occasion, the largest gathering of Chinese

<HEADLINE> More Companies Entering Agribusiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
private companies are doing agriculture-related business, and the
western area of the country is becoming a hot place to locate,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the number of private companies already
surpassed 710,000, an increase of nine percent from the same period
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of private companies engaged in agricultural
business exceeded 7,200, up 14.5 percent from the same period of
the previous year, the paper quoted the State Administration of
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of private companies are aware that to
survive intensified market competition will require their efforts
in adapting to changes in the government's industrial policies,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of private companies grew rapidly in
Shaanxi, Guizhou, Liaoning provinces and Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region. But, the growth of such kinds of companies was shrinking
in the eastern and central provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
However, SAIC officials indicated that in 1996 the year-on-year
growth in the number of Chinese private companies decreased by
45.6 percentage points from 1995, and the number of self-employed
business households fell from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Since the concept of mergers has been introduced into the
country along with reform, big companies incorporating small ones
has not only been the business of the State ownership system, SAIC
explained.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of private companies and self-employed
business households was shrinking compared with the previous
year, their business scope was expanding through incorporation in
1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, registered assets of private companies
in China surpassed 313 billion yuan, up 27.2 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
As for self-employed business households, the number of the
households exceeded 25 million last year, down 2.2 percent from
the previous year. However, their registered assets last year
chalked up a year-on-year rise of 4.1 percent to surpass 188.7
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Joint Annual Inspections Make Foreign Investors Cheerful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Six government departments will
conduct joint annual inspections of foreign-funded enterprises in
stead of conducting separate inspections by different government
departments as they did in the past with an aim to give easier
access to foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The joint annual inspection is expected to better the
investment environment and improve government efficiency, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The inspection, starting at the beginning of this year, are
undertaken jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce,
the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance,
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the State Bureau
of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs will take part in the
move from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Every foreign-funded enterprise must hand in a combined annual
inspection report to the seven departments or their branches in
the January-April period.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises should report their capital, production,
management, finance, foreign exchange, imports and exports in the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Promote Use of Iodized Salt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 5 (Xinhua) -- In a move to reduce the high
rate of disease caused by iodine deficiency, Tibet this year will
promote the use of iodized cooking salt in the region, rather than
spreading iodized tea as before.
</P>
<P>
Health News has reported that Tibet plans to build four iodized
salt factories to meet the needs of local residents. The number of
iodine deficiency cases in the Himalayas regions ranks in the top
six in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Tibet has been popularizing iodized tea, hoping the
drink will act as a substitute for iodized salt and iodized oil
pills.
</P>
<P>
But the effort failed, according to a 1996 report issued by a
joint research team involving the office on the prevention and
treatment of endemic disease and United Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
A team survey of 263 primary school pupils in six township
schools in Tibet showed that just over 64 percent of the pupils
there had enlarged thyroids.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that sales of non-iodized salt were
widespread in the Tibetan salt market.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Fight Against EU's Butter Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is to launch a
two-pronged effort to fight against the European Commission's
decision to ban low-tariff entry to Britain for NZ spreadable
butter, the local newspaper "the Dominion" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Lockwood Smith was quoted as saying the
government would take the commission to the World Trade
Organization and that the Dairy Board was expected to initiate
action in British courts and the European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Smith made the announcement Tuesday after meeting Franz
Fischler, the first European agriculture commissioner to visit New
Zealand since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Smith reportedly told Fishchler that NZ took exception to the
unilateral nature of the EU decision to impose duty on its
spreadable butter.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, the Dairy Board lost an appeal against a
commission ruling that spreadable butter does not qualify as
butter and therefore cannot get low-tariff entry to Europe.
</P>
<P>
As a result, New Zealand will have to pay an extra 3,050 NZ
dollars (2075 US dollars) a ton on its annual spreadable butter
sales to Britain if it is to send the product from New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Food Supplies to Arrive in Iraq Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Shipments of foodstuffs and
medical supplies to Iraq in implementation of the oil-for-food
agreement are expected to arrive here by the end of this month,
a diplomatic source told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The source has also confirmed the arrival of two U.N. food
observers in Baghdad, anticipating the arrival of others in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations will send 151 international observers to
Iraq to supervise the distribution of foodstuffs, medicine and
other supplies to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Revenues of Iraqi oil sales were accumulating in special
account in New York and the United Nations may thus be able
this month to cover the expenses of deployment of the observers
as well as the purchase of wheat, sugar and rice and other basic
commodities needed by Iraq, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Reports have been circulating that Iraq has signed contracts
for the purchase of wheat from France and Australia. Merchants in
Baghdad also said that contracts have been signed for the purchase
of rice and sugar and other commodities from France, Thailand and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has earmarked 805 million U.S. dollars of the oil sales
for the purchase of foodstuffs, and 210 million dollars for
medicine. Iraq needs 193 million tonnes of wheat, 319,000 tonnes
of rice and 256,000 tonnes of sugar to cover its needs for six
months.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the United Nations signed the oil-for-food agreement
last year, under which Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion
dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine
for its people.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Slams S. Africa's Trade Union for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swazi Foreign
Minister Arthur Khoza today slammed the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) for backing the national strike in the
mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Khoza, who is at present in South Africa for a visit, said
COSATU's link with the strike, organized by the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), was a clear evidence of
interference in Swaziland's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Khoza expressed his concern to his South African counterpart,
Alfred Nzo, when they met in Pretoria earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Swazi plantation workers on Monday took to the
street demanding a new constitution which would allow political
activities in the land-locked southern African country.
</P>
<P>
COSATU reportedly threatened a blockade of Swaziland if four
arrested SFTU leaders were not released.
</P>
<P>
Khoza said a decision by COSATU to withhold the delivery of
goods to Swaziland would contravene the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) Agreement and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Trade Protocol.
</P>
<P>
In response, Nzo said that COSATU was an independent
organization. However, he emphasized that South Africa had no
intention of interfering with Swaziland's internal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nzo explained that the South African government would perform
its obligations under the SADC and SACU agreements which provide
for the free trade within the region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa respected Swaziland's traditional institutions,
said the South African foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only Southern African country where
multi-party democracy has not been introduced. Activities of
political parties in the country have been banned since 1973.

<HEADLINE> Animal Diseases Rampant in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, FEBRUARY 4 (Xinhua) -- African Farmers and
veterinarians are very much concerned about animal diseases,
which have brought considerable economic losses to countries on
the continent, a top official of an African veterinary society
said today.
</P>
<P>
Paul Bosman, Acting president of Office International Des
Epizooties (OIE)' African Commission, said a number of animal
diseases which are already under control on other parts of the
world, are still rife in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to Bosman, heads from African Veterinary Services
throughout Africa held a forum in Pretoria, the administrative
capital of South Africa, last week to foucs on the worsening
problem. The four-day meeting ended at weekend.
</P>
<P>
The popular epizootic diseases include rinderpest, swine
fever, foot-and-mouth disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
and African horse sickness.
</P>
<P>
Such diseases have "severly penalized livestock production and
in many stances prevents numerous African countries from
exporting to markets of Europe, Asia or the Middle East", Bosman
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most serious problem facing African countries
appeared to be the spread of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia,
which killed a large number of cattle, reduced their fertility
and supply of milk, meat and manure.
</P>
<P>
The weekend veterinarians' meeting have made recommendations
that veterinary public health actions be strengthened in OIE
member countries and international programs for disease control
be set up. enditem

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South African policemen
who have not performed their duties well will be fired in a
forthcoming shake-up, local daily "the Citizen" reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A major shake-up in police at all levels is under
consideration in hope of improving security service around the
country, South African Police Service (SAPS) National
Commisssioner`* was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Policemen who did not or cannot perform at required standards
will be replaced, Fivaz said, adding that "heads should roll if
the department does not meet its challenges in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The remarks by the police chief came in response to sharp
criticism by National Party and Democratic Party, both of which
called on the government to stop pussy-footing around and take
immediate and effective actions against increasing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Refering to the planned shake-up, Fivaz said measures would be
taken to streamline existing SAPS structures and to work out
systems concerned to evaluate and enforce performance and service
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is in a period of transition from
apartheid to democracy, has been much troubled with increasing
violent crimes. Despite the positive role played by the police in
curbing the crimes, the general public still have the impression
that the police should take more responsibility for the current
social disorder. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Warns Iraq Not to Violate UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon, in response to
a German newspaper report, said today that the United States
supported chief U.N. inspector Rolf Edeus's analysis of Iraq's
hiding SCUD missiles and warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not
to violate the Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ken Bacon said, "We believe they are hiding as many
as 18 to 25 SCUD missiles in Iraq. This is against the
sanctions.... We think it would be wise for Saddam to comply with
the U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The German daily Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitune said in an
advance release from Wednesday's edition that U.N. inspectors who
were in Iraq between January 5 and 23 had found that Iraq was
continuing to develop missiles with a range of around 1,600 km.
</P>
<P>
Chief inspector Rolf Ekeus, the newspaper said, had written to
Iraqi Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on January 13, telling him that
Iraq was contravening U.N. resolutions and this would have
consequences.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper also said the United States could make a
decision this week on whether to launch a Tomahawk missile strike
at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said, "Obviously I can't describe what our future actions
would be, but we have shown time and time again that we are
prepared to protect U.S. forces. We are prepared to protect our
interests in the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a State Department briefing, spokesman Nicholas
Burns, asked whether the United States reserves the right to make
a strike if necessary, said, "The United States always reserves
the right to use its military force to defend its national
interest anywhere in the world, but I see no reason to heighten
your concern in any way pertaining to the situation in the Middle

<HEADLINE> Angola Marks Armed Struggle Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 4 (xinhua) -- The Angolan government urged
the former rebel UNITA movement to be committed to the peace
process as the southern African country marked the National Armed
Struggle Day.
</P>
<P>
Thirty six years ago, Angolan nationalists fired the first
shot at the Portuguese colonialists in a bid to win national
independence. The country became independent in 1975.
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally to mark the Armed Struggle Day, Minister of
Public Works Pedro Loy urged the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to abide by the Lusaka Peace
Accord signed in 1994 as the country strives for a national unity
government which, originally scheduled for January 25, has been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
The former rivals have been divided in a couple of key issues
including power sharing and disarmament schedule which has led to
the postponement of the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Money Crisis Shadows U.N. Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The minister-level
deliberations of the top world environmental body which are to
open here Wednesday will be shrouded in thick clouds of money
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) is facing the most
serious financial crisis since its establishment in 1972, said
UNEP Executive Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell at the ongoing 19th
session of the UNEP Governing Council starting on January 27.
</P>
<P>
A few industrial countries, led by the United States,
unwilling to perform their commitments to provide financial and
technical aid for global environmental protection, are seeking
cuts of both budget and their contributions to the world body.
</P>
<P>
The developing world sharply criticizes them, saying they are
trying to dodge their obligations in spite of the fact that it is
the developed nations who have deteriorated global environment.
</P>
<P>
According to figures available, from a budget of 160 million
U.S. Dollars in 1991-92 programs, UNEP's budget provision has
fallen to 90 million Dollars in 1996-97 of which only 62.5
million Dollars can be raised, leaving one-third money gap for
the already heavily slashed budget.
</P>
<P>
"Member states have reduced their overall contributions to
UNEP, while at the same time imposing ever-increasing
responsibilities on UNEP," Dowdeswell said at the biennial
two-week meeting at UNEP's Nairobi headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Major donors including the United States, Japan, Britain,
France and Italy are reluctant to pay and try to push forward
their so-called "reforms" in the body, UNEP sources said.
</P>
<P>
Garcir Duran, head of the Colombian delegation, on behalf of
the Group of 77 and China, called at the meeting for enough money
for UNEP so as to guarantee its normal run.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP, in full charge of all environmental affairs within
the U.N. systems, can work effectively only with enough money to
curb the continuous worsening deterioration of the global
environment, Duran stressed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegates argued that it is reform, not money issue, that
should be put at the top place of the meeting, charging the UNEP
is wasteful, inefficient and has done little since the 1992 Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
It was the reluctancy of rich countries on donations and their
delay to realize their commitments on global environment that has
resulted in the weak performance of the UNEP, the developing
world retorted.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for the UNEP is to solve the money crisis,
said many delegates from the third world.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that necessary reform should be carried
out within the global environment body. But the rich countries
should not regard this as a pretext to cut their donations, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other advanced states insist to
establish a 15-member inter-session body to rule the UNEP, saying
the smaller size leadership will provide more efficiency.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the third world proposes to set up a bigger
inter-session body which is authoratative, widely representative
and based on the current organizing systems.
</P>
<P>
The deliberate pursuance of "reform" by the few west
governments reveals their amibition to control the UNEP
leadership and the whole UNEP while dodging their financial
responsibilities, local observers say. enditem

<HEADLINE> Swaziland Slams S. Africa's Trade Union for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swazi Foreign
Minister Arthur Khoza today slammed the Congress of South African
Trade Unions (COSATU) for backing the national strike in the
mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Khoza, who is at present in South Africa for a visit, said
COSATU's link with the strike, organized by the Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), was a clear evidence of
interference in Swaziland's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Khoza expressed his concern to his South African counterpart,
Alfred Nzo, when they met in Pretoria earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Swazi plantation workers on Monday took to the
street demanding a new constitution which would allow political
activities in the land-locked southern African country.
</P>
<P>
COSATU reportedly threatened a blockade of Swaziland if four
arrested SFTU leaders were not released.
</P>
<P>
Khoza said a decision by COSATU to withhold the delivery of
goods to Swaziland would contravene the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) Agreement and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Trade Protocol.
</P>
<P>
In response, Nzo said that COSATU was an independent
organization. However,DE,x)x-8-z_}ed that South Africa had no
intention of interfering with Swaziland's internal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nzo explained that the South African government would perform
its obligations under the SADC and SACU agreements which provide
for the free trade within the region.
</P>
<P>
South Africa respected Swaziland's traditional institutions,
said the South African foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only Southern African country where
multi-party democracy has not been introduced. Activities of
political parties in the country have been banned since 1973.

<HEADLINE> Serbia's Ruling Party Supports Milosevic's Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Socialist Party of
Serbia (SPS) today expressed strong support for the initiative of
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to reinstate part of the
local election results annulled in November.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative of President Milosevic constitutes the best
legal way for overcoming the difficult political crises that arose
in Serbia following the second round of local polls, and its
confirmation will be the most democratic way for putting a stop to
the adverse events that we have been witnessing in the past two
and half months," the SPS Belgrade city board said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The confirmation of the initiative will also prevent further
endangering of the interests of the state for the sake of party
interests and ensure normal living and working conditions for the
citizens of Serbia," said the statement quoted by the Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
After nearly 80 days of street protest in Belgrade by the
opposition Zajedno coalition, Milosevic today ordered the
reinstatement of part of the election results annulled by the
government in November.
</P>
<P>
"In keeping with its constitutional competence, I propose that
the Serbian government submit to parliament a draft emergency law
which will proclaim as final results of a part of local elections
in Serbia in keeping with the findings of the OSCE (fact-finding)
mission," Milosevic said in a letter to Serbian Prime Minister
Mirko Marjanovic.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno has been staging peaceful street protests over the past
11 weeks in Belgrade to demand the full reinstatement of the
election results. It claims to have won in the local election
results in 14 cities and its victory was confirmed by the OSCE
(Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe) after its
delegation visited Belgrade for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Serbia and the Federal Republic of Serbia are and will be a
part of Europe and good relations with the European Union are
essential for the future of our country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A definite resolution of the unnecessary political crisis in
Serbian towns will enable further good relations, which the
republic wants to develop, with the developed part of the world,"
the SPS Belgrade city board said.

<P>
Lagos, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Environmental sanitation is to
receive a boost in Nigeria through a plan by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) to assist in the conversion of refuse
into income-generating ventures.
</P>
<P>
A study on the feasibility of the plan will be conducted soon,
Comfort Olayiwole, UNICEF project officer in charge of
sanitation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
A number of the cities will be selected for the pilot project,
the UNICEF official said, adding that some non-governmental
organizations will be involved in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
She said UNICEF would also assist in the school sanitation
program by using pupils as disseminators of health messages,
while competition on environmental friendliness would be promoted
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to her, seven African countries will next month
participate in a UNICEF-assisted workshop on improving low-cost
sanitation technology through the use of sanitation platforms in
pit latrines.
</P>
<P>
The countries are Ghana, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cape
Verde, Equatorial Guinea and Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has constructed more than 30,000 such platforms since
1994 to improve environmental sanitation in the rural areas of
Nigeria, she said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Reaffirms Desire to Join NATO in First Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu reaffirmed on the occasion of his visit to NATO
today his country's strong desire to be included in the first
wave of NATO's enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the press after his meeting with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and members of the North Atlantic Council,
President Constantinescu said the main argument for his country's
early membership was that Romania today was a pillar of stability.
</P>
<P>
"Through the good relations Romania has been developing with
all its neighbors, it has begun a regional stability," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Solana restated that NATO would invite "one or
several" countries to begin accession talks with NATO at NATO's
Madrid summit in July.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision would be taken "upon the consideration of
both political and military nature."
</P>
<P>
With the Madrid summit approaching, the new Romanian government
and President Constantinescu have made NATO membership a priority.
</P>
<P>
Although no formal decisions have yet been taken, NATO leaders
meeting in Madrid in July are expected to name Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as the first group countries to be invited to
join the organization probably in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Romania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia are
considered the next strongest contenders.
</P>
<P>
France has already thrown its weight behind Bucharest's bid to
join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports, a senior Romanian official has
said that his country would spend 4 billion US dollars in the next
five years to bring its military hardware up to NATO standards,
upgrading fighters and buying electronic warfare equipment.

KHARTOUM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Hassan al-Bashir returned here today after a brief visit to Kenya
and exchange of views with Kenyan leaders on Sudan's situation.
</P>
<P>
The visit was one in a series of the kind by Sudanese senior

situation in Sudan and the "Ethiopian-Eritrean aggressions and
Ugandan provocations along the southern Sudanese borders."

Moi is the current Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority
on development of peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During his several-hour visit at his own request, the Sudanese
president added, he also discussed issues of relations between the

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Reshuffle Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- South African policemen
who have not performed their duties well will be fired in a
forthcoming shake-up, local daily "the Citizen" reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A major shake-up in police at all levels is under
consideration in hope of improving security service around the
country, South African Police Service (SAPS) National
Commisssioner George Fivaz was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Policemen who did not or cannot perform at required standards
will be replaced, Fivaz said, adding that "heads should roll if
the department does not meet its challenges in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The remarks by the police chief came in response to sharp
criticism by National Party and Democratic Party, both of which
called on the government to stop pussy-footing around and take
immediate and effective actions against increasing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Refering to the planned shake-up, Fivaz said measures would be
taken to streamline existing SAPS structures and to work out
systems concerned to evaluate and enforce performance and service
at all levels.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is in a period of transition from
apartheid to democracy, has been much troubled with increasing
violent crimes. Despite the positive role played by the police in
curbing the crimes, the general public still have the impression
that the police should take more responsibility for the current
social disorder. enditem

Aksener announced here today that she had dismissed Sincan Mayor
Bekir Yildiz for praising some extremist organizations.

WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. officials declined
today to comment on a German newspaper report that the United
States is mulling over another missile strike on Iraq, which U.N.
inspectors had discovered has been continuing to develop missiles.
</P>
<P>
At a regular news briefing, State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said, "There is no change of policy here.... There's no
heightened concern in Washington. There's continuing vigilance in
Washington on this issue. But I simply can't comment on any
prospect of the use of military force."
</P>
<P>
Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitune, a German daily, said in an
advance release from Wednesday's edition that the United States
could make a decision this week on whether to launch a Tomahawk
missile strike at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The German newspaper said the U.N. inspectors who were in Iraq
between january 5 and 23 had found that Iraq was continuing to
develop missiles with a range of around 1,600 km.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper continued that chief inspector Rolf Ekeus had
written to Iraqi Prime Minister Tariq Azizi on January 13, telling
him that Iraq was contravening U.N. resolutions and this would
have consequences.
</P>
<P>
Burns, responding to a question whether the United States
reserved the right to make a strike if it deemed this necessary,
said, "The United States always reserves the right to use its
military force to defend its national interest anywhere in the
world, but I see no reason to heighten your concern in any way
pertaining to the situation in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials also refused to comment on the German
newspaper's report about the U.S. consideration of a punitive
strike against Iraq for its alleged contravention of U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
A defense official said that they don't discuss future
operations, but said the United States agreed with chief inspector
Ekeus's analysis that Iraq still possessed the SCUD missiles.
</P>
<P>
"We agree with his assessment and continue to support U.N.
Special Commission efforts to insure that Iraq is in compliance
with applicable U.S. Security Council resolutions," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, February 4 (Xinhua) -- A two-day nationwide
strike called by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU)
continued today in the capital of the mountain kingdom Mbabane
and the commercial centre Manzini, said a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The strike, launched on Monday among a strong presence of
police and security forces, was aimed to press the government to
speed up the democratization process and lift a 24-year-old ban
on political parties.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only southern African country where political
parties have still been banned by a royal decree in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Although a massive stayaway went ahead with reports of 100
percent participation by workers in the eastern part of the
kingdom, business activities in Mbabane and Manzini, however,
continued as usual with heavily armed police patrolling the
streets and guarding some important sites such as the National
Television and Radio Stations.
</P>
<P>
Most schools in the two cities reopened on Tuesday morning
after closing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Swazi radio, there has been a bomb
scare at the bus rank in Manzini, causing a disturbance at lunch
hour.
</P>
<P>
A petrol bomb carried in a plastic bag was lit at the bus
station, but the burning device did not explode, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soldiers patrolling the bus station fired into the
air when the incident occurred, making bus drivers flee the scene
in their empty vehicle and forcing panic-stricken commuters to
scatter and run for cover, said the report.

Amlaku Asres, an official from the agricultural bureau of the
region, was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying that
the increase in the number of investors and size of land
cultivated to oil seeds are the main factors for the bumper
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Oil seeds is one of the major export commodities of the
country. The nation earned 21.8 million U.S. dollars by exporting
27,000 tons of oil seeds in 1995/96. enditem

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Condemn Israeli Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
sharply reacted to an announcement by the Israeli government to
increase Jewish settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories,
reported the state-run Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian minister of local government and chief
negotiator with Israel, told reporters that the move is worrisome
and dangerous. Another senior Palestinian official, Ahmed Rahman,
said that it shows that the Israeli government is not serious
about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They were referring to an advertized announcement in the local
press today to sell some 120 houses to the public. The homes are a
first sum of 3,000 empty housing units which the government has
decided to sell to new settlers as part of the policy of expanding
the existing settlements in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000 apartments were built five years ago and have since
then remained empty because the Labor government imposed a freeze
on settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came two days before Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are
scheduled to meet Thursday at the Erez checkpoint on the border
between Israel and the Gaza Strip. The issue of settlement
expansion will apparently be taken up during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Alishe Peled, senior Housing Ministry adviser, told Israel
Television this evening that plans have been finalized to market
land in Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza for private
construction of some 5,000 additional housing units to meet the
need of the Jewish community expansion.
</P>
<P>
He defended the rightwing Likud government's settlement
policy, saying that its policy is not to build new settlements
and all the ministry is doing is to extend the communities.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Orders Election Results to Be Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic has ordered part of the election results annulled by the
government in November to be reinstated, the official Tanjug news
agency said today.
</P>
<P>
"In keeping with its constitutional competence, I propose that
the Serbian government submit to parliament a draft emergency law
which will proclaim as final results of a part of local elections
in Serbia in keeping with the findings of the OSCE (fact-finding)
mission," Milosevic said in a letter to Serbian Prime Minister
Mirko Marjanovic which was quoted by Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
sent a delegation to Belgrade in December to investigate the
election dispute and later confirmed that the opposition coalition
Zajedno had won November's local elections in 14 cities in Serbia.
Zajedno has been leading anti-government demonstrations over the
past 11 weeks in Belgrade to demand the full reinstatement of the
election results.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to stress that the interest of the state to promote
relations with the OSCE and the international community surpasses
by far the importance of any number of council seats in several
towns," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the election conflicts, regarding part of the
local elections, especially in Belgrade, have inflicted great
damage to our country both at the internal and international level
and that this is high time to resolve the problem in the highest
institutions of our republic, the government and the national
assembly," the letter added.

<HEADLINE> Angola Marks Armed Struggle Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 4 (xinhua) -- The Angolan government urged
the former rebel UNITA movement to be committed to the peace
process as the southern African country marked the National Armed
Struggle Day.
</P>
<P>
Thirty six years ago, Angolan nationalists fired the first
shot at the Portuguese colonialists in a bid to win national
independence. The country became independent in 1975.
</P>
<P>
At a mass rally to mark the Armed Struggle Day, Minister of
Public Works Pedro Loy urged the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to abide by the Lusaka Peace
Accord signed in 1994 as the country strives for a national unity
government which, originally scheduled for January 25, has been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
The former rivals have been divided in a couple of key issues
including power sharing and disarmament schedule which has led to
the postponement of the peace process.

<P>
Health officials were quoted by a report reaching here today
as saying that the disease came from northern Togo where more
than 120 people had been killed by the disease.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Money Crisis Shadows U.N. Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The minister-level
deliberations of the top world environmental body which are to
open here Wednesday will be shrouded in thick clouds of money
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) is facing the most
serious financial crisis since its establishment in 1972, said
UNEP Executive Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell at the ongoing 19th
session of the UNEP Governing Council starting on January 27.
</P>
<P>
A few industrial countries, led by the United States,
unwilling to perform their commitments to provide financial and
technical aid for global environmental protection, are seeking
cuts of both budget and their contributions to the world body.
</P>
<P>
The developing world sharply criticizes them, saying they are
trying to dodge their obligations in spite of the fact that it is
the developed nations who have deteriorated global environment.
</P>
<P>
According to figures available, from a budget of 160 million
U.S. Dollars in 1991-92 programs, UNEP's budget provision has
fallen to 90 million Dollars in 1996-97 of which only 62.5
million Dollars can be raised, leaving one-third money gap for
the already heavily slashed budget.
</P>
<P>
"Member states have reduced their overall contributions to
UNEP, while at the same time imposing ever-increasing
responsibilities on UNEP," Dowdeswell said at the biennial
two-week meeting at UNEP's Nairobi headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Major donors including the United States, Japan, Britain,
France and Italy are reluctant to pay and try to push forward
their so-called "reforms" in the body, UNEP sources said.
</P>
<P>
Garcir Duran, head of the Colombian delegation, on behalf of
the Group of 77 and China, called at the meeting for enough money
for UNEP so as to guarantee its normal run.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP, in full charge of all environmental affairs within
the U.N. systems, can work effectively only with enough money to
curb the continuous worsening deterioration of the global
environment, Duran stressed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegates argued that it is reform, not money issue, that
should be put at the top place of the meeting, charging the UNEP
is wasteful, inefficient and has done little since the 1992 Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
It was the reluctancy of rich countries on donations and their
delay to realize their commitments on global environment that has
resulted in the weak performance of the UNEP, the developing
world retorted.
</P>
<P>
The top priority for the UNEP is to solve the money crisis,
said many delegates from the third world.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that necessary reform should be carried
out within the global environment body. But the rich countries
should not regard this as a pretext to cut their donations, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other advanced states insist to
establish a 15-member inter-session body to rule the UNEP, saying
the smaller size leadership will provide more efficiency.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the third world proposes to set up a bigger
inter-session body which is authoratative, widely representative
and based on the current organizing systems.
</P>
<P>
The deliberate pursuance of "reform" by the few west
governments reveals their amibition to control the UNEP
leadership and the whole UNEP while dodging their financial
responsibilities, local observers say. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iran Fulfills Debt Obligation in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian banking authorities
announced here today that Iran fulfilled all its foreign
obligation for 1996 by paying 5.828 billion U.S. dollars of its
overdue debts.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohsen Nourbakhsh,
said Iran has since 1995 signed debt reschedule agreements with
creditors from Germany, Spain, Austria, Italy, Belgium, China and
Japan for opening medium term credit lines worth 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted him as saying that
of the credits, 2.4 billion dollars has been used to finance
50 projects in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh has said that Iran plans to repay 3.7 billion
dollars of foreign debt in 1997, 3.3 billion dollars in 1998 and
1.9 billion dollars in 1999 and 182 million dollars in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Specialists attributed the strong debt servicing capability to
higher oil export revenue earned in 1996. Iran earned 15.06
billion dollars from oil exports in the past 10 months, 2.7
billion dollars more than the figure envisaged in the current
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities said Iran is expected to earn a total
of 19 billion U.S. dollars from the oil exports during the current
fiscal year, 3 billion dollars more than the pre-set target.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh said that Iran's foreign exchange reserves rose from
921 million dollars in 1994 to 2.8 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the country's foreign exchange reserves in
the first nine months of the local calendar year (March
20-December 20) have increased by 2.503 billion dollars to reach
8.8 billion dollars.
