<HEADLINE> Schroeder Wants Strong EU-Commision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, 11 January (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder called Monday on the European Parliament to ponder key
tasks of financial reform and enlargement before casting ballots.
</P>
<P>
Bonn needed a strong Commission to bring about reform in E.U.
finances by a March summit in order to pave the way for taking in
new member states from Eastern Europe, stressed Schroeder at a
Bonn news conference with embattled European Commission President
Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament in Strasbourg was due to open debate
Monday on corruption, fraud and mismanagement charges involving
Santer's Commission, which serves as the 15-nation European
Union's (E.U.) executive branch.
</P>
<P>
Parliament was due to vote Thursday on a motion of
no-confidence over the allegations. A two-thirds majority is
necessary to force the Commission from office and Santer has said
that even if a simple majority in favor of the no-confidence the
Commission will stay on in office.
</P>
<P>
"I plead that we do not only look to the past but that we also
look to the future," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Germany currently holds the E.U.'s rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
"In order to succeed I need a stable Commission which is
capable of working," he said. "And I am sure the freely elected
parliamentary representatives see this relationship just as I do."
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder declined to make any suggestion to parliament on
how to vote over the corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, ex-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
rejected suggestions from Santer that he consider becoming the
next E.U. Commission president when Santer's term ends next year.
</P>
<P>
"Kohl is not available for this office," said a spokesman for
Kohl. Since losing Germany's election last September, Kohl, 68,
has stayed on in parliament as a regular member of the
conservative opposition.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder repeated earlier warnings that failure to agree on
E.U. finances by March could lead to a delay in taking in new
members from the former East Bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Then and only then enlargement would be delayed," said
Schroeder. The first new E.U. members are not expected to join
before 2003.
</P>
<P>
Germany has demanded a cut in its net annual contribution to
the E.U. of 22 billion marks (13 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
E.U. members must agree on who pays what for the Union for the
period 2000 to 2006 by the end of this year at the latest when
current financial arrangements expire.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few problems here we have to solve," said
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Reform of farm subsidies, which devour half the annual E.U.
budget of about 100 billion dollars, remains key to revamping the
Union's finances, he said. Bonn wants member states to start
paying more for their own farmers instead of sending the bill to
Brussels. This is opposed by France.
</P>
<P>
"Every member state must be prepared to compromise," said
Schroeder, who noted that this also included Germany.

<HEADLINE> GCC Insists Iraq Comply with U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states have insisted on Iraq's implementation of
all U.N. resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the GCC foreign ministers' meeting held in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, Sunday, Sabah said the GCC states have taken a joint stand
strongly rejecting threats by the Iraqi regime, particularly those
against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"The unwavering stand of the GCC showed emphatic rejection of
Iraqi policy of threats and any decision that may be taken to
violate (the United Nations) Security Council resolutions," Sabah
told the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sabah made the remark after Iraqi officials stepped up a
rhetoric campaign against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mahammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Sunday
night that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia "have directly participated in
the U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq" in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. cruise missiles passed through Kuwaiti airspace
during the bombardment, and dozens of U.S. and British warplanes
flew over Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi National Assembly said Sunday that it held
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia responsible for the material and human
losses in the December 16-19 U.S.-British air raids against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Banks Suffer Losses of 9.8 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean commercial banks
recorded combined net losses of 11.5 trillion won (9.8 billion
U.S. dollars) last year, the highest loss ever in the nation's
history, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commercial banks posting losses are Hanvit Bank, Korea
First Bank, Seoul Bank, Cho Hung Bank, Korea Exchange Bank, Peace
Bank and Housing &AMP; Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
Hanvit Bank, a merger of Commercial Bank of Korea and Hanil
Bank, sustained the biggest net loss of 3.35 trillion won (2.8
billion dollars) in 1998, followed by Korea First Bank, which
was sold off to Newbridge Capital of the United States, with a
loss of 2.6 trillion won (2.2 billion dollars), Seoul Bank
reported 2.2 trillion won (1.9 billion dollars) in losses, Cho
Hung Bank lost 1.97 trillion won (1.7 billion dollars), Korea
Exchange Bank lost 840 billion won (700 million dollars), Peace
Bank lost 430 billion won (360 million dollars), and Housing &AMP;
Commercial Bank lost 400 billion won (340 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Key reasons behind the record losses were reportedly bad
loans, the FSS said.
</P>
<P>
However, Hana Bank reported a net surplus of 110 billion won
(90 million dollars), followed by Kookmin Bank's profit of 74.5
billion won (60 million dollars), Shinhan Bank with a surplus of
58 billion won (50 million dollars) and KorAm Bank with 53
billion won (40 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Net losses of provincial-based banks totaled 2.4 trillion won
(2 billion dollars) in 1998. Combined deficits of Seoul-based and
regional banks amounted to 13.9 trillion won (11.7 billion
dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But, the deficits are less than expected due to the reduced
stock appraisal losses resulting from the recent strong rally in
the Seoul stock market, added the FSS.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Farm Output to Grow 2.5-3.5 Percent: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine agriculture
sector is expected to post a positive growth of 2.5-3.5 percent
this year, a senior government official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient rains and other favorable factors enabled the
farmers to plant large tracts of land with rice, corn, vegetables
and other crops, Agriculture Secretary William Darin said at a
meeting of provincial governors and government officials on food
security.
</P>
<P>
"We expect surplus rice production in the first quarter of
1999," Dar said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all concerned sectors and provincial governors to give
their hands on the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture sector suffered a slump last year,
the worst in the last 30 years, due mainly to the devastating
effects of the El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena.

WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. warplanes fired
missiles on Monday at an Iraqi air defense site in the northern
no-fly zone after they were targeted, the U.S. Defense Department
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. planes, two F-15Es strike aircraft and one F-16

The planes were on routine patrol in the "no-fly" zone over
northern Iraq when they were illuminated by radar from the Iraqi
surface-to-air missile installation, he said.
</P>

The planes returned safely to their base in Turkey, Bridges
said, adding that damage to the Iraqi site could not be

The F-15Es fired two AGM-130 air-to-surface missiles and the
F-16 fired one anti-radar missile, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Fire at Two Iraqi Air Defense Sites </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON January 11 (Xinhua) _ Two U.S. Air Force planes
fired missiles on Monday at two Iraqi air defense installations in
northern no-fly zone after determining they were about to be
attacked by surface-to-air missiles, the U.S. Defense Department
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. planes returned safely to their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the Iraqi site could not be immediately determined,
Defense Department spokesman Army Col. Richard Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. F-15E strike aircraft and one F-16 fighter were on
routine patrol in the ``no-fly'' zone over northern Iraq when they
were illuminated by radar from an Iraqi surface-to-air missile
installation, he said
</P>
<P>
In the first case, two F-15E strike aircraft were on routine
patrol in the northern no-fly zone when they were illuminated by
radar from an Iraqi surface-to-air missile installation, and the
U.S. warplanes fired two AGM-130 air-to-surface missiles in
response. The Iraqis did not fire on the planes, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
In the other incident, a F-16 fighter fired one-anti-radar
missile after being targeted by Iraqi radar at a separate air
defense installation near Mosul.
</P>
<P>
Bridges described the U.S. attacks as acts of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
"The illumination of an aircraft is certainly a hostile act,"
requiring the U.S. pilots to respond, Bridges said. A pilot whose
plane is illuminated, or ``painted'' by radar, assumes he is about
to be fired upon.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened near the city of Mosul at about 10:45
a.m. Iraqi time (0745 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Give State of Union Address as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will give his State of the Union address to Congress and the
nation in mid-January despite calls that he postpone it because
of his impeachment trial, a White House spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The president looks forward to delivering the State of the
Union address on January 19th," James Kennedy said, adding that
"we have no intention of being diverted from addressing the
issues that are important to the country."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice -- in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He
is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected to a
trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
With his impeachment trial set to resume on January 14,
Clinton faces the daunting challenge of addressing a joint
session of Congress on January 19 in the midst of Senate proceedi
ngs into whether he should be removed from office on the charges
stemming from his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans have called for a delay, although Senator
Susan Collins said the timing should be driven by circumstances.
If the Senate was "almost to the conclusion of the trial, the
president should wait. If it looks like it's going to be a longer
period than anticipated, then he should go ahead," she said.
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats also joined the Republicans Sunday in urging
Clinton to either delay the speech or submit it as a written
report instead.
</P>
<P>
However, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle defended
Clinton's decision, saying "the business of the country still
must go on, even if the trial is under way."
</P>
<P>
"It will be uncomfortable clearly, but I don't see any other
real option. Let's get on with the business. This is important,
but so is running the country," Daschle said on CBS's "Face the
Nation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Constitution requires a president to present Congress
annually with a status report on the nation. The report first was
submitted in writing but, since the days of President Woodrow
Wilson, it has been a formal address.

<P>
BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Europe's largest car concern,
Volkswagen, said Tuesday it delivered a record 4.58 million vehicles
in 1998, surpassing by 7.5 per cent the record set the previous year.
</P>
<P>
At VW headquarters in Wolfsburg, the company said its estimated
share of the world market last year came to 11.4 per cent, up from
10.4 per cent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a breakdown, the company said deliveries of private cars of the
VW brand came to 2.85 million last year, up 8.5 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Audi division deliveries increased 9.8 per cent to 600,000, while
the subsidiary Seat (Spain) showed a 7.2 per cent increase to
432,000, and the Skoda subsidiary (Czech Republic) improved its
deliveries by 8.1 per cent, to 363,000.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, VW commercial vehicle deliveries rose by 4.6 per
cent for a 1998 total of 238,000.
</P>
<P>
By region, VW group deliveries to Western Europe improved by 13.7
per cent to 2.83 million, while those to North America skyrocketed by
53 per cent to 418,900. Even deliveries to the Asia-Pacific region,
despite the economic turbulence, improved by 1.1 per cent to 375,900.
</P>
<P>
But deliveries to South America and South Africa combined plunged
by 22.9 per cent to 588,500 cars, VW said.

opened indiscriminate fires on the sleeping inmates of the house.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Says NGOs Are Indispensable Part Of Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The new non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) have meant a significant change in China's
social structure and the perfection of the socialist market
economy, according to Zhou Guangzhao, the vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhou told the annual meeting of the China Association for
Science and Technology (CAST), of which he is president, here
today that social groups will make up an important part of
China's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The registration rules for groups, which were revised by the
State Council, and the provisional regulations on registration
for NGOs mean a great deal for improving the management of NGOs
and safeguarding social stability, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Bringing more social groups into NGOs is the principle of
separating politics from social life, Zhou said, and means that
social groups no longer need be affiliated with a certain
government department and can be independent bodies instead.
</P>
<P>
Social groups can be voluntarily formed by people for
activities that help them realize their common goals, he said,
and this will be a guiding principle for societies affiliated
with CAST.
</P>
<P>
Zhou asked all CAST-affiliated societies to take over
functions given up by government offices.
</P>
<P>
CAST has 4.3 million members and is one of the largest NGOs in
China.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, 59, was elected as expected to a new
seven-year term, with 81 percent of the votes for him, a
presidential press service official told Xinhua Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The official results gave Communist Party leader Serikbolsyn
Abdildin 14 percent, customs committee head Gani Kasymov four
percent and parliamentary deputy Engels Gabbasov one percent.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election, the first since the former Soviet
republic became independent in December 1991, proceeded in a
peaceful atmosphere. A total of 200 international observers were
deployed to oversee the election.
</P>
<P>
More than 7.13 million voters, or 86.26 percent of the total
eight million electorate, turned out for the election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the April 1995 referendum, Nazarbayev was
scheduled to end his presidency in 2000. However, the Kazakh
parliament revised the constitution in October last year and
decided to hold the election ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev led Kazakhstan during the Soviet era and became the
republic's president after its independence in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Russia Produces New Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian air force will have
MiG corporation's latest product, a multipurpose attack jet
fighter, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev announced on
Tuesday, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a presentation show in the town of Zhukovsky outside Moscow
Sergeyev said the new plane excels all Russian planes and is not
inferior to the most advanced Western models, including the latest
American D-22A Raptor fighter.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the work on the newly-designed fighter
normally lasts for five to seven years. At least one billion
rubles (about 50 million U.S. dollars) will have to be invested in
flight tests. The first flights are to be carried out at the end
of February 1999.
</P>
<P>
MiG corporation's general director Mikhail Korzhuyev said that
the new fighter is difficult to be detected by radar and is
extremely maneuverable which creates new opportunities for
enhancing the efficiency of the latest weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the modernization of MiG-29 fighters (MiG-
29SMT and Mig-UBT variants) will constitute the bulk of the

<P>
OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has warned
Canada that it will strike back at four key industries if Ottawa
proceeds with plans to protect Canadian magazines from
cross-border competition, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Monday, a top U.S. official gave Canada's ambassador in
Washington, Raymond Chretien, oral notice of U.S. plans to
retaliate by blocking some Canadian steel products, textiles and
apparel, wood products and plastics from access to the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping all our options open at this point. That's all
that I can say," Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He added that Barshefsky has repeatedly expressed her concerns
about Canada's protectionist cultural policies, and that there
have been a series of meetings between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The costs of the proposed retaliatory measures are estimated
by Canadian officials at between 3 billion Canadian dollars (1.98
billion U.S. dollars and 4 billion Canadian dollars (2.64 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Canadian Foreign Affairs official confirmed Monday night
that the private talks had taken place Monday at the Canadian
Embassy, involving deputy U.S. trade representative Richard
Fisher and Canadian Ambassador Chretien.
</P>
<P>
The United States has made no secret of its unhappiness with
Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps' initiatives to protect
two key areas of Canadian culture: magazines and films.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Minister Copps introduced Bill C-55,
which would make it illegal for Canadian advertisers to place ads
in so-called split-run magazines -- Canadian editions of U.S.
publications which contain little editorial content originating
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Copps is preparing legislation to protect
Canadian films. She has met with representatives of the U.S. film
industry, and informed them that she is considering a levy of 3
to 5 percent on all movies and videos distributed in Canada.

<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese procuratorates handled
108,828 cases of bribery and dereliction of duty in 1998 and
investigated 40,162 persons.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, told a national procurators' conference here today
that last year's crackdown concentrated more on some spectacular
cases.
</P>
<P>
He said the procuratorates investigated 9,389 cases, each of
which involved bribes of more than 50,000 yuan (about 6,000 U.S.
dollars) and the embezzlement of public funds worth more than
100,000 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
They involved some 1,820 officials above the county level and
7,065 staff members in judicial and administrative offices, he
said. The case of former Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong demonstrated
the determination of the Party and the government in the
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>

NANCHANG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The victims of a mass
poisoning case in East China's Jiangxi Province have suffered
relapses in the past two days and medical personnel are making an
appeal for outside assistance in treating the illness.

people of Longnan and Dingnan counties had used some lard
produced by companies in the southern city of Shenzhen. Two
people died and 221 others had to be treated in local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that the lard contained as much as 29
times the permissible level of tin, causing damage to the nervous

A lack of proper medicine was the main reason for the
relapse, explained Lin Weihua, the head of the Longnan Hospital.

<HEADLINE> Information about Namibian Involvement in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian Defense
Ministry has lifted the media blackout on the country's
involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
"The Namibian" newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lift the embargo was taken after discussions
between Defense Minister Erikki Nghimtina and Editor of "The
Namibian" Gwen Lister Monday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government imposed the ban after claiming that
information sent to the media on Namibian casualties in Congo (K)
and other related incidents was distorted.
</P>
<P>
The ban was supported by Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob
who said last week that the blackout had been enforced for the
sake of the security of the Namibian forces in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, together with Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad, sent troops
to the vast central African country when rebels launched a war to
overthrow DRC President Laurent Kabila and his government five
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Nghimtina agreed to lift the ban at Monday's meeting after
expressing his concern about the publication of rumors which could
adversely affect the safety and security of the Namibian soldiers
in the DRC civil war, which began in last August.
</P>
<P>
However, Lister stressed the need for the Namibians to be kept
accurately informed about the situation in the DRC and for more
open channels of communication to be established between the media
and the Ministry of Defense in the public interest, to avoid rumor
and speculation.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 12 (Xinhua) - A week off
work gives the amateur players sweet memories in their ice hockey
life, although they return to Hong Kong, China, without any medal
from the National Winter Games on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The part-time China Hong Kong ice hockey team, led by a
chairman of a constructing company, lost 5-8 to Mudanjiang
Tuesday, its sixth and last loss in the Games, which opened
Sunday with the ice hockey tournament began on January 5.
</P>
<P>
But the losers were happy as the whole squad stayed on the ice
after Thuesday's defeat, cheering, chatting with journalists and
taking photos everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Love and passions of the sport generated much more pleasure
than they expected in the one-week staying in the northeast city
of China, as well as some concerns for the future of China's ice
hockey.
</P>
<P>
"Ice hockey in our country is shrinking after winning the
first two Asian Winter Games in 1982 and 1986. We should put
more efforts to promote the sport," said team leader Li
Guangjing, whose name has run several headliners in sports pages
on local newspapers since he came here on January 4.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that China will revive its conquering position in Asia
as it was in the 80s'."
</P>
<P>
There are only seven teams, besides Hong Kong, in the ice
hockey competition here, with one of them, Jilin, is set to
announce its disbandment after the Games.
</P>
<P>
No players from provinces outside Heilongjiang and Jilin
attended the competition, except the Hong Kong squad.
</P>
<P>
"Even in Hong Kong, people can play ice hockey, why not in
Guangdong or in Fujian provinces?" Li added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong players, who play ice hockey once a month, train
by themselves and afford their own fortune for the use of ice
rinks in a commercial stadium in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Team member Liu Jiazhu, 26, an auditor in Hong Kong, said, "I
just enjoy playing ice hockey. There's lots of fun."
</P>

Liu's teammates include driver, businessman, jewellery sailor
and company owner, with most of whom over 30s.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM Vows Not to Compromise on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Tuesday said there could be no compromise on his
government's drive to eliminate terrorism both from Karachi or in
any part of the country.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no compromise on the government's efforts to
stamp out terrorism, wherever it is, whether in Karachi or in any
other part of the country," Sharif told reporters at Chaklala
Airbase here before departure for Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He said his government began "a peace mission" in Karachi to
purge the city of terrorism. Theses steps were taken in the port
city in the supreme national interest, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that he would get cooperation from every
section of the society in his efforts to eliminate terrorism from
the country, adding that such cooperation will help further
strengthen the government's endeavors against the scourge of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"When there will be no terrorism, there will be investment and
the country would move ahead on its path to progress and
prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elimination of terrorism, he said, was not his dream alone but
the dream of very Pakistani as well.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about military courts, he said, these
courts "have performed well, and were doing their job, in aid of
the civil power."
</P>
<P>
Whenever there is a need, the government can seek help of the
armed Forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Pakistani government has, as part
of its fresh efforts to combat wanton terrorist activities in the
country, begun to provide elaborate security cover to persons
considered likely targets of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
A large number of diplomats, politicians, judges, religious
leaders
and government functionaries have been provided armed and trained
gunmen
for their security, reported the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This has been reinforced by static guard deployment, sources at
the
Interior Ministry said. While necessary, police escorts have been
provided to minimize chances of terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
As a preventive measure, a number of outer checkposts have also
been
established in case of emergency or incidents of robbery, dacoity
or car theft.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Largest Steel Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- With an output of 114 million
tons in 1998, China remains the world's largest steel producer,
said the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE)
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China's crude steel output this past year increased by 5.7
percent, compared with 107.9 million tons in 1997, influenced by
an estimated 7.8 percent growth in GDP, according to the
organization's latest estimates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world crude steel production fell 2.5 percent from
798.5 million tons in 1997 to 778.2 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although production remained high in the first half of 1998,
the UN/ECE said Russia's currency crisis, economic turmoil in
Latin America, and a retarding effect of the Asian financial
crises depressed output in the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, aggregate output registered a 1.5 percent
decrease as a result of the economic crises in this region.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation in Asia was worse. A drastic decrease
in output took place in Japan, South Korea and ASEAN member
countries. Japan's output of 93.55 million tons was the lowest
since 1972. With 39.2 million tons in 1998, South Korea
experienced a decline for the first time in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, output decreased for the first time
since 1991. This decrease however was reportedly slight dropping
by 1.0 percent from 98.5 million tons in 1997 to 97.5 million
tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the European Union, crude steel production in 1998
registered an increase of 1.1 percent, which was sustained by
favorable steel demand from the steel-consuming sectors.
</P>
<P>
Russia's currency crisis resulted in a sharp drop of 10.1
percent in crude steel production, slipping from 48.5 million
tons in 1997 to 43.6 million tons in 1998.

development road and models that are different from Western
countries' for its sustainable development.
</P>
<P>

Zhou, also president of the association, said that the serious
flooding last summer revealed the problems in China's economic
development like the destruction of forests. Scientists need to
advise the government and spread knowledge among leading
officials to promote the coordinated development of the economy,
society and the environment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Sales Firms Get License for Salesmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of sales
representatives working for well-known foreign direct sales
companies in China, who have shifted their business from direct
sales to retailing, have been granted licenses following a period
of training.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct sales giants like Amway (China), Guangzhou Avon
Co. Ltd. and the Mary Kay Cosmetics (China) Company have received
their licenses from organizations authorized by the State
Administration of Internal Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
China's State Council issued a ban on direct sales in April
last year. Companies engaged in direct sales had to wind up their
business or apply to change their license to that of a regular
retailer by October 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, a total of 64 foreign direct sales
businesses changed their working patterns: one method involves
retailing goods without hiring salesmen while others use sales
assisted retailing. The latter is required to apply for a sales
person license.
</P>
<P>
SAIT ruled in an earlier notice that a licensed sales agent of
a foreign direct sales company must be at least 18 years old,
have signed a service contract of at least one year, and should
have received training or relevant experience of at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
The notice also requires that a licensed sales agent must not
engage in direct sales. When their service contract expires, the
license will be revoked.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's New Defense Forces Chief Pledges Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's new Defense
Forces Chief Gen. Mohd Zahidi Zainuddin Tuesday pledged to nurture
a culture of openness and transparency in the military.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama, Zahidi said he would also concentrate on consolidating
the Malaysian defense forces as an institution of high integrity.
</P>
<P>
Zahidi, who succeeded Gen. Ismail Omar at the end of last
month, said: "My vision is to make the defense forces an open
organization with integrity which the nation can rely upon to
defend the country," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zahidi said he would take criticisms and be open to views from
all quarters, including the lower ranks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of human resource development in the
military, saying it was this aspect that eventually mattered as
the officers and men were the ones who would determine the success
or cause the failure of any effort by the military.
</P>
<P>
"As such I believe that human resources are the defense forces'
most vital asset. I consistently believe that without soldiers,
there will be no generals or commanders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zahidi said the Malaysian defense forces would move towards
maximizing the strength and expertise of each individual member.
</P>
<P>
Zahidi said he was sensitive to understanding in depth the
requirements of the air force and navy in order to attain
tri-service cohesion in taking on the military challenges of the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Zahidi, who was promoted from Army Chief, said given that each
service of the defense forces had its own peculiar military
culture, there were organizational loopholes that would have to be
plugged in order to attain desired cohesion.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to give priority to equipping officers and men
of the forces with knowledge in information technology as part of
efforts to enhance the forces' level of preparedness.
</P>
<P>
Zahidi said any procurement of new weaponry for the military
would be in the context of the modernization of the defense forces
and in national strategic interests and not to join the arms race.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia's defense ties especially with countries
in the region would continue since it had been proven that they
had brought about much benefits in the ASEAN context in
particular.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia harbors no intention of having confrontation
with any country. "Whatever that we do is always in the context of
peace and of preserving our sovereignty and national assets," he
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Promote Implementation of Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat Tuesday called on the U.S. to help boost the Wye River
peace agreement between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat's words came at a time when U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross is in the region on a mediation tour.
</P>
<P>
Ross should fulfill only one aim on his current trip, namely to
reach a mechanism to enforce the clauses of the accord, Erekat
said in an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in Israel Monday for talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on ways of advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreeement Arafat and Netanyahu signed last
October in Washington, Israel should withdraw its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
But the accord was suspended by Israel only after the first
phase was carried out in early December as Israel accused the
Palestinian leadership of igniting violence against it.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to shelve the accord unless the
Palestinians meet conditions including collecting illegal weapons,
reducing police forces, which the Palestinians denounced as
requirements not stipulated in the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the accord should be completed by the end
of this month, but the Israeli government froze the process under
the pretext of holding early general elections on May 17, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing, at this point, to negotiate, because all the
talks were done at the Wye Plantation in the U.S. last October,
Erekat stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The sole Palestinian demand at this time is specific and
clear-cut, namely the need to implement the Wye River Memorandum,"
the Palestinian official said.

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China voiced the hope today
that the upcoming four-party talks this weekend in Geneva will
realize new achievements on the basis of what has already been
accomplished in both implementing the nuclear framework agreement
and promoting permanent peace in the Korean Peninsula.

<P>
China's foreign ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said here today
at a regular news briefing that the parties will take part in
substantial discussions this weekend on easing tension and
establishing a permanent peace mechanism for the region, as well
as on other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that China will continue to play a positive and
constructive role in dealing with these issues.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear framework agreement between the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea and the United States has been
earnestly implemented since it was signed, said Sun, who also
reiterated that China has always advocated the maintenance of
peace and stability in the peninsula, and has been doing
important work in this regard in its own way.

CANBERRA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Ben Ainslie took
another step toward the Laser world title on Tuesday as he has a
14-point lead over Robert Scheidt of Brazil with two races left.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie won the first race of the day while Scheidt failed to
take a top three placing in either race nine or 10. The Briton
has won four races in the past three days while Scheidt has taken
just one.
</P>
<P>
He has looked every inch a winner here, sailing tactically
clever races and keeping a cool head throughout.
</P>
<P>
However, in this 12-heat series there is only one discardable
result. Ainslie already has that in his score and cannot afford a
slip-up against the very determined Brazilian.
</P>
<P>
The last day of this championship will be as much a battle of
minds as of sailing skills although Scheidt has to watch his
back, with third-placed Karl Suneson of Sweden only three points
behind.

JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) is to distribute food aid to early-childhood development
centers in Lesotho, Southern African Broadcasting Association
(SABA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
SABA quoted WFP officer for emergency operations, John Gerthy,
as saying that the exercise will start on January 20 to get food
to 186 centers in Maseru, capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Gerthy said the package comprises 50 tons of beans, cooking oil
and maize meal which would be enough food for the centers for
three months.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization is helping the childhood development
centers because most of them were destroyed during the unrest last
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 children between the age of two and five years
will benefit from the donation, said Gerthy.
</P>
<P>
SABA did not say when Gerthy made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
The WFP assistance is believed to be the first of its kind to
people affected by the destruction of businesses in the mountain
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned over Transfer of TMD to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China considers the
incorporation of Taiwan into the Theater Missile Defense system
(TMD) a violation of the basic principles of international law
and three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, said foreign ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remark at his regular press briefing, labeling
the move a barrier to the improvement and growth of Sino-U.S.
relations and one that will jeopardize the security and stability
of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. government will proceed from the overall
development of Sino-U.S. ties and observe the principles outlined
in the three communiques, and its commitments on the issue of
Taiwan," he said, adding that the U.S. should not transfer the
TMD and relevant technology or other advanced weapons to Taiwan,
in order to avoid damaging Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, China also takes note of Japanese
government's decision to launch military surveillance satellites
by year 2002 and join the development of the TMD system.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is concerned over the possible military and
political impact of the moves taken by these two countries on
regional and global security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that peace and development are the mainstream of
our time after the end of the Cold War, and under these
circumstances the deployment and spread of strategic-weapons
systems may trigger a new round of the arms race, thus affecting
world balance and stability," Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Japan will observe its constrained defense policy and
adhere to the course of peaceful development," Sun said.

regions are competing in 13 team and individual events at the
Wellington Regional Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and the United States, the three leading powers

<P>
He said this during a meeting with Frank G. Zarb, chairman and
chief executive officer of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD) of the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China's securities market is still in its
initial stage and there is much room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
He added that last year China was adversely affected by the
financial crisis in Asia and suffered from severe flooding.
However, China's national economy still enjoyed rapid development
as the Chinese government adhered to its reform policy and
adopted effective measures to tackle the problems.
</P>
<P>
Zarb gave a briefing on computer-based stock transactions
conducted by the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., which is affiliated
with the NASD. Nasdaq is the world's first completely electronic
stock market, existing without a trading hall. It has absorbed
many hi-tech companies onto its listed issues, and its
transaction volume is second in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zarb said that the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have
advanced rapidly in recent years, and China has adopted the
correct policy by opening its capital market gradually and
discreetly.
</P>
<P>
He added that Nasdaq would like to cooperate with its Chinese
counterparts in advancing the technology of electronic stock
transactions and the supervision of capital markets.

<HEADLINE> 19 Killed in Southwest China Traffic Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A mini-bus with 20 people
aboard rolled down a 70-meter-high slope in southwest China's
Guizhou Province at about 4:30 pm on January 6, leaving 19 dead
and one seriously injured, local authorities announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The bus, which belonged to the No.3 Bus Company of Guizhou
Province, was on its way back to Guiyang, capital of Guizhou,
from Qianxi County in the western part of the province when it
apparently went out of control around a sharp curve and plunged
to the bottom of the hill.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people were killed instantly, and the two seriously
injured passengers were pulled from the wreckage and rushed to a
nearby hospital, but one died on the way.
</P>
<P>
Hospital authorities said the one survivor arrived in coma but
has since regained consciousness and is now completely out of
danger, adding that he will be sent back to Guiyang tomorrow
morning for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
Traffic police in Qianxi and bus company managers said the
cause of the accident was still under investigation, but they
suspect that the poor road conditions may be to blame.
</P>
<P>
"This part of the road had been the site of many previous
accidents," one traffic policeman noted.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou is one of China's most renowned mountainous provinces,
and as a local saying puts it, "One can hardly find three square
feet of level ground here."

<P>
MAPUTO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Education
Arnaldo Nhavoto has hailed the development of education in his
country saying the number of schools and enrollment has been the
highest since the country gained its independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Most of the education networks which were destroyed during the
civil war have been recovered, Tuesday's Noticias newspaper quoted
him as saying.
</P>

The government has attached great attention to education after
1992 when peace was attained, said the minister, adding that

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, Jilin Province, January 12 (Xinhua) -- When Olympic
silver medallist Xu Nannan led Changchun to win the women's
freestyle skiing, the first gold medal in China's Ninth Winter
Games, her name appeared on the official web site just three
seconds after the results were confirmed by chief referees.
</P>
<P>
The official national winter games' site --
http://sport.jl.cninfo.net, receives about 1,600-1,700 hits daily
since it opened on the New Year Day.
</P>
<P>
Though it was not the first time for engineer Han Jian,
director of the hub, to install a network for sports tournament,
it's the only one he can boast of.
</P>
<P>
"We grant instantness for every one who'd like to know the
national winter games on web," said Han, also chief of the
computer technology electronic information center of the State
Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Quickness was always in my mind when I built the network.
However, I didn't realize it in the Eighth National Games in
Shanghai in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 was the first sports games
to be exploited by the Internet, but it was until the Nagano
Winter Olympics last February that people started to enjoy
watching the Games on website worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Competition results can be transferred to the host computer
in the center instantly after the games, and to the web
simultaneously. It takes just three seconds in the process," Han
said.
</P>
<P>
"A data-transferring cable connects the results screen in the
stadium and the mainframe in the center, and everything is done
by the computer during a span of a blink.
</P>
<P>
"In the Shanghai National Games, a group of 20 typists were
hired to put the results into the Internet, which wasted half an
hour before it got hits."
</P>
<P>
A team of 20 computer experts worked for four months to
install the information network for the winter games, which cost
just one million RMB (120,000 U.S. dollars), comparing to 82.8
million RMB (10 million U.S. dollars) expense and a team of 200
Spanish experts at the Bangkok Asian Games last December.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Navy's fast
attack craft engaged a fleet of Tamil rebel boats in Northern
Province Monday, destroying four of them and killing 12 rebels,
reports reaching here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
The attack began Monday night when Navy boats first detected
two rebel boats coming towards the Naval vessels, a Navy spokesman
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
One rebel boat caught fire while the other fled. Then the Navy
detected four more rebel boats coming towards them, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Three of them were destroyed and the other limped back to the
sea.
</P>
<P>
The fighting continued till early Tuesday morning. The Tamil
rebels may have been transporting some of their area leaders to a
point off Kuchchaveli region, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan gun boats last week destroyed a flotilla of rebel
boats, killing at least 25 rebels.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Navy has strengthened patrol around
Kuchchaveli, as the Tamil rebels, who are fighting for a separate
state in the north and east of the country, have sent
reinforcements to the area in the last two weeks.

LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth

<P>
Speaking in Nigerian capital Abuja Monday, Anyaokuo said after

<HEADLINE> mee011210hke - Jordanian House Approves 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian House of Deputies
(lower house of parliament) has approved the 1999 fiscal budget
with a projected seven percent deficit, Radio Jordan reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 67 deputies who attended the session Monday, 55 voted in
favor of the draft budget law, which is to be referred to the
Senate for further debate and endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The budget of 2.16 billion Jordanian dinars (3.24 billion
U.S. dollars), presented to the House by Finance Minister Mishail
Marto last December, put the current expenditure at 1.68 billion
dinars (2.37 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The capital expenditure in the budget is 477 million dinars
(667.8 millions dollars), which analysts believe too low for a
robust economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The seven percent budget deficit is in line with the target
imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for renewing its
financial aid to the reform program of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the IMF are expected to sign an agreement later this
month on a new three-year reform program following the kingdom's
failure to achieve sustainable economic growth in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
The government holds out the hope that the 1999 budget will
help spur the sluggish growth, which was caused by instabilities
over Iraq, Israel, plunging oil prices in the Gulf and a decline
in overseas remittances.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government fears measures to control
deficits will further push the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the budget have also echoed the concerns. They
believe the government is unable to solve its twin dilemma of
rising unemployment and poverty while keeping a lid on public
expenditure, and keeping the deficit below seven percent.
</P>
<P>
With the seven percent deficit ceiling, the government can
hardly achieve a growth rate higher than three percent in 1999,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the belief that Jordan needs at least a six
percent economic growth to cope with the population growth of the
country, which stood at three percent in 1998.

SINGAPORE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices extended losses

million Singapore dollars (387.60 million U.S. dollars). Gainers
outstripped losers by 263 to 59 with 97 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Coffee Exports to Drop in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to export
35,000 tons of coffee in 1999, a sharp drop of 65.7 percent from
58,000 tons in 1998, Thai News Agency (TNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TNA quoted a source from the industry as saying that the sharp
drop is attributed to unexpectedly lower coffee supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Minister projected that the country's coffee
output for the 1998/1999 crop season (October-September) would
reach 59,883 tons compared with 78,548 tons in the previous crop
year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's coffee exports are mostly of the Robusta variety. It
is normally traded at 100-150 U.S. dollars per ton discount to
London prices.
</P>
<P>
The country's coffee was severely hurt by the El Nino weather
phenomenon in late 1997, which has devastated many trees and was
one of the key reasons for the expected fall in output and export,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the coffee production is likely to be reduced
significantly by the government's plan to encourage growers to
switch to more lucrative crops such as oil palm and corn.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's embattled Minister of
State for Finance and Economic Development Sam Kuteesa has
categorically denied accusations that he bribed some MPs to
withdraw their signatures from the censure petition against him.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement in a statement Monday,
according to the Monitor newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said he had never given any money to any MPs or any form of
inducement for the purpose of requesting them to withdraw his or
her signature against him.
</P>
<P>
However, the Monitor newspaper reported on January 8 that MPs
backing the censure had alleged that some of their colleagues
trying to withdraw their signatures from the petition had been
bought by the minister who was reportedly involved in
improprieties in the country's privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion that seeks to unseat Kuteesa from his
ministerial job, charging him with influence peddling and cheating
Uganda Airlines, will be up for debate when the Parliament returns
for debate.
</P>
<P>
Some previous reports here said President Yoweri Museveni was
protecting the embattled minister because Kuteesa's wife is sister
to First Lady Janet Museveni.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks Peaceful Solution to Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran has said that it will use
all diplomatic means to find a peaceful solution to the Iraqi
crisis as Baghdad entered a new confrontation with its neighboring
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told the English
daily Iran News published on Tuesday that Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister for African and Arab Affairs Mohammad Sadr is in Iraq for
talks with Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the Iraqi issue and do not want the
issue to surface again," Asefi said, adding that Sadr will also
visit other regional states to help broker peace and to use all
diplomatic means to bring the Iraqi crisis to an end.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes on Iraq for four
consecutive nights on December 16-19 with a declared aim of
punishing it for not cooperating with the U.N. weapons inspectors,
who are authorized to monitor Iraq's elimination of all weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The weapons inspections began in 1991 after the Gulf War, set
off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iraq held Kuwait and Saudi Arabia accountable for
the property and human losses during the air strikes because they
allowed the U.S. and Britain to use their space and bases for the
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also denied admitting the current Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders
determined by U.N. resolution 833 in May 1993. It also rejected a
Saudi proposal on easing the U.N. sanctions, which was imposed on
Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait, saying its a trick of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have reportedly been on alert after
Iraq's war-like rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraq's territorial claim on Kuwait, the Iranian
spokesman said that such a move is not a proper way to solve
differences and the region should be governed through negotiations
and tension-free talks.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Tehran's opposition to any possible conflict between
Iraq and Kuwait, saying that "we are of the opinion that the two
sides should not engage themselves in such a conflict because this
could be the worst problem in the region."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Commission to Decide on PAL Rehabilitation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) of the Philippines may hand out by early February
its verdict on a rehabilitation program intended to put Philippine
Airlines (PAL) back on its feet, Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, the secretary said the SEC's decision
should pave the way for PAL to get the cash flow it needs to pay
off its debts, which now amount to 2.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Once the SEC approves the program, it will lead to the
sequence of cash flow for PAL through capital infusion and
additional loans, as well as loan restructuring," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
The SEC still has a big say on who will form PAL's board of
directors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said PAL Chairman Lucio Tan will continue to be
on top of the PAL board as majority stockholder and can still
influence board decisions, although he cannot interfere in the
airline's management anymore.
</P>
<P>
"Tan will just set the policies and the management will follow
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
PAL will be under a new management team starting Wednesday,
when four former executives of the Kong Kong-Based Cathay Pacific
Airways take over.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the airline needs cash infusion amounting to some
6 billion pesos (150 million dollars) to support its daily
operations and pay long-outstanding accounts.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada said last week that he wanted to keep
PAL flying at all costs because of its impact on all sectors of
the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Granaries Damages China's Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of grain silos has
meant that almost a seventh of China's grain output last year has
had to be stored in the open, leaving it open to attack by rats,
to be damaged by fires and soaked by rains.
</P>
<P>
The country grew 490 billion kg of grain last year but many of
its silos are old and good harvests over the past four years have
increased pressure on storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
Now the central government has pledged to invest 18 billion
yuan to build new granaries that can store an additional 27.5
billion kg by the summer of the year, and will also upgrade a
number of older silos.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Zhiqiang, a 52-year-old farmer in Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, one of China's largest grain
producing areas, the crop is being ruined by rats and the weather.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will also help reform the grain distribution
system, improve the country's macro-control on agriculture, and
purchase more grain from the farmers, said Wang Fengqi,
vice-chairman of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
He added that the central government will build an additional
16 granaries in the region alone.

<HEADLINE> Report: Michael Jordan to Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Bulls superstar
Michael Jordan, considered the greatest basketball player of all
time, will announce his retirement this week, according to
today's media reports across the United States.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, the Associated Press, USA Today and The
Denver Post have all reported that the 35-year-old legend would
announce his decision to call it quits at a news conference on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speculations as to Jordan's future have been rife since NBA
players and bosses reached a last-minute settlement last
Wednesday to end the six-month lockout. Jordan, refusing to make
any public decision regarding his future during the lockout, had
been in the Bahamas on vacation, but returned this week to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
During his 12-plus seasons in the NBA, Jordan rewrote the
regular and postseason record books, becoming the most
recognisable and highest-paid athlete in the world in the process.
</P>
<P>
He led the league in scoring a record 10 times, was selected
Most Valuable Player of the NBA Finals six times and All-Star
Game MVP three times in 11 appearances.
</P>
<P>
The gravity-defying guard is third all-time in career scoring
with 29,277 points, behind only dominating centers Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain, and holds the record for
points per game, averaging 31.5 a game throughout his amazing
career.
</P>
<P>
He left basketball following the 1992-93 championship season
to try his hand at professional baseball before making a comeback
to the Bulls late in the 1994-95 campaign.
</P>
<P>
Jordan turned in even better performances to carry the Bulls
back to more NBA titles and last season he gave one of the most
remarkable show in his glorious career by sinking the winning
shot of the NBA Finals to give Bulls a third consecutive
championship and sixth title in eight years.

<P>
HUHHOT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly six million people of
Mongolian ethnic group across China are now able to watch
Mongolian-dubbed TV news programs the same day as they are
broadcast in standard Chinese.
</P>
<P>
 The Mongolian-dubbed TV news is actually broadcast to 53
countries and regions in Asia-Pacific region through satellite.
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time that Mongolian audiences have been
able to watch "today's news" both in Chinese and their own
language since 1969, when north China's Inner Mongolian
Autonomous Region set up a local TV station.
</P>
<P>
 The dubbed TV news programs last 30 minutes and are
broadcast at 7:00 p.m. in the evening by China Central Television
(CCTV). Each program is quickly translated into Mongolian and
broadcast at 10:30 p.m. by the Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region's own TV station.
</P>
<P>
 Before now, due to shortage of funds, equipment and
translators, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region was not able
to broadcast Mongolian-dubbed news the same day it was broadcast
by CCTV, China's only national TV station.
</P>
<P>
 The TV Station of Inner Mongolia's Autonomous Region
started to broadcast programs in Mongolian on October 2, 1976.
Many audiences from Mongolia, Russia, and Hungary take a keen
interest in them.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Urged to Tackle Financial, Economic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists were urged
today by Vice Premier Wen Jiabao to use their expertise to help
tackle the country's financial and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
At an annual working conference of the China Association for
Science and Technology (CAST), which opened here today, Wen
presented the scientists with a full analysis of the
international financial crisis and the pressing economic issues
facing China.
</P>
<P>
"You are expected to study the relationship between finance
and the economy and science and technology, and give the
government your advice for tackling important problems related to
the development of the national economy and science and
technology," Wen told the scientists.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic development increasingly depends on
scientific and technological advances, and that some countries
suffered greatly under the impact of Asian financial crisis
because their economic growth lacks scientific and technological
support.
</P>
<P>
An economy without the support of science and technology, and
science and technology divorced from serving economic development
both lack vitality, the vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
With a membership of 4.3 million, CAST is the largest
scientific organization in the world, and Chinese scientists
gather annually to discuss major scientific tasks.
</P>
<P>
Wen called on Chinese scientists to help promote development
of the agricultural economy and the reform of state-owned
enterprises, and to offer more scientific and technological
services.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves Second Tranche of Loan to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Tuesday approved the release of 500 million U.S. dollars of the
Financial Governance Reform Loan for Indonesia, the second tranche
of a 1.4-billion-dollar policy loan approved by the bank in June
1998.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the Manila-based bank said
the Indonesian government has completed a large number of policy
reforms in areas of financial sector restructuring, improved
governance practices in public and private sectors and increased
disclosure and transparency of financial information.
</P>
<P>
"These will contribute to continued progress in achieving
macro-economic stability under the most difficult circumstances,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The 1.4-billion-dollar policy loan, which supports the
country's financial governance reform program aimed at addressing
the weakness in the financial and public sector, was set to be
disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche of 500 million
dollars was released shortly after the approval of the loan last
June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has also approved a 2.47-million-dollar
technical assistance grant to help Indonesia undertake
comprehensive reforms of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Withdrawal Plan Meets With Lebanon's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has expressed
reservation about a four-point plan concerning the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon offered by Japanese Foreign Minister
Masashiko Komura.
</P>
<P>
Komura offered the plan to leaders of six Arab countries during
his tour to the region from January 5 to 13.
</P>
<P>
The four points are the withdrawal of Israeli forces should be
implemented as stipulated by U.N. Security Council Resolution 425,
the withdrawal should lead to a comprehensive Middle East peace,
the parties should discuss concrete steps for a withdrawal without
pre-conditions and the international community should render
support to stabilize south Lebanon after the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said in an interview with
the Daily Star Monday night that his government agreed with the
first point but disagreed with the third step, which calls for
discussing the details of a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared for any talks or negotiations nor security
arrangements with Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed the proposal would lead to a withdrawal,
Hoss said "In the face of Israel's intransigence, I do not expect
much."
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The resolution 425, which was approved by the U.N. in 1978
following Israeli's first invasion of Lebanon, calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Israeli cabinet endorsed the 20-year-old resolution
but linked the implementation of it with a negotiated security
arrangement with Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria flatly rejected the offer, asking
the Jewish state to withdraw troops without any pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
A western diplomat in Beirut said that it is difficult for
Tokyo to market the plan despite polite noises from Lebanon, Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It comes closer to Israeli thinking," the diplomat said.

<HEADLINE> 27 Swans Die from Poisoning and Illegal Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of white swans which
flew to Sanmenxia on the Yellow River in central China's Henan
Province earlier this month have seen 27 of their companions die
either from poisoning or illegal hunting.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen others have had narrow escapes from death after being
treated by local veterinarians, according to the China
Environmental News.
</P>
<P>
The police in Shaanxian County of the city of Sanmenxia
stopped a 40-year-old local farmer, Zhao Shishi, as he was
cycling down a road near the spot where the swans were found
dead, and discovered a bag on Zhao's motorcycle filled with
poisoned water birds belonging to another species under county
protection.
</P>
<P>
The police searched the suspect's home, where they found nine
other dead water birds and more than 10 kilograms of poison. Zhao
pleaded guilty in the face of this solid evidence.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A construction worker recently
stumbled upon a skeleton in downtown Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, and the bones have been dated
as 4,000 years old, the Wenhui Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The worker, Li Shujun, came across a leg bone six meters under
ground at a construction site, which aroused the interest of
local archeologists, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
After two days of careful excavation, scientists unearthed a
complete skeleton with all the bones and teeth intact, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the mature skeleton lay another, smaller one, which
was badly decomposed and the experts were unable to determine its
sex or age.
</P>
<P>
After a complete examination of the intact skeleton, archeolog
ists determined it was that of a man who lived in the early part
of the Xia Dynasty (21 century - 16 century B.C.) and was 1.72
meters tall.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Flow in Zambia Disappointing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has performed badly in
attracting foreign direct investment due to poor infrastructure,
the Zambia Investment Center (ZIC) has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Tuesday quoted the ZIC acting director-general
Margaret Mwanakatwe as saying the country lacked well-established
infrastructure to attract foreign direct investment compared with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Mwanakatwe was speaking at the high level round-table meeting
on the business environment for foreign direct investment to
Zambia held here in Lusaka on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The state of any host country's infrastructure was a major
consideration when a decision on direct foreign investment was to
be made, she said, adding the road network in Zambia needed a lot
of attention while the airports and harbors needed urgent
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The rail links were also in a dire need of rehabilitation and
expansion, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mwanakatwe also noted need for private sector investment in
rehabilitating such infrastructure, saying the government alone
would not be in a position to accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
She said the government had a major responsibility to ensure
that the environment was conducive to private sector
participation. It also needed to consider how infrastructural
investment into rural areas would be enhanced, which had prompted
the ZIC to focus many sectors in a bid to attract potential
investors.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the meeting, Danny Pule, deputy minister of
Finance and Economic Development, said the government is deeply
committed to ensuring that Zambian infrastructure is provided with
needed investment to be able to support investment.
</P>
<P>
Pule said having established a firm basis for private sector
confidence in the Zambian economy, the government intends to build
partnership with the private sector at new and more challenging
level.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (FIAS), a joint service of the International Finance
Corporation and the World Bank, in collaboration with the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

<HEADLINE> Rabe's Former residence in Nanjing to be Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The city government of
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, has decided to
preserve forever the former residence of John D.Rabe, author of
"Rabe's Diary."
</P>
<P>
Today's Wenhui Daily reported that the residence will be
preserved as historical evidence of Japanese militarists'
invasion and massacre.
</P>
<P>
Rabe was a representative of the Siemens Company in Nanjing
when war broke out there, and he witnessed the atrocities
committed by the invading Japanese troops in 1937 and recorded
what he saw on a daily basis from September to the following
February.
</P>
<P>
During that period, Japanese troops slaughtered more than
300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers in a nightmare remembered
as the "Nanjing Massacre."
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Rabe's former residence is located at No.1
Xiaofenqiao in downtown Nanjing. Rabe risked his own life in
helping to save the lives of more than 200,000 victims in the
so-called 'security zone.'
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, a number of historians and
other scholars learned that Rabe's former residence might be torn
down for road expansion, and they urged the city government to
change its plan, and the local government accepted this proposal.
</P>
<P>
In a related development,, preparations began on Monday for a
Chinese film version of Rabe's Diary; the script is expected to
be completed by May and filming is scheduled to begin in
September.

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.2 million overseas

<HEADLINE> Consumer Complaints on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Both the quantity and quality
of consumer complaints are increasing in China according the
China Business News, which says this indicates that people are
becoming more aware of their consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the China Consumer Association (CCA) handled about
800,000 complaints, as compared with only several thousand dealt
with each year in its early days.
</P>
<P>
While most consumers expect to return faulty goods and have
them replaced or repaired, many now are also demanding apologies
and even compensation.
</P>
<P>
Another interesting change is the drop in the value of the
goods. Last year, more than 50 percent of complaints involved
less expensive consumer goods, the newspaper published by the
State Administration of Internal Trade says.
</P>
<P>
There is also a new trend which sees people complaining about
poor service in the tourism and telecommunications sectors.

<HEADLINE> 150-year-old Kingdom of Heaven's Frescoes Need Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randomly parked cars and a market now occupy the vacant lot in
front of the former official residence of the leaders of the
so-called Kingdom of Heaven who led the Taiping Revolution in the
19th century in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu
Province, the Beijing Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the ruined site, the wood-and-brick house, now dilapidated,
is unable to withstand fierce winds and heavy rains, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to painting experts and archeologists, the 18
frescoes were influential during the Taiping Revolution, the
largest peasant uprisings in China's history.
</P>
<P>
State cultural relics protection authorities rehabilitated the
frescoes and renovated the house in 1991, but they are still in
danger of disappearing, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Because of a lack of sufficient funds, experts suggest that
domestic or overseas individuals finance the work of protecting
this historical site, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Sculpture Exhibits in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing visitors today have
chance to see a group of 100 Italian-made wooden warriors, which
have different approaches but similar artistic results with the
terra-cotta found in the Qinshihuang tomb in China 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mario Ceroli made his sculpture titled China in 1966 with log.
The wooden army forces resemble to clay warriors molded during
the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) in clothes and hair style and
formation.
</P>
<P>
Probably Western artists and the Chinese share something
similar in artistic creation and evaluation, an assistant with
the Capital Museum said.
</P>
<P>
However, the 61-year-old sculptor's work also show
characteristics owned by Western people, such as curly hair of
the warriors.
</P>
<P>
In 1960s and 70s, artistic works with the Chinese theme
thrived in Western countries. Among those artists, Ceroli led a
unique style of "arte povera", or art of the poor.
</P>
<P>
He obtained many awards and carried out exhibition tours
throughout the world. Coinciding with Rome Mayor Francesco
Rutelli's visit to Beijing, the exhibition will last five days.

<HEADLINE> Private Business Props Up Coastal Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The private sector accounts
for over 50 percent of the retail sales in China's affluent
coastal areas, according to China Business Times.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is based on a survey carried out in 18 coastal
cities including Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao,
Lianyungang, Nantong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou,
Fuzhou,Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Beihai and the four special
economic zones of Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shantou and Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
The results emphasize the important role of the private sector
in ending the country's long-standing commodity shortage and in
promoting the reform of the distribution sector and commercial
enterprises, the newspaper quotes market analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the growth of private commerce,
which was very fast a few years ago, has slowed down due to the
country's economic restructuring. While the growth in most of
the coastal cities went as high as 80 percent in 1995, the rate
dropped to somewhat 20 percent in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the private sector has still exhibited more
remarkable vigor and self-adjustment in the face of growing
fierce competition in the commercial sector. While many
state-owned department stores and other commercial enterprises
have been plagued by low efficiency, with some being forced to
close down, private businesses have proved to be more efficient
and flexible, the analysts say.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Leaves Angola for Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sevan Benom, the United Nations
special envoy and deputy secretary-general in charge of defense
and security affairs, left here Monday night for New York.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference before his departure, Benom said he
will report to U.N. chief Kofi Annan on the current situation in
Angola and on the investigation of the downed U.N. planes.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the U.N. investigation team has located
the remains of the first plane in central Angola. However, he
said, the site had obviously been damaged and the black box which
recorded flight conditions was missing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there was little possibility for any survivors
taking into consideration the big fire after the crash.
</P>
<P>
The envoy did not pointedly say that the plane had been shot
down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Benom announced that the U.N. will send a
international team to the north of Huambo Province to search for
the second plane.
</P>
<P>
Huambo is currently under the control of the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
Reports from a Portuguese Radio said UNITA had issued a statement
saying it is willing to offer cooperation to the U.N. so long as
the communication channel is through.
</P>
<P>
Benom termed the current situation in Angola as "very
dangerous", but would not comment on whether the U.N. observer
mission will withdraw in due time.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has confirmed that the U.N. mission has
been withdrawing its staff to the capital Luanda from various
places.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy arrived in Angola last Wednesday to investigate
into the two plane crashes before and after the new year. During
his stay in Angola, Benom held talks with President Eduardo dos
Santos from whom he obtained full support of the Angolan
government for the U.N. rescue mission.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital is amongst
the world's top ten most polluted cities and now a daily forecast
of the pollution index is to be made by the Beijing
Meteorological Protection Bureau which will work closely with the
city's Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The city authorities have put high on their agenda this year
the task of reducing air pollution, and an official said the
forecast will begin as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Beijing -- along with the cities of Lanzhou,
Yinchuan, Xining and Hohhot in northeast China -- reported
seriously high levels of pollution resulting from large volumes
of suspended particles in the air.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing now has some 1.4 million motor
vehicles and the air pollution index has often been above
moderate levels because of tail gas emissions, coal-fired heating
and weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong
Province, the city environmental protection bureau has advised
citizens to stay indoors wherever possible as it had serious air
pollution in the first week of this year.

<HEADLINE> New Vehicle Sales Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's new vehicle sales
slumped by 15 percent in 1998, according to year-end figures just
released by the Kenya Motor Industry (KMI) Association.
</P>
<P>
The downturn to a total of 9,407 new vehicles is less than half
the number required to sustain a healthy and growing national
fleet, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sales decline was attributed to the general economic woes,
high interest rates, tough taxation on company cars and dumping of
used imports.
</P>
<P>
The KMI bureau said passenger car sales have been particularly
hard hit and are down 21 percent, while the tough road conditions
have boosted four- wheel-drive vehicle sales, which were up three
percent.
</P>
<P>
The only other class which grew in 1998 was double cab pickups.
"These cab pickups used to be taxed like luxury cars," the KMI
bureau explained," but since the government started taxing them as
utility vehicles, several new models have been introduced and
sales have almost treble."
</P>
<P>
The KMI bureau added that the sales of double cab pickups grew
because they are among the most versatile, practical and
appropriate ones for Kenya.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin injected more than 1.3 billion yuan (about 158 million
U.S. dollars) into the construction of its urban electric power
network in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The funds were used to build and expand twelve 35-kilovolt
substations, and upgrade 475 low-voltage distribution networks
both at or under 10 kilovolts, according to local department
concerned.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the city only had three
35-kilovolt substations. It was listed among the 25 cities by the
State Planning and Development Commission last year as the first
group which will be given considerable support for urban power
network construction.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of the city's economic development, the
region's power company decided to greatly improve the urban power
network between 1998 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Within a year the power supply shortage has been eased, and
incidence rate of power failure reduced by 40 to 50 percent. This
has not only made residents' lives more convenient but has also
improved the city's ability to fight against natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
To further improve the power supply, the city will add one
million kilovolts to its current power supply of 2.6 million
kilovolts by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A cross-sea bridge, the first
in China with roads and railway line on the same level, is under
intensive construction in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Work has been completed on 60 percent of the bridge, 40
percent of the overpass on Daxie Island, as well as 20 percent of
the bridge approach on the bank of the Beilun port.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will have a total length of 3,723 meters. The
entire project consists of the main bridge, a highway approach
and a railway feeder line on Beilun bank, and an overpass on
Daxie Island. The first phase of the bridge will cost 370 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be completed in late October and will be put
into service by the end of this year. By then, the annual freight
volume of the railway in the middle of the bridge will amount to
20 million tons, and the two-lane highways on both sides of the
railway will be able to allow 32,000 motor vehicles to pass
daily.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the bridge started in April 1997 and the whole
project will cost 430 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Daxie Island is one of the most suitable places on China's
east coast for an international bulk cargo center.
</P>
<P>
In November 1992, then Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren, who
was chairman of the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (CITIC), agreed to a large-scale land development on
Daxie. Upon approval of the State Council in March 1993, Daxie
Island has been given preferential treatment as an economic and
technological development zone.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is considered as an important infrastructure
project which will transform Daxie Island into a first-class port
and trade zone.

and there is no guarantee on the safety of the investment, which
can easily lead to the money disappearing," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the extremely high returns claimed by
these developers attracts large amounts of inward capital from
investors, which seriously disrupts the financial balance and
once the risks are realized the countryside's financial stability
will be affected.

The spokesman said that sales of overseas lottery tickets are
also prohibited, stressing that so far the Chinese State Council
has ratified only two kinds of lottery tickets: the China welfare
lottery tickets and the China sports lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to learn more about the country's
financial laws and regulations to avoid being taken in by
fraudsters and thus also prevent financial risks.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
offer further cooperation in diverse ways with the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and cement ties
between the two regional groups, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation will focus on investment through the
European Community Investment Partners Scheme, under which the EU
will publish an Asia-Invest report on Sri Lanka this year, German
Ambassador Helmut Van Edig told a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador of the EU Iuka Uusitalo told the joint press
conference that Sri Lanka would have an important role to play in
furthering cooperation between the regional groups as Sri Lanka is
both chairing the SAARC and has one of its diplomats as secretary
general of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Uusitalo said the EU with its experience of integration would
be able to provide training to the SAARC Secretariat to strength
itself.
</P>
<P>
In terms of direct cooperation between the two blocks, SAARC
could apply for the Generalized System of Preference, said
Uusitalo, adding that under such a scheme, goods from the region
produced with its own resources would get preferential status,
which would also facilitate trade.

<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive 140
million taka (2.9 million U.S. dollars) commodity aid as
flood-related assistance from Germany under an agreement signed
between the two sides here Monday.
</P>
<P>
With this funding, medical supply goods and equipment will be
provided to health centers to improve and rehabilitate basic
health care facilities in Bangladesh, The Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount was made available out of the budget of the German
Economic Cooperation and Development Ministry in the framework of
a special program earmarked for the flood calamities in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, food aid operations with German funding of 227
million taka (4.68 million dollars) were launched and successfully
implemented through the World Food Program and the German
Technical Cooperation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the German-Bangladesh negotiations on
development cooperation in Dhaka last December, the German
government committed another 140 million taka (2.9 million
dollars) within its 1998 financial assistance for Bangladesh for
urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction of rural roads and
markets.
</P>
<P>
Thus, in this connection with flood relief and rehabilitation,
Germany made available a total of over 500 million taka (10.3
million dollars) to Bangladesh as grant without payment.

<HEADLINE> Germany Firm in Promoting Reform of EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder on Monday reaffirmed Germany's determination to promote
the reform of the European Union (EU) after a meeting between the
European Commission, headed by Jacques Santer, and German cabinet
members here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was dominated by the consultation on the
restructuring of EU's financial spending, the reform of
agricultural policy and the slashing of Germany's financial
contribution to the EU. The EU has set March, when a summit is
held, as the deadline for completing its Agenda 2000 for internal
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural policy reform is critical for financial
reform, which directly decides whether the EU can be successful
in expansion, said the chancellor. Germany supported EU's enl
argement into eastern Europe. The first new members are not
expected to join before 2003.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which currently holds the EU presidency, has demanded
a cut in its net annual contribution to the organization of 22
billion marks (13 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Reform of farm subsidies, which devour half the annual EU
budget of about 100 billion dollars, remains key to revamping its
finances, Schroeder said. Bonn wants member states to start
paying more for their own farmers instead of sending the bill to
Brussels. This is opposed by France.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the EU should fairly consider the benefit and
interest of all its members, but "every member state must be
prepared to compromise," said Schroeder, who noted that this also
included Germany.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor also expressed his support for Santer's
commission which faces a vote on a motion of no-confidence on
Thursday. A two-thirds majority is necessary to force the
commission from office.
</P>
<P>
Bonn needed a strong commission to succeed in the reform of EU
finances by the summit, in order to pave the way for taking in
new members, stressed Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament in Strasbourg was due to open debate
Monday on corruption, fraud and mismanagement charges involving
the commission.

MADRID, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Economy and Finance Rodrigo Rato said on Monday
Spain and Venezuela will sign a new financial protocol.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement after meeting with visiting
Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez to discuss ways to
strengthen bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chavez also met with Spanish Foreign Minister Abel
Matutes. He pledged to open more opportunities for Spanish
investment in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who started Monday in Madrid a tour of Europe, said he
wanted to transform Venezuela into an "authentic democracy"
through constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Spain's trade surplus with
Venezuela totaled 24 million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Spanish exports to Venezuela range from mechanical and
electric machinery to automobiles, steel products and books,
while its imports from Venezuela are only crude oil and
aluminum.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Rose, Lavender Oil Sold Out in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAZANLAK, Bulgaria, January 11 (Xinhua) - Bulgaria for the
first time in ten years sold all its rose and lavender oil last
year, said Georgi Chaoushev, director of the Institute on Roses
in the central Bulgarian city of Kazanlak.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 kilograms of rose oil were sold by four Bulgarian
companies and the Plovdiv representation office of a French firm
at the prices from 3,650 to 4,000 U.S. dollars per kilogram. The
remaining stock of rose oil is no more than one kilogram, which
will meet this year's demands of the perfume industry, the senior
research associate said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's traditional rose oil industry, whose share of the
world market has slipped to 30 percent from around 70 percent in
1980s, has seen a considerable expansion in 1998. Its rose oil --
grown in the Valley of the Roses in the center of Bulgaria -- is
more expensive than rival products from China, Turkey and
elsewhere because of its high quality.
</P>
<P>
A total 15 tonnes of lavender oil at between 32 and 45 dollars
per kilogram have been sold to the traditional buyers from the
U.S. and France. For the first time, Greek and German traders
have taken part in the bids for the ethereal oils.
</P>
<P>
Last year's production of valerian and milk thistle will be
known by the end of January.

<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people died in the
cold wave that has been sweeping Bangladesh's north and
northwestern region since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Monday's temperature in the Rangpur district was nine degrees
Celsius, while the lowest temperature fell to 6.5 degrees Celsius
at Ishurdi district on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The temperature elsewhere over the northern part of the country
ranged from 7 to 9 degrees Celsius, according to the Met Office.
</P>
<P>
Besides, most of the districts in the region were even with out
the sun for several days, said press reports reaching here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Normal life was paralyzed due to the severe cold in the region,
which has caused immense sufferings to the poor people.
</P>
<P>
The local district governments are distributing blankets and
warm clothes among the distressed.
</P>
<P>
The sudden fall in the night temperature was caused by the
movement of the subcontinent high that was persisting over the
Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and adjoining West Bangla and on the land
areas comprising Bangladesh, weather experts observed.
</P>
<P>
The cold wave would continue for three or four days, a senior

CARACAS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's incoming
government led by President-elect Hugo Chavez will seek the
backing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for emergency
economic aid, said the Financial Minister Maritza Izaguirre on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Venezuela will have to present the IMF an economic program in
mid-March to obtain its support," said Izaguirre, who was named
Finance Minister by Chavez on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said the program, which will extend over this year and the

<P>
Izaguirre said that she would start personal contacts next
week with the IMF, adding that IMF director Michel Camdessus
would travel to Caracas next month after Chavez is sworn in on
February 2.
</P>
<P>
She said that she would give priority to revamping the budget
on the basis of an average oil price of nine U.S. dollars a
barrel, adding that she would maintain a strict fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
Izaguirre said that the rescheduling of the foreign debt would
be necessary to curb the expected budget deficit of about eight
billion dollars if crude prices remained low.

consumption boosted China's production to 94.48 million tons
between January and November last year, 9.4 percent more than the
same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China Metallurgical News reported recently that the annual
production increase last year would reach 10 percent, which was
attributed to the central government's efforts to step up
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
In October, for example, national fixed assets investment grew
by 28 percent, and the infrastructure investment growth was 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Big steel consumers such as the machinery and household
electrical appliance sectors achieved marked growth toward the
end of the year as opposed to previous sluggish results.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the growth rate for large and
medium-sized tractors was 70.5 percent; for automobiles 16.7
percent; and more than 30 percent for washing machines,
refrigerators and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
The paper estimated the annual demand for steel products last
year was 110 million tons, a 4 percentage points increase over
1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, customs officials have firmly cracked down on the
smuggling of steel products, which has boosted demand for
domestic products.
</P>
<P>
However, there is great concern in the industry about the
negative effects of soaring production which, together with 10
million tons of imports, has resulted in probably 5 million tons
of unwanted steel products, in addition to those already in
storage.
</P>
<P>
"This has affected the supply-demand balance that was reached
in the previous period," the paper commented.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of October last
year half of the 6 million tons of additional steel produced was
sent into storage.
</P>
<P>
The overall market price of steel products started to drop fr
om November last year.

<HEADLINE> New OSCE Chief Urges KLA to Release Yugoslav Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The new head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
claimed here Monday that it was "totally unacceptable" for the
ethnic Albanian guerrillas, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), to
hold Yugoslav soldiers as hostages.
</P>
<P>
"Taking hostages is totally unacceptable. OSCE has demanded
immediate release of hostages and maximum restraint. We have to
see an immediate release of the hostages if we should avoid a
major conflict," Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek told a
press conference after his meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
The two applauded the positive role the OSCE monitors in
Kosovo have been playing in search for a solution to the hostage
drama through political means.
</P>
<P>
Knut Vollebaek, who is on his first trip to the Balkans as new
chairman of the 54-nation European security watchdog, also
praised the constraint demonstrated by the Yugoslav government in
the drama.
</P>
<P>
The KLA captured eight Yugoslav army soldiers last Friday some
40 kilometers northwest of Kosovo's regional capital Pristina.
Monitors of the OSCE's Kosovo verification mission, backed by
pressure from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia,
were trying to persuade the KLA to free the soldiers and the
negotiations still continued.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Repeats Appeal for Unity of Ethnic Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli
Majko renewed the appeal Monday to ethnic Albanians in Serbia's
Kosovo province for speaking with one voice in settling the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government supports only a political solution
that favors the respect for the will of the Albanian people in
Kosovo as well as for international principles and rules, Majko
said in a meeting with Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the
self-claimed ethnic Albanian government in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Such a solution should be one acceptable not only to any
individual person or political force but also to all parties
concerned, Majko said.
</P>
<P>
Bukoshi backed Majko's initiatives, saying that all the
political organizations should reach understanding through talks
and formulate a common program.
</P>
<P>
Bukoshi said his "government" will be composed of
representatives of all ethnic Albanian political forces.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians, the majority of the population of
Kosovo, have long sought independence from Serbia and broken
into many bloody conflicts with Serbians. However, these
Albanians have power struggle among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The invitation of Bukoshi to visit Tirana is part of Majko's
efforts to unify the various political forces of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, according to Musa Ulqini, Albania's minister of
information.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Bukoshi's visit, Kosovo Albanian Democratic Movement
Chairman Rexhep Qosja and Adem Demaci, political representative
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, visited Albania on January 8 and
4, respectively.

PRAGUE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's inflation rate
dropped to 5.6 percent last year, the lowest since the former

In the early days of its independence, Slovakia's inflation

government to take a series of measures, such as macroeconomic
regulation and monetary control, to curb
it.
</P>

The inflation rate dropped sharply in recent years to 5.8
percent in 1996 and 6.1 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes Release of Hostage by Colombian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy on Monday welcomed the release of Norbert Reinhart
who had been held captive by leftist rebels in Colombia for over
three months.
</P>
<P>
Reinhart, 49, an executive of Ontario-based Terramundo
Drilling, was released Saturday. Also released was a German
tourist, according to the Colombian anti-kidnapping authorities.
</P>
<P>
Reinhart surrendered himself to the Colombian rebels on
October 6 so that his employee Edward Leonard, taken prisoner on
June 24, could go free last year. His company was contracted by
Grey Star Resources, a Vancouver exploration company, to drill at
a Colombian site, the Canadian Press reported.
</P>
<P>
"These lengthy kidnappings, first of Edward Leonard and then
of Reinhart, were cruel and inhumane," said the Canadian minister
in a release. "The taking of innocent civilians in any
circumstances is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Axworthy expressed appreciation for the excellent cooperation
Canada received from the Colombian authorities, the Catholic
Church of Colombia, Grey Star Resources and the International
Committee of the Red Cross in seeking the release of Reinhart.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced satisfaction that the peace process between the
government of Colombia and the rebel forces is now underway.
Canada firmly supports this process and is ready to lend
assistance, if requested by the parties, to these difficult and
protracted discussions, he added.

<P>
BELGRADE, January 11 (Xinhua)-- Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic Monday urged ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo to resume
direct and unconditional dialogue with the government, the
official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the call when meeting with Knut Vollebaek, Norwegian
foreign minister and chairman of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that negotiations were the only way to solve the
Kosovo crisis and autonomy within Serbian republic was a
realistic foundation for such a political solution.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Kosovo Liberation Army of attempting to
escalate the military conflict by taking eight Yugoslav Army
soldiers hostage.
</P>
<P>
The abduction was another example of terrorism by the KLA, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic urged again the OSCE to work for the release of the
eight soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the eight is the latest challenge to the
on-off ceasefire in Kosovo, where guerrillas are fighting for the
Albanian-majority province's independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The eight soldiers were seized Friday as they were trying to
enter rebel-controlled territory.

<P>
SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUN, Colombia, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The
Colombian government on Monday called on the rebels to sit down
at the negotiating table to discuss the government's ten-point
agenda on human rights and a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The agenda was forwarded to the Revolutionary Armed forces of
Colombia (FARC) in the second round of negotiations opened last
Thursday in San Vicente, one of the five central and southern
municipalities demilitarized last November.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, a wave of killings launched last week by
pro-government death squads continued, leaving over 120 people
dead.
</P>
<P>
The ten-point government proposal also aims to review the
country's economic and social structure, state and political
reform and the substitution of crops for drug-growers, whose
crops and processing labs are protected by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government also includes in the agenda environmental
protection, the strengthening of the justice system and
anti-corruption measures.
</P>
<P>
It also wants to eradicate paramilitary groups, seeking the
international community's support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The FARC demanded the dismantling of the paramilitary death
squads, and put forward a general agenda including a political
solution to the conflict, the restructuring of the army,
congressional reforms, economic development with social justice,
taxes, energy resources, foreign relations and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana said last Thursday there
would be no "banned issues" in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have said that they are ready to accept a truce if
eight of its 10 proposals are accepted.

<P>
LANZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Two zoos in China are trying
to persuade a female and male panda to mate but zoologists says
the rare creatures, there are some one thousand left alive in the
wild, are very choosy.
</P>
<P>
The female panda, named Shu Lan, belongs to the zoo in
Lanzhou, the capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, and was
recently flown to the southwestern city Chengdu city, the
capital China's Sichuan Province, to check out male pandas that
are in the city's zoo.
</P>
<P>
Shu Lan is four and a half years old and Lanzhou zoo's only
giant panda and has never mated. The two zoos decided to
introduce her to the three males in Chengdu and are hoping that a
match will be made with one of them.
</P>
<P>
If she does conceive and gives birth, she and the cub will
return to Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
However, even if Shu Lan doesn't take to any of the male
pandas, zoologists believe artificial insemination could be an
option.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China will make accelerated
efforts this year to expand basic education, further reduce
illiteracy among young people and adults and help education
contribute more to regional economic growth, today's "China
Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Education Minister
Chen Zhili as saying that her ministry will work together with
other ministries to help major universities develop research in
high technology and efficiently turn results and discoveries into
production.
</P>
<P>
A Plan on Education Development for the 21st Century, which
was worked out late last year, will be implemented this year.
</P>
<P>
The plan will provide guidelines within the next three to five
years for training higher-level talents and implementing the
nine-year compulsory education program among the population.
</P>
<P>
The country will help more than three million illiterate
people (aged 15-50) learn how to read and write.
</P>
<P>
More investment will be put into ethnic minority areas to
improve teachers' academic levels.
</P>
<P>
More than three-quarters of China's population have received
nine-year compulsory education. The number is expected to rise to
eighty percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Educational departments across the country will provide more
training opportunities for primary and middle school teachers, to
help improve their academic expertise, teaching skills and
professional qualities.
</P>
<P>
The move aims at shifting the previous examination-dominated
teaching method into a students' quality-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Another important task is to develop vocational and adult
education programs, to help serve regional economic and social
development, and promote on-the-job and re-employment training
programs, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt's Effort to Limit Rice Farming Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's effort to
limit second rice farming in the north this year in view of severe
drought has failed as a survey shows a more-than-two-fold increase
in the total area of cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The survey, made on December 30 last year by the Irrigation
Department and the Agricultural Extension Department, shows that
the total area of off-season rice farming in the north stood at
1.557 million rai (249,117 hectares) against a targeted limit of
720,600 rai (131,296 hectares), the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry's project to encourage farmers to turn
to other crops also appeared to have failed as only 1.252 million
rai (200.295 hectares) of a targeted 3.874 million rai (619,808
hectares) were being used for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
As of January 7, the water level was found to be low at 25 of
Thailand's 28 large reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only 31.7 percent of the water from the
country's seven major dams will be supplied this year for farming,
compared with 62.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interior Ministry, until January 8 this year
drought had already affected 232,469 families in 57 districts of
13 provinces.

<HEADLINE> One-Third of Chinese Wine Producers Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua)-- A third of China's 600 wine
producers have gone bankrupt in the past two years because of
over supply and fierce competition, reported a recent issue of
the Tianjin evening news.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, north China's biggest port city, half of the 38
wine producers were forced to shut down despite the market
economy that has taken deeper roots in China in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Wine production surged from 1996 and reached its zenith around
early Spring last year. Many liquor and soft drinks producers
turned to wine production, resulting in wine of inferior quality,
but these companies have mostly been forced out of business.

<HEADLINE> Italy Rules Out Euro's Negative Impact on Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy's foreign trade will not
suffer because of the introduction of the euro, Italian Foreign
Trade Minister Piero Fassino said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the International Italian Chamber of Commerce,
Fassino said that such confidence comes out of the fact that
Italian companies have a very strong competitive capacity, as
demonstrated by last year's trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
Italy enjoyed a net trade surplus of 40 trillion lire (around
24.4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 despite the global economic
turmoil, ranking itself as the best performer among the
industrial countries in terms of trade surplus-GDP ratio,
according to Fassino.
</P>
<P>
Of the total exports, the minister said, 47 percent went to
the western European markets, 20 percent to eastern Europe, 12
percent to America, 7 percent to Asia and the remaining to other
small markets.
</P>
<P>
Italy is one of the 11 European countries which jointly
launched the euro on January 1.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Forest Area Down 7 Percent in 36 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's forest area is
reducing year by year, dropping by 7 percent now as compared with
36 years ago, according to official statistics compiled by the
Forest Department under the Forestry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The data of 1962 show that 57 percent of the country's total
area was then covered by forests. The percentage dropped to 51
percent in 1989 and then to 50 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate felling and cutting of trees in the forests for
fuel and burning of charcoal are said to be the main cause of
forest depletion in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The action has brought about ill effects such as the appearance
of barren hills in the areas covering northern Myanmar down to
southern Ayeyawaddy division, the transformation of central
Myanmar into a tropical region and depletion of tidal forests
resulting in landslides and scarcity of marine products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out projects for greening the regions, under
which measures for reforestation, conservation of both reserved
and non-reserved forests, re-establishment of fuel-wood
plantations and tidal forests are being taken.
</P>
<P>
Under the project for using firewood substitute fuel, stoves
using them are produced and production and sale of briquettes are
the means being applied in the tropical regions. Trees for use as
firewood are planted in tidal forest areas.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has imported briquette making machines and arrangements
are being made to build briquette factories in Sagaing, Mandalay
and Magway divisions.
</P>
<P>
To use as firewood substitutes to prevent forest depletion,
briquettes, micro-wave ovens and agricultural wastes are being
applied.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Denies Report of Arms Supply to Sri Lankan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai army has denied that
arms smugglers are using Phuket, southern Thailand, as their base
to supply arms to Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka, The Bangkok Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But, Gen. Surayud Chulanont, the army chief, confirmed Monday
that arms smugglers were using sea lanes in the Gulf of Thailand
and the Andaman Sea to ship war weapons from Cambodia and Myanmar
to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
However, Surayud rejected allegations that some senior Thai
Army officers were involved in arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Surayud was referring to Monday's report in the
English-language Nation newspaper which quoted senior Sri Lankan
foreign ministry and army officials in making the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The army chief said he was confident that no Thai military
officers were involved in arms smuggling, and promised harsh
punishment if any of them was ever caught and proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Adm. Thira Haocharoen, the navy chief, maintained
that the Thai military had no policy to support anti-government
movements in any country.

<HEADLINE> Riots, High Risk to Investment in Indonesia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of
Investment Hamzah Haz has called on the public to prevent the
occurrence of mass riots that will deteriorate the country's image
abroad and further batter the investment climate.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mass riots that broke out in Karawang, which
is located 60 kilometers northeast of Jakarta in a rice-growing
area, last Friday pose a high risk to investment activities in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Two people were shot dead and eight others were injured after
security officers opened fire to prevent the mob from attacking
shops in Karawang. It was reported that six police posts, Karawang
police station and Kota police station were vandalized by the mob.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited three things as the impact of the riots.
First, it would reduce the activities of realized investment;
secondly, new investment due this year will be under threat of
collapse; and thirdly, those with investments of around 5 billion
U.S. dollars that have been running for one year are more than
likely not to extend their investment period.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trend in the drop in investment proposals and
realized investments by foreign investors was seen throughout
1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw 60 percent of foreign and domestic investments
canceled due to the deteriorating security climate in Indonesia,
the minister was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Build More Anti-Flood Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The north China metropolis of
Tianjin will spend about 1.1 billion yuan to construct and
rebuild anti-flood works in urban areas of the city over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is located at the lower reaches of many rivers through
which the water from Beijing and Hebei Province rushes into Bohai
Bay, so Tianjin has the arduous tasks of combating floods on the
rivers and containing the sea tides. But the city has a low
flood-combating capability due to limited investment in the
construction of anti-flood works in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Tianjin Municipal Water Conservancy
Affairs Bureau said the money will mainly be used to finance
construction of seven major projects, including consolidating
levees along the main stream of the Haihe River, enabling them to
sustain the flow of flood waters at a speed of 800 cubic meters
per second, and constructing more embankments to hold back the
sea tides.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more foreign loans will be introduced to co
nstruct an advanced anti-flood information network to facilitate
flow of information and decision making in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Five of the projects will start construction this year and
will require an investment of 350 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin had major floods in 1939, 1963 and 1996 and suffered
heavy losses during the first two floods. It is estimated that
the new anti-flood facilities of the past few years have brought
more than 17 billion yuan in economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
Major flooding on the Yangtze River, China's longest, and on
the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in northeast China last summer
caused severe losses to the Middle Kingdom. Many localities seem
to have learned a lesson from the last year's flooding and have
increased investment for constructing anti-flood works in a bid
to gain an edge over future floods.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House: Evidence Supports Charges Against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of
Representatives insisted Monday that evidence against President
Bill Clinton "overwhelmingly supports" both charges -- perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the Senate, the Republican-controlled
House said that "perjury warrants conviction and removal" from
office of a duly elected president under Senate precedents.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice, in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He
is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected to a
trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
The House's papers were filed in advance of opening arguments,
set for Thursday in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Clinton's lawyers decided to forgo filing a
motion seeking to dismiss the case at its very inception,
although officials suggested they would make that motion after
both sides had finished opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
The House decided against filing any immediate motions, as
well, although lawmakers are certain to seek permission from the
Senate to call witnesses to testify at the end of the period in
which both sides present evidence.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the White House said that the impeachment
charges against Clinton should be dismissed, saying that the
accusations "do not permit the conviction and removal from office
of a duly elected president."
</P>
<P>
"The charges in the articles do not rise to the level of `high
crimes and misdemeanors' as contemplated by the Founding Fathers
and they do not satisfy the rigorous constitutional standard
applied throughout our nation's history," Clinton's attorneys
said in a response to the Senate's trial summons.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has acknowledged that his behavior with Lewinsky was
improper, but "the charges in the two articles of impeachment do
not permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly
elected president," his lawyers said.

<HEADLINE> TV Rights Battle Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- One of the most crucial matches
in the history of British sport will be played out on Tuesday -
in the unlikely setting of a London courtroom.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report on Monday, the multi-million pound
battle is between the English Premier League and the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT).
</P>
<P>
The case hinges on whether the present 743 million pound
broadcasting contract between the Premiership, BSkyB and the BBC,
which expires in 2001,is in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
But sports minister Tony Banks has already warned of the
"damaging implications" for the game if the OFT wins the case.
</P>
<P>
Banks said he agreed with the chairman of the Football Task
Force, David Mellor, who claimed the grass-roots of the sport
could lose up to 50 million pounds as a result of a court ruling
in favour of the OFT.
</P>
<P>
"If the OFT finds against the football authorities there will
be profound damaging implications for the whole structure of
football in this country," Banks said.
</P>
<P>
"I endorse entirely the views put forward by the Task Force
and I hope the court will take such comments into consideration."
</P>
<P>
The case will open at the Restrictive Practices Court and is
expected to last as long as four months.
</P>
<P>
The OFT claims that the league is operating as a cartel in
brokering the joint TV deal with the two broadcasters on behalf
of 20 clubs.
</P>
<P>
It insists that consumers are being cheated because the
Premier League is artificially inflating the cost of football and
restricting fans' access to watching games on television. Only 60
of the 380 Premiership games are televised live.
</P>
<P>
John Bridgeman, Director General of Fair Trading said: "Any
other business acting in this way would be subject to competition
law and I see no reason why the selling of sport should be
treated differently."
</P>
<P>
However, the Premier League argues that the current system is
working well, earning clubs between 5 and 10 million pounds each
per season.
</P>
<P>
It believes an end to the collective selling of rights would
create a chasm between the top league clubs and the rest and risk
destroying the structure of the competition, possibly sparking a
breakaway by the elite clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Premier League also fears that victory for the OFT could
mean more media companies attempt to takeover top clubs, leading
to a shift of power from the league and clubs to corporate giants.
</P>
<P>
The value of soccer rights to television companies was
dramatically underlined last year when BSkyB tabled a 623 million
pound bid for Manchester United, the most profitable and best
supported club in the Premier League.
</P>
<P>
The bid is currently on hold pending an investigation by
Britain's competition authorities.
</P>
<P>
A bid by cable TV company NTL for Newcastle United is expected
if the BSkyB/Manchester United deal goes through.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Expects FA Cup Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Manchester United expect to have a capacity crowd for their FA
Cup fourth round tie against Liverpool despite being ordered to
close the North Stand at Old Trafford following Sunday's power
failure.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC, Trafford Council, the licensing
authority for the stadium, said the club must prove all problems
with the electricity supply have been solved before any
spectators will be allowed into the stand.
</P>
<P>
The Cup game does not take place until January 24 and United
hope to discover the cause of the problem soon.
</P>
<P>
The start of United's match with West Ham was delayed for 45
minutes while engineers tried to restore power to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Problems resurfaced following the game when emergency lighting
went out on four stairways and thousands of fans were kept
waiting as they field out through two emergency exits.
</P>
<P>
An extra 128 United staff and 86 police officers were deployed
in the stand to ensure everyone left safely.
</P>
<P>
The club insists supporters were not in any danger and staff
had rehearsed for such a scenario.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ken Ramsden said: "There was a loss of lighting in
the four conventional stair towers, but the main lighting in the
concourse itself and the two emergency stair towers had full
lighting.
</P>
<P>
"For those people exiting under the control of our staff,
there were delays but that was because it was a well-ordered job."
</P>
<P>
But a movie tribute to United legend Sir Matt Busby which was
filmed at the ground went off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
Fans remained silent for half-a-minute before power was lost,
during scenes shot for a biopic of George Best.
</P>
<P>
The club is co-operating with electricity company, Norweb, in
a full investigation into the cause of the power failure and does
not believe there is any threat to the FA Cup fourth round tie.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to have the matter resolved within a couple of
days. We are very confident that we will play the Liverpool game
as scheduled and ticket sales are going ahead as usual," said Ra
msden.

JAKARTA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net international

14.42 billion U.S. dollars the previous week due to foreign debt
payments, the Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.

But net international reserves were above the International

<HEADLINE> NBA Deal Benefits Small Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- NBA officials, in drafting
the new collective-bargaining agreement, did not want to turn the
league into one of haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the negotiations, it was a priority of those
involved to avoid ending up with a settlement that would favor
the large-market teams and allow them to buy up the big-name
players and dominate NBA.
</P>
<P>
The intent was to keep the Milwaukees, Sacramentos and
Minnesotas of the league solvent and competitive. NBA
commissioner David Stern thinks the league succeeded with the new
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It gives 29 teams the opportunity to compete," said Stern.
"It emphasized continuity of roster. Hopefully, players will be
encouraged to maximize their income and do it with the teams that
they previously played with.
</P>
<P>
"It give well-managed teams the opportunity to have a return
on their investment. We want the fans in all NBA cities, when the
exhibition season is about to begin to have a sense or to be able
to have a sense over some period of years, that there's an
opportunity for their teams to compete and possibly win. That is
very important. We think this leads us in that direction."
</P>
<P>
The new system of annual salary increases allows a player to
make more money if he stays with the same team. If a "Larry Bird"
player re-signs with his own team, he may sign a seven-year
contract with annual raises of 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
If a player goes to an other team, he will be limited to a
six-year deal with annual raises of 10 percent. The thinking is
that this will encourage players to re-sign with their own teams
even if they are in samll markets.
</P>
<P>
Stern said it was hoped that the new deal would increase
franchise values around the league which would also benefit the
samll-market teams.

NEW YORK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell to a 28
month low of 108.22 yen at one point on Monday, but became

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls to 28-Month Low against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. dollar dropped to
108.93 Japanese yen Monday from 110.93 yen last Friday, a
28-month low for the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
During the trading day at the New York Foreign Exchange,
the dollar fell to 108.22 yen, the lowest since August 26, 1996.
It was trading at more than 147 yen last August.
</P>
<P>
The dollar lifted when the U.S. treasury denied a report that
Washington was happy with a weaker dollar because that would
make it easier for U.S. companies to sell their goods in Japan.
</P>
<P>
After the Japanese yen started soring against the dollar
last Thursday, Chris Widness, economist at Chase Manhattan Bank
in New York said that yen's rise will hinder any economic
recovery in Japan this year because the stronger Japanese
currency will make Japanese exports more expensive, reducing
its overseas profits.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar gained ground Monday against most major
currencies. The European single currency, euro, slipped to
1.1542 dollars from 1.1554 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also trading at 1.6946 German marks, up
from 1.6929 Friday and at 5.6818 French francs, up from 5.6766.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Hopes to Shorten Euro Transition Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has expressed hope to
see euro notes and coins in 2001 instead of 2002 as legally planned,
officials said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Belgium Finance Minister Jean-Jacques Viseur told Monday's
local newspaper De Morgen that the EU should look again at
introducing euro notes and coins on March 1 or October 1, 2001,
rather than as planned on January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, a European commission spokesman said at a news briefing
that the current legal situation is defined in a regulation which
was adopted on May 3 last year. "To change that regulation would
require a further European Commission proposal and for that to be
unanimously adopted by the 11 countries in the euro zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about possibility of shortening of the transition
period, the spokesman said that though much shorter period is more
desirable, the commission would not make proposal at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgian Finance Ministry spokeswoman said Viseur
will put forward the question at a meeting of EU finance ministers
next Monday and ask the European Commission to examine whether it
is possible.

<HEADLINE> Adams Returns to Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Tony Adams has successfully
completed his comeback after seven weeks out with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal and England defender Adams came through the
Gunners'reserve-team outing against Northampton reserves showing
no adverse reaction to the problem which has kept him out of
action since November 25.
</P>
<P>
The inspirational center-back picked up a booking as he
skippered an experienced side in a 2-0 defeat at Sixfields.
</P>
<P>
The Gunners, who also boasted Nigel Winterburn, Christopher
Wreh, Nelson Vivas and Remi Garde among their second string, were
undone by goals in either half by Kevin Wilson and Christian Lee.
</P>
<P>
Adams picked up his yellow card in the 63rd minute after
tangling with Wilson on the edge of the box.
</P>
<P>
The Highbury favourite was penalised in the first half for a
tackle from behind on Lee, and when the resulting free-kick was
not cleared properly, Wilson finished cleanly from the edge of
the box.
</P>
<P>
For the second goal, Adams was left vainly appealing for
offside as Wilson flicked the ball over the top for Lee to round
Stuart Taylor. Despite the result, Adams' return is a boost for
both Highbury boss Arsene Wenger and England coach Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
Wenger, masterminding the Gunners' defence of the Double is
already without several key players and center-back Steve Bould
suffered a knee injury on Saturday which may require surgery.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle too, would welcome back the inspirational Adams for the
friendly against World champions France on February 10 and the
Euro 2000 qualifier with Poland on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Adams in now likely to step back into the first team for
Saturday's game against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.

<HEADLINE> Atkinson Takes over at Nottingham Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ron Atkinson will begin to work
at Nottingham Forest as manager next weekend without any fear of
failure.
</P>
<P>
His appointment as the club's boss until the end of the season
was confirmed in a statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The former Manchester United, Aston Villa, Sheffield
Wednesday, Coventry and West Brom boss had been installed as
favorite for the job following the sacking of Dave Bassett last
week.
</P>
<P>
Peter Shreeves has been named as his number two after working
with Atkinson in a similar capacity at Wednesday and they face
the task of saving the club from relegation.
</P>
<P>
"I would think it's a marvelous challenge, not one to fear.
Ron achieved the same at Coventry when they were in a tight
situation," said Shreeves.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that confidence among the players was "fairly
low" but added: "If there's anyone who can do the job better than
Ron, the name doesn't come to mind easily."
</P>
<P>
One of English football's most flamboyant characters, Atkinson
has developed a reputation as a "Red Adair", who can get teams
out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
But he faces a particularly tough task at the City Ground.
</P>
<P>
Forest were humbled 4-0 by another of Atkinson's former clubs
Coventry at the weekend and are now rooted to the bottom of the
table after a dismal run of 18 Premiership games without a
victory.
</P>
<P>
The lowest point of the campaign came last week when they were
knocked out of the FA Cup by First Division side Portsmouth - a
result that cost Bassett his job.
</P>
<P>
The club's statement to the Stock Exchange read: "Nottingham
Forest has appointed Ron Atkinson as manager of Nottingham Forest
Football Club.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Atkinson will take up his appointment as manager prior to
the home game against Arsenal on Saturday 16th January 1999."

UNITED NATIONS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Tazanian President
Julius Nyerere, the international mediator on Burundi, was among
participants on Monday at the start of the two-day talks aimed at an
end to the civil war and aid economic development in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meetings at the U.N. headquarters in New York are
being attended by regional, donor and U.N. officials. The talks were
jointly organized by the U.N. Department of Political Affairs, the
U.N. Development Program and the Canadian Government.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Nairobi, Kenya, said over the weekend that Nyerere,
who met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday, would
likely recommend to East African leaders that they suspended
sanctions against Burundi when they meet in Arusha, Tazania, on
January 18.
</P>
<P>
Regional states, including Kenya, Tazania, Uganda, and Rwanda,
imposed an economic and trade embargo on Burundi after retired Major
Pierre Buyoya took power in an army coup in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
Their main condition was that Buyoya starts talks with Hutu rebels
engaged in a bloody conflict with the country's Tutsi-dominated army
in which 150,000 people have died since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Internet to Reach Half UK Adults This Year: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the adults in the
UK will be wired up to the Internet by the end of this year,
according to an opinion poll published Monday in the Guardian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Though under one-third of adults in Britain, 29 percent, are
now online, the survey showed that Internet growth in Britain
looks set to surge with a further 14 percent saying they plan to
get connected within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
That means the figure of people hooked up to the Internet is
expected to rise to 43 percent, nearly half of the adult
population, by the millennium, the Guardian reported.
</P>
<P>
This also indicates a rate of expansion more than double than
twice that of last year's 1 percent a month, according to the
poll.
</P>
<P>
The growth confirms that the Internet has caught on faster than
any previous new technology, including video recorders and CDs.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the Internet is lifting off in Britain as a mass
medium widely used by the public and is no longer the specialist
preserve of academics, scientists and "net nerds," the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Surge on Production Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices rose 5 percent
to a two-month high on expectations for leaner supplies, after a
key Nigerian terminal was shut down by local protesters demanding
a greater share of oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Forcados oil terminal
is contributing to a 300,000 barrel-a-day drop in Nigerian
production, or about 0.4 percent of world supply. The disruption
followed a report last week that U.S. inventories had their
biggest drop in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
February crude oil rose 37 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $13.44 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest price
since November 13. Crude prices are down 17 percent from a year
ago, though prices have gained in eight of the past 10 sessions.
</P>
<P>
In London, February Brent crude oil rose 31 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $12.04 a barrel, on the International Petroleum
Exchange. The February Brent contract expires on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, traders expect that Nigerian crude oil will arrive
back on the market soon.
</P>
<P>
Expectations for rising prices also are being fed by historical
pricing trends, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
When prices broke through $13.25 a barrel, which was last
week's high, crude rallied all the way to $13.75 a barrel, said
traders who use charts and graphs to predict pricing trends.
</P>
<P>
Whether the rally continues into tomorrow will hinge on the
results of a report on the size of U.S. inventories by the
American Petroleum Institute, traders and analysts said. The API
is to release its report for the week ended January 8 after

<P>
The Dow closed at 9,619.89, down 23.43. Earlier this

<HEADLINE> Competition Makes EU Insurance Industry Slim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Growing competition within the
15-nation European Union (EU) single market has made EU insurance
industry smaller, data available here Monday shows.
</P>
<P>
The data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, said the
number of economic actors is decreasing while the financial
indicators show only a slight upward trend in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat said the total number of direct insurance
enterprises in the EU fell by 3.36 percent between 1996 and 1997,
from 3099 to 2995, while most EU countries reported a drop with
the biggest being in Greece (-11.18 percent), Spain (-9.73
percent), France (-7.22 percent) and Denmark (-5.71 percent). And
in contrast, Ireland recorded the largest EU growth of 10.89
percent, followed by Sweden with 8.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in the number of enterprises is most likely a result
of mergers to face growing competition," says Eurostat, adding
that since the liberalization and deregulation of the insurance
markets through related EU directives, Europe has been increasing
competition, and the introduction of the euro will eliminate a
further barrier between 11 euro zone countries: Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Currently, enterprises are reacting at different levels in
order to meet increasing competition and maintain or extend their
market share. As a result, the number of mergers and acquisitions
is increasing while efforts are being made to lower operational
costs and maintain or lower prices, says Eurostat.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Bow to Profit Takers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- European markets dropped sharply
Monday on a wave of profit-taking and Wall Street's fall at the
impact of a soft U.S. dollar and strong Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The London stock market recorded a heavy fall as the FTSE 100
closed down 62.2 points to 6,085, even though the session had been
marked by frenetic merger speculation and takeover battles.
</P>
<P>
Banks, pharmaceuticals, oil and telecom shares fell after
rising sharply in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
A fresh wave of corporate activity, including a tie-up between
British American Tobacco and Rothmans International helped
sentiment, but failed to stop the slide.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt shares fell back after early gains as profit-takers
took over. At the close the Xetra Dax was 104.04 points lower at
5,265.47.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that big portfolio managers were adopting a more
pan-European approach to equities after the launch of the euro,
and that the reshuffling could continue until mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Paris shares fell back on profit-taking after last week's
strong run. At the close the Cac 40 index was 43.52 points lower
at 4,201.90.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disappointed by Cool Cuban Response to Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
expressed disappointment over Cuba's cool response to U.S.
initiatives designed to increase cash flows to ordinary Cubans and
expand people-to-people contact.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard not to be disappointed by the initial public
response the Cuban officials have made that could make it less
likely that the benefits of this arrangement to the Cuban people
would be made possible," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted that without the acquiescence or cooperation of the
Cuban government, some of Clinton's initiatives cannot be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that upon reflection, the Cuban government will
choose to cooperate on these measures where their concurrence is
needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The administration hopes the government of Cuba does not impede
the workings of these arrangements to the detriment of the Cuban
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton proposed direct mail
service between his country and Cuba, and also more U.S. residents
eligible to wire cash donations to needy Cuban families.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. organizations also would be allowed to send
funds to non-governmental organizations on the island and the
charter flights would be increased.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced expanded cultural ties in education,
sports and other spheres while food sales and the sale of farm
inputs would be permitted on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
However, the measures were dismissed by Cuban officials as a
"public relations maneuver," stressing they would have little
effect on Cuba's economy.

<HEADLINE> Greece Denies Plans for Tripartite Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday denied that there
were plans for a tripartite meeting between the U.S., Greek and
Turkish leaders in Washington in April to discuss the relations
between Athens and Ankara as well as the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that a tripartite meeting between U.S.
President Bill Clinton with the Prime Ministers of Greece and
Turkey had not been brought up and had not been examined.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the tripartite meeting would take place on
the occasion of the summit of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has for years been trying to mediate between Greece
and Turkey to resolve their differences, but has made little
progress.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that with the recent cancellation of
plans by Cyprus to deploy the Russian-made S-300 anti-Aircraft
missiles on the divided island, opportunities have come for Greece
and Turkey to improve their strained relations and for the Greek
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to re-start their inter-communal
talks.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister on EU-Asia Finance Ministers Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The search for ways to stabilize
currency exchange rates and world economic issues top the agenda
at a meeting of European and Asian finance ministers in Frankfurt
this week, German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The present economic developments in Europe clearly show the
world economy is also our fate and that we need world economic
cooperation to avoid extreme down-turns of economic development in
the future," said Lafontaine at a Bonn news briefing.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) and Asian finance ministers would discuss
extreme exchange rate shifts and the high mobility of short-term
capital in Asia which was causing dislocation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ways to stabilize Japan's banking system would also be on the
agenda at the meeting of finance ministers from the 15-nation EU
and 10 Asian states from January 15 to 16, said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
But, above all, the meeting would be dominated by developments
in the world economy and recommendations to stabilize
international finance markets and exchange rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said the meeting was aimed at bringing
"step-by-step" progress but he declined to name any concrete
policy goals.
</P>
<P>
"The economic disturbances we have prove that stable exchange
rates are necessary," he said. "This is basically undisputed
because otherwise one would have to be for strongly shifting
exchange rates. And this would in effect mean one was pleading for
investment insecurity and the major loss of jobs."
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said that aside from Asia, other countries like
Mexico had had to pay a great deal to make up for exchange rate
shifts.
</P>
<P>
In a barb evidently aimed at the United States, he said, "You
know my experience is that some (states) begin to shift only when
they notice certain changes in the world economy are also
impacting on them. That's how I would put it diplomatically."

BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi began a two-day trip to Germany Monday, which will include
talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi began his visit in Berlin where he met Germany's mainly
ceremonial state president, Roman Herzog.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Herzog said talks focused on the international
monetary system, economic policy and the situation in Russia.

Obuchi explained his efforts to reform Japan's banking system
and stressed his government was ready to stimulate the economy
through tax reform, said a spokesman for Herzog.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese leader later met leaders of the influential
Federation of German Industry.
</P>
<P>
Following a scheduled visit to Sony's new European headquarters

The French foreign minister arrived in Moscow on an official
visit on Monday afternoon, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Izvestia newspaper, Vedrine said that
making preparations for the coming visit to Paris by the Russian
President Boris Yeltsin is one of the aims of his visit.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will visit France late this month, Vedrine said,
noting that personal contacts between the French and Russian
presidents continue to play an important role in the development
of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Asked to what extent French diplomacy will pay attention to
the nationalist and anti-Western sentiments which were displayed
in Russia recently, the French foreign minister said there is no
need to pay much attention to these moods.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing surprising that some want to use the suff
erings or apprehensions of people for political ends, but
constant vigilance and wise replies are needed in this case," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vedrine hailed the fact that the Russian supreme
authorities confirmed their loyalty to reforms and continued the
dialogue with their Western partners.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Reiterates Endeavor to Curb Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has reiterated his endeavor to curb terrorism in the
country, particularly in Karachi, the country's largest city,
despite receiving dire threats directly.
</P>
<P>
"All my experience convinces me that unless we can pull out the
roots of violence from our soil we can make no progress," Sharif
said in a letter written to the Attorney General on Sunday asking
him to project his government's point of view before the court in
the most effective manner.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General read this letter on Monday before a
seven-member bench of the Supreme Court hearing the petitions
against the establishment of military courts. The Supreme Court
has stopped the execution of death sentences by the military
courts till it decides their validation.
</P>
<P>
"We can advance neither in the field of economic development,
nor of social betterment and nor of cultural and educational
advancement," the prime minister said, adding the nation will
constantly remain mired in poverty, backwardness and ignorance.
</P>
<P>
"Others will advance and we will lag behind. If we are to
progress we have to break the mould of lawless killings and
eradicate the vortex of violence. This is not merely necessary but
essential," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at a time when the government is poised to resume
economic growth it is facing the renewed threat of terrorism and
sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
"Waves of blood have been submerging our fair and tranquil land
from time to time. We emerge from one blood-bath only to be
drenched in another. We seek to eradicate the virus of bloodshed
only to see another manifestation emerge, in a stronger and more
virulent form," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent wave of violence the Prime Minister
wrote, "You are aware that for the past two years the tide of
violence has been ever increasing. I have no desire to criticize
the ordinary courts. I know that they operate under difficult
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"But how many terrorists have been convicted and executed in
the past two years? Thousands have been killed, but how many have
been punished?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Concluding the letter the prime minister said that he wants to
assure everyone concerned that he respects the functioning of the
ordinary courts.
</P>
<P>
"But there is a grave and real emergency in the country which
has been upheld by the Supreme Court. I do not wish to discuss any
legal or constitutional issues of which the Supreme Court is the
best judge. Nor do I desire to seek to influence the court's
deliberations in any manner in a pending case," he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economic Outlook Remains Uncertain: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore official
said here Monday that his country's economic outlook for this year
remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the commissioning of a new 400 kilo
volt transmission system at the Labrador substation, Minister of
Trade and Industry (MTI) Lee Yock Suan said "at this point of
time, it is very difficult to be certain how we are going to
perform this year."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the prediction by some analysts that the economic
crisis here is bottoming out, Lee said it is still difficult to be
certain of such a prediction, adding the current economic
situation appears mixed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry is keeping to its original
forecast of between minus one percent and plus one percent growth
in GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was first announced in November 1998 and
reiterated by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in his New Year
Message. Singapore's GDP grew 1.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lee said "we depend very much on the external environment, the
U.S. market, -- whether it holds up, the European market, what the
Japanese do and of course what our neighbors do."
</P>
<P>
The 400 kilo volt transmission system is part of the islandwide
power grid's project to distribute electricity in greater bulk to
its consumers.

a report by its Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)

Systems" in accordance with the Joint Declaration between China a
nd Britain on the question of Hong Kong and the Basic Law of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the fact that China is not yet a state
party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, Qiao said, the Chinese central government will inform the
HKSAR and ask the latter to send representatives to attend
meetings of the treaty bodies to answer questions if the report
needs to be considered by the relevant treaty bodies.
</P>
<P>
On transmitting the report to UNHCHR Mary Robinson, Qiao also
submitted a diplomatic note for her to pass to UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Qiao replaced Wu Jianmin as Permanent Representative to the
United Nations and other international organizations at Geneva
last December.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Exports Plunge by 12.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports plummeted
by 12.4 percent to 3.803 billion U.S. dollars during the first
half of the current fiscal year as compared to exports worth 4.342
billion dollars during the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the Federal Bureau of
Statistics (FBS) Monday, the imports also decreased by 19.6
percent to 4.397 billion dollars as compared to imports of 5.472
billion dollars during the first half of last fiscal year
</P>
<P>
Traders have attributed the decline in exports to recession in
international market during the period while they have attributed
the plunge of imports to measures taken by the State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) and Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The SBP placed 30 percent cash margin requirement on imports
except a few items last July. However, it reduced the margin to 20
percent on January 10. In addition to that it also introduced a
dual exchange rate mechanism under which the dollar became
costlier for importers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the steps by SBP somehow also helped the
government narrow the trade deficit which has come to 594 million
dollars during the first half of the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Kills Two in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Carbon monoxide trapped by
an ice-clogged chimney killed a couple and sickened 17 others
including their daughter and neighbors in three adjoining
buildings in Delaware State in Eastern U.S. Sunday, said reports
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighters initially responded to reports of a gas leak at an
apartment building in Wilmington on Sunday, the reports quoted
fire battalion chief Al Huelsenbeck as saying.
</P>
<P>
They soon discovered the gas was emanating from next door, and
when rescue workers forced their way into the house, they found
two people dead, Huelsenbeck said. The carbon monoxide level
inside the house was more than 10 times the level at which carbon
monoxide detectors are set to ring, he said.
</P>
<P>
In all, 17 people required medical treatment, including 11 at
the apartment building next to the house where the deaths
occurred, and people in two other adjoining buildings.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that the chimney and furnace flue were
clogged with dirt, soot, broken bricks, birds' nests, leaves and
ice. The cold weather probably froze all the material solid,
sealing up the small holes so none of the exhaust could get out,
the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Meets Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa met with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan at the State House her Monday to discuss ways to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his pleasant visit to China last April, Mkapa told
Tang that it's his responsibility to further develop, together
with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, the cordial relation
cultivated by Mao Zedong and Julius Nyerere in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"We'll realize their foresighted expectations on the bilateral
relations by deepening bilateral political cooperation and
consultations and boosting various forms of cooperation by the
enterprises of both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa reiterated in his one-hour meeting that Tanzania is
consistent in upholding the principled stand of "one China", and
that such a stand will never see any change.
</P>
<P>
Tang said history has proved that China and Tanzania are the
all- weather sincere friends of mutual trust since the two
countries forged diplomatic ties more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Tanzanian friendship reared by both leaders of the old
 generation has also found new forms in the fields of economic and
trade cooperation to keep abreast of the times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the reform of the Sino-Tanzanian Friendship Textile
Company from the state-to-state ownership to the joint venture by
both enterprises is one of the gratifying achievements in the wake
of the well-known 1,860- km Tanzania-Zambia Railway.
</P>
<P>
"China will encourage more of its powerful and prestigious
enterprises and companies to invest in Tanzania to try to
contribute to its economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between China and African countries, Tang
noted that China's foreign policy remain based upon strengthening
its cooperation with the vast developing countries including those
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"In line with its African brothers, China will work for
maintaining the just rights and interests of the developing
countries in a bid to establish a just and reasonable new
international order for politics and economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is on his fourth leg of an African tour which has
brought him to Egypt, Kenya and Uganda, is expected to visit some
Sino-Tanzanian joint ventures Tuesday before departing for his
last stop in Zambia.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said here Monday that the parliament is expected to hold a
vote of confidence for the newly established 56th government on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after submitting the cabinet list to
President Suleyman Demirel, Ecevit said that the government
program will be read at the parliament on Tuesday, and the
parliament debates on the program will be held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ousted Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz handed over his
post to Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who served as deputy prime minister in the Yilmaz
cabinet, said that he worked in harmony with Yilmaz during the
55th government for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has worked as prime minister for three times since 1974.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his gratitude for Yilmaz's support for the
formation of the new government, saying that they will work
together afterwards.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Yilmaz said he believed that Ecevit and his
government will carry Turkey to general elections on April 18
successfully.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, 73, had failed to form a government last December. He
was reassigned after independent lawmaker Yalim Erez also failed.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Concerned over Illegal Immigrants in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Interior
Almerino Manhenje has said that the government is concerned over
the situation of Mozambique's illegal immigrants in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government insists on dialog with the South
Africa to coordinate their stands on issues of refugee
repatriation, the Noticias newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with the South African authorities to ensure
Mozambicans' deserved treatment in South Africa," said Manhenje.
</P>
<P>
 The report said every week a large number of illegal
Mozambican immigrants are repatriated by the South African
authorities through Ressano Garcia border post. The Mozambicans
were reportedly packed in overloaded train and were mal-treated.
</P>
<P>
Some repatriatees said illegal Mozambican immigrants were
treated as slaves by South African farmers who reported to local
police at the end of the month before pay day so that the
immigrants were deprived of their salaries or even arrested and
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, it is unfair for South African
farmers and police to treat Mozambicans in that manner. He
stressed that Mozambican authorities will hold dialog to settle
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Yen Hurts Japan's Economy, Journal Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The soaring Japanese yen
against U.S. dollar last week does not signal some newfound
economic strength in Japan but hurts its exports, The Wall Street
Journal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The yen's rise will hinder any economic recovery this year in
Japan, the Journal quoted Chris Widness, economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York, as saying. "dollar weakness is Japan's
problem," Widness said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the dollar fell to 111.04 yen, a 27 month low
after Eisuke Sakakibara, a high-ranking Japanese official said
that he was worried about soaring U.S. stock market. The plunge
for dollar became a major topic on that day when a research team
at Alliance Capital Management Corp. gathered for a strategy
session in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Journal said that a rising yen makes life tougher for
Japanese exporters, as locally produced goods become more costly
in world markets. At a time when Japan is counting on exports to
help lift the economy out of its swoon, the best thing for
Japanese multinationals is a weaker yen, not a weaker dollar, it
said.
</P>
<P>
commenting on the repatriation of Japanese funds from the
United States to enjoy better yields, the Journal said Japanese
bond yields have suddenly jumped to more than 2 percent from less
than 1 percent. but the bond prices have plummeted. And with the
expected issuance of mountains of new debt to stimulate the
moribund economy, Japan's bond market still looks risky to many
market watchers.
</P>
<P>
"In other works, it's yet another measure of Japan's weakness
that its bond yields are suddenly more attractive," it said.

<P>
ABUJA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG has successfully taken control of the State House in
the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown, a statement said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the headquarters of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the Nigerian capital
Abuja said that its peacekeeping troops had driven rebels from the
State House near the center of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are now being pushed out of Freetown following
ECOMOG'S reinforcement during the past few days, it said, adding
that "efforts are being made to flush the rebels out of private
residences in Freetown where some of them are still taking
refuge."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, ECOWAS Secretary-General Lansana
Kouyate will travel to Lome, Togo, on Tuesday to meet Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS chairman, for
emergency talks on the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It noted, "Consultations are currently going on between ECOWAS
heads of state and parties to the conflict with a view to
convening a meeting on the crisis as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, several hundreds of Nigerian soldiers
have been sent to Sierra Leone to reinforce the 15,000-strong
ECOMOG troops which have been battling for the control of the
capital city Freetwon with the rebels since last Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Work Hard on the Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States is determined
to "work very hard to seize the opportunities" created by Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides' decision regarding the S-300 missiles
issue, U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus contracted for Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
in 1997 in a bid to boost its defense, a move rejected by Turkey,
which threatened to launch preemptive strikes if the missiles
were deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides decided late last December to cancel the deployment of
the missiles in Cyprus after consultations with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Clerides, Brill said there is a
lot of hard work to be done to move forward on the Cyprus issue
and opportunities have to be seized through consistent work.
</P>
<P>
He called for support for the initiatives taken by United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Brill said that security is a core issue which must be
addressed in a comprehensive way for the ultimate solution.
</P>
<P>
He pledged U.S. support for the work of Ann Hercus, chief of
mission of the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the U.S. supports a bicommunal, bizonal
federation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees HK's Post-handover Period Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
in its first annual report on Hong Kong that the Chinese
territory's basic rights, freedoms and autonomy have been broadly
upheld, although it is suffering its worst recession for decades
after being severely battered by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the report was published here on Monday, Sir Leon
Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, said the
success of Hong Kong's post-handover period in such adverse
economic conditions is a tribute to the determination of both Hong
Kong and Beijing to safeguard the former's wide-ranging autonomy
as enshrined in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR). This bodes well for the future, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Full respect for "one country two systems" is the best
guarantee of Hong Kong's future prosperity, and thus its ability
to support China's own domestic reforms, Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
"The commission is greatly reassured by the overwhilming degree
of freedom enjoyed by the media, the legal system and ordinary
people in Hong Kong, even though some isolated cases have raised
some questions," the EU commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, pointed out in its
report that an effective enforcement of the "one country two
systems" concept is fundamental to Hong Kong's lasting stability
and prosperity, which in turn will benefit the EU and other world
partners who have for many years enjoyed a dynamic trade and
investment relationship driven in part by Hong Kong's independent
free market economy.
</P>
<P>
China will also benefit from the international financial
center's prosperity and stability, the report said. For China, "a
robust, globally integrated Hong Kong is a powerful buttress to
its own economic reforms".
</P>
<P>
The EU therefore, the report said, sees the upholding of the
Hong Kong SAR's autonomy, within the "one country two systems"
concept, as a central plank of its policy towards the territory
and a major component of its relationship with China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, the EU set about upgrading its links with
the SAR by adopting a policy document entitled "The European Union
and Hong Kong: beyond 1997". Based on the document, the EU
commission undertook to produce an annual report on relations
between the EU and Hong Kong. Today's report is the first of such
kind.

killed after their aircraft crash-landed a few kilometers outside
the capital Kinshasa.

<P>
A statement from the Zimbabwean Defense Forces (ZDF) Monday

Zimbabwe, along with Namibia and Angola are fighting the
Congolese rebels who are trying to topple the government of

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Research Meeting Opens in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A four-day regional meeting on
tobacco control started Monday in Nyanga, east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to set research priorities for eastern,
central and southern Africa and identify critical economic,
social, environmental, legal and health problems that are brought
 bout by tobacco production and consumption, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has drawn more than 20 participants from 14
countries. They are mostly researchers, policy makers and
community activists of health, agricultural economics, social
science, environment and law.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean Minister of Health and
Child Welfare Timothy Stamps said tobacco consumption and
production are escalating rapidly in developing countries as

Tobacco is known to cause about 25 diseases, including lung

<HEADLINE> Japan Presents Plan for Israeli Pullout from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura Monday presented to the Israeli government a plan
for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Komura presented the plan to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon during their meetings
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the four-point plan demands the
adoption of Resolution 425 of the United Nations Security Council,
which calls on Israel to pull out its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes that Israeli and Lebanese governments discuss
concrete steps of withdrawal, adding that peace moves should not
have any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for international support for the withdrawal and
help in stabilizing the situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for a resumption of Israeli-Syrian peace talks
after the withdrawal is completed and offers Japanese mediation to
all the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the plan exactly matched the Israeli
policy in the Israeli-Lebanese negotiations, adding he hopes to
renew the peace talks with Lebanon and Syria if he wins the early
elections on May.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also hailed the ideas as "impressive," saying that
he welcomes Japanese mediation in the Israeli-Lebanese talks.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Komura had shown the plan to senior Syrian
and Lebanese officials during his visits in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before his tour in Israel, Komura has visited Egypt, Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985 and has
refused to withdraw from the region unless the Lebanese government
agreed to negotiate security arrangements to protect northern
Israel from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government rejected the Israeli proposal, noting
that the U.N. resolution calls for unconditional Israeli
pull-out.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Ties Between UNSCOM and U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan stressed on Monday that he has no evidence of ties
between the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the
United States as the media had charged.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement upon arriving at the headquarters of
the United Nations this morning.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the statement he issued last week is
factual and he would hope that this issue could be put to rest.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he did not think the issue was Richard Butler,
Executive Chairman of UNSCOM in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, and he did not think the issue was
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"In the scheme of this, we are dealing with much larger issues
about compliance of Iraq and stability in the region that we
should focus on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no evidence and I think Butler's statement
has been forthright and the U.S. itself has said they give him
support that he required for his work," the Secretary-General
added.
</P>
<P>
Washington Post and Boston Globe reported last week that UNSCOM
had help the United States intelligence agents to spy on Iraq,
which further put UNSCOM's future in question.

</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, China will grant Tanzania some two

</P>
<P>
China also agreed to donate 100,000 U.S. Dollars for emergency

</P>
<P>
On the cultural field, China and Tanzania agreed to boost
exchanges of cultural delegations, arts troupes, books and

</P>
<P>
The exchange of information and cooperation between the news

<HEADLINE> Record Number Refuse to Serve in German Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A record number of men refused to
serve in the German military last year by declaring themselves
conscientious objectors, the defense ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Presseagentur(dpa) reported, in 1998 a total of 171,657
men refused to do their military service - the highest number since
the German armed forces were reestablished after World War II in 1955,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
This figure beat the previous record of 160,494 conscientious
objectors set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry said there was no single cause for the new
record. "It's a big mix of individual motives," said a ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Under Germany's constitution anyone has the right to refuse to bear
arms in war. Those who exercise this privilege normally perform civil
service and the many young men working in hospitals, old-age homes or
with the handicapped have become an important source of cheap manpower
for the German social welfare state.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said despite the number of
conscientious objectors the armed forces still did not have a problem
getting the required number of new recruits each year.
</P>
<P>
About 163,000 young men were conscripted into the German armed
forces in 1998 for their 10-month mandatory service, said the
spokesman, adding, however, that the figure should not be
misunderstood even though it was lower than the number of
conscientious objectors.
</P>
<P>
"We only call in as many conscripts as we need and last year we
did not need more," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, has a total strength of
340,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> White House Not to Dismiss Senate Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's lawyers will not make a motion seeking dismissal at the
outset of his impeachment trial, Democratic sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources, who asked not to be named, said the president's
lawyers still planned to make such a request but would save it
until after both sides could give their opening presentations.
Democratic lawmakers had suggested the delay in deference to the
desire of senators to open the trial in bipartisan fashion.
</P>
<P>
The president's lawyers, meanwhile, were responding to the
Senate trial summons and declaring they would present a defense
for articles of impeachment accusing the president of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they expected the first response to be short, 11
or 12 written pages, making clear their intention to aggressively
contest the charges and to argue the evidence doesn't warrant the
removal of the president.
</P>
<P>
Both House prosecutors and White House lawyers had until the
end of the day to present motions, but Democratic sources said the
White House would file no motions Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of the two articles of impeachment -- perjury and
obstruction of justice -- in connection with his effort to conceal
a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. He is the second president in U.S. history to be
subjected to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868.

<HEADLINE> White House: Charges Against Clinton Don't Merit Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The White House said Monday
that the impeachment charges against U.S. President Bill Clinton
should be dismissed, saying the accusations "do not permit the
conviction and removal from office of a duly elected president."
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton's lawyers won't force a vote on dismissal at
the outset of the trial, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of the two articles of impeachment -- perjury and
obstruction of justice -- in connection with his effort to conceal
a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. He is the second president in U.S. history to be
subjected to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
"The charges in the articles do not rise to the level of `high
crimes and misdemeanors' as contemplated by the Founding Fathers
and they do not satisfy the rigorous constitutional standard
applied throughout our nation's history," Clinton's attorneys said
in a response to the Senate's trial summons.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, the articles of impeachment should be dismissed."
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said the president "denies that he made perjurious,
false and misleading statements before the federal grand jury on
August 17, 1998." Further, it said the president "denies that he
obstructed justice" either in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case or in the Monica Lewinsky grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has acknowledged that his behavior with Lewinsky
was improper, but "the charges in the two articles of impeachment
do not permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly
elected president," his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
While arguing the charges should be cast aside, the lawyers
have decided not to make a motion before the trial starts
requesting dismissal, bowing to Democratic lawmakers' wishes to
begin the proceeding in bipartisan fashion, White House officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Over 2,200 Rwandans Flock Back from DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,200 Rwandans who
had crossed to Masisi Region, in northeastern Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) at the beginning of the armed Hutu insurgency last
year have started to flock back home, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
''Since January 1st up to the10th, we have registered 2,253
returnees. They are in poor condition and need urgent
assistance,'' the RNA quoted Ramazani Barengayabo, the Mayor of
Rwerere as reporting.
</P>
<P>
More returnees continued to arrive from Masisi, which was the
hotbed of the Hutu extremists behind the waves of insecurity that
characterized the northwest Rwanda in the recent past. Over 100
returnees were registered on Monday, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Rwerere commune is located in the northeast of Gisenyi, near
the border with the DRC. It is amongst the communes in northwest
Rwanda which paid a heavy tribute to the armed insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Rwerere commune shelters more than 53,000 residents
who turned their heels against the armed Hutu extremists, as the
pressure by the government army and the political mobilization are
gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
''The resettlement of these people is gaining momentum,''
Barengayabo told RNA. Nineteen construction sites have been
selected, and the works have already started,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The returnees interviewed by RNA affirmed that they had been
held hostages by the Hutu extremists -- former Rwandan government
soldiers (ex- FAR) and '' Interahamwe'' -- which had established
bases in Masisi.
</P>
<P>
''They were telling us the government in Rwanda is massacring
Hutus, that we should join the struggle to liberate the country,''
said one returnee.
</P>
<P>
Most of the returnees said they decided to return to Rwanda,
after they had reassuring messages from President Pasteur
Bizimungu who, with his entire cabinet, visited Rwerere and other
parts of northwest Rwanda early last month.
</P>
<P>
It is said that these returnees, some of whom were involved in
attacks, have revealed arms caches they left behind before
crossing to Masisi.
</P>
<P>
The returnees claimed that the Hutu extremists have been
inflicted a heavy blow by the Congolese rebels fighting to
overthrow President Laurent Desire Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meets Argentine President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met Argentine President Carlos Menem Monday at the White House
with hopes that the meeting would put the public attention more on
his job than on his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Menem planned to discuss trade, climate change,
Bosnian peacekeeping and U.S. policy toward Iraq, said P.J.
Crowley, the spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Clinton told reporters the United States
and Latin American nations "have turned a page in our history"
over the past 10 years, as leaders abandoned dictatorship for
democracy and became a force for peace in other areas of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Our future has never been brighter," Clinton said. "This year,
we are a hemisphere at peace, essentially without international
conflicts, moving beyond historic animosities to discover new
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
The United States is Argentina's second-largest trading partner
after Brazil. Menem wants to talk about trade and efforts to
fight drug trafficking and international terrorism, and filling
the vacant U.S. ambassadorship to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
They would also discuss climate change and encouraging more
developing nations to embrace the idea of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Argentina played host to a U.N. conference on climate change in
November, and agreed then to adopt a target on reducing emissions.
</P>
<P>
On Clinton's impeachment trial, Menem stated unequivocal
support for Clinton before leaving Argentina, saying Congress was
"going against what the people of the United States want" by
continuing the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders last met in October at the annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund in Washington, and Clinton paid a
state visit to Buenos Aires in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Menem is scheduled to leave office later this year, although he
has not ruled out another bid for office.
</P>
<P>
The administration designated Argentina a non-NATO ally in
1997, a status that allows access to surplus military equipment.
Argentina is the only Latin American country to have the title.

</P>
<P>
The White House officials said the president's lawyers, or a
Senate Democratic ally, would likely make a motion to dismiss the
charges after the opening presentations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore Monday predicted the Senate
would conclude that Clinton should not be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
"What the president did was wrong," Gore told The Associated
Press. "He's acknowledged that, asked for forgiveness. But what he
did falls far short" of misbehavior warranting removal from
office. "And I'm confident the Senate will feel likewise."
</P>
<P>
The 13-page document released by the White House vigorously
rejected the charges against Clinton, addressing the particulars
of the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the president's lawyers argued that neither
article met the constitutional standard for conviction, that they
were too vague and that they were flawed because each contained
more than one charge.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have 45 seats in the Senate, more than enough to
defeat a vote to remove Clinton from office, which requires a
two-thirds majority. A motion to dismiss would need 51 votes.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
People's Republic of China decided Monday to upgrade its
diplomatic mission in Zanzibar of Tanzania from consulate to
consulate general to further develop bilateral friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed here by visiting Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and his Tanzanian counterpart Jakaya
Kikwete, Tanzania agrees to such a move and retains its right to
establish its own consulate gneral in China in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government agreed to provide all necessary
assistance and convenience to the Chinese Consulate General in
Zanzibar in the performance of the consular functions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to properly handling consular matters
between them in the spirit of friendly consultation, and in
accordance with international practice as well as international
laws, including the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
</P>
<P>
A highly self-ruling part of the United Republic of Tanzania,
Zanzibar, which consists of two main islands in the western Indian
Ocean, has a population of about 800,000, mostly Muslims.
</P>
<P>
China established its diplomatic relations with Zanzibar a few
days after the latter got independence from the Sutan King rule on
January 12, 1964.
</P>
<P>
The Consul General Wang Jikui, who speaks fluently the local
Kiswahili language, expressed his willingness to do his best to
upgrade the friendly bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is on his fourth leg of an African tour which has
brought him to Egypt, Kenya and Uganda, is expected to visit some
Sino-Tanzanian joint ventures on Tuesday before departing for his
last stop in Zambia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday called for
immediate direct talks between Belgrade and Kosovo Albanina
rebels, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a
news conference that Russia "believes the international community
should help this process in every possible way".
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kosovo settlement will be among problems to be
discussed at talks between Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and his counterparts from the U.S., France, Poland, Cuba, Sweden,
Israel and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Russia, seriously concerned over the attack by Kosovo
Liberation Army gunmen on Yugoslav and the seizure of eight
servicemen last Friday, cannot have terrorists and extremists
disrupt the process of political settlement in Kosovo, Lakhmanin
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moscow resolutely condemns that action and regards it as a
crying manifestation of terrorism. Russia hopes that the OSCE
mission in Kosovo will continue talks in order to successfully
free the hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lakhmanin also called for head of the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) Richard Butler to resign amid a row
over reported links between UNSCOW and Western special services.
</P>
<P>
He said that "We have repeatedly noted in the past that
Butler's activity had discredited the Special Commission."
</P>
<P>
On the Iraq problem Lakhmanin said Russia hopes Iraqi leaders
will display a responsible approach to the problem of relationship
of Iraq with the United Nations and neighbouring countries.

LUANDA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Defense Ministry
announced Monday that recruit registration started from January 8
to February 16 for all citizens between 18 and 20 years of age,
lowering the previous legitimate age for recruits by two years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry warned that anyone who does not register on time
will be deemed as committing a crime and be punished by the law.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the lowering of age limit by the Angolan
government is a result of the spreading of internal armed
conflicts which caused shortage of soldiers on the part of the
government army in the face of a series of new attacks across the
country by the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The two sides confronted in intense clashes both in central and
 northern Angola since last November.
</P>
<P>
A military source revealed that the younger and inexperienced
recruits will not be sent to the forefront to fight UNITA forces,
but instead be stationed in newly-recovered cities for security.

meeting with parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud took office from his predecessor Elias Hrawi last
October and a new cabinet was formed at the end of 1998, headed by
prime minister, Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
On swearing in in the parliament, Lahoud vowed to save the
country from economic crisis and political instability through a
dramatic administrative reform.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the cabinet decided to remove around 20 senior
civil servants from their posts in an attempt to invigorate
performance, stop financial squandering, and check corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, the move sparked an outcry from the opposition
spearheaded by former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and his
political partner Walid Jumblat, a minister in Hariri's government.
</P>
<P>
Hariri accused the government of seeking "political revenge
and grudges," saying the campaign was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Among those fired on charges of mismanagement, seven are
believed to be close to Hariri, who had upheld premiership since
1992, in the aftermath of the country's 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud defended the government measures, saying the officials
were dismissed according to reports issued by the Civil Service
Council and inspection bodies.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that the government is expected to announce
a new round of dismissals at the weekly cabinet session on
Wednesday which will also include another of Hariri's allies.

<HEADLINE> Visa Restrictions Barrier Between EU, HK: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Current visa restrictions
continue to act as a burdensome barrier to business between Europe
and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the
European Union (EU) said in its first annual report published here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
By July this year, 49 countries were giving Hong Kong visa-free
access, of which just the Britain and Ireland are within the EU,
while Hong Kong granted visa-free access to 170 countries and
territories, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, has also
noticed that the local business community, as well as European
companies operating in the SAR, have expressed strong desire to
see free business travel available between Hong Kong and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU holds that there is a strong case to be made
for giving Hong Kong more generous treatment, noting the Chinese
territory's determination to operate a secure and efficient
immigration and passport control system in Hong Kong. However, the
report said the existing procedures are perceived as costly,
burdensome and unfriendly to business.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR has the authority to issue passport and other travel
documents, as well as applying its own immigration controls. While
the commission has no direct responsibility for visas, it strongly
supports Hong Kong's efforts to secure visa-free access to the EU.
The SAR government continues to see this as the most important
issue in the territorty's relations with Europe," the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the commission believes a generous attitude from 15 EU
member states would further underpin Hong Kong's status as a
separate customs territory with its own immigration policy, a key
pillar of the "one country, two systems" formula initiated by
former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Dumping Illegals in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Monday denied
dumping all illegal African aliens into Mozambique, saying set
procedures were being followed to prevent that from happening.
</P>
<P>
These procedures were approved by Mozambique, the South African
 Department of Home Affairs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
They required Mozambican immigration officials to make sure
that aliens deported from South Africa were Mozambican nationals
before being accepted.
</P>
<P>
"If the Mozambican officials determined that the alien is not
Mozambican, the alien is returned to the South African officials,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in response to allegations of Simao
Jonasse, Mozambican police commander in the border town of Ressano
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
"The South Africans continue to deport into our country
individuals of various nationalities," Jonasse said last week.
</P>
<P>
The South African Home Affairs Department said South African
and Mozambican officials held regular talks on migration issues.
</P>
<P>
"If there is or was indeed a problem, the matter will be
discussed at such a forum," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Muluzi Invites Tanzanian Businessmen to Invest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malawian
President Bakili Muluzi Monday invited Tanzanian business people
to invest in his country and promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that your investment in Malawi would be safe
and profitable," Muluzi said while addressing the business
communities of the two countries at the Sheraton Hotel in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malawian government will create a conducive
environment for Tanzanian businessmen, like providing loans to
them and fighting against the evil of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi, himself a businessman before he was elected the
president of Malawi in 1994, said the two countries should set up
cross-border fairs, and intensify cooperation in transport,
telecommunications, energy, tourism and agriculture sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian president said African countries should strengthen
economic cooperation through organizations like Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC), especially when trade globalization
becomes a trend. He cited the example of the launching of Euro
currency.
</P>
<P>
"We should work together, otherwise we will be left out," he
said, stressing that African products must be of quality if they
want to be competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Malawian president visited Murzah Oil
Mills Ltd, a local edible oil company which started commercial
production in July of 1997. It is using refined palm olein
imported from Malaysia for production.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi said he is very impressed by the company, which has an
investment of eight million U.S. Dollars and a production capacity
of 30,000 metric tons of refined edible oil per annum.
</P>
<P>
Aruna Chalam, the Financial Controller of Murzah Oil Mills Ltd,
told the president his company is operating at 30 percent of full
capacity at present. Additional machinery is being installed to
facilitate the production of other soft oils like soybean and
sunflower seeds.
</P>
<P>
The company management has expressed wishes to export edible
oil to Malawi, which imports edible oil from other countries
through Dar es Salaam port.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Blames Khatami Supporters for Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian conservatives appeared
making a counter-offensive by accusing supporters of President
Mohammad Khatami of being behind the mysterious political killings
over the past months.
</P>
<P>
Rowhollah Husseinian, head of the Islamic Revolution Documents
Center where important archives are kept, claimed those involved
in killing liberal figures "were from the left-wing faction and
convinced supports of Khatami."
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was drawn from a "political point of view," he
told the evening newspaper Kayhen.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, believed to have the support of the supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and moderates led by Khatami are
embroiled in a fierce power struggle as the country's economic
situation further slid.
</P>
<P>
A number of liberal advocates and writers were murders over the
past months and Khatami ordered a thorough investigation. Last
week, the Intelligence Ministry owned up that some of its agents
were involved in the crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, Husseinian alleged that the killers were from certain
religious groups and the main culprits were Khatami's supporters.
He did not provide any evidence to support his accusation.
</P>
<P>
He said the killings were an attempt to seize the Intelligence
Ministry that has been under conservative control, and part of a
left-wing scheme to "take over organs of state power one by one."
</P>
<P>
"As I know," he said, "the opportunist left-wing forces were
planning a scenario to take over the Information (Intelligence)
Ministry" - they have indeed put several deputy ministers and
other officials in it.
</P>
<P>
He urged the intelligence minister, Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi,
to stand against the pressure and to dismiss those sent in by the
left-wing faction.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Khatami has vowed to sack Najafabadi
after the revelation of the involvement of intelligence agents in
the political killings.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Tehran Times reported Sunday that
Najafabadi decided not to quit after the supreme leader blamed
foreign hands in the murders.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei told the Friday prayers congregation that he could not
accept that those murders took place "without a foreign scenario
behind them."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Monday met behind closed doors to discuss the latest
situation in Sierra Leone as West African countries are stepping
up mediation to defuse the crisis in the West African
English-speaking country.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was briefed by the U.N. Secretariat on the
current situation in Sierra Leone, Celso Amorim, president of the
15-nation Council for the month of January, said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to consider a report on Sierra
Leone by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said that "Sierra
Leone has suffered a serious setback."
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan recommended the
extension of the mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL) for another two-month period, until March 13.
</P>
<P>
"The future of UNOMSL now appears much less clear than it did
only a matter of weeks ago," said the U.N. chief, who also intends
to reduce the number of military observers, retaining in Conakry,
capital of neighboring Guinea, a small number who would return to
Sierra Leone when conditions permit.
</P>
<P>
UNOMSIL groups 56 military observers and medical servicemen,
they were forced to leave for Guinea in the wake of the rebel
advance in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, two West African foreign ministers flew to
Freetown on Monday and had talks with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah
and commanders of a regional force battling rebels in the city,
witnesses were quoted as saying in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Amara Essy of Ivory Coast and Joseph Kokou Koffigoh of Togo
launched a fresh drive for a ceasefire six days after the rebels
captured large areas of Freetown.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Air Force Commander
Anatoly Kornukov said Monday that the efficiency of the American
and British strikes on Iraq in the Desert Fox operation was only
50 percent efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying tha:"the
Russian Defense Ministry closely followed the developments in Iraq
and analyzed all possible consequences."
</P>
<P>
"In our preliminary estimate, the efficiency of the strikes
stood at 50 percent," he said, adding that some of the strikes
were inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
The commander announced that interest in Russian defense
systems had increased after the Desert Fox operation.
</P>
<P>
"Our reconnaissance and missile complexes are not inferior to
foreign ones. The S-300 missile is no worse than the American
Patriot," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that research centers are now working on the creation
of a single command structure for the Russian strategic deterrence
forces.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov noted that Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the
commander-in-chief of the Russian armed forces, is to have the
final say on this matter.
</P>
<P>
The single strategic deterrence forces command structure is
expected to control all services possessing nuclear weapons: the
strategic rocket forces, strategic nuclear naval fleet and
strategic air forces.

<HEADLINE> UK Law Lords to Hear Pinochet Petitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Three of Britain's most senior
judges will on Wednesday hear applications from the Chilean
government to intervene in the re-hearing of the case of former
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The three law lords will also consider petitions from human
rights body's, as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch,
the House of Lords said.
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's hearing, seven law lords, who are sitting as
the country's highest court, are scheduled on January 18 to
re-hear arguments whether Pinochet is entitled to immunity from
arrest as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the law lords set aside a ruling they made in
November that Pinochet had no sovereign immunity. The former
ruling had cleared the way for the start of the 83-year-old
general's extradition proceedings to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Pinochet successfully argued that the case should
be re-heard as one of the original five judges had close links
with Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is currently living under police guard in a rented
mansion near London, awaiting the outcome of the extradition
battle in the English courts.
</P>
<P>
The retired general was arrested at a private hospital in
london on October 16 while recovering from a back surgery. A
Spanish court accused him of responsibility for the deaths and
disappearances of more than 3,000 people during his 1973-90 rule
and wanted him to be extradited to Spain to face charges.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet said last month in a london court that he would not
recognize any court outside Chile.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Tea prices in Kenya went up at
 the export auction in the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa Monday
due to worries that the current drought may seriously damage
the 1999 crop.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa-based Traders Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) said in a
news release available here that the tea market improved at the
weekly auction where main grades with brighter Best Pekoes 1s
(BP1s) and Pekoe Fannings 1s (PF1s), gaining five to 20 U.S.
cents while secondary grades rose by as much as five cents.
</P>
<P>
"Buyers are speculating that crop figures might drop because of
the current dry spells,'' said the ATB.
</P>
<P>
Tea yield in Kenya was expected to reach a new high of some 290
million kg last year but the dry weather in the just-ended short
rains season has cast a deep shadow over the 1999 harvest.
</P>
<P>
"What we need are sustained showers (to improve the tea
production),'' said Richard Surrey of the trade group Tea
Brokers Association of East Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the Monday day auction, Best BP1s traded at 2.37-2.44
Dollars per kg while PF1s were posted at 2.25-2.35 Dollars per kg
compared to 2.32-2.50 Dollars per kg and 2.10-2.21 Dollars per kg
respectively last week.

ATB said Egypt and Pakistan continued to lend strong support
while Britain bought selectively in line with quality.

<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid expressed surprise Monday at the latest
statements made by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
concerning Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Abdel-Meguid regretted that Aziz made
the statement, which he said would "likely (have) negative impact
on" the upcoming Arab foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Al Thawrah newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath
party, on Sunday quoted Aziz as claiming that Kuwait is "part of
Iraq since ancient time." This showed an about-face on Iraq's 1994
recognition of the current Iraqi-Kuwaiti border.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that such statements would not have been made
at this particular time," Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Cairo-based Arab organization criticized
Aziz's statement as being "not conducive to creating the
atmosphere needed to boost understanding."
</P>
<P>
Arab countries originally decided to hold a foreign ministers'
meeting last month to discuss a Yemeni call for an Arab summit on
the latest developments of the Iraqi issue after the military

NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Troops backing Congo (K)'s
President Laurent Kabila have air-raided the rebel-held Kisangani
in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), claiming some
40 lives, a media report quoted aid workers in the country as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bombing reportedly broke out Sunday night, leading to the
general close-down of markets and shops Monday in the third
largest city in the DRC, said aid workers.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the allied forces from Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad
and Namibia shoring up Kabila's army confirmed the bombing in
capital Kinshasa Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he has given no details.
</P>
<P>
"It's true Kisangani was bombed last night,'' he was quoted by
the report reaching here as saying. Kisangani is the most
important town held by rebels since the civil war in DRC erupted
in August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The aid workers, quoting their contacts in the jungle city,
said that the bombs fell close to a former residence of
guerrilla commander Jean- Pierre Ondekane who had reportedly moved
out of the house two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the DRC government also announced that loyalist
forces had retaken two rebel-held towns in the north.

"The FAC (Congolese army) and allies have just liberated Gemena

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Troops Recapture State House in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG has successfully taken control of the State House in
Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) headquarters in Nigerian capital Abuja Monday said
that its peace- keeping troops had driven rebels from the State
House near the center of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are now being pushed out of Freetown following
reinforcement by ECOMOG" during the past several days, it said,
adding that "efforts are being made to flush the rebels out of
private residences in Freetown where some of them are still taking
refuge."
</P>
<P>
In an interview through telephone, ECOWAS Secretary-General
Lansana Kouyate said in Abuja that "as I speak to you now, I can
confirm the State House is under ECOMOG control."
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebels were now in disarray with some of them
fleeing into the bush and others hiding among the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretary-general pointed out that ECOWAS remained
 committed to its two pronged approaches of diplomacy and military
action to resolve the Sierra Leonean crisis.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the foreign ministers of Togo, current ECOWAS
chairman, and Cote d'Ivoire were already in Sierra Leone to follow
up on the negotiations begun last week by President Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah and the jailed leader of the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Kouyate will travel to Lome Tuesday
to meet Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current ECOWAS
Chairman, for emergency talks on the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It noted that "consultations are currently going on between
ECOWAS heads of state and parties to the conflict with a view to
convening a dialogue meeting as soon as possible on the crisis".
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, several hundreds of Nigerian soldiers
have been sent to Sierra Leone to reinforce the 15,000 ECOMOG
troops which have been battling for the control of the capital
city with the rebels since last Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to Send More F-16 to Southern No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States plans to
send eight more F-16 warplanes to further enforce the southern
no-fly zone in Iraq, a U.S. defense spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The eight additional jet fighters, which are specially adapted
to carry sophisticated missiles to destroy anti-aircraft radars,
would also be joined by four more aerial refueling tankers, said
Major Joe LaMarca, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command in
Tampa, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The additional F-16 warplanes would bring the total number of
U.S. aircraft patrolling the southern zone to 193.
</P>
<P>
The air reinforcements coincide with an increase in tension
between Iraq and U.S.-British forces patrolling the Iraqi northern
and southern no-fly zones, imposed after the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, two incidents happened over the northern
no-fly zone when U.S. patrolling planes fired missiles at two
Iraqi air defense sites after determining they were about to be
attacked by surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
In the one case, two U.S. F-15E strike aircraft on routing
patrol were illuminated by radar from an Iraqi surface-to-air
missile installation, and the U.S. strike aircraft fired two
AGM-130 air-to-surface missiles in response.
</P>
<P>
In the other case, an American F-16 fired one anti-radar
missile after being targeted by Iraqi radar at a separate air
defense installation near Mosul.
</P>
<P>
"The illumination of an aircraft is certainly a hostile act,
requiring the U.S. pilots to response," a Pentagon spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Egypt, Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will travel to Saudi Arabia and Egypt later
this month for talks on Iraq and the Middle East peace process,
the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"She will consult with two of our closest allies in the region
on matters of mutual interest. Clearly Iraq and the Middle East
peace process will be on the agenda," spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Albright will make the visits after a trip to Moscow ending
Jan. 27. She will probably stay the night in one of the Arab
capitals, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Saudi Arabia are the most influential Arab states and
are likely to determine any common Arab position on how to deal
with Iraq after the departure of U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Both criticized Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's call last week
for the overthrow of Arab rulers who did not prevent the U.S. and
British air strikes against Iraqi targets in December.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit will come shortly after a meeting of Arab
foreign ministers, due to take place in Cairo on Jan. 24.

<HEADLINE> Butler Says UNSCOM Not Dead and He Will Not Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler said Monday that U.N. weapons inspections would not
be dead and he would not resign.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on arms non-proliferation, Butler
said, "UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) was not dead." He
predicted there might be a compromise in the U.N. Security Council
of future inspection operations in Iraq, which were halted after
four-day bombing raids against Iraqi targets by U.S. and British
missiles.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the Security Council would
maintain the organization although some changes might be required.
</P>
<P>
"I think the international community remains determined to
preserve the non-proliferation objectives (of the UNSCOM) and get
the job done with Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked after the conference, sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace if he would resign, Butler replied,
"Absolutely not."
</P>
<P>
Pressure has mounted on Butler to resign after allegations were
published last week that the UNSCOM acted as spies for the United
States. Russia has urged him to quit and France called for a new
weapons monitoring organization.
</P>
<P>
Butler repeated his denial that the UNSCOM had been used as a
spy instrument, saying: "UNSCOM has not been used as a spy
organization."

<HEADLINE> British PM Says Britain, France Discuss Way Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that Britain is discussing with France and other
U.N. Security Council members ways for going out of the Iraqi
crisis other than military strikes.
</P>
<P>
In an article contributed to the French left-leaning daily
Liberation, Blair said that Britain and the United States were not
seeking to play the role of world policeman by staging the "Desert
Fox" operation, but because it was right to do so.
</P>
<P>
"We are holding talks with France and other members of the
(U.N.) Security Council to find a formula allowing checks and
monitoring to resume in Iraq, but under a system that would avoid
the inspectors' presence creating crises from time to time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain would make proposals on improving the
situation of humanitarian supply to Iraq through the "Oil for
Food" program and on increasing medicine supply to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While saying that Britain and the United States will stage new
strikes if Iraq continues to attack British and American warplanes
above the no-fly zones, he said that one should not be stuck in
the "vicious circle of military strikes."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq can very well choose another way out," he said, adding
that once U.N. arms inspectors return to Iraq, the Iraqi
government should show "good will" by allowing them to look for
the missing chemical and biological arms.
</P>
<P>
Blair also said that those who think that Saddam Hussein would
cooperate better if sanctions were lifted are "covering their own
eyes."
</P>
<P>
France has proposed lifting the oil embargo on Iraq while
maintaining a new surveillance mechanism in Iraq to make sure that
Iraq would not become militarily dangerous again.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine discussed the proposal
with his British counterpart Robin Cook last Friday in Paris, and
he will discuss it with his Russian and Chinese counterparts this
week, according to diplomatic sources.
