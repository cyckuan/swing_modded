WOMAN UNINFECTED WITH HIV LOSS SUIT OVER ERRONEOUS DIAGNOSIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth tar-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Denton woman who spent three years
believing she had HIV is not entitled to monetary damages from the
physicians and medical laboratory involved in testing, diagnosing
and treating her for the disease, a Tarrant County jury concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors voted 11-1 in rejecting the negligence claims brought by
Khristol Watson, 29, against Dr. Muddamalle Augustine of Arlington,
Texas, Drs. Steven Sotman and Daniel Barbaro of Fort Worth, Texas,
and National Psychopharmacology Laboratories, a now-defunct
Tennessee company.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who was found to be HIV-positive in 1991, sued the
physicians and lab after discovering in 1994 that she is, in fact,
HIV-negative. She said she underwent a hysterectomy in 1993 largely
because she believed she was infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys had asked for damages up to $38 million for pain
and suffering, lost earnings, medical expenses and mental anguish,
including Watson's distress at knowing she can no longer bear
children.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict Friday, which ended a four-week trial, came on the
third day of jury deliberations in 348th District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm devastated,'' Watson said shortly after the result was
announced. ``I've lost all my faith in the judicial system. It's
not the money; it's the principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected them to say something wrong happened because
something very wrong happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Watson suggested that she won't pursue appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to go on. I've got some healing to do, but it's just
time to go on. How, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the doctors phoned their clients immediately after
the verdict was read. They said the physicians are pleased with the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Dussault, attorney for National Psychopharmacology
Laboratories, said it was clear that jurors ``took this very
seriously and looked at all the evidence.'' Randy Hall, who
represented Sotman and Barbaro, said he hopes Watson ``gets her
life together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can make a difference,'' Hall said. ``She can
still go out and talk to young people and say, `Don't do what I
did.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The trial brought out details about Watson's past drug use and
emotional problems, and her attorneys played for jurors a film her
brother made about their family's coping with her substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   While Watson believed she carried the AIDS virus, she spoke to
students, jail inmates and others about AIDS and the
life-threatening dangers of risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors interviewed after the trial said they did not
focus on Watson's past in determining whether any of the defendants
could be faulted for negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the fact that there was no evidence to prove'' the
allegations, said juror Cedric Kindred, 25, of Fort Worth, a
7-Eleven employee.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding juror David Beck, 36, said the panel members ``all
agreed basically there was an error. We couldn't determine where''
it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had discussions about yes, there was an error; yes, this
woman's been through hell,'' said Beck, an investment banker with
Signal Securities in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get to the monetary part of this ... until we knew
where the problem was. Once we realized we couldn't figure out
where the error is, we couldn't go any further,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have pinpointed where the error is, we would have
stuck it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Augustine diagnosed the AIDS virus for Watson in September 1991
based on a positive HIV test after she checked into Willow Creek
Hospital in Arlington for depression and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's suit said that her blood sample was switched or
contaminated during the process, between being drawn at Willow
Creek and tested in Tennessee and California. But the trial did not
show conclusively what happened that led to her receiving a
positive test report.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Watson's attorneys argued that Augustine
wrongly assessed her HIV status since she had no telltale symptoms.
They said Sotman and Barbaro provided substandard medical care
because they did not retest Watson or question the diagnosis even
though she never developed key signs of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Sotman and then Barbaro, both infectious disease specialists,
monitored Watson between 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys countered that the physicians acted reasonably
based on what they knew. The lawyers also argued that Watson would
have had the hysterectomy anyway because of problems with
endometriosis and ovarian cysts.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Albert Kirkpatrick, 40, of the Fort Worth suburb of
Watauga, the only dissenter, said he drew a conclusion different
from the other jurors after looking at all the evidence.
Kirkpatrick, an American Airlines facility maintenance mechanic,
also said he was swayed by Watson's expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could just look at it in blinders and look at what we
were given with the evidence, then that was the way I had to
vote,'' he said.

BULLS CRUSH JAZZ IN GAME 3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ron Harper woke up on Sunday morning and felt
refreshed when he looked out his window. No Wasatch Mountains meant
no game at the Delta Center. No derisive chants or tasteless signs
from annoying Jazz fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up and just started saying, `Ain't no place like home,
ain't no place home,''' Harper, a Chicago Bulls guard, said. ``It
was like the bad dream was over.''
</P>
<P>
   It began for another team in Game 3 of the National Basketball
Association finals on Sunday night. Karl Malone and John Stockton
also were not in Utah anymore. If that was not made clear by the
nonchalant way Michael Jordan's team converted dunks and
3-pointers, it was evident in the surreal margin of victory on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls 96, Jazz 54. Tension and drama, 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat embarrassed for NBA basketball for the guys to
come out and play at this level, with no more fight left in them
than they had,'' Jerry Sloan, the Jazz coach, said after Utah
scored the fewest points by one NBA team in any game since the
inception of the 24-second shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a 2-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series, Chicago
ran the Jazz off its home floor after splitting two games in Salt
Lake City last week. With victories here in Games 4 and 5, the
Bulls could claim their sixth title in eight years without going
back to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz? Against the smothering defense of Harper, Jordan and
Scottie Pippen, Stockton and Malone executed the
pick-and-roll-over. They combined for 12 turnovers, and they did
not play in the fourth quarter as the Bulls ran up the score and
began laughing and high-fiving on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The closest a team had come to looking this futile was when
Indiana scored 55 points against San Antonio in a regular-season
game last March 29. In the playoffs, teams had scored as few as 64
points four times.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they were embarrassed, Stockton spoke for his teammate
Malone when he said: ``I don't even know that we have to answer
that one. I think it's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah committed 26 turnovers and was outrebounded, 50-38. It was
down by 18 points at halftime and trailed by 72-45 after three
quarters. Toni Kukoc (16 points, 6 rebounds and 4 steals) and
Pippen (10 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists) were the perfect
complements to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   They moved in synchronization, each player finding a seam or
angle to the rim. Yes, Jordan scored more points than anyone else,
24. But he invariably does that. To elevate his contributions above
those of his teammates would not do justice to the symphony the
Bulls were playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls played like the team the Jazz used to be: patient,
poised and potent with the ball in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz also set futility marks for the largest loss in a
finals game, surpassing Washington's 35-point blowout of Seattle in
1978, and for the fewest number of field goals in a game (21) and
points in a half (23).
</P>
<P>
   Stockton has not been a factor the past two games. With Harper's
flailing arms and Pippen's ability to move his feet quicker than
the Utah point guard can dribble, he could not get the Jazz offense
kick-started.
</P>
<P>
   And Malone was feeling the pangs of competing against the player
he beat out for last year's most valuable player award. With the
majority of the United Center chanting ``M-V-P! M-V-P!'', Jordan,
this year's mvp, made two free throws to send the Bulls into the
final quarter with nary a worry.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the third quarter was a carbon copy of the first
half, with Harper and Scott Burrell throwing down dunks as the
Bulls bounded out to a 72-45 lead. The building was electric, loud
enough to make you wonder if the Jazz didn't feel like the
tomato-can opponent in a heavyweight title fight instead of the
worthy contender that deserved to be here.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, who implied after Game 2 that his team was a bunch of
softies, called a timeout and looked at his players as if he did
not know them. The team that took care of Shaquille O'Neal's Lakers
in four straight games to win the Western Conference championship
had been reduced to the Denver Nuggets playing here in January.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan tried everything. He inserted Greg Ostertag into the
starting lineup for Greg Foster. He implored his reserves to shake
things up and be active when they went into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually the score?'' Sloan deadpanned after he was
handed a final stat sheet. ``This is the final. I thought it was
196-54. Seems like they scored 196 points.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling mightily from the field in the first two games,
Malone got out of the gate quick. He made his first six shots _ 12
of Utah's 14 first-quarter points _ and helped the Jazz ease the
transition into a hostile arena.
</P>
<P>
   But his teammates offered no help early. Only two other Jazz
players had field goals through the first 15 minutes. If it wasn't
careless turnovers, the best-executing team in the game was given
the guillotine by Chicago's menacing defense.
</P>
<P>
   The travel time and lack of rest from playing 48 hours earlier
was supposed to account for sloppy play on both ends, but the Bulls
looked more precise and poised than they had since the finals
began.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if they had used the first two games to collect
themselves, to remember what it was like to be in control of a
series and not give ground to a challenger. Maybe it was Pippen
still trying to fool with Malone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has boasted before about his team's prowess. But never
before has he made such a brash prediction as the one he made as he
was leaving the Delta Center in Salt Lake City on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not coming back,'' Pippen said to the national cable
audience. ``Get ready for the WNBA season.''

JEAN TOWER RENNIE, 84, FOUNDED COLLATERAL DAMES

<P>
   Jean Tower Rennie, the founder of the Collateral Dames, one of
the first women's investment clubs in the United States, died on
May 31 at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84. The cause was
heart failure, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rennie was born in Milwaukee on Feb. 3, 1914, the daughter
of Edwin Tower and Bessie Applegate Tower. Her mother's family was
instrumental in the founding of Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rennie attended the Downer Seminary in Milwaukee
and &UR;  &LR; Collegiate School in Louisville and graduated from Vassar
College in 1935. Although she had no formal training in finance,
Mrs. Rennie's lifelong interest in the stock market led to the
organization of the Collateral Dames in 1957. In the 15 years of
its existence, the club attracted chief executive officers and
economists to Milwaukee as speakers. Club members also spent a week
in New York, at the invitation of the New York Stock Exchange and
several leading companies.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rennie and her husband, William Roxburgh Rennie, a
manufacturers representative, were married in 1940. They were
active supporters of the English Speaking Union, an organization
that promotes relations between the United States and Britain, and
after her husband's death in 1985, Mrs. Rennie succeeded him on the
board of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include a son, Roxburgh Rennie of Providence, R.I.; a
daughter, Missie Rennie Taylor of Manhattan, and five
grandchildren. &QL;

   Samuel Jackson Lanahan, an authority on tax law who was a Golden
Glove eastern division champion in 1940, died on May 29, after
suffering a pulmonary embolism at his vacation home in Dartmouth,
England. He was 79 and lived in Trappe, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Lanahan was a founding partner, in 1954, of Clark &AMP; Lanahan, a
law firm in Washington that merged with Wilmer &AMP; Broun and, in
1962, joined other firms to become Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering. He
was a partner for 19 years and head of the London office for three
years. He retired in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Lanahan was born in Baltimore on Nov. 11, 1918, attended St.
Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and graduated from Princeton
University in 1941. In World War II, he was a navigator in the
Navy. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He married Frances Scott Fitzgerald, the daughter of F. Scott
Fitzgerald, in 1943. They were divorced in 1968, and he later
married Sheila Nevius. He is survived by his wife; a son, Samuel,
of Corvallis, Ore.; two daughters, Eleanor Anne Lanahan of
Burlington, Vt., and Cecilia Lanahan Ross of Kennett Square, Pa.;
two stepchildren, Theodore Nevius of Washington and Katherine
Nevius of Arlington, Va.; a brother, William Wallace Lanahan Jr. of
Baltimore; his stepmother, Eleanor Addison Miles of Queenstown,
Md., and eight grandchildren.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A BREAKDOWN IN THE BACKSTRETCH FOR THE JAZZX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Indulge me while I clear out the Belmont Stakes
residue, but I do not see Michael Jordan and the Bulls fading in
the homestretch with another Triple Crown now in sight.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the trailer has to believe it has the ability to
catch up, but from the sight of the Utah Jazz in the second half
here on Sunday night, what we appear to have on our hands is a
pre-race favorite running without faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz did not quit Game 3 of the National Basketball
Association finals. They were dismissed from it. The only mail
delivered was the game itself, post-marked by the Jazz, Salt Lake
City. Just when people were forecasting photo finishes between
teams rated evenly matched, the Bulls wiped the Jazz out of the
picture, winning by 96-54 and taking a 2-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually the score?'' Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said when
he was handed a box score. He imagined it was worse. ``Seemed like
they scored 196.'' The Jazz could have been suffering the effects
of having their grand design for this series ruined by their Game 2
loss at home Friday night. All the more reason why this team needed
to be nostril-to-nostril with the Bulls on Sunday night. They went
face down on the United Center floor instead, losing the most
lopsided finals game ever and fueling the notion that, deep in
their wholesome souls, they don't believe they can beat Jordan and
his ferocious will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we could win last year, but to say we don't
this year would be wrong,'' Jeff Hornacek argued. Given 30 percent
shooting, 26 turnovers, and the equaling of the record for fewest
points in any NBA game with a shot clock, this sounded much like
the Jazz's rhetoric about the wayward Karl Malone shots that cost
Utah its home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Same shots he always takes, the Jazz say. Same ones he always
makes. The problem with that rationale is that it fails to
acknowledge the psychological component of trying to wrest the
crown off Jordan's head. This is not the typical opponent. This is
not the normal setting. This is not the ordinary challenge, and
that not only goes for Malone but for the entire Utah team.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of its best player, from the time Malone has been
playing basketball on the national level, he has been the
quintessential outsider, the muscular kid from a college, Louisiana
Tech, best known for its women's teams. As a pro, he has been
looked at by many of his peers as the Brother From Another Planet.
The African-American superstar who revels in the whitest of all NBA
markets, the big country biker and trucker who wouldn't be caught
dead dropping off a Mercedes with the trendy valet.
</P>
<P>
   Mailman Malone stands alone, unless he is communing with John
Stockton on the pick-and-roll. That has been his message, and he
has delivered his share of politically incorrect diatribes, on
subjects ranging from Magic Johnson's popular return in 1992 (he
thought it wasn't a good idea) to the league's formerly hailed drug
policy (he thought it wasn't getting the job done). But these last
two springs, finally making it to the finals and the league's
premier stage, Malone has found himself face-to-face with the
ultimate establishment icon. It has become immeasurably difficult
to have his say in the face of true greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the man the Jazz must follow to win, tried on Sunday
night to make a statement, clearing his throat by hitting his first
six shots. He scored 12 first-quarter points, but when he looked up
at the scoreboard, the Jazz had 14 and were trailing by 3.
</P>
<P>
   This raised another sobering issue: the Bulls' ability to
control Stockton's dribble penetration with their long-limbed
defenders. Stockton is not as quick as he used to be, and this
becomes much more noticeable against a tough-minded Eastern
Conference team with a big, physical presence like Ron Harper than
it does against those sprouts-and-tomato defenders out West. Elvis'
team contests the kings of pick-and-roll a bit better than the
Lakers did, and Malone pays the price on the back end.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six minutes of the second quarter, the Jazz's
offense devolved into the Knicks'. Malone became quiet after Dennis
Rodman relieved Luc Longley. In one embarrassing run of wasted
possessions, Malone ran over Scottie Pippen on the break, Bryon
Russell turned a simple and uncontested inbounds pass to Stockton
into a backcourt violation, Stockton lost the ball deep in the
lane, Malone traveled in the post, then he threw up an air ball off
a runner in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture? Jordan and Toni Kukoc did, immediately abusing
their men off the dribble, rocketing the lead to 18 by the half and
creating visions of another trophy ceremony by late Friday night.
When Kukoc penetrates the way he did on Sunday night, forget it,
Chicago's panting sportswriters may as well begin the campaign to
keep this group together another five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a game like this can't get you motivated, nothing else
will,'' Malone said after a second half that sank below the level
of embarrassment, all the way to disgrace, resulting in a pile of
soiled towels greeting the news media when the door to the Jazz
locker room was opened.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton most ominously finished with more turnovers (5) than
points (2). There were uncontested Chicago dunks. Jordan and Pippen
rested on the bench with impish smiles that gave way to raucous
laughter. The Bulls were cruising, in control of the series, ahead
in the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   What we know is that these guys have never been caught from
behind.

CANCELLATIONS REVEAL SHORTCOMINGS OF MEDICAL SCREENINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A great deal about the ill-fated Evander
Holyfield-Henry Akinwande card is bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   A major event had to be canceled the day before it was scheduled
to take place. Two fighters (Akinwande and Ray Mercer) tested
positive for hepatitis B. Maria Nieves-Garcia couldn't fight
because she's 21 months pregnant. And Roberto Duran had his purse
garnished in a child-support case.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, however, two questions stand out:
</P>
<P>
   One, why isn't medical testing done well in advance of major
fights to avoid last-minute cancellations? Didn't we learn anything
from the scheduled Tommy Morrison-Arthur Weathers fight in 1996,
which was canceled the day of the event when Morrison tested
positive for the virus that causes AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   And, two, why is testing for hepatitis B done only in a reported
four states?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the time and money lost as a result of the
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Akinwande (who were to make $10 million and $2.5
million, respectively), the promoters, Showtime, cable distributors
and many more stand to lose a fortune because of an ill-advised
policy on testing. (And that doesn't take into account fans who
made travel plans and purchased tickets, for which they presumably
will get refunds.)
</P>
<P>
   New York, where the fight was scheduled to be held Saturday,
requires that test results be submitted a minimum of five days
before the fight. (California requires a test for hepatitis B 30
days before licensing but requires testing only once a year.)
</P>
<P>
   And that, according toe
New York State Athletic Commission, is ``only a request.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't enforce it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? To protect everyone involved, athletic commissions
across the nation should require that test results be submitted a
month before !ital!major!off! fights or no license. Simple as that.
If that means a foreign fighter must fly into the United States
solely to take the test, so be it. Again, it would serve everyone _
including that fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, this wouldn't work with many smaller cards, for which
last-minute replacements are the norm.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Holyfield-Akinwande fight was made months ago. Even
without appropriate policies, the fighters could've _ should've! _
had their tests in long ago. Holyfield's were submitted weeks ago,
Petrillo said, while Akinwande (who fights out of Orlando, Fla.)
was tested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To protect themselves, it boggles the mind that fighters
wouldn't make testing a high priority. That much is clear to
Holyfield, who said, ``I find it kind of strange that they wait
until the last minute for testing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about title fights like this, there's no
reason you can't get it done well ahead of time,'' said Paul
Wallace, co-chair of the medical advisory board for the California
State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree. It's absolutely absurd it wasn't done several months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrillo said New York officials will ``sure have discussions
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   All states should. This really isn't that complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of testing for hepatitis B itself isn't complicated,
either. It is vital, though.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is far more infectious than HIV, Wallace said, ``It
just doesn't have the notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   In Akinwande's case, the disease was at the infectious stage,
according to a doctor who studied the fighter's blood sample.
Without testing, it seems, Holyfield would've been at risk. At the
same time, all those who have worked closely with Akinwande _
including sparring partners _ !ital!were!off! at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most states do not test for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Nevada, the world's boxing capital, is among them,
although Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State
Athletic Commission, said his state is discussing its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   The day the card was canceled, Jean-Christophe Courreges,
Akinwande's French manager, said, ``Anywhere else in the world, he
would be fighting. They don't test for this anywhere else (outside
the U.S.).''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if the powers that be are smart, they will after this. And
that includes California, which might want to test more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public policy is not based necessarily on fact but on things
the media puts out,'' Wallace said. ``If a major star or public
figure ends up with hepatitis B, I would think we would see some
focus on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public health often suffers until there's some kind of
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's avoid tragedy this time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward: Oscar De La Hoya, who defends his WBC
welterweight title against unknown Frenchman Patrick Charpentier on
Saturday in El Paso, Texas, reiterated his desire to fight Felix
Trinidad in what would be an attractive non-heavyweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, his promoter, said he met with Trinidad's handlers last
week. However, these are the early stages of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he made a ``crazily high offer'' to Trinidad, more
than $5 million, but Trinidad's people have not accepted. They said
they would consider it and get back to Arum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good meeting and they left on a good note,'' Arum
said. ``Oscar wants that fight. And we feel it's a very winnable
fight because of Trinidad's (aggressive) style. So we'd love to do
it, and I think we eventually will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he might be willing to guarantee Trinidad more money
than De La Hoya, but De La Hoya would get a percentage of the
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I had this situation was with (Ray) Leonard when
he fought (Marvin) Hagler,'' Arum said. ``Leonard took a straight
buyout, Hagler fought on a percentage and Hagler made 1{ times what
Leonard made.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad claims he no longer is under contract to promoter Don
King, but Arum said that's not so clear, which complicates
negotiations but isn't necessarily an insurmountable obstacle.

HELEN CARTER, 70, COUNTRY SINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Va.)  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helen Carter, a singer and musician who was part of the Carter
family dynasty of country-music entertainers, died on Tuesday at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. She was 70
and lived in Dickson, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   She had been hospitalized for gastrointestinal problems that
began over a year ago, said Kelly Hancock of House of Cash, the
business office of Johnny Cash, Mrs. Carter's brother-in-law, and
of her sister June Carter Cash.
</P>
<P>
   The original Carter Family band, which helped kick-start the
country-music record industry in 1927, was begun by A.P. Carter, a
railroad worker and farmer from Maces Springs, Va.; his wife, Sara,
and Sara's cousin, Maybelle. The band grew with the occasional
addition of Maybelle's children, including Helen.
</P>
<P>
   The family band lasted from 1927 to 1943, and it was of
inestimable importance to American music.
</P>
<P>
   It disseminated traditional songs, established a widely imitated
small-group sound and built a set of templates that country,
bluegrass and folk musicians would draw upon _ the mountain hymn,
the love ballad, the cowboy tune and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943 Sara quit singing for good, and Maybelle started a new
band, Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, with her daughters as
permanent members.
</P>
<P>
   Helen was 12 when she was introduced to the world over the
airwaves of XET in Monterrey, Mexico, and in her teen-age years
became the most dependable musician of her mother's band, playing
accordion, guitar and autoharp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a successful band, featured on ``The Old Dominion Barn
Dance,'' a radio show based in Richmond, Va., in 1946; later it
moved to the ``Tennessee Barn Dance'' on Knoxville's WNOX. In 1950
the band joined the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville, and did
some recording as a trio for Columbia records.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Carter was a songwriter as well, writing ``Poor Old
Heartsick Me,'' a hit for the singer Margie Bowes in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, she often appeared on radio and
television not as a member of a working group but simply as a
member of the famous clan. For example, she appeared on television
with her sister June and Cash.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her sister June, of Hendersonville, Va., she is
survived by her husband, Glenn Jones of Dickson, Tenn.; another
sister, Anita Carter of Goodlettsville, Tenn.; three sons, Glenn
Daniel, David Lawrence and Kevin Carter Jones, all of Dickson, and
six grandchildren.

USGA is ready to go to war
<TEXT>
<P>
   Governing body wants to bomb high-tech clubs back to Stone Age
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The United States Golf Association is about to declare war on
high-tech golf as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA, which along with the Royal &AMP; Ancient is the official
rules-making body for all of golf, has decided the new, space-age
equipment on the market today threatens the integrity of the game.
And the USGA is determined to do something about it, targeting such
products as titanium drivers and long putters.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots in the skirmish were fired three weeks ago. The
USGA found itself in the center of a heated controversy when its
newest president, F. Morgan ``Buzz'' Taylor, said in his inaugural
address that he was concerned that the new ``superb athletes'' in
the game, in conjunction with the latest in equipment, had the
potential to make many of golf's historic venues obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview with Golf World Magazine, Taylor said it
in plainer terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our franchise is to preserve and protect the game's ancient
and honorable traditions,'' he said. ``I intend to do that, and
there's not one lawyer in the world who is going to get in our way
of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting words, to be sure. But what do they mean? No official
proposal has been released, but the word is out that the USGA is
studying a number of changes in equipment rules, including a
crackdown on titanium drivers, setting a limit for lofts in irons,
banning long putters, limiting the lengths of shafts, and reducing
the maximum number of clubs allowed in a bag from 14 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Most insiders think the focus will be on the ``trampoline
effect'' the USGA believes exists in some thin-walled titanium
drivers. The current Rules of Golf make it clear that the
``material and construction of the (club) face shall not have the
effect of a spring.'' The USGA contends this is what some of the
most popular drivers have.
</P>
<P>
   USGA officials also have hinted they will have a significant
announcement on the proposal as early as the U.S. Open, which will
be June 18-21 at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. No official
decision to change the Rules of Golf could be made until the USGA
and the R&AMP;A meet for the Quadrennial Rules Conference in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the major golf manufacturers have responded
swiftly and angrily. Callaway Golf, makers of the Great Big Bertha
and Greatest Big Bertha titanium drivers, which would be on the
USGA's extinction list if the rules were adopted, issued a 3{-page
news release announcing it would join with other companies in
opposing any such USGA rulings banning modern clubs. In addition,
Callaway bought full-page ads in the New York Times, USA Today and
Golf World to present its position.
</P>
<P>
   But while the USGA is threatening and the manufacturing world is
reeling, the one organization that would be most affected if all
the new changes were adopted is taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend hackers who dished out $500 a pop for a Big Bertha
driver might be disappointed if their weapon of choice is taboo.
But those golfers trying to make a living using the same driver on
the PGA Tour have considerably more to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour is its own organization, separate from the USGA,
but it follows the rules as set down by the USGA. And PGA Tour
officials don't see that changing in the future, regardless of
which way the USGA rules on the equipment issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an equipment advisory committee, a standing committee,
that serves as our liaison with the USGA technical department,''
said Bob Combs, PGA Tour senior vice president of public relations
and communications. ``We're aware of the ongoing research being
done by the USGA, but there's been no release of data yet. So we're
just watching to see what the USGA's conclusions are and what the
data shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet regardless of the decision, the outcome is almost a foregone
conclusion. Tour officials stressed that ``we play under USGA
rules.'' There are guidelines that allow the PGA Tour to modify a
USGA rule, but those guidelines are rarely, if ever, evoked.
Modifying a rule set down by the USGA would only be done in what
one tour official termed an ``extreme'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fundamental thing is that there are just one set of
rules for both pros and amateurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, any sweeping changes in equipment rules made by
the USGA for their own competitions would also affect the events on
the PGA Tour as well. The pros could kiss their titanium drivers,
long putters and perimeter-weighted irons goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Some PGA Tour pros, such as The Woodlands Jeff Maggert, find it
a little hard to believe the USGA would go to such lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know if they would do it or not,'' Maggert said.
``The manufacturers would certainly go nuts. And there are
certainly a lot of guys out here using titanium drivers. Who knows
what they are thinking? But I think they must also realize that
golfers today are just better athletes, just like in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so long ago that no one could run a 4-minute mile.
Now it's done all the time. The track is still the same distance.
So what now? Make them run in combat boots to slow them down?''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert agreed technology has come a long way in recent years.
But in his mind, the length of the putter and the type of the
driver make less of a difference than the size and condition of the
athlete using it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to go back to what it was like 30 years ago, then
don't forget the lousy fairways, lousy bunkers, lousy greens,''
Maggert said. ``They forget some of the things that made the game
so difficult back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his disapproval of the USGA's proposals, Maggert
remained firm in his belief that if the USGA changes the rules, for
better or worse, the PGA Tour needs to follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the best interest for everyone to follow one set of
rules,'' he said. ``That's the whole point of golf. Everyone plays
by the same rules, plays the same game, whether a 35-handicapper or
a touring pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Now only time will tell under what rules the game will be
played.

ANGELS LOOK LOCALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK HIPES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At first glance, when the Anaheim Angels took USC
ace Seth Etherton with the 18th pick in last week's Major League
Baseball amateur draft, it was a bit shocking.
</P>
<P>
   True, by the end of USC's national-championship run, Etherton
was considered one of college baseball's most polished pitchers.
After he beat defending national champion Louisiana State on
Thursday in a must-win game in Omaha, Neb., he was 13-3 with an ERA
hovering around 3.00 and 182 strikeouts, a Pacific-10 single-season
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could pitch in Double-A right now, today,'' Trojans coach
Mike Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Angels taking a senior with little bargaining power
so high in the draft was surprising. It will give Etherton and
adviser Craig Landis an extra leg to stand on when negotiations get
under way. A closer look, however, reveals the Angels' motivations
are not totally without foundation. Etherton was burned in contract
negotiations a year ago after St. Louis made him a ninth-round pick
and he is eager to navigate an easier path this time around. It
will be easier knowing it takes less than a half-hour to get from
Edison Field to his parents' home in Dana Point, where he was
reared on Angels baseball.
</P>
<P>
   As important is the Troy Glaus phenomenon. The Angels' first
pick a year ago held out all summer long, missing out on a full
minor-league season. Some think it cost him a spot on the big club
this season. Etherton will be much easier to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make a lot of sense to get him started as soon as
possible,'' Angels director of scouting Bob Fontaine Jr. said of
Etherton. ``If he were to sign right away, he may start at a level
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Also notable, the Angels realize that Glaus has made headlines
this season not only because of his numbers _ he had a
minor-league-high 19 homers (more than 30 other minor-league
!ital!teams!off!) at the time of his call-up last week to Triple-A
Vancouver _ but also because he went to nearby UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, UCLA. Etherton, USC. It's not such a bad deal after all.
</P>
<P>
   Second time's the charm: It was just before the 1995 season that
a struggling shortstop mired in the depths of the Detroit Tigers
organization decided to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three years later, Bryan Corey is a major-leaguer. He
was recently called up by his new club, the Arizona Diamondbacks,
as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best decision I ever made,'' said Corey, a
second-team all-league selection at both Thousand Oaks High and
Pierce College before being drafted in the 12th round by the Tigers
in 1993. ``Three and a half years later, I'm in the big leagues.
It's all happening real fast. I think I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey, 24, hit .128 in 180 at bats when he and the Tigers
decided he should be getting batters out, not being a batter that
got out. By 1996, he was 6-4 with a 1.21 ERA and 34 saves for
Single-A Fayetteville, thanks in part to a mean sinker. Last year,
he was 3-8 with nine saves at Double-A Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The D'Backs liked what they saw, taking him in the third round
of the 1997 expansion draft. At the time of his call-up, he was 3-0
with a 1.77 ERA. In three appearances with the big club, he has
allowed four earned runs and six hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to pitch,'' Arizona director of minor-league
operations Tommy Jones told Baseball America.
</P>
<P>
   Full speed ahead: With the draft complete, the short-season
Single-A leagues and rookie leagues will blossom from nothingness
to full-roster status for Opening Day II June 16.
</P>
<P>
   First-year players accrued from the draft and free-agent
signings will report to two Single-A leagues (New York-Penn League
and Northwest League) and two Rookie League teams (Appalachian
League and Pioneer League).

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 8:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno made the right call in preserving
the right of Oregon residents to seek physician-assisted suicide in
that state. Last November, Thomas Constantine, the administrator of
the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, announced that doctors in
Oregon who acted under that state's assisted suicide law would be
subject to severe federal sanctions, including revocation of their
right to prescribe drugs. The DEA is responsible for enforcing
federal drug laws, but it has no right to substitute its own
judgment for the judgment of Oregon voters who resoundingly
affirmed their support for the state's Death With Dignity Act by a
60 percent vote last November.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon law allows a terminally ill adult to request a
prescription for lethal drugs if he or she is of sound mind and is
judged by two doctors to have less than six months to live. After
several months of review, Ms. Reno has concluded that the federal
law does not permit prosecution of a doctor who complies with the
Oregon law. Her decision is in line with the sentiment of the
Supreme Court. Although the high court ruled that there is no
constitutionally protected right to assisted suicide, it said
states must be free to engage in the ``profound debate about the
morality, legality and practicality'' of this issue. Oregon voters
have engaged in that debate, and their judgment about the right to
die should not be subject to federal interference.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, leaders of the right-to-life movement are seizing
on the assisted-suicide issue as they have on abortion. Rep. Chris
Smith of New Jersey, a vociferous opponent of abortion rights, has
said there will be efforts in Congress to undo Ms. Reno's decision
on the Oregon case. As in the reproductive rights arena,
conservatives who otherwise oppose federal control are eager to
substitute their moral judgments for those of local voters when the
outcome is not to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is beginning to grapple with an individual's right to
control how a life ends. A national poll last fall showed that 68
percent of respondents supported physician-assisted suicide.
Oregon's law is likely to be replicated in other states. Ms. Reno's
decision allows voters in all states to act according to their
values.

DOCILE JAZZ ARE SENT AWAY WHIMPERING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There is something crusty and hardened about Jazz
Coach Jerry Sloan, something that is as rugged as the farm life he
prefers. Out of this personality was born a player who used to
crash to the floor for every loose ball and defend with a clenched
jaw as a Chicago Bull, once upon a time.
</P>
<P>
   So it had to rip at his callous fiber to see how unequipped his
Jazz team was to counter the snarling defense of a Bulls team that
all but kicked sand in the face of his passive players on Sunday
night at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   With their crew cuts and Scout badges, good manners and
accounting degrees, the Jazz played the part of a team from the
Western Conference typically overwhelmed by a physical East team
that hit and hit hard. When it was over, the Jazz went whimpering
away after being humiliated, 96-54, in Game 3 of the National
Basketball Association finals. The Bulls now have a 2-1 lead in the
four-of-seven-games series.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz was simply bludgeoned by an aggressive defense that
left the team with 26 turnovers, and pushed aside as it found
itself on the wimpy side of a 50-38 rebounding advantage for the
Bulls. The Jazz was from the West, all right: all talent, no grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't put up much of a fight,'' Sloan said after it was
over. ``I'm very disappointed about that. I'm somewhat embarrassed
for the NBA for the guys to come out and play at this level, with
no more fight left in them than what we had. They got all the loose
balls, all the offensive rebounds, and we turned the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of countering with toughness, the Jazz settled for
passive jumpers, rushed their plays and fell right into the hands
of a Bulls' team that was driving to the basket and pressuring the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Ron Harper and Scottie Pippen (two steals). Then
Toni Kukoc and Dennis Rodman joined in. Early on, Harper and Pippen
applied ball pressure that overwhelmed even the calmest of Jazz
players, such as John Stockton. At times, Harper and Pippen would
double up on Stockton at half court, cutting down on his ability to
get his team into a pick-and-roll mode. The more pressure Harper
and Pippen applied, the more Stockton unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first half, Stockton had an uncharacteristic
four turnovers, three in a disastrous second quarter. This is when
the Bulls provided the squeeze on the Jazz. In the second quarter,
the Jazz turned the ball over nine times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't respond by gritting our teeth and executing despite
their pressure,'' Stockton said. ``We tried to do it in our own
way, but that didn't work. Then everything just snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls didn't let up. Pippen was relentless as he roved the
court, using his long arms to disrupt Stockton's passing lanes and
to interrupt any driving layups by the Jazz. At one point, he
planted his body in front of a charging Karl Malone and took a
charge in the second quarter just as the Jazz started to wobble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that kind of thing is a key for us,'' Pippen said.
``I'm roaming on defense in order to stop him from getting to the
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls stopped the Jazz in its tracks with a defense that was
quick and irritating, especially when it came to Malone.
</P>
<P>
   After Malone made his first six shots _ the bulk of which came
around an immobile Luc Longley in the first quarter _ Coach Phil
Jackson sent Dennis Rodman onto the scene at the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any excuses at all,'' Malone said. ``We just got
beat.'' He added that the Jazz could not respond to the Bulls'
defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   Once Rodman stepped onto the floor, Malone lost his edge. He
could not spin by Rodman. He had to score around him as elbows
poked his back and knees banged his shins. Malone made just two of
his next five shots and had seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Luc played him real soft,'' Jackson said. ``I put in
Dennis, and they never really got anything started with Karl on the
post. From there on out, Dennis just shut down his touches. Dennis
did a good job on him from that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pippen, Harper and Rodman applied pressure, Kukoc was
throwing himself on the floor looking for loose balls and reaching
in to strip the Jazz. He ended the game with six rebounds and four
steals.
</P>
<P>
   He was the perfect complement to a defense that left the Jazz
looking just like any other team from the West usually looks when
faced with the grizzled teams from the East: physically outmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever seen a team play better
defensively,'' Sloan said. ``They ate us alive.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Hard to guess this early which will end up as the
!ital!piece de resistance!off! of Web sites once the !ital!Coupe du
Monde!off! begins in France this week.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best way to approach it is stick to a few basics until
you've decided just how much information you're willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   May we suggest the following !ital!hors d'oeuvres!off!:
</P>
<P>
   The official World Cup site: In English and French, this site
(www.worldcup98.org) has what you'd expect without too much
advertising clutter. Did you know there are 704 players
participating? Find all their names here. In the store, the
cheapest thing you can pick up (depending on the exchange rate) is
a set of five marbles with the little Woody Woodpecker mascot for
$2.69.
</P>
<P>
   The official U.S. soccer site: Mostly full of press releases
disguised as stories about what's going with the American team
(www.us-soccer.com), but that can be enough to satisfy those who
aren't interested in negative publicity about the team.
</P>
<P>
   The best English resources: Since ABC and ESPN have the U.S.
broadcasting rights, expect ESPN's SportsZone
(http://espn.sportszone) to supplement the event. It already has a
contest (like the NCAA Tournament pool) in which you can pick the
final 16, then finish off the bracket. The other recommended source
is by by Yahoo! (http://soccer.yahoo.com/wc98), which provides
plenty of depth.
</P>
<P>
   The instant goal site: Sign up for free at this place
(www.kgoal.net) and they'll send you an e-mail every time a goal is
scored during the 64 games. Which could be as many as 12 e-mails!
In English, French, Spanish, Swedish or Dutch. You can also
unsubscribe if the service is getting you in trouble at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile: On the official NBA site (www.nba.com) the newest toy
is called NBA.cam, which allows computer users to watch the NBA
Finals through one of four small robotic cameras placed in the
Delta Center in Salt Lake City and the United Center in Chicago. If
someone else is already playing with the cameras, you get to see
what they're looking at....
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive Software's plans to release ``Mike Piazza Strike
Zone'' computer video game for Nintendo64 later this month are on
hold, as the company decides what to do with the fact its headliner
no longer wears a Dodgers uniform.... Ask Jack McDowell what it's
like to get suspended for fighting while on the disabled list when
the Angels pitcher takes his turn on a chat session scheduled for
Thursday at 1 p.m. on the official site of the Major League
Baseball Players Association (www.bigleaguers.com). McDowell also
promises to discuss the new CD ``Feedbag'' released by his band
Stickfigure.

England capable of crown, susceptible to sorrow
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ Nowhere does the volatile, unpredictable nature of
international soccer seem better illustrated than in Group G of the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   There is England _ the remarkably successful self-described
keeper of the sport _ where controversial decisions and rabid fans
are as abundant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is Colombia, a soccer hotbed of South America, where
passions run so deep that four years ago a player was killed,
reportedly by mobsters, after an own-goal against the United States
led to the Colombians' ouster from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There is Romania, a classic Eastern European side with
experience, talent and flawless execution. And there is Tunisia, a
group of creative North Africans with a style all its own.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason, then, that picking a winner out of this
group has proved more difficult than last December when these
nations were drawn together.
</P>
<P>
   After the World Cup draw, England was penciled in almost
immediately as the team to beat in Group G. But not so fast. After
playing well throughout qualification last year, obviously
determined to make up for failing to qualify for the World Cup in
1994, the English side has since struggled on the field and made a
hugely controversial decision off it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gascoigne, a popular player whom many consider the greatest
midfielder in England's history, was cut from the World Cup roster
late last month by coach Glenn Hoddle. The move stunned the nation
and spawned numerous debates across England and within the team.
Gascoigne was the only player on the English roster with World Cup
experience, from England's semifinals appearance in 1990. He also
was considered the only true playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   But on top of ankle and groin injuries that slowed Gascoigne
during World Cup training, he was a well-known carouser and
admitted hard drinker who regularly found himself on the cover of
the British tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his decision to cut Gascoigne, Hoddle said: ``We
have run out of time getting him to the fitness levels that I
needed. He was not at the level he needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That much became clear during recent English exhibition matches.
After only one half of a game against Belgium last month, Gascoigne
asked to be removed from the field, citing a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Hoddle's decision and England's sluggish efforts
in the exhibitions, British bookmaker Ladbrokes last week
lengthened the odds of England's winning the World Cup from 7-1 to
8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the English remain a threat not just to win the group,
but the World Cup. But they also need to regroup fast, or Colombia
and Romania could again leave the English wondering what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanians might have the team on the biggest roll. Veterans
Gheorghe Hagi, Gheorghe Popescu and Bogdan Stelea are performing
well in what should be this talented group's last hurrah. And
remember, this is a team that defeated Colombia, the United States
and Argentina four years ago before losing on penalty kicks to
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying competition was relatively weak this time for the
Romanians, but they still went 9-0-1, and that's hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Colombia?
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, many experts pegged this team to win the
tournament before disaster struck. Andres Escobar, the murdered
defender, will be a name forever etched in World Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Colombia has been a mere afterthought to many
handicappers of the World Cup. But many players off the 1994 team
return this summer in hopes of easing some of the bad memories. The
likes of Carlos Valderrama and Freddy Rincon might be a step
slower, but their skills remain.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a remarkably entertaining group, start to finish,
with only the Tunisians likely to finish where expected _ at the
bottom.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 8:
</P>
<P>
   Let the seller beware. That appears to be a principal lesson in
the decision of Merrill Lynch to pay $437 million to settle civil
suits brought against it in the wake of the Orange County, Calif.,
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch warned Robert Citron, the county treasurer who
later pleaded guilty to securities fraud, that his strategy of
borrowing money to buy risky derivative securities for the county's
investment fund might blow up if interest rates rose, as they did.
But Citron wanted to keep buying, and Merrill kept selling.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill was hardly alone in knowing the strategy was risky. It
had become a political issue in Orange County, but the county
supervisors, happy to spend the profits generated when the strategy
was working, did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's settlements with the county and a water district that
had invested in the county fund serve as a warning to Wall Street
that it may face penalties even if a customer voluntarily buys
something that was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Orange County had refused to calculate a market value of its
investments, and no one forced it to do so. Had the declining
market values been readily available, the risks would have become
clearer to the public much earlier. Better accounting might have
kept this debacle from happening.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: TESTING THE LIMITS OF DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP TAUBMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an odd conjunction of opposing political cultures. Turkey,
the emblem of secular governance in the Middle East, and Iran, the
heartland of Islamic fundamentalism, are both resisting powerful
internal political movements by prosecuting the mayors of their
largest cities, Istanbul and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul's mayor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was recently convicted
of inciting hatred in a speech last year. Tehran's mayor,
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, just went on trial on corruption charges.
In truth, the two men are being pursued less for what they said or
did than for what they represent, which is a strong desire among
their countrymen for a more inclusive, less rigid brand of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In attacking the mayors, the rulers of Turkey and Iran have
shown a potentially fatal inability to practice moderation in
politics. The defenders of the faith in each nation will likely
discover someday that in their unyielding pursuit of conformity
they only strengthened and radicalized the popular causes they
feared and tried to suppress.
</P>
<P>
   In both prosecutions, the legal battle itself is just a skirmish
in a broader struggle between ruling authority and a growing
political opposition. In both cases, the mayors represent an
opportunity for peaceful change that should not be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The rulers of Turkey and Iran would acknowledge no common
thread. If anything, they would maintain that the two cases show
how different the countries are. The generals who wield real power
in Turkey are determined to snuff out any Islamic political
activity, fearful it will undermine their secular state and even
lead eventually to an Iranian-style revolution. The clerics who run
Iran are intolerant of civil authority and see it as a threat to
the Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
   But when the ideological and legal veneer is removed, the two
cases are essentially about the same thing: extremism in the
defense of power.
</P>
<P>
   I saw this tendency when I visited Turkey and Iran last fall. A
Turkish general who denounced his country's main Islamic political
party was just as intransigent as a cleric in Tehran who opposed
reform. Though the two nations view each other as political
antagonists, and their handling of religious matters could not be
more different, the Turkish generals and Iranian clerics are
allergic to genuine democracy. The generals are secular
fundamentalists, the clerics Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Erdogan's offense was not that he sowed discord, but that he was
a leader of the Welfare Party, the Islamic political organization
that drew the largest number of votes in parliamentary elections
three years ago. The party briefly governed Turkey in a coalition,
but was then displaced and ultimately outlawed at the behest of the
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Karbaschi is an ally of President Mohammad Khatami, who was
elected last year in an overwhelming protest vote against the
clerical stranglehold in Iran. Whether the mayor embezzled city
accounts as charged may never be known. What is clear is that
Khatami's opponents went after the mayor to weaken Khatami and his
reform program.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when I boarded an Iran Air jumbo jet for the
flight from Istanbul to Tehran, I thought I was about to traverse a
vast political expanse. The differences of culture, language and
history are indeed great. But after a few days in Tehran, I found
the politics of exclusion and control were not that dissimilar. It
is a pity, for the people of Turkey and Iran have the energy and
heart to fashion democratic societies, if they only had the
chance. &QL;

MARINER SILENCE SAYS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One game can be a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always right around the corner,'' Mariner manager Lou
Piniella said Sunday, knowing that 100 games left in a season is
still enough time to believe things could change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Mariner turning point came on August 24th against
the Yankees. The M's came back to win and then took off on a molten
tear, stealing the American League West and you know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   For any of the 41,514 fans who stuck around at the Kingdome,
there was an opportunity to feel that same sort of hopeful rush.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing the Dodgers so badly all day, the Mariners sent
the winning run to the plate in the ninth. An injured David Segui
came to pinch hit. He had the bases loaded and the score was 7-4
and you just know Segui, who has three career grand slams and a
fierce competitive drive that makes even Piniella proud, wanted to
smack his team over the top.
</P>
<P>
   But when Segui swung for strike three, the game ended with a
frustrating abruptness, and so did the moment of Mariner optimism.
</P>
<P>
   It left you wondering with considerable good reason what the
remaining 100 games of the season will bring.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take to turn around the 1998 Mariners? What can be
done to salvage a season that has gone from World Series contender
to a disheartening but ever-more-obvious June surrender?
</P>
<P>
   There has to be an answer. There has to be something that can
inject some life, some hope into a club that should not be this
down and out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the losses mount and the season wilts, there is no clue
about what can be done. The silence coming from the Mariners has
grown deafening.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the decision last week to not trade Randy
Johnson, Mariner officials have taken a bunker mentality, refusing
to comment on what their mind-set is regarding their team and their
options.
</P>
<P>
   Their final word on the Johnson situation was that they won't be
trading the lefty this season. What this means is either the M's
aren't telling the truth, or they are willing to let the Big Unit
just walk away after this season with the promise of getting
nothing for him except two draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder why so much time has gone by with no action being
taken to make a fix. The bullpen has crushed the Mariners' spirit
too many times. The defense has gone from bad to worse, which is
what happens to a team that's struggling.
</P>
<P>
   You would think the best time to make a change has already come
and gone, which makes you wonder why time is dripping like molasses
and Woody Woodword's feet seem so stuck in all the goop.
</P>
<P>
   Does ownership think Woodward and Piniella have the players they
requested in the offseason, so it's up to Woodward and Piniella to
get the job done now with the personnel in hand?
</P>
<P>
   Are Piniella and Woodward, the team's vice president of baseball
operations, frustrated at what may have ultimately been an
ownership decision to not trade Johnson, since perhaps someone
keeps hoping the old Randy Johnson will just come out every fifth
day and pitch his brains out?
</P>
<P>
   Is there such a split between Mariner ownership and the baseball
side of the organization that the franchise is now incapable of
arriving at a decision about what changes to make?
</P>
<P>
   Piniella denied that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is (a split) at all. The difference is
what you can do and what you can't do ... We know the things that
need to be done here. It's just a question of people being
available,'' Piniella said. ``I don't know what we can do or can't
do. Right now, we have to play better with what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Piniella would not talk specifically, it seems as if he
and Woodward have determined what changes they need to make. Now,
the urgent question is when and if those changes can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, evidence for the need of a shake-up keeps mounting.
After a four-error loss to the Dodgers Saturday, Piniella promised
some changes for Sunday's game. But when he wrote up the day's
lineup card, everything remained status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora was back out at second base. Russ Davis was on third.
The two biggest culprits in the Mariners' American League-worst
defensive department were sent back out to do the jobs they were
hired to do.
</P>
<P>
   But what else could Piniella do?
</P>
<P>
   With no depth either on the big club or down on the farm, the
Mariner skipper simply does not have the pieces necessary to shake
things up.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but how Piniella would like to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rather obvious this isn't working,'' Piniella shouted
after a hideous loss in Baltimore, when errors were plentiful and
the bullpen was leaking more than George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Piniella was a little less agitated. Maybe there is
hope. He said he and Woodward spoke. The team's needs are known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of my hands. Talk to ...,'' Piniella said, trailing
off, not willing to say who would be the person to speak with
regarding changes.
</P>
<P>
   It only takes one game to start a win streak. A turnaround is
conceivable, but not without some bold intervention.

NOTHING GOES RIGHT IN M'S FINALE WITH DODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After suggesting Saturday night that some lineup
changes were in store, Mariner manager Lou Piniella stuck with
basically the same starters Sunday and got a similar result in the
series finale against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were stung with another loss, 7-4, before 41,514
fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros slugged solo home runs and the
Dodgers blooped losing pitcher Jamie Moyer into submission during a
game-clinching five-run rally in the sixth inning as the Mariners
fell eight games below .500 (27-35) for the first time since ending
the 1994 season with a 49-63 record.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the potential lineup change, Piniella said, ``I
wasn't talking 12 hours. We (management) know the things that need
to be done here. It's just a question of people being available. I
don't know what we can do or can't do. Right now, we have to play
better than what we have. And I expect us to play better than we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's went down with a ninth-inning fight, scoring three runs
and then loading the bases to bring the potential winning run to
the plate. Sore-footed pinch-hitter David Segui struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 24th homer in the ninth but otherwise
had an rare dismal game _ striking out three times and misplaying a
line drive into right-center field for his third error of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled back and that's a good sign,'' Piniella said. ``One
swing, and we win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui, the only lineup change _ and only because he has a sore
right foot _ took three swings against Antonio Osuna, missing all
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to hit a line drive somewhere in the gap and
score (pinch-runner Charles Gipson) from first base,'' Segui said.
``There are times you try to hit a home run. But I wasn't trying to
hit one out in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella, ``David is hurt but gave it his best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   As they returned to their clubhouse, the Mariners continued to
rub their collective eyes in disbelief. They left 13 more
baserunners on base. And popups fell in front of Griffey and right
fielder Rob Ducey to fuel the Dodgers' big fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are struggling, things like that happen,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have now lost six of their past seven games in various
ways. Ineffective starting pitching. Poor relief pitching. Errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is frustrating for everybody,'' said catcher Dan Wilson,
who went 3-for-4. ``We're all trying to work ourselves out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what it is going to take?
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Piniella: ``Getting good pitching, timely hitting,
catching the ball and winning some games.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Wilson: ``We need to execute and get our confidence
back.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Moyer: ``We need seven or eight strong innings, maybe even
nine, from our starters at least two times through the rotation to
take some of the pressure off the offense and bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Segui: ``Two weeks ago I would have said we needed a
shake-up. But I think it's past that stage. I think everything we
need is here, but what do I know?
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Alex Rodriguez: ``It isn't a confidence issue. It's an
execution issue. This team has won in the past and knows it can win
again. It's not like it has had a facelift.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Moyer, ``I don't think anyone in this room is going to
give up. But we have to find a solution someway, somehow and real
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who won the final two games of the interleague
series, rode the solid pitching of starter Darren Dreifort for
eight innings. The right-hander, whom the Mariners reportedly
requested in recent trade talks involving Randy Johnson, spaced
nine hits and got a superb defensive play by second baseman Eric
Young, who deprived Edgar Martinez of a run-scoring single in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position until
Rodriguez singled home Cora from third base in the seventh inning.

BULLS HOLD JAZZ TO RECORD LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan stopped midway through his
postgame news conference when someone handed him the statistical
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was actually the score?'' a stunned Sloan asked. ``This
was the final? I thought it was 196. Seemed like (the Chicago
Bulls) scored 196.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, Jerry. And a longer gape at the final score would
explain that the Bulls offense in Game 3 of the NBA Finals was
hardly the difference at United Center last night.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago 96. Utah 54.
</P>
<P>
   Old? Tired? Cracks in the armor?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Bulls beat ragged the old cliche of defense winning
championships. Yep, the Jazz are tired of hearing about how good
the Bulls are as they shoot for a sixth championship.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, after Sunday's _ fill in the discerning adjective
here _ the Jazz are broken and picking up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a defensive effort better than police vests stopping
bullets, the Bulls completely flattened the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   It only seems as if Utah has been eliminated from the Finals.
The series is far from over. However, if ever was such a thing as a
commanding 2-1 lead, the Bulls have just that.
</P>
<P>
   The after shock is still resonating:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Utah's point total was the fewest ever by a team in an NBA
game since the advent of the 24-second shot clock in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The Jazz made just 21 field goals and scored only 23
points in the second half _ the fewest ever in an NBA Finals game.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Chicago's 42-point margin of victory was the largest in
Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chicago has never lost a playoff series after
taking the lead. Not only have they stolen the homecourt advantage
in this series, Games 4 and 5 are at United Center. The Bulls are
8-1 at home in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   What _ that is positive _ do the Jazz have to look forward to?
``You watch endings of games like this and you better be ready to
play the next game,'' Jazz forward Karl Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone watched the waning moments of Game 3 from the bench. The
Bulls led by 18 points at halftime and owned a 27-point advantage
by the start of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago snatched the game's momentum with one simple yet
hard-to-do adjustment. They controlled Malone and John Stockton,
and the rest of Utah's pieces fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good feel for them,'' said Bulls star Michael
Jordan, who told his teammates long before the third quarter ended
that he wanted to rest the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screen and roll is very tough to play,'' Jordan said.
``But once we got a feel for it and saw something that worked we
kept at it. Now we're starting to affect them to some degree in
stopping the screen and roll. That's great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen's ability to roam and disrupt Stockton was the
key. Pippen often defended whomever was an offensive liability on
the floor for Utah. As soon as Stockton crossed midcourt, Pippen
doubled off his man and ran toward Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy closed down the passing lanes and frustrated the
NBA's all-time assists leader. Stockton had seven assists and five
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever seen a team play any better
defensively since I've been in the business,'' Sloan said. ``They
ate us alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah never got into its offensive sets. The Bulls forced Utah
into a playoff-high 26 turnovers and had 13 steals. Essentially,
the Bulls were more aggressive and mentally tough.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the third quarter, Utah had 13 field goals to
match 13 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten better (defensively) _ to be able to take them
out of their sets and rotate and get to their shooters,'' Pippen
said. ``Our defense is what's carrying us throughout this series.''
</P>
<P>
   The pick and roll Utah methodically destroys opponents with went
stale. Malone rebounded from poor performances in the first two
games and scored 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting. But the Jazz had
just 16 assists and shot 30 percent as a team.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls even checked Malone, who hit his first six shots.
Bulls coach Phil Jackson switched Dennis Rodman to guard Malone
instead of Luc Longley. Malone went just 2 of 4 in the second half
with Rodman badgering him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Luc played him real soft, and it looked like
(Malone) was going to hit that jump shot all day at the start,''
Jackson said. ``I put Dennis on him on the outside and they never
really got anything started with Karl in the post from there on
out. It shut down his touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone wasn't ready to give the Bulls too much credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut them down on everybody. They had a helluva defensive
game. It was an old-fashioned one (last night). We got exactly what
we deserved,'' Malone said. ``But our plays work. It's evident our
plays work when we run them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, the small problem of when Chicago is running
its system to perfection. That is the simplest explanation for last
night _ a game in which the team with one of the game's best
offensive players won with offense being an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine tuning a lot of things and we're starting to look
good,'' Jordan said. ``I like that. It's a good time to look
good.''

SHIRLEY POLYKOFF, 90, ADVERTISING PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shirley Polykoff, the pioneering advertising woman
who came up with a single double-entendre that changed the face, or
rather turned the heads, of American society, died on Thursday at
her home on Park Avenue. She was 90 and the author of the ``Does
she ... or doesn't she?'' slogan, which unleashed American women to
choose the color of their hair.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a
routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as
the mid-1950s hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a
cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their
hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1956 Miss Polykoff invented the ``Does she ... or
doesn't she?'' campaign for a tiny Bristol-Myers division known as
Clairol. Almost overnight, the slogan became a national catch
phrase, and dyed hair (although never thereafter, she made sure,
known that way) went from declasse to de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted by the slogan and its reassuring tag line, ``Hair
color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure,'' within a
decade nearly half of all American women were regularly coloring
their hair, and sales of dyes, tints and rinses had soared from $25
million to $200 million a year, with Clairol accounting for more
than half the total (as it does today with industry sales of more
than $1 billion).
</P>
<P>
   Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone &AMP;
Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone
female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and
the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Brooklyn-born middle daughter of Russian Jewish
immigrants, especially one whose mother wanted her to be a boy, the
triumph was hardly a fluke. From the time she was 11 and made ``$3
and change'' for 12 hours' work selling coats in a Brooklyn
department store, Miss Polykoff had relished proving herself in the
traditional masculine role of breadwinner.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in time to take
over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had
written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at
Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in
retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety
stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New
York agencies with retail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the few women in a male-dominated industry selling
almost exclusively to women, the traditional household purchasing
agents, Miss Polykoff had an advantage over her sometimes obtuse
colleagues, particularly those who told her the proposed ``Does she
... or doesn't she?'' campaign was too suggestive.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1975 book, ``Does She ... or Doesn't She? And How She Did
It,'' Miss Polykoff recalled that when similarly obtuse executives
at Life magazine turned down a 10-page Clairol layout because of
the double-entendre, she challenged them to poll the women in the
magazine office.
</P>
<P>
   When the dirty-minded executives could not find a single woman
who thought the line had any smutty connotation, Miss Polykoff was
not surprised. She had realized all along that well brought-up
women of the 1950s, the Clairol target audience, would never admit,
as she put it, ``that a nice girl ever got an off-color meaning
about anything.'' The ad ran, and, as she recalled, ``everybody got
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   To some latter-day feminists, Miss Polykoff was somewhat
perplexing, on the one hand an obvious pioneering role model for
professional women, on the other a woman whose success, which
included such campaigns as ``Is It True Blondes Have More Fun?''
and ``If I've Only One Life to Live, Let Me Live It as a Blonde,''
depended on catering to women's vanity as sex objects.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Polykoff, who frankly used her femininity to charm men and
who chided modern businesswomen who try to ape men, did not
apologize. For all her ambition and outsized success as a woman,
Miss Polykoff was cut from a pre-feminist mold, never forgetting,
as she often put it, that she was ``a girl first and an advertising
woman second.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up as the awkward middle daughter between two
raven-haired beauties, Miss Polykoff, who saw her blond hair as her
only physical distinction (at least until she began to develop what
she called her ``sexy curves''), was so distraught when her hair
began to darken as a teen-ager that she began having a local
hairdresser lighten it, just to make the back match the front. That
fiction sufficed until her future mother-in-law secretly asked her
son the Yiddish foreshadowing of ``Does she ... or doesn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her
career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000
so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George Halperin.
After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less
than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under
her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried
employee for many years.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio,
and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier
Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three
grandchildren.

TOO THE BITTER END, MIKE PEGRAM ENJOYS HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ His horse seemed to have won a Triple Crown.
And then he seemed to have lost it, and then won it, and finally,
he lost it, not by a nose, by a nostril.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six hours later, Mike Pegram, the Mount Vernon owner of
Real Quiet, stood at the end of a ballroom in a Long Island hotel,
surrounded by a bottle of beer, a plate of shrimp and 300 of his
closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I have friends,'' he said. ``How would you like to be
in a hotel room right now if you lost?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the winners are having this much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was an ache deep within Pegram at having come so close
to getting his maligned horse engraved in the sport's history _
only to lose so breathtakingly in the Belmont Stakes _ he didn't
betray it.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram bounced in and out of the party he was throwing to hug
old friends and trade war stories.
</P>
<P>
   They were there from Princeton, Ind., the place of his youth,
old buddies like Rick Wheeler and Chuck Winters, whose fathers knew
his father.
</P>
<P>
   They were there from Mount Vernon, folks like Robbie Slayton,
who caught Pegram's Little League fastballs from age 8 in
Princeton, and then moved out to join him in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Slayton, his wife, was there. Twenty-two years ago, she
interviewed with Pegram for a job on the counter crew at the
McDonald's in Oak Harbor. Today, she's director of operations for
the string of 22 fast-food outlets Pegram owns north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Pegram's longtime Mount Vernon friends were on hand,
people like former Skagit County district court judge John Kamb and
his son Tommy, an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, Real Quiet's trainer, was there, and so was jockey
Kent Desormeaux. Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of the 1997 Belmont
bridesmaid, Silver Charm, also made it.
</P>
<P>
   For everybody, there was still a sense of numbness at what they
had seen a few miles to the west at Belmont. A horse losing the
Triple Crown by a nose? That's like Mark McGwire being denied Roger
Maris' home run record on his last at-bat of the season on a
leaping catch over the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that stewards indicated they would have ``marked
down'' Real Quiet after he went wide on the homestretch to jostle
Victory Gallop. It would have taken some severe guts to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real disappointed, but he knows he'll be back,'' Robbie
Slayton said, referring to Pegram. ``I think he knows that horse
overachieved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine,'' said KOMO sportscaster Bob Rondeau, who
co-owned a horse with Pegram that was recently claimed. ``He'll be
better than anybody else about this.''
</P>
<P>
   It will forever be alleged in many quarters that Desormeaux
didn't give Real Quiet the best ride, that he charged too early on
the demanding 1{-mile oval, and then he initiated the bumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``B.S.,'' Pegram said. ``That's pure, unadulterated B.S. Are you
a gambler? If you'd had a (pari-mutuel) window in front of you at
the quarter pole, how much would you have bet?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Desmormeaux, ``After 75 or 80 yards (in the lead), he said,
`There's nothing else to run for.' He gawked a little on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had it to do over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He only said that,'' scoffed Pegram, `` because he felt bad
for Bobby, he felt bad for the horse and he felt bad for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What a five-week trip it was for Real Quiet's people, especially
for the 46-year-old Pegram. He was Jed Clampett on Rodeo Drive. He
rang the opening bell the other day on Wall Street. He stopped to
sleep when he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like going to Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Magic
Mountain,'' Pegram said. ``Without a budget.''
</P>
<P>
   A sniff short of history, Real Quiet will go down as the 14th
horse to win the first two legs of the Triple Crown before being
denied here. Bought for $17,000 at a yearling sale and unimpressive
as a 2-year-old, he may be recalled modestly unless he certifies
his excellence the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram's imprint may be more lasting. His party was the
personification of his tweaking of horse racing's establishment. He
interrupted a conversation once to join a dice game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see (industry) people who don't like the thought of us
being here,'' he said. ``We were playing in somebody else's
sandbox. And guess what? We might pee in it next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram hopes the industry doesn't miss the message of his
campaign with Real Quiet. Some 80,162 fans flooded the Belmont,
second-largest crowd in the track's 93-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans showed me they didn't like racing the way it was,''
he said. ``They put 80,000 people in there today for three reasons:
Visa (which offered a $5-million bonus to a Triple Crown champion),
Bob Baffert and third, Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got this racing establishment, and for whatever reason,
they don't like fun. Well, they better get used to it, because we
ain't going away.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Pegram's contention that some of the lag in racing
interest has been caused by the industry's unresponsiveness to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   Will this experience change Pegram? Will he be tempted to raise
the ante at a yearling sale in an attempt to hit it big once more?
</P>
<P>
   He answered the questions with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to drive myself crazy getting back here?'' he
asked. ``No. Do I want to, yes. I know how fortunate I was to do
it. But I'm like the racing fan. I look for value.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram shares another trait with the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new sheriff in town,'' he said. ``It's called fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he was accepting a string of hugs and thanks for the party,
and also for the ride. He was having fun, the best way Mike Pegram
knows to wash away the pain.

JAILING THE VICTIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Veronica Martinez spent five hours in a jail where
she wasn't fed lunch and her cellmate was a drugged-out woman with
a queasy stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Then she was led in handcuffs from her cell to a courtroom in
L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But the 25-year-old woman from the suburb of Tujunga was not a
criminal suspect. In fact, prosecutors said, she was the victim.
</P>
<P>
   She was the chief witness against her boyfriend, who was on
trial on a misdemeanor charge of punching her in January. Like many
women in similar positions, she did not want to testify. The judge
jailed her to make sure she took the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was humiliating,'' she said, calling the judge's decision
``cold-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's case represents a trend that victims and defense
attorneys say has become all too common since the O.J. Simpson
case: In an effort to crack down on domestic violence, prosecutors
and judges are getting increasingly aggressive with victims who
refuse to testify or change their stories.
</P>
<P>
   These women may find themselves threatened with prosecution for
filing a false police report. If they insist the original story
they gave police was a lie, then they are told they are guilty of a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, albeit it rarely, women wind up in custody to
make sure they take the stand at trial. A woman who misses a court
appearance might find police at her doorstep with a pair of
handcuffs and a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal Court Judge Roy M. Carstairs jailed Martinez because
he said her refusal to testify voluntarily would have sabotaged the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to realize,'' the judge said, ``that these people
are their own worst enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say such tactics are designed to give victims as
little control as possible over the outcome of a domestic violence
case. That way the accused abuser can't wiggle out of a criminal
charge by intimidating his spouse or promising her he'll change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is basically take it out of her hands so she's
no longer responsible, so we can say to him, this isn't your wife
doing it, it's the state doing it, and we're going to proceed
whether she wants to or not,'' said Deputy City Attorney Lara
Bloomquist, who supervises the office's domestic violence unit.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of women who file domestic violence
complaints wind up recanting or vanishing at trial, Bloomquist
said. And many of these women ignore subpoenas to come to court. In
extreme cases, prosecutors will request a ``body attachment''
allowing police to track the woman down and bring her to court _
forcibly, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomquist said her office requests body attachment in less than
5 percent of all cases, and only when the woman makes clear she
won't come voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Critics find such tactics distasteful and paternalistic. They
accuse prosecutors of assuming every victim who tries to recant is
too fearful or weak to decide what's in her own best interest. In
no other type of crime, they argue, would the victim have so little
control over how a case is handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a strong feeling in the domestic violence
community that these are grown women and they have the right to
make decisions for themselves,'' said Abby Leibman, executive
director of the California Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   And defense lawyers argue that such tactics prevent women from
changing the stories they initially told police even when those
stories were heat-of-the-moment exaggerations or outright lies.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Public Defender Bill Weiss, who heads the Van Nuys office
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, said one prosecutor routinely
would take the recanting witness into a small room and threaten her
with immediate arrest for filing false police reports. Weiss said
he learned about the practice after several women complained to
lawyers in his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, OK, sit still here because I'm going to get a
police officer and you'll be taken into custody and your kids will
be taken by the (Department of Children's Services),'' Weiss said.
``He saw nothing wrong with that kind of coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's become a common refrain for women to say they've
been threatened with losing their children if they don't cooperate,
defense lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, if you don't testify or you recant then your kids
will be taken away,'' said Deputy Public Defender Mary Paxson.
``I've had witnesses say that under oath on the witness stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Pam Booth, who heads the DA's office in
nearby El Monte, said her office alerts the county's Department of
Children's Services whenever a child is directly involved or
witnesses an act of domestic violence. It's up to DCS to open an
investigation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Booth denies that her prosecutors threaten victims but says they
will ``advise them of the possible consequences'' if they try to
recant or ignore a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the possibility of criminal prosecution, many
recanting witnesses now need their own attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Public Defender Robin Berkovitz cited a recent Downtown
case where her client was charged with threatening his former
girlfriend with a gun. The woman later recanted, saying she was
jealous to see her boyfriend with another man.
</P>
<P>
   The woman took the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination at
a preliminary hearing, preventing Berkovitz from being able to
question her on the stand. Her client later pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and served 120 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``By telling the court they were considering prosecuting her,
they were preventing him from putting on a meaningful defense,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's presence at trial isn't always vital for a
conviction, especially with a new law that permits a jury to hear
certain statements a woman made to police but who then is
unavailable to testify. The law was passed in response to the
Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in some cases prosecutors or judges decide the victim
needs to be in court. A woman's presence is often important in
misdemeanor cases where police don't have any independent proof of
physical injury.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case at the trial of Luis Manuel Roman _ the one in
which Martinez was the star witness. In January, police arrested
Roman in Tujunga after Martinez called 911. Roman is the father of
three of Martinez's children. He was on probation for hitting her
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest incident, police say Martinez told them Roman hit
her several times, according to Deputy City Attorney Jose Egurbide,
who prosecuted the case. She had no bruises or other signs of
injury, Egurbide said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Martinez said she never told police he hit her. She
said she called 911 because the argument was getting heated and she
wanted him out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city attorney got really mad when I tried to tell him it
didn't happen that way. I felt stuck. I didn't know whether to say
what the truth was or go along with the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Egurbide notes that Martinez also tried to change her story in
1996. He said he never threatened her, he simply advised her she
might need her own lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person is changing their story, the implication is that
either she lied to the police or she's going to lie on the stand.
She needed to understand the implications of that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez uncooperative, Egurbide decided to try the case
without her. Nonetheless, on April 9, in the middle of the trial,
Carstairs ordered a body attachment for Martinez when she failed to
show up in court. When she arrived the next day, the judge
threatened to jail her immediately but released her when she
promised to show up promptly the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she was late. Carstairs ordered her into
custody until she testified later that afternoon. The trial ended
with a hung jury and Roman received a 60-day jail sentence for a
probation violation. He was released from custody last week.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial, Martinez was studying to become a probation
officer. She now works as a retail clerk. She said the experience
changed her mind about a career in criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you,'' Weiss said, ``how many women have told me,
had I known all this was going to happen, I never would have called
the police.''

CARREY ON TOP AS CROWDS FLOCK TO SEE `TRUMAN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers backed up the red-hot hype for Jim
Carrey's ``The Truman Show'' with a powerful $31.6 million at 2,315
theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The offbeat comedy-fantasy, starring Carrey as a man whose
entire life has been televised worldwide, opened amid exceptionally
strong reviews and a massive publicity push designed to draw
customers beyond Carrey's core of young, male supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount executives said the strategy had worked well with 80
percent of viewers rating the film ``excellent'' or ``very good''
and solid support from all ages and demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to draw very mixed audiences and broaden the base
well past young males,'' said Wayne Lewellen, the studio's head of
theatrical distribution. ``We're very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewellen said Paramount will add 400 to 500 theaters to ``The
Truman Show'' for the coming weekend, about 100 more than the
studio's original plan. He predicted the film, which cost a
relatively modest $60 million, should generate continued strong
grosses well into the summer because of its unique premise.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital said Paramount has to
be relieved about the performance because of uncertainty about
whether moviegoers would want to see Carrey in a departure from his
usual slapstick roles. ``It's clearly a high-risk project that will
make a lot of profit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening impressively was Warner Bros.' ``A Perfect
Murder,'' an updated remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Dial M For
Murder,'' with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in the roles
originally played by Ray Milland and Grace Kelly. It finished a
strong second with $16.2 million at 2,845 theaters, giving Warner _
which suffered through a dismal 1997 _ the prospect of another
solid performer following ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's third weekend of ``Godzilla'' finished third with a
moderate $10 million at 3,310 theaters, pushing the monster
lizard's 19-day take to $114.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's second weekend of Sandra Bullock's ``Hope
Floats'' followed with $8.5 million at 2,403 screens, giving the
romantic comedy more then $28 million after 10 days. Paramount's
fifth weekend of ``Deep Impact'' had $6.7 million at 3,280
theaters, boosting its 31-day take to $122 million and making it
the 96th-highest domestic grosser ever behind ``Rocky III'' at
$122.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``The Horse Whisperer'' came in sixth
with $5.1 million at 2,362 sites to pass $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth'' finished seventh with a
disappointing $2.2 million at 1,784 theaters in its third weekend
of nationwide release by Fox. Miramax's second weekend of ``I Got
the Hook-Up'' came in eighth with $1.65 million at 655 locations,
edging Paramount's 25th weekend of ``Titanic'' with $1.63 million
at 1,219 theaters. The latter has topped $582 million after 171
days and leads ``Star Wars'' as the best domestic grosser by $121
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 was Warner's fourth weekend of ``The
Quest For Camelot'' with $1.5 million at 1,562 sites.

ERIKA CHEETHAM, MEDIEVAL SCHOLAR, DIES AT 58 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erika Cheetham, an English medieval scholar who made a fortune
translating the predictions of the 16th-century physician and
astrologer Nostradamus, who gazed not only at the stars but also,
legend had it, into a brass bowl of water to see visions of the
future, died on May 3 in London. She was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Her books, ``The Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' ``The Further
Prophecies of Nostradamus'' and ``The Final Prophecies of
Nostradamus,'' in which she claimed to have found predictions of
the execution of Charles I, the Great Fire of London, the Apollo 13
catastrophe and the spread of AIDS, sold in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   They were on mass-market paperback best-seller lists for years
in the United States, Britain and other countries, and, since the
first book appeared in 1973, they have never been out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Her good fortune came about because of a mistake at the
Taylorian Library at Oxford, where she was working toward a
doctorate in medieval languages. The librarian gave her the wrong
book, the ``Propheties de M. Nostradamus.'' She found it
fascinating and saw in it what she interpreted to be a prediction
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Michel de Notredame, the astrologer's real name, was also a
traveling doctor from Provence, doing what was regarded as heroic
work during plagues in Aix-en-Provence and Lyons. He produced
several almanacs and a book of rhymed prophecies called
``Centuries,'' which has stayed in print through 300 editions.
Before his death in 1566, he had gained a wide following.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33d quatrain of his fifth set of predictions, for
example, a passage on the city of Nantes read: ``The city's leaders
in revolt, will in the name of liberty, slaughter its inhabitants
without regard to age or sex. There will be screams and howls and
piteous sights.'' Two centuries later this was interpreted as a
prophecy of the drownings of Nantes under the Committee of Public
Safety in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   But being a closet Lutheran in a time of the Inquisitions held
to punish heretics, most of Nostradamus' prophesies were cryptic
and written in a mix of archaic French, Latin, Greek, Italian or
English. Translators contended that the quatrains contained codes,
anagrams, hints and fragments of meaning that, put together, were
predictions of coming events. A reference to a figure named Hister
was taken as code for Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Erika McMahon-Turner was born in London on July 7, 1939, a
daughter of wealthy parents, Eric Turner, under secretary to the
Admiralty, and Helen Lilian McMahon Turner. She attended a convent
school but was expelled for writing an essay contending that God
did not exist. She had an interest even then in the paranormal and
the prophetic. Later, on gaining acceptance to St. Anne's College,
Oxford, she cut a stylish, aristocratic figure, someone who went
riding with the Aga Khan and married a Grenadier Guard, James
Nicholas Milne Cheetham.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving her Ph.D. she became a staff writer for The
London Daily Mail. She wrote an article on Nostradamus in 1961 and
two years later began translating his work in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Her first book appeared in 1965 and became an immediate hit, as
did the other two. Her publishers at Corgi Books were now excited
about Nostradamus as well. ``A very profitable business to be in,''
one was quoted as saying. ``Every publisher should have a
Nostradamus title on their lists. And the beauty of it is that if
you get one of Nostradamus's predictions wrong, you can always
remove it from the next edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at the start of the 1990s at least 10 Nostradamus titles
were in print, and with the advent of the Persian Gulf war,
bookstores in Britain and the United States were selling out, with
total sales tripling in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheetham, however, was ambivalent about the perspicacity of
her hero. Claiming to be a linguist, a scholar and a skeptic, she
once said: ``It's all rubbish, you know. Some of it is so vague and
tortured and you could bend all sorts of events to fit.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times she projected conviction: ``It's a question of
all the portents coming together,'' she said in 1985, ``a pope with
two attempts on his life, two brothers assassinated in the U.S.A.
and the advent of Halley's comet.''
</P>
<P>
   In her periods of skepticism, she was not alone. ``In a
respectable London bookshop last week,'' wrote Francis Wheen in The
Guardian in 1996, ``I was astonished to find an entire section
given over to works by or about Nostradamus, the mumbo-jumbo
merchant.'' The likely explanation, he said, was superstition
linked to the approach of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonbelievers in the more distant past included the
Catholic Church, which in 1781 put ``Centuries'' on its index of
condemned books.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheetham also wrote the screenplay of the 1982 film ``The
Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which Orson Welles played Nostradamus,
and she was a contributor to periodicals and encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   She was divorced in 1980, and is survived by a son, Alexander
Cheetham.

BULLS' DEFENSE LEAVES JAZZ TOTALLY HUMILIATED
</HEADLINE>
 FINALS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Bulls' Last Dance just became their Last
Laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The dysfunctional-yet-dominant Bulls put an unprecedented
whipping on the Utah Jazz and a stranglehold on the NBA Finals
Sunday night with a record-breaking 96-54 Game 3 victory at the
United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago held the Jazz to the fewest points since the invention
of the 24-second shot clock (1954-55) while also producing the most
lopsided margin in Finals history. The Jazz shattered the record
for fewest points in a Finals game (was 71), eclipsed the record
for fewest points in any game (was 55), set marks with 21 field
goals, 23 second-half points and easily topped the largest margin
of defeat (was 35) via the 42-point debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat embarrassed for NBA basketball with the way we
played, with absolutely no fight,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said.
``We couldn't get into our offense. Shoot, we couldn't bring the
ball up the court. They really got after us. I don't remember a
team that quick and good on defense. They ate us alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, who five days ago saw their dynasty supposedly
crumbling in a Finals that coach Phil Jackson refers to as ``our
last dance,'' seized a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series with
the biggest blowout of their championship run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome score to look at,'' admitted Jackson, whose
team has never lost a playoff series in which it held a lead.
``That was one heck of an effort on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly Chicago's best game of the playoffs, and Utah's
worst. That toxic combination produced Bulls leads of more than 30
points throughout the second half and swayed experts to now
consider a Chicago four-game run a real possibility. No home team
in NBA history has swept the middle three games under the 2-3-2
format, but the Bulls have all the momentum heading into
Wednesday's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great performance, but just one game isn't going to
win the series,'' said Michael Jordan, who scored 24 points on only
14 shots and sat icing his knees during a fourth quarter
highlighted by two 3-pointers from reserve Jud Buechler. ``I think
we've sent Utah back to make some adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to Chicago's Six-cess goes through its defense, which
totally suffocated a Utah half-court offense considered one of the
best in the history of basketball. The Jazz, looking more like the
Mavericks' anemic offense of the past two seasons, made 21 baskets
and committed 26 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a game like this can't get you motivated to play, nothing
will,'' said Jazz forward Karl Malone, whose team has lost
consecutive games for the first time since December. ``They played
a hell of a defensive game and we didn't respond. We just got our
butts beat, completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls smothered the Jazz during a first half in which Utah
almost totally unraveled offensively. Even the usually unflappable
John Stockton became frazzled, committing four turnovers and two
silly fouls in the last minute of a half that ended with Chicago
totally in control at 49-31.
</P>
<P>
   Malone drilled his first six shots, but then went scoreless the
last 15:32 of the half against Dennis Rodman's more aggressive,
physical defense. Seemingly in an unstoppable rhythm against Luc
Longley early, Malone traveled, was called for a charge and
launched an awful airball jump-hook in his only second-quarter shot
against Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, dedicated to keeping Stockton out of the middle, also
was successful in taking the Jazz out of its pet pick-and-roll.
Scottie Pippen roamed off Utah's ineffective centers, allowing him
to trap Stockton toward the sideline just past mid-court. Jazz
players not named Malone missed 19 of their first 20 shots _
including 11 in a row _ as Chicago scored the last eight points of
the first quarter for a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two driving runners by Pippen took the lead to seven, from which
point the Bulls' Doberman Defense took over. Perennial
all-defensive team members Rodman, Jordan and Pippen attacked and
stifled Utah into missed layups and an embarrassing back-court
violation by Stockton. At one point, the rattled Jazz had 26 points
and 16 turnovers as they were only able to run seven first-half
pick-and-rolls for eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation point came late in the half as Scott Burrell and
Ron Harper made steals that led to four points in the final 19
seconds to push the lead to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Bulls did make one mistake yesterday. They
should have saved this classic performance for the series clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that really the score?'' Sloan asked when handed a final
statistics sheet. ``It felt like they scored 194.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Going out on top with USC's College World Series
win, recently deposed play-by-play man Larry Kahn and
broadcast/business partner Mike Lamb delivered fairly classy
parting shots at the end of the broadcast on KPLS-AM (830) Saturday
_ which probably whizzed right by anyone in the Valley who had no
chance of picking up the reception from the Orange County station
on their transistors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the majority of the people in the (USC) athletic
department, you were great,'' said Kahn. ``No matter what certain
people like to believe, this is only the beginning. We'll see you
somewhere, folks.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   _'Twas fitting that the last game Kahn was allowed to do as the
radio voice of USC sports was a baseball game that ended up with a
football score....
</P>
<P>
   _It's also prrrrrrretty well known that USC athletic director
Mike ``Get Your &AMP;)$ Outtahere'' Garrett has been trying to shove
Trojans baseball coach Mike Gillespie toward the John Robinson
Memorial Exit Sign for some time. How 'bout now, for another
public-relations blunder? Gillespie will regularly check his phone
machine this offseason....
</P>
<P>
   _Fearing a Sports I!llustrated piece in the works will only
further besmirch Garrett's reputation, USC has sent out a
preemptive strike. Senior VP Dennis Dougherty's office dashed off a
multi-page memo to certain SC alums, explaining how some higher-ups
have been interviewed for this probably slanted story by Don Yeager
(publishing date unknown). They also issued a statement signed by
school prez Steven Sample and other esteemed colleagues pledging
full support for Garrett....

<P>
   _Legal eagles representing recently ousted AM-1150

ANGELS PULL OUT WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Dante Bichette's fly ball to medium left field had the
fans at Edison Field streaming for the exits, if they hadn't left
already.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two runs, the Colorado Rockies were down to their
last out, and Anaheim Angels left fielder Darin Erstad pounded his
glove in anticipation of the club's eighth consecutive victory. The
problem was, Erstad never saw the ball in the twilight sky. It
landed untouched and two baserunners scored on the play to tie the
game at 5.
</P>
<P>
   Bizarre? Not as bizarre as the bottom of the ninth inning, when
the Angels managed to pull out a 6-5 victory Sunday before 42,493
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won the game in the bottom of the ninth when Jim
Edmonds scored from third on a wild pitch that got past
shortstop-turned-catcher Neifi Perez. Perez was forced into playing
catcher after the Rockies pinch-hit for starter Kirt Manwaring in
the top of the ninth, and backup catcher Jeff Reed got knocked out
of the game in a home-plate collision with Dave Hollins earlier in
the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins opened the bottom of the ninth with a walk off Jerry
Dipoto, and Edmonds followed with a liner into the right-center
field gap. Third base coach Larry Bowa waved home Hollins, who
initiated a nasty collision with Reed. Reed held on to the ball but
had a bad cut on his right cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen,'' Rockies manager
Don Baylor said. ``It looks like somebody took a razor to it. It's
three or four inches long. When I went out there, it was almost
like a horror flick.
</P>
<P>
   Reed received 12 stitches to close the wound.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has two emergency catchers _ Jason Bates and Greg
Colbrunn _ but both had already played in the game and were taken
out. Baylor decided to move Perez to catcher because he has good
hands. Perez said he had caught when he was 13, about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dipoto walked Tim Salmon intentionally to bring up Cecil
Fielder. On a 1-1 count, Dipoto threw a slider in the dirt and it
got away from Perez, allowing Edmonds to score the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get him out, I can't throw it not to get it
past him,'' Dipoto said. ``You roll the dice. Neifi's not a
catcher. I know I couldn't go back there.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Angels' eighth in a row, their longest winning
streak since a 10-game streak July 5-17 last season. The victory
also moved the Angels (34-26) to within 2{ games of first-place
Texas in the AL West, the closest they've been since May 8 when
they were two games out. But this was most certainly the strangest
in the streak.
</P>
<P>
   Angels reliever Rich DeLucia was deprived of his first save of
the season when Erstad lost Bichette's fly ball, but he wasn't
about to blame anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no chance in a sky like that,'' DeLucia said. ``The
ball was really dark too. It goes up in that gray sky, with the
lights behind it, it's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Edmonds: ``I never saw it either. But he would have caught
that ball if the game started at 1 o'clock (instead of 5:05).''
</P>
<P>
   Many Angels said the ninth inning was one of the weirdest
innings they've ever played in, but not Hollins, who played for the
Phillies in the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crazy inning,'' he said. ``I haven't seen anything
like that since I was in Philly and Mitch (Williams) was pitching.
It was every other night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ninth inning was amazing,'' DeLucia said. ``That's what
makes baseball exciting. You've got a completely normal game for
eight innings, and boom! Something like that happens.''

HUMBLING DEFEAT ISN'T A FIRST FOR UTAH
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When the Utah Jazz tumbles, it certainly isn't humble.
</P>
<P>
   Included among Utah's playoff losses this season: a then-record
62 points in a 21-point setback in Game 3 against San Antonio in
the Western Conference semifinals on May 9, and setting all kinds
of negative records including fewest points ever in a game and
worst margin of defeat in Sunday night's Game 3 Finals loss to the
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butt kicked in every facet of the game,'' Jazz
center Greg Foster said. ``What do we need to do? Play basketball,
first off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Greg Ostertag, ``In the second half, we sort of quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz responded to the awful against the Spurs by winning
Game 4 the next day, then reeling off seven consecutive victories.
Despite Sunday night's unprecedented debacle, they were already
talking about a revival in Wednesday's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some players _ and even coach Jerry Sloan _ mentioned they will
use Chicago's fourth-quarter performance as motivation. The Bulls
rested their starters, but reserves Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler
took _ and made _ 3-pointers even after the lead climbed past 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were shooting threes and trying to bury us, I
expect us to be very competitive the next game,'' Sloan said. ``If
we're not ready after a game like this, we'll get blown out of this
building again.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Adam Keefe said, ``We laid down out there. It will go
down in Chicago history like the Valentine's Day massacre. It was a
sick effort on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   In their past five quarters against the Bulls, the Jazz have 69
points. They are averaging 76 points in the three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to feel sorry for us,'' said Karl Malone. ``But
if we're not ready to bounce back after this we need to find a new
profession.'' RUNNING OF THE BULLS
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, despite the odds, the Worm is turning. Tammy Castillo,
a mother of three from Twin Falls, Idaho, claims Dennis Rodman is
the only of 50 professional athletes to oblige her requests of an
autograph for her autistic son. Rodman apparently sent the family
an autographed jersey and a basketball signed by each of the Bulls.
... Jordan produced his signature move of the series in the third
quarter. While being tackled by 7-foot-2 center Greg Ostertag, he
stayed in the air long enough to flip up a right-handed reverse
layup that swished through the hoop. ALL THAT JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   Foster has been a non-factor, producing only two points in 45
minutes in the Finals. ... The Jazz have been miserable in the
fourth quarter, getting outscored, 67-36. ... Ostertag started at
center in an attempt to help clog the defensive lane, but he
struggled with his vision because of a contact lense problem and
struggled with his layups because of coordination problem. ... For
the first time this season, the Jazz has lost consecutive games
with John Stockton in the lineup. INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's playoff record at the United Center: 32-4.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's average points allowed in their past four fourth
quarters: 13.5 HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael's resolve is so extraordinary and unique. He's one of
the few athletes that when you're talking about a will to win, it's
real and it's powerful.'''' _ Motivational expert and Bulls fan
Tony Robbins.

LORNE WELCH, RAF PILOT AND ESCAPE ARTIST, DIES AT 81 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lorne Welch, a crack British glider pilot and yachtsman who
played parts in two of the most storied escapes by Allied prisoners
during World War II, died on May 15 at his home in Farnham,
England. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   A prisoner of war with uncommon flair, Welch was being held at
the Stalagluft III prison camp in Silesia when he rigged the tunnel
ventilation system that was used in one of the largest mass
breakouts by Allied prisoners during the war, an incident that
became the subject of the 1963 movie ``The Great Escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a prisoner at Colditz, the 700-room Saxon castle the
Nazis used to hold incorrigible escape artists, he helped design a
two-man glider with a 32-foot wingspan that was to be launched from
one of the castle's towers. It was never tested because the
prisoners were liberated by American troops before an attempt could
be made.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Welch became the first man to glide twice across
the English Channel and to fly with the British team in four world
gliding championships.
</P>
<P>
   As the son of a general in the British army, Welch seems to have
gravitated to aviation in part as an act of rebellion against the
father who had named him Patrick Palles Lorne Ephinstone Welch.
</P>
<P>
   After secondary schooling at Stowe, Welch, who had an instinct
for solving technical problems but no formal training as an
engineer, worked with both marine and aircraft engines, designed
and built a sailing dinghy and flew gilders before joining the
Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve just in time to qualify as a
flight instructor at the outbreak of war in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He might have remained safely on training duty if, in May 1942,
the British had not announced plans to launch 1,000 bomber raids on
Nazi Germany, a strategy that required the services of virtually
every military plane and pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Welch first fell into German hands in 1942, when his plane
crash-landed in a field in the Netherlands during his fourth
mission. Rather than flee, Welch chose to remain with his injured
bombardier and allowed himself to be taken prisoner. After the
wounded flier had been taken to a hospital, Welch made a bid for
freedom, breaking away at the Amsterdam train station. But, when
his pursuers fired into the crowd, he gave himself up in order to
save the lives of the civilians.
</P>
<P>
   His next stop was Stalagluft III, where he was recruited into a
escape plot organized by Roger Bushell, the South African squadron
leader known as ``Big X,'' Welch was assigned to build a
ventilation system for Harry, one of three 300-foot tunnels being
dug 30 feet beneath the ground. With his usual ingenuity, Welch
used parts of two beds, two dufflebags, nine coathooks, four hockey
sticks, four ping-pong paddles and a bit of shoe leather to
construct a bellows system connected to the tunnel by a series of
linked powdered-milk cans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 76 men who made their way through Harry the night of
March 24, 1944, only 3 made it safely to freedom. Of the 73 who
were recaptured, 50 were summarily executed on direct orders from
Hitler, an atrocity that was avenged after the war when the
executioners were caught and hanged for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For all his contribution to the great escape, Welch was not
among those who went through the tunnel. Months earlier, on June
16, 1943, he and 23 other officers pretending to be on delousing
duty had simply walked out through the main gate, wearing fake
German uniforms made in a secret prison tailor shop.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Welch and a fellow British officer found a German
airfield and were on the verge of stealing a plane to fly to Sweden
when they were surprised by the plane's crew, who might have taken
them prisoner had they taken a closer look at their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the pair made a second attempt to steal a plane and
this time they were taken prisoner and packed off to Colditz.
</P>
<P>
   With its high thick walls soaring above mountain bluffs and with
more guards than prisoners, Colditz was considered escape-proof.
But of 191 recorded escape attempts, 31 were successful. Indeed,
for all the German precautions, it was a tribute to the prisoners'
ingenuity that it was not until half a century later that workmen
found a secret radio that had kept the prisoners abreast of war
news.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most audacious of the escape plots was the
construction of a full-sized, two-man glider in a walled-off
section of the castle attic. Welch used his technical expertise to
verify that the glider _ made of bed slats covered with
millet-treated sleeping-bag cloth _ would withstand the stresses of
flight, including being launched by a catapult powered by the
five-floor drop of a concrete-filled bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Although the glider's design was later judged airworthy by
aviation experts, what might have been the most spectacular escape
of the war was made unnecessary by the arrival of American forces
in April 1945. As the Colditz guards watched in sheepish disbelief,
Welch and other prisoners showed off the glider in the castle
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Welch worked on rocket engines, then became a
gliding instructor and wrote several books on gliding.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ann, and a daughter.

COWBOYS' IRVIN ENJOYING A QUIET RENAISSANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after citing ``a loss of passion for the game'' and
contemplating retirement, Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin is looking
and sounding like ``The Playmaker'' again.
</P>
<P>
   No member of the defensive backfield is spared from trash
talking. The locker room is infused with his hearty laugh and
boastful jabs with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And fellow Cowboys receivers are straining to keep up with his
legendary workout regimen, which has included extra pass patterns
after practice to become familiar with coach Chan Gailey's new
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who is admittedly having an enjoyable and productive
off-season for the first time in two years, said he is motivated
for himself and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he ``cheated'' the Cowboys because of his limited
off-season work in recent years and plans to make amends in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to end up cheating the guys because I didn't
know if I could give it everything I got,'' Irvin said. ``And to be
totally honest with you, I ended up cheating the guys anyway
because I wasn't here all off-season to train like I needed to
train. I wasn't here to show the young guys this is what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to try as much as I can to make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin declines to discuss the multitude of strife in 1996 and
1997 _ including him pleading no contest to felony drug possession
charges, being suspended for the first five games of 1996 for
violating the league's substance abuse policy and then enduring the
ordeal of being falsely accused of sexual assault in 1997 leading
to last season's retirement talk _ that kept him from the Cowboys'
past two off-season programs.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin only chooses to talk about football these days.
</P>
<P>
   And strange as it may seem, the story with Irvin heading into
the start of Cowboys training camp July 15 in Wichita Falls has
been all about football and how productive he could be in Gailey's
new offense after substandard performances the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin had the finest season of his career in 1995 when he caught
111 passes for 1,603 yards and 11 touchdowns. He followed that up
with 64 catches for 962 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games in
1996 and 75 catches for 1,180 yards and nine touchdowns in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the off-season work will result in him regaining his
All-Pro form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about my off-season,'' Irvin said. ``A lot of
people don't know what that means. I need the practice to be at my
best and I really haven't had an off-season in two years. Two years
ago I was in the middle of that mess. And last year, I quite
honestly didn't think I was going to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   That Irvin wants to play is certainly embodied by his unyielding
intensity and unmatched work ethic that teammates say has energized
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was a guy who set the standard,'' Cowboys receiver Billy
Davis said. ``He was a meter stick to where this team's mentality
was going. It was disappointing not having him around. If affected
the team, our mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having him back reminds us of what it takes to get where we
need to go. Myself and the other receivers have taken hold of that
and just upped our game and the level of intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey fully understands that any distractions could have
negatively impacted the implementation of his new offense and
potentially sabotaged his inaugural season. But Gailey said he is
not surprised by Irvin's positive influence; he expected nothing
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't evaluate the past because I look for the best in
people,'' Gailey said. ``I expect people's best. And Michael has
set a standard of work out here. He helps create a good learning
and conditioning situation. And I expect him to have a great
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin credits much of his enthusiasm to the new coaching staff
and Gailey's new offense, which will feature Irvin lining up in the
backfield and at slot receiver in addition to his regular outside
receiver position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to playing under Chan and seeing what we
can do with this offense,'' Irvin said. ``I am not running new
routes but I'm running them from different places. So defenses
won't know where I'm lining up all the time. Our old offense was
good for us, but we probably needed that change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emmitt Smith and I were talking about it on the field the
other day. We are all looking forward to change. Change is good for
us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the tumultuous past seasons, nobody symbolizes
change more than Irvin's off-season. And the Cowboys couldn't be
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is a very good friend and I think a lot of him,''
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``From a personal standpoint,
not to see him occupied with some of the off-the-field activities
that he's had over the last couple of years is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have really gotten his life on the right track and
is heading down the right path. From that standpoint I'm very proud
of him and happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, cautiously appreciative for what so
far has been an off-season free of incidence from any of his
players, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of knowing we could get a call tonight, it feels
good,'' Jones said. ``But that's an ongoing challenge. But I have
seen a change in Michael because he is as mentally tough as anybody
I've known and a smart person. When a smart individual experiences
some of the lessons that Michael has experienced, they learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, some of this I may be reading into. But I see a guy that
has been to war in a lot of different ways yet still has the skill
and competitive heart. But is also a veteran of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones says what can be said of Irvin can be said of the team on
and off the field. He believes the changed Cowboys will result in
regaining some past glory in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look out there at minicamp a year ago,'' Jones said. ``And
there Michael was with his issues. \RCornerback\S Deion Sanders was
playing baseball. Even if he is rehabbing his ankle. He is here.
Emmitt is here playing at full speed. Last year he was rehabbing.
And \Rdefensive tackle\S Leon Lett wasn't going to join us until
Thanksgiving \Rbecause of a substance abuse suspension\S. Not just
Michael, looking at everybody out here and their attitude, that
alone will get you fired up. We have been focused on what's
happening on the football field and getting better out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is helping our enthusiasm and making everything
positive. Change can be very good.''

BULLS DO A NUMBER ON JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Watch them closely the rest of this week, because it
might be over before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls of the 1990s are what the Beatles were during the
1960s and Chicago's swan song is beginning to sound like Side 2 of
the ``Abbey Road'' album. The Bulls are playing one final jam of
perfect music before Jerry Krause pulls a Yoko Ono and breaks up
the band.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's march toward a third straight title, and a sixth of
this decade (is there any doubt it would be eight straight if not
for Michael Jordan's baseball flirtation?), took a dramatic step
forward Sunday night at the United Center when the Bulls dismantled
the Utah Jazz, 96-54, to take a 2-1 lead in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, folks. 96-54. Utah set a record for Finals
futility, shattering the previous low score of 71 (last done by
Houston against the Celtics in 1981). It was the worst beating in
the history of the NBA Finals, surpassing Washington's 35-point
drubbing of the Sonics in 1978. Utah's point total was the lowest
in the history of the post-shot-clock NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly. Really ugly. Utah committed 26 turnovers and made only 21
of 70 shots (30 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat embarrassed for NBA basketball,'' admitted Utah
coach Jerry Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Jazz can rally like the Celtics did in 1984, winning
three of the last four after getting humiliated in Games 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't feel like that. Working on nine days of rest,
the Jazz had to go into overtime to beat the weary Bulls in Game 1,
then lost Game 2 on their home court. Sunday night the series
shifted to the Windy City and there were stretches in the second
half when it looked like the Jazz were ready to roll over and quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really starting to look good and I like that,'' said
Jordan, who had 24 points. ``It's a fortunate time to start looking
good. I've always said that defense wins championships. I think we
have a good feel for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to overstate the magnitute of the beating.
Chicago's vaunted defense completely smothered the Jazz. Chicago
led, 17-14 after one, 49-31 at halftime, and 72-45 at the end of
three. Imagine a team in the NBA Finals scoring only 45 points in
three quarters?
</P>
<P>
   Utah fans could only be shocked and chagrined. Mortified and
stupified.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a game like this can't get you motivated to play, nothing
else will, so we'll see what happens,'' said Utah's Karl Malone,
who had 22 points. ``They had a hell of a defensive game and we
didn't respond. We don't have any excuses at all. We just got our
butts beat and didn't respond as a team. In this game here, we got
exactly what we deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone came out of his shooting slump, connecting on eight of 11
attempts, but he rarely saw the ball in the second half and his
teammates shot 13 for 59 (22 percent) without him. Credit Jordan,
Scottie Pippen, and Ron Harper, the Bulls' Doberman Defense. Pippen
played free safety most of the night, destroying everything that
got in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie's capable of being a one-man wrecking crew,'' said
Chicago coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The worst patch for the Jazz came at the end of the third period
when Chicago's venerable veteran Harper (8 points, 10 rebounds)
grabbed a quick rebound and fired a no-look full-court pass to a
breaking Scott Burrell. The immortal Burrell slammed it home to
make the score 66-42. Utah came down and the frustrated Malone
immediately was flagged for elbowing Dennis Rodman in the face. It
was Malone's fourth foul, and the Jazz called time to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   After the timeout, Jordan went into the low post and hit a
turnaround over Chris Morris. Then Rodman followed his own miss
with his only 2 points of the night and it was a hideous 70-42.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the fourth quarter, the Jazz had Shandon
Anderson, Howard Eisley, Antoine Carr, Morris, and the immortal
Adam Keefe on the floor. Not one starter. It was a message of
sorts. This one was over, and Sloan, a proud warrior, already was
thinking about the next game. Garbage time was particularly nasty
for the Jazz. Jordan's services were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can accept losing,'' said Sloan. ``But's it's always a
disappointment of not playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The first period featured more bricks than one would find under
the ivy at Wrigley Field. The Bulls made six of 18, while the Jazz
struggled to hit seven of 22 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, after shooting 14 for 41 in the first two games of the
series, came out with something to prove and made his first five
shots, four of them jumpers. Unfortunately for the Jazz, no one
else in purple could do much of anything and Utah fell behind,
17-14, even though the Bulls shot only 33 percent. Utah was worse.
Take away Malone's 6 for 6, and the Jazz made only one of 16 shots
in the period.
</P>
<P>
   It was a testament to Bulls basketball. Chicago missed 10 of its
first 12 shots, but still held serve. Luc Longley scored a
team-high 6 point in the first quarter, and Harper snagged six
rebounds. Malone had 12 of Utah's 14 points. John Stockton had the
other basket.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have known the embarrassment waiting for the Jazz in
the next three quarters?
</P>
<P>
   The first two games of this series provided no warning for
Sunday night's massacre. Now it's up to the once-favored Jazz to
see if they can respond with a victory in Chicago, or at least a
more noble defeat. Utah has too much experience, class, and dignity
to go out like this.

RANGERS' BULLPEN SELF-DESTRUCTS IN LOSS TO PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It was ironic that it was bat day Sunday at
The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, because the San Diego Padres didn't really need their
pieces of wood when they mounted their winning rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres defeated the Texas Rangers, 17-8, before a sellout
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But the Padres did most of their damage in a six-run eighth
inning with their bats on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson relieved Eric Gunderson with one out and nobody
on in the eighth, after the Rangers had scored three runs in the
seventh to tie the score, 6-6. Patterson faced five batters and
walked four of them, forcing in two runs. The other batter he
faced, Wally Joyner, bucked the trend and actually used his bat to
hit a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exhibition of how not to pitch,'' said Patterson
(1-2), who took the loss. ``I couldn't find it. I couldn't find the
groove at all. Not giving us a chance, that hurts. If they hit the
ball, fine. But if you walk four guys, that's hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The walk on the wild side left Patterson with a rather ugly
looking line: Five batters faced, no outs, one hit, four walks and
five earned runs, the final ones scoring when relievers Tim
Crabtree and Scott Bailes allowed the inherited runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was not the only reliever who couldn't get the job
done in the last two innings. Crabtree allowed a hit to Mark
Sweeney that allowed two of Patterson's runners to score, and
Bailes allowed two hits that got home Crabtree's runner. Steve
Finley had four hits, including three doubles, and drove in five
runs for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine, recalled from Triple-A earlier in the day when second
baseman Mark McLemore went on the disabled list, allowed five runs
on five hits in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the four relievers allowed 11 runs on nine hits and
five walks in the final two innings, all after Will Clark's
three-run homer in the seventh had brought the Rangers back from a
6-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we got to a point in the ballgame where we've
been successful,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Our bullpen's been
one of our strengths and we got the matchups we wanted. We just
couldn't throw strikes at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncharacteristic performance. The relief corps entered
the game having earned six of the team's past 10 victories and had
a 2.72 earned-run average in the past 13 games. Coming into the
game, the Rangers had the lowest bullpen ERA in the league at 3.13.
</P>
<P>
   It also was an uncharacteristic performance from Patterson, who
entered the game with a 2.70 ERA. The right-hander had walked five
batters in 20 innings, and never had walked more than three in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Padres, he found the strike zone with only eight
of his 25 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm felt fine,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with last
year's surgery. It was purely mechanical. Those things you can work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are no physical problems as a result of an
off-season shoulder operation, Patterson said he doesn't feel as
well as he did last season, when he was 10-6 with a 3.42 ERA in 54
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't felt it,'' he said. ``I've been getting the job
done, but I haven't been comfortable all season. I'll just keep
working at it. That's all you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like it would come down to Patterson and the
bullpen when the Padres erased a 3-2 deficit with four runs in the
fifth. The big blow was a three-run homer by Greg Vaughn on a
belt-high, hanging slider by Rangers starter Bobby Witt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got back in it with Clark's three-run homer to
center off Dennis Reyes, who was pitching in relief of Padres
starter Mark Langston. But Dan Miceli then came in for Reyes, and
held the Texas batters in check.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Rangers, Patterson and company failed to
do the same thing.

AVERY MAKES PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ In the good times and bad, lefthander Steve Avery
always insisted he was a better pitcher than his time with the Red
Sox indicated. Finally, it's starting to happen for him.
</P>
<P>
   What he did in his fourth start of the year, a 5-0 victory over
the New York Mets Sunday night at Fenway Park, was something the
Red Sox have wanted to see for a year and a half. He had prime-time
stuff, using a revised motion. Twice he snuffed out New York
rallies in situations where in the past he has folded like an
accordian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Avery was great,'' said first baseman Mo Vaughn.
``Whenever he got himself into situations, he made his pitches.
It's good to win this one. We had good pitching to go with some
timely hitting. If you want to win, that's what you've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jimy Williams sent Avery out for a start last September, it
triggered an option year in the pitcher's contract. The move was
controversial, and the Sox had to hope he would overcome health
problems and turn into a hurler who could give them some quality
starts and innings. Sunday night, he gave them his best outing
since a 3-1 victory over Cleveland last July 21, a seven-inning
stint that helped Boston salvage the final game of a three-game
series.
</P>
<P>
   When he went 7 2/3 innings against the Indians, Avery was an
over-the-top fastball pitcher. Sunday night, using a new release
point, he was more a crafty veteran. In the fourth inning, just
minutes after his teammates had just given him a 4-0 lead, Avery
put runners on first and third with none out. He escaped. In the
seventh, he put two runners on with one out, and again New York
failed to score. He left after throwing just 84 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nice to throw strikes,'' said Avery. ``It's nice to go
after hitters. It's nice to win. It relaxes people going into a
tough Atlanta series. The motion I use now adds movement to my
fastball, which is something I never had. Even when I threw the
ball hard, I never had movement. I keep the ball down better. I get
guys to swing at more low pitches. My changeup is more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery's changeup and curve are more effective when his fastball
is better. He threw 24 changeups, 18 for strikes. That's big for a
guy who decided to give the new motion a try only last Tuesday in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We experimented in Toronto,'' said Sox catcher Scott
Hatteberg. ``He was kinda in and out. Today, he was better. He got
out (of rhythm) just a few times and got right back in it. He had
more velocity and more movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery retired the first nine batters he faced. Then, in the top
of the fourth, he gave up a 420-foot triple to Brian McRae and an
infield single to Edgardo Alfonzo, McRae holding. But Avery got
Bernard Gilkey to fly to short right, with both runners holding.
And as John Olerud struck out on a 3-2 pitch, Hatteberg not only
caught the foul tip but threw a bullet to second base, cutting down
Gilkey for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big,'' said Williams. ``We'd just scored four runs,
and you want to keep the momentum in your corner. The strikeout and
throw to second kept things going our way. Olerud ticked that ball.
Hatteberg caught it and made a perfect throw.''
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan made a brief
visit to the mound. Avery apparently got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a pitcher has never thrown from a certain angle, it might
be tough to retain that angle all the time,'' said Williams.
``Maybe you need a reminder, and that's why Joe went out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he did a nice job keeping that angle. I thought his
fastball really came out of his hands nice, which helps his
changeup. He kept it down and he also threw some breaking balls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox put it away in the third, sending nine batters to the
plate against Masato Yoshii, the veteran Japanese hurler. All four
runs scored after two were out.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis started it with a line single off the Wall. Lewis
stole second and scored on a single up the middle by Reggie
Jefferson. Nomar Garciaparra doubled into the left-field corner,
sending Jefferson to third. After a walk to Vaughn, Troy O'Leary
followed with a base hit to center, scoring Jefferson and
Garciaparra and sending Vaughn to third. Then John Valentin doubled
to right, scoring Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit a solo home run in the fifth, his 18th of the season.

`RACING GODS' WILL SOON GIVE IN TO TRIPLE CROWN PURSUERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ It is merely a tongue-in-cheek notion designed to
help explain the inexplicable, this concept of ``racing gods'' that
oversee thoroughbred racing and conspire to deny the Triple Crown
to good-but-not-great horses like Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't real, of course. But sometimes it makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   There was Real Quiet, cruising strongly on a four-length lead in
Saturday's Belmont Stakes after delivering the same devastating
blow that knocked out his opponents in the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness Stakes. He was surely cruising toward a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a twinkling of an eye, Real Quiet was suddenly running
in slow motion when compared to the charging Victory Gallop. His
commanding lead shrinking to three lengths, two, one and finally a
random bobbing of heads.
</P>
<P>
   He still could have won it, of course. A jump before the wire,
his head was down and Victory Gallop's was up, as the two horses
were in asynchronous strides. A jump after the wire, his head was
in front, too.
</P>
<P>
   But at the only time and place that counted, Victory Gallop's
head was down at the precise instant the horses flashed across the
Belmont Park finish.
</P>
<P>
   Before the race, more than a few handicappers picked against
Real Quiet simply because he didn't have the same uncommon talent
as Secretariat or Seattle Slew or Affirmed. Some instead chose
Victory Gallop, others took Raffie's Majesty or even _ in a huge
stretch of logic _ Parade Ground. But the underlying theory was the
same: something unlucky or unexpected would occur to bring about
Real Quiet's defeat. The racing gods would see to that.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet became the only horse in the 130-year history of the
mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes to blow a four-length lead in the
final furlong.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case ``The Fish'' still managed to thumb his nose at
history by keeping it in front, we discover that the racing gods
must believe in insurance: he would have been disqualified, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Preston, one of three Houston brothers who own Victory
Gallop, praised Real Quiet in a post-race news conference. At one
point, he described Real Quiet as a ``super horse,'' but he quickly
corrected himself lest he be struck by a bolt of blue lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really not, we have to say,'' Preston added. ``This
proves that he is not a Triple Crown horse, or he wouldn't have let
us beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for these racing gods, here is a warning: your power will be
sorely tested in upcoming years.
</P>
<P>
   As the modern thoroughbred continues to become increasingly
fragile due to indiscriminate breeding practices, horses such as
Silver Charm and Real Quiet will pop up with regularity. They don't
break watches or cause jaws to drop. But the more expensive,
fashionably-bred colts will continue to be exiled to the farm with
condylar fractures, bone chips or broken sesamoids _ only to begin
a stud career and beget even more unsound horses _ while the Real
Quiets of the sport will succeed by virtue of their durability.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, one or more of these horses will slip through the
filter and win a Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it wasn't this year.

RAMOS IS IN THE THICK OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOCCER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAINT-JEAN-D'ARDIERES, France _ When he crosses the manicured
yard behind the Chateau de Pizay, the killer geese at the pond flap
and squawk at him. Tab Ramos gives them no argument. ``I'm just
happy I'm here,'' he says. ``Because three months ago I didn't know
if I'd ever get here.''
</P>
<P>
   The right knee Ramos had torn up twice in less than a year was
still as stiff and cranky then as the Tin Woodsman's. US men's
soccer coach Steve Sampson had his World Cup candidates in camp and
the clock was ticking. Sampson had said he'd wait for Ramos until
the 11th hour, but ...
</P>
<P>
   No promises. No promises that the 31-year-old Ramos would get a
spot on the 22-man roster. And now that he's here, living with his
fellow Yanks in an ivy-covered castle in the middle of Beaujolais
country, there's no guarantee that Ramos will start when the
Americans take on Germany in Paris a week from Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be on the field,'' says the man who didn't
leave it last time until a Brazilian defender fractured his skull
with a cheap elbow. ``But you have to earn your spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos's spot used to be in the middle of the intersection,
dribbling and distributing. But that was before he tore his ACL in
a Cup qualifier at Trinidad two Novembers ago, then did it again
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now Claudio Reyna, who went to Ramos's old high school (St.
Benedict's Prep in Newark), has taken over at playmaker and Sampson
isn't sure he can start two men who aren't used to sharing one
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson dumped captain John Harkes this spring because Harkes
didn't want to take a defensive supporting role behind Reyna. That
won't be a problem with Ramos. ``I'm not in a position to choose
anything,'' he says. ``I'll play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there aren't enough midfield jobs to go around.
There are six of them in Sampson's 3-6-1 formation, and if Ramos
can't be the playmaker, he'll find something else to be. Reyna
won't be tripping over Ramos's feet _ or his ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has 22 players better than all our players,'' Ramos
says. ``And they don't get in each other's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos has been wearing a US jersey since he played in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul. He's one of three players left from the 1990 Cup
team and second only to Cobi Jones among capped midfielders. He
knows how to adjust to whatever circumstance throws at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two different coaches when I played in Spain,'' Ramos
says with a shrug. ``In Mexico, I had three coaches in two years.
Systems and players change all the time. Soccer stays the same.
Either you can play or you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Ramos couldn't adjust to was getting hurt. He was
at the top of his game two years ago when he shredded his knee the
first time. Coincidence or not, the Americans then went 2-2-4 in
Cup qualifiers without him after being 3-0-0 with him.
</P>
<P>
   When Ramos came back, he scored the team's best goal of the year
to beat Costa Rica, 1-0. Six weeks later, he ruined the knee again
and doctors told him he might not make it back for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hardest time for me,'' Ramos says. ``Getting
hurt, being out for so long, coming back, getting hurt again, then
coming back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Sampson saw Ramos in action a couple of times this spring,
there was no question he'd have a roster spot. ``It's been amazing
how he's come back,'' marvels Reyna. ``He's been the same old Tab
he always was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos wishes he had a couple more months to get ready. He wishes
he had the luxury of making a few mistakes in friendly matches. He
wishes he hadn't been moved back to GO with so little time to prove
himself _ again.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a jersey with the familiar ``10'' on the back and the
privilege of being harassed by French geese. ``Am I disappointed?''
Tab Ramos says. ``I don't think that can come out of my mouth.''

STARS' ZUBOV ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF FELONY ASSAULT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov was arrested by Coppell
police early Sunday morning on suspicion of assaulting his wife
Irina and exhibiting a ``deadly weapon,'' police said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was released from custody Sunday and police issued a brief
statement. When asked if Zubov had been arraigned, a police
dispatcher said the department could not comment further than what
was contained in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said officers were called to the 1000 block of
Gibbs Crossing at 3:05 a.m. Sunday in reference to a 911 hangup.
</P>
<P>
   ``After an initial investigation, it was determined an assault
had occurred and, during the assault, a deadly weapon was
exhibited,'' the police statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault-family
violence, a second-degree felony.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov, 27, completed his second season with the Stars _ his
sixth NHL season _ Friday when the Stars lost in Detroit,
eliminating them from the playoffs in the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey said the Stars have talked to
Sergei and Irina Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in touch with all the parties, and we realize the
seriousness of the situation,'' Gainey said. ``We've tried to
support all of the people in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubov's agent, Jay Grossman, said he could not comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the 1994 Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers,
Zubov is among the Stars' top performers and was tied for second in
the NHL this season in points by a defenseman with 57. He was the
Stars' second-leading scorer behind Mike Modano in the playoffs
with nine points in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Moscow, Zubov came to the Stars in a 1996 trade with
Pittsburgh. He is under contract for two more seasons.

   ELMONT, N.Y. _ It was difficult to watch a Triple Crown triumph
slip away in the last few yards of a 1 1/2-mile race. Racing fans,
80,162 strong, came out to Belmont Park to see history made
Saturday, and they were denied that experience at the wire.
However, it could have been worse. Instead of losing his Triple
Crown bid on the track, Real Quiet could have lost it in the
stewards' stand, and that would have been truly ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness and was
attempting to become the 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont
Stakes, zipped past the eighth pole with a 4-length lead. But it
was not meant to be as Victory Gallop, second in the Derby and
Preakness, closed strongly on him, survived two bumps, the second
of which was more than sufficient to cause a disqualification, and
prevailed by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Had the photo gone the other way, the stewards said they would
have had to take Real Quiet, the 4-5 favorite, down, depriving him
of the sport's greatest honor and depriving his connections of the
$5 million Triple Crown bonus. Had the three stewards acted,
politics would have intruded on the scene and conspiracy theorists
would have abounded. It was unfortunate for those who appreciate
the sweep of history that Real Quiet was defeated, but he is not
the greatest horse ever to stick his head through a bridle, and it
was better that he lost to Victory Gallop's charge than to the
stewards' votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we got beat,'' said Elliott Walden, trainer of
Victory Gallop, Sunday. ``I thought he was going to get by a little
easier. It did seem like the bumps stopped his momentum. It wasn't
about trying to beat Real Quiet or Bob Baffert (Real Quiet's
trainer). It would have been difficult to be second in all three
Triple Crown races, especially when you think you're due. Nothing's
going to change. I'll just keep taking care of business and play
with my kids. I'm blessed to have a horse like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden, who is an excellent Kentucky horseman, did an
outstanding job of getting Victory Gallop from the Preakness to the
Belmont in top shape. After the Preakness, Victory Gallop developed
a skin rash, caused by ringworm, and lost weight. But he was
dead-fit for the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week went very well for Victory Gallop,'' said Walden.
``The skin rash cleared up the way it was supposed to. After the
Preakness, it didn't look like we could move with Real Quiet and
get by him. But we tried to learn from that and we made our move
late this time. I'm so happy for the Prestons (brothers Art, Jack
and Jan of Prestonwood Farm) and everyone who gets up every day amd
works for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who is media savvy, took the high road immediately
after the race and Sunday. ``When something like this happens,
there is nothing you can do but take your butt-kickin' and go
home,'' he said. ``It was a great day and a great race. Now, we
just have to regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert trains Silver Charm, who lost the Belmont to Touch Gold
nearing the wire last year, which also cost Baffert the Triple
Crown and his share of the $5 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting closer,'' he said. ``We'll get it down one of
these times. It's disappointing, it's a letdown because you get
this far. But I still think I would have felt worse if this had
happened in the Kentucky Derby. The Belmont was about history and
the fans. It was there and we had it. But what can you do? You
can't re-run the race. I wouldn't do anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, who rode Real Quiet and was outfinished by Gary
Stevens on Victory Gallop, criticized himself for moving too soon
entering the far turn. Frankly, he also was a little wider than he
needed to be, but Baffert refused to rip Desormeaux's ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot tougher on Kent,'' Baffert said. ``(Saturday
night), he was really taking it hard. Kent is a very emotional guy.
He rode great. I'm glad it turned out the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been worse if we had gotten our number taken
down. Gary is not the kind of guy to claim foul for no reason. He
told me that he put the race on hold (requested that the stewards
delay making it official) because the photo could have gone either
way and Real Quiet had come out on him. The inquiry took so much
time, I thought maybe Victory Gallop came in on us. I did not want
to win this on a disqualification and I wouldn't have wanted to
have lost it on a disqualification. And everyone who saw the race
would have hated to have been a steward and have to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that both Real Quiet and Victory Gallop ran hard,
winning races. It's pretty gratifying for a trainer to know that
his horse didn't pack it in at the top of the lane like some of the
others' horses. The fans saw a horse race all the way to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next for Victory Gallop most likely will be the $1 million
Haskell Invitational, going 1 1/8 miles at Monmouth Aug. 9. Among
his opponents there could be Indian Charlie, another top 3-year-old
trained by Baffert, and Coronado's Quest, the talented colt trained
by Shug McGaughey who won the Riva Ridge Stakes on the Belmont
undercard. Real Quiet might go to the $750,000 Travers Stakes, at a
mile and one-quarter at Saratoga Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet became the 14th horse to lose the Triple Crown in the
Belmont and the sixth since the last successful bid by Affirmed in
1978. Since Affirmed beat Alydar in a classic stretch battle,
Spectacular Bid (1979), Pleasant Colony (1981), Alysheba (1987),
Sunday Silence (1989), Silver Charm (1997), and Real Quiet have
failed.

CAMP HELPS MOLD CLAY, PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Willie Clay is grateful that only one of the
major defections from the Patriots this offseason came on defense,
cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock, who was dealt to the Minnesota Vikings
for a third-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   For if more had, Clay knows the defense would have felt the
impact, much like the offense knows it will now.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the guys we lost were quality leaders and veterans and
people who made our team better,'' said Clay. ``We lost a great
deal of leadership when we lost Dave Meggett, Keith Byars, Sam
Gash, and Curtis Martin. It's very difficult to compensate for the
loss of a Meggett, who was just a great team player and someone who
could go around the locker room and just get everybody going.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in a situation like that is you feel it the most
in the huddle. With Dave or Sam or Keith, you'd have someone who
could step up and say something when something needed to be said.
Curtis wasn't a vocal guy, but he had the respect of everyone on
the team because of the way he went about preparing for a game and
the way he conducted himself on and off the field. Now, somebody
else is going to have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay, who Sunday took part in the final day of mandatory
minicamp before more than 22,000 season ticket-holders at Foxboro
Stadium, said he also will miss Hitchcock, a neighbor in the locker
room and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy was a friend and someone I really enjoyed being
around,'' said Clay. ``He played very well for us last year. Now we
have to go about replacing that spot on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised by the defections, Clay said,
``Nothing surprises me anymore. People come and go and trades and
free agency are part of the game. Sometimes they're not easy to
figure out, but all I know is that it's over now. It's happened and
there's nothing we can do about it. Now we have to think of how to
replace those people and go from there. There's no use in going
backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay, a safety, is concerned about the right cornerback
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get the job done at that position, whether it's
one guy or by committee,'' he said. ``If it's by committee, so be
it. Someone has to step up and hold up their end at that position,
because you're going to see 10 other positions where people are
going to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Because first-round draft pick Tebucky Jones was injured early
in Friday's session (pulled left hamstring), Clay didn't have a
chance to form an early opinion as to whether Jones can handle the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell,'' said Clay. ``We have a veteran like Steve
Israel ready to step in if he's healthy and Chris Canty has learned
a lot over the past year. It's up to Tebucky, I guess. He's going
to get the opportunity to show everyone he can play there. It's too
bad he got hurt because a young kid needs all the time he can when
he first comes into the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any ``stars'' of the earlier rookie camp and the
minicamp, they were the young cornerbacks. Penn State's Mark Tate,
who spent much of last year on the practice squad, Kato Serwanga, a
free agent from California, and Terry Billups, a free agent from
North Carolina, all were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Canty, who had been buried on the left side behind Ty Law, had a
chance to play with the first defense at right corner during
minicamp and played well. He's trying to change the opinions of
those who believe the Patriots made a mistake by making him their
first-round pick last year.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling after the camp is that the defense is ahead of the
offense, something that may be heard often during training camp in
Smithfield, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of minicamp was mainly on the offense, particularly
rookie running back Robert Edwards. Eyes also were following Drew
Bledsoe, as always, wide receiver Terry Glenn, and the offensive
line, which must come to make holes for the new halfback.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, meanwhile, appears to be for real.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three years, the Patriots are running the
same defense for the second straight year. The constant changing of
schemes had taken its toll on some players. Now, rather than having
to learn a new style, they can just concentrate on improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for coming back here and playing the
same defense and just getting better on what we did last year,''
said linebacker Chris Slade. ``I think we're all pretty excited
about our defense. I thought we really came together toward the end
of the season and we played really well in the playoffs. If we can
get some help from our offense, I think it's going to be a great
year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ted Johnson won't agree that the Patriots played well
against Pittsburgh in the playoffs, even though they lost, 7-6,
allowing only a first-quarter touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have held them scoreless,'' he said. ``You can always
be better. But over the past few years, having to learn a new
defense and a new philosophy all the time, that cuts into the real
genuine experience you can have when you're actually out there and
you know the routine. Now we know the routine. We know where
everybody is supposed to be. We can help each other out a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right ingredients and the right staff to get the
job done,'' Clay said. ``If we make enough adjustments, everyone is
expecting us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones was held out for the remainder of the camp after being
hurt. He was limping, but it was too early to tell the severity of
the injury. He will remain in the area, as will other rookies and
free agents, until June 26, when the strength and conditioning
program comes to an end ... Bledsoe likely will leave the area
shortly and return to his Montana retreat, as well as go home to
Washington state, until the start of training camp July 19. ``I
think we've made a lot of progress on the offense,'' he said.
``We've started to get our timing down with the receivers. I think
we'll adapt to it pretty quickly once camp starts.'' ... Owner
Robert Kraft, offensive lineman Bruce Armstrong, and coach Pete
Carroll addressed the fans before practice.

TOMMY GUNNING FOR WIN OVER HOMETOWN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Billerica, Mass., now may be in Tom Glavine's rear-view
mirror, but it's never out of sight. And certainly not out of his
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Any link to home makes Glavine a little sentimental, which is
why pitching Monday night's opener of the Red Sox-Braves series at
Turner Field still is special for the former National League Cy
Young winner and Most Valuable Player of the 1995 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I'm still a Boston sports fan,'' said
Glavine. ``I keep up with the Red Sox and the Bruins and the
Celtics and the Patriots. I read whatever I can about them and
follow them on TV whenever I get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine is happy to see the Red Sox doing so well, and says,
``Because Jimy Williams is there makes it even more special for me,
because he was a big part of what we did here in Atlanta for so
many years. Don't get me wrong, I'm going to go out there and try
to beat them as hard as I can, but sometimes you dream a little and
wonder what it would have been like to be a Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine could have traded in his Braves jersey a couple of years
ago when he became a free agent, but he decided not to leave a good
situation. He was there for the bad years in the late 1980s, so why
not stick around for the good times?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the Braves have been perennial contenders, and
Glavine has been one constant. He, along with manager Bobby Cox,
pitching coach Leo Mazzone, and to a degree John Smoltz, are the
last links to the bad Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of Glavine's career came in '95 when the Braves
won it all and Glavine won Game 6 of the World Series with a
sterling 1-0 masterpiece over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Braves have been good in the playoffs, but not
good enough, beaten in the NLCS by the expansion and wild-card
Florida Marlins last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are dominating the regular season again. Even with an
8-2 rec-ord and a 2.10 ERA, Glavine can't boast that he's the
team's best pitcher. There's Greg Maddux, 9-2, with a 1.69 ERA;
lefthander Denny Neagle, 7-3 with a 3.04 ERA; young Kevin Millwood,
8-2 with a 4.07 ERA; and, waiting in the wings, the injured Smoltz.
Filling in for Smoltz has been veteran Dennis Martinez, who has a
2-2 record and a 3.86 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a chance for four 20-game winners, last
accomplished by the '71 Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty amazing and pretty impressive,'' said
Glavine. ``In the past, we always had four good starters. But now
with Kevin coming along, we've got five. Every day we pitch, we
have a top pitcher going against you, and that's not something many
teams have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the biggest differences in this year's team is
that we have a lineup that can score runs. Having Andres Galarraga
in the middle of our lineup has greatly improved our ability to
score runs. He's just a great hitter. He hits for average and
power. In years past, teams knew that we didn't have that
righthanded thump and then could flood us with lefties late in the
game. With Andres in the middle, they can't do that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine says his own pitching hasn't changed a bit. He says in
any given year one pitch is working better than another. This year
he's rediscovered his breaking pitch to go with one of the best
changeups in the game and a fastball that seems a yard quicker when
he's getting his offspeed stuff over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being able to mix in a slider has really helped me in
keeping hitters off balance,'' he said. ``Part of being a
successful pitcher is being able to change what you do from time to
time so hitters don't see a pattern. I'm constantly doing that. You
have to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what Steve Avery has had trouble doing since
he left the Braves two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, like many in baseball, is baffled by the struggles of
Avery. At one time Avery and Glavine were inseperable, part of
baseball's most incredible staff. Glavine's great stuff and Avery's
dominating heat complemented each other well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having watched him up close for many years, I can't tell you
how good this guy was,'' Glavine said. ``He was the best young
lefty I'd ever seen. He carried us at times in '91 and '92 and in
the playoffs pitching big, money games. He had it all. To watch him
struggle ... it's baffling. I don't know what's going on with him.
I spoke to Steve in spring training and I knew he had some things
he was working on, but I haven't seen him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's said that he doesn't have injuries and that he
fully recovered from his oblique muscle injury toward the end of
his time here, but he was never the most forthcoming guy when it
came to stuff like that. I mean, when his son was sick in '95,
nobody knew anything about it until he had to leave the team for a
while. He keeps things to himself. So, who knows if he was hurt
more than he ever said?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do know is that sometimes when you struggle like he has
you have everybody in the world trying to tell you what's wrong.
Everyone means well because they're trying to help. But your head
can be swimming in all sorts of information. I hope that's not the
case there. When he left Atlanta, I thought it might be good for
him to go someplace else and get a different point of view. I think
Joe Kerrigan is a great pitching coach, but I don't know more than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that Ave is back in the big leagues. That's
a positive start,'' said Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine is thrilled that Williams has become a successful
manager. Williams was the third base coach and infield instructor
under Cox, and he also was the coach who worked with the pitchers
on their hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that someday we would lose him because he's too good of
a baseball man not to have been managing somewhere,'' Glavine said.
``I know the situation in Toronto was tough on him, but I think the
years he got to work under Bobby really helped him figure things
out. I was hoping he'd get a job, and then when he got the Red Sox
job, I was excited, because if I had to hand-pick someone to manage
my hometown team, I would have picked Jimy.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine asks his fellow Sox fans to be patient with Mark Lemke.
``He was the first roommate I ever had in the minors and we've been
through a lot together, so I'll always love the guy,'' Glavine
said. ``When we won in '95 and we all stormed out of the dugout
when we got the last out, one of the first people I looked for was
Lemmer. If you're looking for great production from him every day,
you're not going to get it. But he'll give you steady and at times
great defense. He'll help your pitchers out tremendously, and
honestly, I can't think of a guy who had bigger hits for our team
at the most crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's struggling now (he is injured), don't get down on him.
He'll come around, and when he does, he'll be a big asset for the
Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Glavine, who will face Derek Lowe Monday night, is
impressed with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez is one of the best pitchers in the game, and
with Bret Saberhagen looking like he's back, to go along with Nomar
and Mo, that's a pretty strong nucleus,'' he said. ``They're one of
the best teams in baseball this year, so it'll be a challenge for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   A hometown challenge.

What a Trip! Giants Sweep  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Louis _
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; It was one of the longest, most exhausting three-game trips
the Giants had ever taken. It also turned out to be one of the
sweetest.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants _ the first-place San Francisco Giants _ had every
reason to fold it up Sunday afternoon. The flight out on Thursday
was bogged down with bad weather and airport delays. On Saturday,
they played a bullpen-draining 14-inning affair that ended after
midnight. And Sunday, they were down three runs to the Cardinals in
the seventh inning. It would have been perfectly acceptable to give
in and go home.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not Dusty Baker's Giants. Sparked by a double by
pitcher Mark Gardner and a tie-breaking home run Jeff Kent, the
Giants turned this one around with a four-run seventh inning and
held on with some great pitching by closer Robb Nen for a 6-5 win
at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Giants completed their first three-game
sweep here in 14 years and extended their winning streak to a
season-best nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a kiss of death when you get out ahead of us by a
lot of runs,'' said Giants center fielder Darryl Hamilton, whose
sixth-inning double drove in two runs. ``We're gonna keep coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20th comeback victory of the season for the Giants,
who were down 4-0 after the first inning when the Cardinals knocked
around starter Gardner. It's getting to be a trend for Gardner to
get whacked early _ he's given up two five-run first innings this
year to go along with Sunday's four-run start.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he was feeling the effects of a pre-game nap gone
awry. He woke up on the trainers' table several hours before game
time with ``a big knot,'' he said, in his neck and down his left
shoulder. He went out there in the first inning, couldn't get his
rhythm going and the Cardinals took advantage. Mark McGwire _
surprise, surprise _ doubled and scored and Tom Pagnozzi knocked in
two with a bases-loaded single. But a double play bailed out
Gardner, and knowing the history of this team, he wasn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner also knew he wouldn't be pulled anytime soon either. The
Giants' bullpen turned in 91/3 innings the night before and most of
the 'pen was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was out there for at least six,'' said Gardner, who
improved to 5-2. ``I was the sacrificial lamb out there. It was a
matter of damage control.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner did his job from there on, allowing just a run-scoring
double in the fifth inning by McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardy started out slow, but he gave us all he had,'' Baker
said. ``Especially because his neck was sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Given therapy between innings to get loose, Gardner's kinks
didn't seem to bother him at the plate. He lined a single in the
third inning, and in the sixth he had the key hit: When showing
bunt with a runner on first, he pulled the bat back and drilled a
double into the left-field corner off starter Kent Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the game was Gardner getting that double down the
line in a bunt situation,'' Kent said. ``It picked us up
emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third, Hamilton followed with a
two-run double to right that cut the Cardinals' lead to 5-4. It was
the second game in a row Hamilton has come up big. Saturday night,
Hamilton's two-run triple in the ninth inning sent the game into
extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, whose only blemishes before the sixth were a solo home
run by Brian Johnson and an RBI double by Kent, was losing it in
the seventh, but because the Cardinals' bullpen was in the same
terrible shape as the Giants', St. Louis manager Tony La Russa
stayed with his starter.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker's inning only got worse when his wild pitch moved
Hamilton to third and Barry Bonds drove home the game-tying run
with deep sacrifice fly to center. Kent followed with the
tie-breaking home run into the right-center field stands. It was
his seventh homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got him into a bad rhythm,'' Kent said of Mercker. ``It was
probably the worst pitch he threw all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew this would be a one-run game, or if not, an
extra-inning game _ all six games here between the Giants and Cards
have been exactly that. After the Cardinals put runners on second
and third and no outs against Nen, it looked like the Cardinals,
losers of eight out of nine, would steal a win.
</P>
<P>
   But Nen struck out Ray Lankford and intentionally walked McGwire
to load the bases. After a force out by Brian Jordan, Nen ended it
by getting John Mabry to bounce into a force play.

   ``It's never easy to play the Cardinals,'' Kent said. ``We're
happy to be going home.''

SCHWAB LAUNCHES NEW CHINESE-LANGUAGE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA CASTANEDA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. has become the first U.S. brokerage to provide
Internet trading in a foreign language by introducing a
Chinese-language site.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The site, at www.schwab.com/chinese, is Schwab's latest effort
in a longtime strategy to build its Asian American clientele by
providing bilingual brokers, materials and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese site also may lead to more multilingual Web sites in
the future, said Wallace Louie, Schwab's director of Asia Pacific
Services in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are long-term international implications as we become
more of a global economy,'' he said, adding that Schwab is working
on a Spanish-language investing site as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Schwab began offering 24-hour telephone service in
Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Japanese and some other Asian
languages to help customers trade securities.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Schwab introduced Telebroker, an automated
telephone service, in Mandarin and Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab also has opened five branches nationwide, including two
in the Bay Area, to cater to Asian Americans by providing bilingual
brokers and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's Asian-language branches are located in San Francisco's
Chinatown, Milpitas, the Los Angeles suburbs of Rowland Heights and
San Gabriel, and Flushing, N.Y. There are plans to open new
branches in Daly City and Seattle later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial companies are trying to catch up with Schwab.
Merrill Lynch has Asian-language offices in New York and the Los
Angeles area. PaineWebber Inc. also has an office in Flushing that
focuses on Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments has launched a pilot program to try and
target Asian American investors by providing bilingual brokers over
the telephone and at some investor centers across the western
United States, including San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-speaking customers can get quotes, check their account
balances and make trades on Schwab's new Web site, which also has
several links to the company's English-language site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is being promoted by Schwab's Asian investment centers,
and by ads in Chinese media. But the most effective marketing tool
will be satisfied customers, Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of financial decisions are made by the entire family,
and there's a lot of word-of-mouth, especially compared to the
general market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian American investors already do business in English,
but Schwab wanted to provide as many options possible to make
investing less stressful, Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have been here a few years but would prefer to
speak to someone in their native language. They want to be sure
there's no miscommunication,'' he said.

NEW SITE FOR SPANISH SPEAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA CASTANEDA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Se habla espanol? Bank Rate Monitor does.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Florida-based firm will introduce a Spanish-language version
of its Web site, which provides news and free rate information
about mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans, credit cards and
savings and checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As the only Web site that will provide extensive personal
finance information in Spanish, Bank Rate Monitor in Espanol hopes
to tap into the growing market of Spanish-speakers in the United
States as well as consumers in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little content in Spanish on the Web right now,''
said William Plasencia, director of Bank Rate Monitor in Espanol.
``I don't have a good explanation as to why. It's a growing portion
of the population here in the United States, and more than half a
billion people in Latin America speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a way to fill a niche by presenting the kind of
information that's useful to everyone here in the United States _
anyone who has a bank account or wants to buy a home and feels more
comfortable reading in Spanish,'' Plasencia said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Bank Rate Monitor in Espanol will be accessible only through
the company's main Web site at &UR;  &LR; www.bankrate.com, probably by this
week. It will eventually have its own Internet address at
www.bankrate.com/esp.
</P>
<P>
   Plasencia said the odds for success are good. The U.S. Hispanic
market is the fifth-largest Spanish-speaking market in the world,
with $273 billion in annual purchasing power, according to Strategy
Research Corp. in Coral Gables, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., also
shows that middle- and lower-income Latinos are more likely than
whites to buy PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, almost 32 percent of Hispanics with annual
household income under $35,000, 58 percent of Hispanics with annual
household income between $35,000 and $49,000, and 77 percent of
Hispanics with annual household income of $50,000 or more owned
computers, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the study noted that 25.5 percent of whites with
annual household income under $35,000, 47.5 percent of whites with
annual household income between $35,000 and $49,000, and 74.6
percent of whites with annual household income of $50,000 or more
owned computers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, computers and the Internet have opened the door to
Latin American consumers, many of whom own homes or businesses in
the United States, or want to keep some of their money in U.S.
banks for security reasons, said Plasencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Latin Americans) don't really know how to maneuver around the
U.S. financial system,'' he said. ``They don't know how to shop
around. There's no resource for that. That's where we come in. We
want to provide objective information.''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos tend to ``double up'' on Internet accounts, which means
there's usually more than one person using one account to get
access to the Internet. ``So we can actually reach a lot more
people than you might think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Spanish-language site will provide a direct translation of
about two-thirds of the 1,600 pages of information on Bank Rate
Monitor's main site, said Plasencia.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language site also will explain terms that many
English speaking consumers take for granted, such as ``FDIC
insurance,'' ``mortgage points'' and ``adjustable rate mortgage,''
Plasencia said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Rate Monitor intends to launch a broader Web site in
November that Plasencia hopes will become the America Online for
the Spanish-language market.
</P>
<P>
   Although the as-yet-unnamed site will be built around financial
information, it will expand to include online brokerage, travel and
banking services as well as chat rooms and message boards, he said.

FINANCIAL FIRMS TAPPING INTO ETHNIC MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA CASTANEDA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Banco Popular recently mailed preapproved credit card offers to
scores of Latinos across the United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The offer from the San Juan, Puerto Rico-based bank featured Don
Francisco, the host of a popular Spanish-language variety show
called ``Sabado Gigante.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have my Banco Popular Visa card and there is one
reserved just for you!,'' a grinning Don Francisco is quoted in
English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's credit cards, insurance products or mutual funds,
financial companies like Banco Popular are starting to take aim at
the nation's growing ethnic markets.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for ethnic consumers _ and bad.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, ethnic consumers are getting more opportunities
than ever to join the financial mainstream. On the other hand,
objective noncommercial information about products and services is
still hard to find in many of these communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers always have an agenda. They don't paint a complete
picture,'' said Kathy Li, director of Consumer Action's National
Resource Center in San Francisco. ``Many immigrants don't know
that. All of a sudden, they're bombarded with mailers,
telemarketers and salesmen. They take it for granted that what
they're told is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The preapproved offer from Banco Popular, for example, included
a $750 credit line, a $30 annual fee, and a 21.9 percent interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Informed consumers would know that if they had shopped around,
they could have qualified for a no-fee credit card with a lower
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   There's a big untapped market for financial goods and services
in ethnic markets, according to Claritas Inc., an Arlington,
Va.-based market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Of the almost 267 million people in the United States, 12.7
percent are African American, 10.7 percent are Hispanic and 5.6
percent are Asian American (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese,
and Asian and Pacific Islander), Claritas said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 53.66 percent of Hispanics, 44.17 percent of African
Americans, and 76.75 percent of Asian Americans had credit cards,
Claritas found.
</P>
<P>
   Just 5.41 percent of Hispanics, 5.01 percent of African
Americans and 14.38 percent of Asian Americans owned mutual funds
in 1997, Claritas said.
</P>
<P>
   And 47.22 percent of Hispanics, 61.42 percent of African
Americans and 52.70 percent of Asian Americans had life insurance
in 1996, the most recent figures available, Claritas said.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Popular certainly isn't alone in targeting ethnic
consumers._ Freedom Card Inc., based in Marina Del Rey (Los Angeles
County), plans a statewide rollout next month of the Freedom Card,
a credit card targeting African Americans who haven't established
credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Boston launched a
marketing effort last year targeting Chinese Americans. The company
changed its name for the Chinese market to ``Everlasting Health''
and started providing bilingual agents, materials and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _ A few weeks ago, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. in San Francisco became
the first U.S. brokerage to create an Internet trading site in a
foreign language _ Chinese _ at www.schwab.com/chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ethnic groups often were ignored by financial goods
and services companies because marketers focused on the general
market, said Kris Reed, vice president of Claritas' financial
services group.
</P>
<P>
   Little information also was available about the purchasing
behavior of immigrants or low-income consumers, which often comes
from credit reports, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more financial goods and services companies are trying to
find immigrants and low-income consumers who have managed to climb
the economic ladder. ``The search now is for the ethnic population
that's reached a true middle class by being here long enough and
assimilating,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies, like Banco Popular and Freedom Inc., are
targeting immigrant and low-income consumers at the other end of
the spectrum who haven't yet established credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers evolve, and we want to be there at all stages,''
said Rick Parlade, Banco Popular's senior vice president of
marketing. ``Given enough time in the U.S., Latinos will form a
banking relationship. We want to be that bank.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be a downside to these efforts, however. Banco Popular
may be trying to help Latinos establish credit, but it's also
offering discounts on money transfers from Western Union and
prescriptions from Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   By offering such discounts, Banco Popular is tacitly sending a
message to Latino consumers that it's OK to pay for prescriptions
out-of-pocket instead of getting health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It's also encouraging the continued use of agencies like Western
Union, which provide expensive check cashing services and money
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Parlade disagreed. He said a large number of Hispanics are
``unbanked'' and uninsured. He said Banco Popular wants to reach
these customers, and offer them a credit card option and discounts
on prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some negatives associated with check cashing and the
services offered by check cashers,'' he said. ``But in general, a
reputable check casher provides a valuable service.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Banco Popular allows Latinos to do business in
Spanish by providing bilingual materials and customer service
representatives, Parlade said.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Buford, chairman and founder of Freedom Card Inc., said
many African Americans either don't use banks and have no credit
history at all, or have a ``challenged'' credit record because of
past problems with late payments and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Card is designed to make it easier for first-time
credit card applicants to get a card by considering ``alternative''
credit histories, such as records of regular and timely payment of
phone bills and electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone has had the same phone number for 20 years, that
certainly suggests they're a stable person. Just because they don't
have a traditional credit history doesn't mean they're not credit
worthy,'' Buford said.
</P>
<P>
   The secured Freedom Card carries an interest rate of 12.5
percent to 18.5 percent. The unsecured Freedom Card has a 90-day
introductory interest rate of zero, which rises to between 15.5
percent and 18.5 percent. Both charge a $35 annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be an opportunity in our financial system for
people to start again,'' said Buford, adding that Freedom Card also
offers a consumer-credit-education and money-management program.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Liu, director of Asian markets for John Hancock, said
it's important for companies to speak directly to ethnic markets by
providing materials in their native language and being culturally
sensitive to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Asians are still more comfortable speaking in their
own language, although they have no problem in English,'' she said.
``They feel more comfortable with different concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way consumers can protect themselves is to become
educated about financial goods and services and make the effort to
shop around for products before they make a purchase, said Li of
Consumer Action.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream publications such as Consumer Reports or Money
magazine may not be popular in ethnic communities, but there are
some places where consumers can get objective noncommercial
information in their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action offers a variety of free brochures about credit,
insurance, investing and other consumer issues in English, Spanish,
Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Credit Counseling Service, which helps consumers
straighten out credit problems, provides counselors, seminars and
education materials in a variety of languages. In addition to her
duties at Consumer Action, Li hosts a Cantonese-language radio
call-in show called, ``Consumer Rights,'' on Fridays from 1 p.m. to
2 p.m. on KEST-AM (1450).
</P>
<P>
   Bank Rate Monitor later this week will introduce a
Spanish-language version of its Web site at www.bankrate.com, which
will provide news and free rate information about mortgages, home
equity loans, auto loans, credit cards, and savings and checking
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Whether shopping for a new credit card or an auto loan,
consumers should do their homework before spending their money. And
if English is their second language, they should demand disclosures
in their native language or ask someone they trust to translate the
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sign anything you don't understand,'' said Gail
Hillebrand, a senior attorney for the San Francisco office of
Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports.

IT'LL BE FAMILY NIGHT FOR WASDIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Wasdin said he had been looking forward to making
the trip to Atlanta for quite some time. After all, his family had
planned a reunion around the Red Sox' three-game set vs. the Braves
beginning Monday night. From Tallahassee to Jacksonville, Wasdins
all over Florida were ready to make the trek north to converge upon
Ted Turner Field to watch their favorite Boston pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate them, Wasdin purchased some 30 tickets for each
game.
</P>
<P>
   Plane reservations had been confirmed. Hotel rooms booked. And,
yes, there were even plans for a family trip to Six Flags. But then
something came up last Wednesday night that caused a major glitch
in Wasdin's plans for a happy family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox optioned him to Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had about 45 people going to Atlanta, at least 30 for each
game,'' said Wasdin as he dressed for Sunday night's game against
the New York Mets. ``I'm from Tallahassee, so I have my mother and
father and friends going from Tallahassee to Atlanta. I live in
Jacksonville, which is where my wife's family is all from, and she
had all her family going to Atlanta on their vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I called them on Wednesday night and said, `Hey, I don't
think I'll be making it,''' he said. ``But they were still going to
go, because they basically wanted to see my new baby, my new little
girl, Avery Denise. So they were like, `Well, we're going. We don't
care if you're going or not.' So the tickets were not going to go
to waste if I was going or not going.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin smiled and laughed. He could afford to do so, especially
since he got his ticket to ride to Atlanta when the Red Sox
recalled him some 24 hours after sending him down to the minors.
The roster spot became available when Dennis Eckersley was placed
on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an experience like no other, I guess you could
say,'' said Wasdin, asked to describe his wacky week. ``From the
day I got optioned to the day I got recalled, it seemed like
forever in between, but the time was just a few hours, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin said he was scheduled to start for Pawtucket Sunday. Upon
his arrival in Pawtucket, he telephoned pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
to get his throwing assignment, but was told to hold off and report
back to Fenway Park Thursday, because something might be up with
Eck's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got recalled and got a chance to pitch (against the Orioles
Thursday), and got a chance to pitch the next night (in the series
opener against the Mets Friday),'' said Wasdin, who retired all
nine batters he faced in three innings of work in a 9-2 loss to the
Mets. ``It was a lot of pressure to come in and throw that first
night back, because, in my mind, I didn't want to get sent down,
but I didn't have the stats to back that up. I really didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say all you really want to say, but when you've got a
6.30 ERA and you've given up more hits than innings, that's not
getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was precisely the reason Wasdin wound up in Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to acknowledge it then, because no one wants to
get sent down,'' he said. ``But I was like, hey, this is a chance
for me to get back into the rotation, or to start again, or to get
my feet back under me. So I had the right frame of mind, then I got
recalled and I was like, `OK, let's show them I can pitch here and
that I can be consistent,' because that was the thing _ I was
inconsistent, I was flip-flopping. I'd have a two good innings then
I'd have a bad inning, or something like that. But to have two good
outings back to back really helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Jimy Williams, ``He's got a good arm. He always
competes. He's resilient and can pitch a lot. Pitching those three
innings the other day really helped us. Even though we didn't win,
it helped save our bullpen a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   While it also helped lower Wasdin's ERA to 5.35, it did little
to improve his hits-to-innings-pitched ratio, which is 39 to 33
2/3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, being sent down really made me more focused. It kind
of rejuvenates you, so to speak,'' Wasdin said. ``Maybe I was in a
little bit of a lull or a dead period where I was going through the
motions, and being sent down might have fired me up a little bit.
It made me re-evaluate my situation here and realize you can't take
anything for granted and you've got to go out there and make each
inning and each pitch count. Basically, that's what I'm going to
try and do from here on out.''

NBA TITLES START WITH STOPS 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The highlights of Sunday night's game will be
condensed into a few choice plays, like Michael Jordan's one-armed
magic against Greg Ostertag or the full-court pass by Dennis
Rodman, and rightly so. NBA greatness is always defined by scoring.
With a few choice words _ Magic's hook, West's bomb, or merely
Garfield Heard _ you're right back in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a cult level to NBA lore, stories barely remembered
and seldom told. They are the unopened volumes, telling the real
story, and they center entirely around defense.
</P>
<P>
   In that ridiculous 42-point rout of Utah, the Chicago Bulls set
a team-wide offensive standard they won't be able to match. Not in
this series, maybe not ever if Jordan sails into the sunset. Nobody
could miss, not even Jud Buechler. Bill Wennington was a heck of an
option. Even Dickey Simpkins put one down. It was bawdy, comical
and completely unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you,'' said Buechler, ``you won't see a score like
this again in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's happening inside the Jazz players' heads? How does it
feel knowing that they can't execute their offense, that they can't
set the tough screens, that a 6-for-6 start by Karl Malone means
absolutely nothing?
</P>
<P>
   The malady has persevered through two full games now, and in a
short series like the NBA Finals, that's a trend. ``We aren't
putting up much of a fight,'' said Utah coach Jerry Sloan, ``and
that's really disappointing. I mean, we're out there and we can't
make a simple inbounds pass. I think it's embarrassing _ for the
entire NBA _ not to come out with any more fight than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan glanced at a copy of the final boxscore, a surrealistic
set of numbers showing seven turnovers by Malone, 30 percent
shooting by the Jazz, a combined two points by John Stockton and
Howard Eisley, and the 96-54 final.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually the score?'' said Sloan. ``I thought it was
196.''
</P>
<P>
   No team in the history of the 24-second shot clock had scored
fewer points. Not just in the Finals or the playoffs, but in  &LR; any
 &LR; game. The plodding beasts of the mid-50s did better than this. It
was also the most one-sided game ever witnessed in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Center Greg Foster was seething. Where he comes from, the hard
streets of Oakland high school ball, you don't lose a game this way
without losing some pride, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just real f_ embarrassing,'' he said. ``And I'll tell
you what, if we're not embarrassed by this, as a team, you can just
go ahead and give 'em the trophy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from a historical sense, the Bulls are not unlike the
49ers during Joe Montana's run. Excitement flowed from the offense
_ like Jordan, Montana was one for the ages _ but the 49ers won
their Super Bowls with defense. Insiders remember Dan Bunz, Hacksaw
Reynolds and Eric Wright as much as they remember ``The Drive,''
Roger Craig or Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls may not be remembered as one of the all-time defensive
teams, because the specter of Jordan will be all-consuming. But
they've earned the reputation. As Buechler said, ``Michael and
Scottie Pippen are two of the best defenders to ever play. Throw in
Dennis Rodman, and everybody else getting into it, and it just gets
crazy out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years in the business,'' said Sloan, ``I don't think
I've ever seen a team play better defensively than Chicago did
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton looked positively helpless, shooting 1-for-4 and never
getting to the free-throw line. Malone broke from the gate like a
cooped-up thoroughbred, but he was a different man after Rodman
entered the game. At the time, he was on a 5-for-5 roll. For the
rest of the first half _ nearly 15 minutes' worth _ Malone took
only two shots.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has his own unique way of explaining things. As he said
before the game, ``I'm doing a great job on Malone. He doesn't
intimidate me. Why would he? He went to school (Louisiana Tech)
with my sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't put it all on Malone. The man did score 22 points
in a clear revival of his shooting touch. ``It wasn't Karl's
fault,'' said Foster. ``No one else did a damn thing to help him.
All anyone wanted to do was shoot the ball, not make the extra
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone insisted that ``Our plays work. But we have to run 'em.
They had a hell of a defensive game, and we didn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the hidden legacy of the Bulls. Occasionally through
time, a defensive play will stand out, like the great Boston Garden
steals by John Havlicek and Larry Bird. More often, those moments
disappear. People remember Magic and Doctor J, and they forget
about Michael Cooper, K.C. Jones, Walt Frazier, Satch Sanders. They
forget how the Warriors shut down Elvin Hayes in '75 or why Bill
Russell kept beating Chamberlain and West.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is Rodman on Malone, Jordan on anybody, and the
octopus-like Pippen, whom coach Phil Jackson says has ``the ability
to be a one-man wrecking crew'' on defense. It's a fine part of
history, every bit as relevant as Jordan's astonishing repertoire.
Years from now, the Jazz can tell you all about it.

FINDING A JOB IN S.F. WITHOUT ANY CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I am a video editor and producer in Florida. I want so much to
move to San Francisco, but I have no professional connections
there, and in my industry it's almost impossible to find work
without knowing somebody. Do you have any suggestions?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It's always been daunting trying to find work in one place
when you're living in another place. But today cross-country or
even international job hunters have a lot more options because of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are Web sites geared to professionals in almost every
industry, often with job listings and discussion groups. The
discussion groups are a great way to network with colleagues and
nose around for job openings in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, your first stop on the Web should be the site run
by the Bay Area Video Coalition. BAVC's Web site at www.bavc.org
lists scores of jobs in the video and new media fields. BAVC also
offers more than 400 classes in video and new media, along with
screenings and other useful networking events. For membership
information, call (415) 861-3282.
</P>
<P>
   Another site you should check out is www.listfoundation.org,
which has a number of new-media job listings. Other local groups
with job listings for the video and film industry are the Film Arts
Foundation at (415) 552-8760 and Media Alliance at (415) 546-6334.
</P>
<P>
   To land an offer, you'll probably have to follow up with some
old-fashioned in-person networking.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule a vacation trip out here to coincide with some industry
event like a video festival. Then use your Internet contacts _ or
other personal connections like your college alumni network _ to
line up informational interviews.
</P>
<P>
   New media and video really are booming in the Bay Area, with
more independent film and video producers per capita than New York
or Los Angeles, according to BAVC.
</P>
<P>
   So do your homework. You're likely to end up with a great San
Francisco job ... and a whole new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job thing isn't so horrible,'' said Sally Fifer, executive
director of BAVC. ``The horrible part is finding housing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  My wife's company was recently acquired by another firm.
The new owners have withheld one week's salary from each employee,
and say they intend to hold it until the employee someday leaves
the firm. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It's completely normal for a landlord to demand an extra
month's rent from tenants as a security deposit. But for a company
to withhold a week of employees' pay as some kind of security
deposit? That's extremely unusual, and probably illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty outrageous,'' said Beth Ross, a lawyer with
Leonard Carder Nathan Zuckerman Ross Chin &AMP; Remar in San Francisco.
``I have never heard of anything like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal labor codes require firms to pay their workers
in a regular and timely fashion _ at least twice a month for most
workers, or once a month for salaried or professional workers.
</P>
<P>
   If your firm is socking away your week's pay in some kind of
escrow account, Ross said, it's violating the law. The company
could face misdemeanor charges, or penalties of up to $100 per
employee plus 25 percent of the amount that is being unlawfully
withheld. The place to file a complaint is the office of the
California Labor Commissioner, at (415) 557-7878.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's possible that you misunderstood the policy. Is
the company really withholding your pay? Or did it just change the
schedule for issuing paychecks?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the firm used to issue checks five days after the
end of each workweek, and is now issuing them 12 days after the end
of each workweek. That would make it seem like you had ``missed'' a
week of pay. But the company would still be paying you on a regular
basis. If that's the case, the policy is probably legal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I am a self-employed editor. One of my clients is a
publisher back east who considers me an employee and withholds
taxes from my paychecks. Because this client considers me an
employee, my tax accountant says I cannot deduct my expenses for
jobs done for this client. But the client doesn't provide me with
me any supplies or materials. Do I have any choice about their
treating me as an employee?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are a growing number of cases these days where
companies misclassify employees as independent contractors, in an
effort to avoid paying benefits or to pare down their full-time
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   You've got the opposite situation _ you're an independent
contractor who is being misclassified as an employee.
</P>
<P>
   You do seem to fit the legal definition of a contractor,
according to Stephen Fishman, a Berkeley lawyer and author of
``Hiring Independent Contractors'' (Nolo Press). You work under
your own direction, use your own office and equipment and have a
number of different clients _ all important criteria in determining
that someone is a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is simply to ask the company to reclassify you as
a contractor. If they refuse, you could theoretically call the
Internal Revenue Service and report the violation. ``But if you do
that, they may not want to hire you any more,'' Fishman cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Before asking to be reclassified, do some math and make sure it
would pay off to be reclassified. As an employee, you and your
employer each pay 7.65 percent of your wages into Social Security
and Medicare; as a contractor, you'd have to pay the full 15.3
percent yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be better off letting things stay as they are,''
Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there may be a way for you to deduct your expenses _ even
as an employee. Oakland accountant David Roberts suggests you take
a look at IRS Form 2106. That would allow you to tally up and
deduct unreimbursed business expenses _ but only if you file a tax
return with itemized deductions, and only if your unreimbursed
expenses total more than 2 percent of your income.
</P>

San Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or

AVERY ARMED WITH NEW DELIVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All he's ever wanted to do in Boston, really, is
contribute _ in any way possible. As a starter. A reliever out of
the bullpen. And, on those rare occasions, even as a pinch runner.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Avery has done it all.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night before 30,630 at Fenway Park, Avery took
another step in cementing his spot in Boston's starting rotation _
which always had been his intended role _ by throwing seven innings
of shutout ball, allowing just three hits and one walk while
ringing up four strikeouts, to lead the Red Sox to a 5-0 victory
over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time he felt this good after a game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Umm, it's been a while,'' said Avery, who struggled through a
minor league assignment in Pawtucket in April before he recently
found the groove by tinkering with the angle of his delivery. ``The
last time I really threw the ball like I felt I was capable of was
in Cleveland last year. It just helps your mentality to go out
there and to feel good with what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm throwing the ball, and I'm struggling to throw
strikes and struggling for the ball to come out the way you want it
to, you're not going to be yourself mentally,'' he added. ``But
when you can relax and concentrate on the hitter and do what comes
naturally, it helps everything. I felt, mentally, I was a lot
better tonight, even better than the last time because the last
time I was a little bit nervous with what I was doing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery's last start was last Tuesday in Toronto. He went five
innings and allowed three runs and three hits in a 5-3 victory,
only his second of the season and first since a 5-0 shutout over
Kansas City May 16. The reason he was nervous was that he was
experimenting with some new mechanics on the mound, a new release
point suggested by pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been used to throwing it over the top,'' said Avery, who
said he received a phone message from Atlanta pitcher John Smoltz
when he returned to the clubhouse. ``But by dropping my arm down, I
probably got rid of some of the other bad things I was doing. I was
striding too far, and leaning away from the plate. But I can't do
these things when I'm throwing from the angle I'm throwing at.
Balls come out a lot better and I'm a lot more consistent. Tonight,
I threw the ball wherever I wanted to most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, with the exception of a lapse in the fourth, which
prompted a visit from Kerrigan. So why did it take so long to
detect Avery's delivery problem, and to correct it?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you're asking someone to make a change
like that, you've got to ask them to make it their idea,'' Kerrigan
said. ``Or, at least, half their idea, especially with someone
who's been very successful since he was 19 years old throwing from
the same arm slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan indicated ``we finally put it to him in a meeting in
New York in Yankee Stadium. Then I just asked him to play catch
with me in the outfield in Trenton and told him to throw it
sidearm, just to see what it looked like. Then we gradually did it
on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery said it took some doing to get used to a delivery ``that
felt like I was throwing it sidearm,'' he said, but it takes some
time and some practice _ and a little patience, as well _ before it
becomes second nature to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got a little bit tired tonight, I felt myself wanting to
go back to what I was used to,'' Avery said. ``But, really, I tell
everyone _ I tell Hattie (catcher Scott Hatteberg) and I tell Joe
to remind me to keep my arm down there. It's probably going to be
that way for a little bit, but you can't argue with the results.''

JAZZ SUFFER DISASTROUS LOSS 
BY DAVID STEELE
</HEADLINE>
 FINALS-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ With 3:32 left in the first quarter of Game 3 of the
NBA Finals Sunday night, Karl Malone tossed in a pretty turnaround
fall-away jumper over Dennis Rodman to give the Jazz a 14-9 lead
over the Bulls, and himself a 6-for-6 start from the field.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Jazz should have walked off the United Center
floor and caught a flight home. It would have saved them the abject
humiliation that was to follow over the next 44-plus minutes.
Considering what did transpire, the state of Utah would be well
within its rights to deny the Jazz re-entry and send them back to
their original home of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls took the Jazz apart at the seams, starting with a run
of 12 straight points after Malone's jumper and ending only with
the merciful final buzzer completing a 96-54 massacre. In the
process, the five-time champs slammed the Jazz into several
undesirable areas of the record book.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Jazz lose by the largest margin ever in a
Finals game, and not only did they set single-game scoring lows in
the Finals and the playoffs overall _ they scored fewer points than
any team in any game since the shot clock was adopted in 1954-55.
The Indiana Pacers, who played without leading scorers Reggie
Miller and Rik Smits that day, managed just 55 against the Spurs in
a regular-season game back on March 29. This Jazz team had its full
complement of players, the same ones that had the league's best
regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Jazz set or tied 13 records for futility and
prompted coach Jerry Sloan to say, ``I'm somewhat embarrassed for
NBA basketball, for our guys to come out and play at this level,
with no more fight left in them than what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan also said this upon being presented with the final stats:
``This is actually the score? Is this the final?'' It wasn't clear
if he was trying to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-1 series lead and the next two games also in Chicago,
the Bulls are on pace to be hugging a sixth trophy by Friday night.
Of his team, which entered the Finals exhausted in every way after
a seven-game battle with the Pacers, coach Phil Jackson said, ``We
know they won't be tired on Wednesday, that's not going to be the
case ... I think we got our legs underneath us, as evidenced by
today's game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was such a thorough dismantling, Michael Jordan was almost an
afterthought. His role in the defensive lockdown was crucial, with
his smothering of Jeff Hornacek and his trapping pressure; at the
other end he scored 24 points, including another entry into the
permanent highlight reel, a second-quarter layup in which he
switched the ball from right hand to left in midair.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz seemed to have plenty of legs in the early going,
riding a revitalized Malone to that quick lead. Four of those first
six baskets were jumpers, and the other two were layups set up by
his outside game. ``That was a good sign. We were up, what,
(14-9)?'' Hornacek said. ``And I don't think we scored the rest of
the game, did we?''
</P>
<P>
   Malone hardly did: after briefly redeeming himself from his
14-of-41 performance in the first two games, he managed to take
only five shots and hit two after his 6-for-6 start. He finished
with a meek 22 points, three rebounds and seven turnovers, three of
which were offensive fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Even during Malone's big start, the Bulls were putting down the
foundation for arguably the greatest defensive game ever. Their
traps from all over the court prevented John Stockton from even
getting the ball upcourt efficiently, as well as keeping the Jazz
from either picking or rolling. Ron Harper made a complete nuisance
of himself to Stockton and added eight points, 10 rebounds and
seven assists in his best overall showing of the series. The Jazz
committed 26 turnovers, tying a franchise playoff record; Stockton
had five by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz aided the Bulls' record-setting effort by playing as if
one of the city's legendary mobsters had given them cement
overshoes. ``It's evident that our plays work when you run them,''
Malone said. ``If you don't run them, you won't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this was a series of Jazz droughts that began
after Malone's late first-quarter jumper. Nearly six minutes went
by before they scored again. Starters Hornacek and Bryon Russell
went scoreless until the final five minutes of the half. The Bulls
finished the half with a 12-2 run in just 2:27. The Jazz trailed
49-31 at halftime, with their total tying for the second fewest
points in a half.
</P>
<P>
   And that was their (begin ital) good (end ital) half: in the
second half they set a new mark with just 23 points. Their
fourth-quarter total of nine was also a record, as was their 21
total field goals and the Bulls' 42-point margin of victory.

WHEELS OF FORTUNE FOR HINCAPIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George Hincapie was thinking he was in the
twilight zone. His mother Martha was crying tears of happiness. And
the bike race announcer was screaming, ``Oh, how sweet revenge
is!''
</P>
<P>
   All this as Hincapie _ a winner turned loser in this race a year
ago _ was shooting over the finish line first in Sunday's First
Union US Professional Racing Organization Championship, winning in
6 hours 6 minutes 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Hincapie hopped on the podium when he thought he was
the first American finisher, thus gaining the title of US
professional national champion. But he had it taken away minutes
later when judges disqualified him for illegally using a team car
to draft with in the race.
</P>
<P>
   So no wonder when he took to the winner's stand Sunday, he said,
``If anyone has something to say, say it now, or forever hold your
peace.'' The crowd roared. It kept roaring, and clapping, as
Hincapie was bestowed win after win and check after check.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was $30,000 for winning the race, which was 156 miles
long. Then it was a starred-and-striped jersey for being the first
American to win, and becoming the year's US pro national champion.
Finally, there was a silver cup and a check for $10,000 for winning
the Solidarity Cup, a series of races completed Sunday that took
place over the past two months in Poland and America.
</P>
<P>
   But Hincapie, 24, chose to be diplomatic later, accentuating the
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not revenge,'' he said. ``Last year was devastating
to me; I thought I was the strongest and I thought I won. But that
was last year. This is this year, and I won.''
</P>
<P>
   The race that covered 10 circuits around downtown Philadelphia
traveled along the Schuylkill River, up the steep road called the
Manayunk Wall, and back down to make a loop in front of the fans at
the start-finish line. And the fast, crescendoing synthesizer music
and the announcer's frantic voice were not in the least too intense
for the drama that unfolded during the last half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the last climb at Manayunk, Lance Armstrong made a
strong attack to get out front, and most of his US Postal Service
teammates followed suit. (``They're trying to put a stamp on this
race!'' the announcer yelled.) But despite his attempt at humor, he
was right; the team was riding with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   As the riders made their way on the last three 3-mile circuits
of the race, the red, white, and blue Postal Service jerseys
dominated the lead pack of 30. The Polish, Spanish, and Italian
riders were trying to pedal up to the front and dominate, but
Hincapie said it was two Americans _ Frank McCormack, of Leicester,
Mass., and McCormack's brother Mark, of North Easton, Mass. _ who
were really causing him trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two riders are incredibly fast, so I really had to rely
on the distance,'' he said. ``I would say normally in any
50-kilometer race, those two guys would be faster than me. But I
was confident that after 160 miles, that it's a different sprint,
and I was confident in my ability to sprint. I had to just believe
in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So with just 200 meters to go, as riders jostled for position
and rode far faster than the 25.43 m.p.h. they had been averaging,
Hincapie made for the line. That, he said, is when his mind zoned
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' he said. ``A moment like that, it's kind of
just like you're in outer space. The last 50 meters, you don't feel
nothing, you don't hear nothing. All of a sudden you're just like
in the twilight zone. You wish that moment could last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he was winning, his mother was crying, like last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying then, and I'm crying today,'' she said, holding a
bouquet of flowers her son had won.
</P>
<P>
   The women's race was ridden simultaneous to the men's race but
covered 57.6 miles and is on the World Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As if to say, ``Been there, done that,'' Petra Rossner of
Germany raised her hands in victory even before she crossed the
finish line. Rossner, who won the race in 2 hours 22 minutes 18
seconds, was the winner here two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dede Demet, of Boulder, Colo., held onto her first-place World
Cup standing after finishing seventh.

COLLINS GETS INTO RAIDERS' MIX EARLY 
BY RON KROICHICK
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ The Raiders completed their final minicamp
Sunday, Mo Collins manned the left-tackle position. It isn't a
stretch to suggest Collins _ even as a rookie _ could become the
caretaker of quarterback Jeff George's blind side.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Harlow, the returning starter at left tackle, missed all
three of the team's offseason minicamps. The Raiders are treating
Harlow carefully as he recovers from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jon Gruden is optimistic that Harlow will be fine. If not
_ and back pain can linger, as Harlow knows _ the all-important job
falls to Collins, the 23rd overall choice in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've devoted this whole month to Mo Collins at left tackle,''
Gruden said after Sunday's practice. ``Give the guy credit. He's
not intimidated. He's got some areas he needs to improve, but he's
got natural ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins played at Florida, so he knows something about
protecting the passer. He spent most of his college days at right
tackle; changing sides requires some adjustments in technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the left tackle will get the best pass
rusher,'' Collins said. ``That's a challenge for me.''
</P>
<P>
   SEARCH: The Raiders are still in the market for a backup
quarterback. They were outbid for Dave Brown (who signed with
Arizona), passed on Jim Everett (health concerns) and are not
especially interested in re-signing David Klingler.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden said the team will continue its search for the next few
weeks. Former Baltimore starter Vinny Testaverde is a free agent,
but he probably wants a chance to start and more money than the
Raiders are willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   They could head to training camp with Donald Hollas as the No. 2
quarterback. Hollas, who was No. 3 on the depth chart last season,
has collected plenty of snaps during offseason workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're going to bring in another guy, but I
know I'm getting a lot of reps,'' Hollas said. ``And that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollas has thrown 115 passes, as Cincinnati's backup (1991-94).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; PLAY SOME DEFENSE: The Raiders will have a decidedly new look
on defense. Four 1997 starters are gone: Linebacker Rob
Fredrickson, defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, cornerback Terry
McDaniel and defensive end Anthony Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Willie Shaw is installing a new scheme,
predicated on putting pressure on the quarterback. Something needs
to change, because the Raiders ranked 30th (last) in the league in
total defense last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been waiting for people to attack us the last couple of
years,'' defensive tackle Russell Maryland said. ``We need to take
it to people before they take it to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we sit back and play soft, we'll be 4-12 again.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; el,3 f,25,10  &LR; MISCELLANY:  &LR; fn,cor,9,10,8.5  &LR; Defensive back
James Trapp left Sunday's practice with a biceps injury of unknown
severity. ... Safety Patrick Bates missed the practice because of a
sore wrist, suffered Friday. X-rays were negative. ... The Raiders
are scheduled to begin training camp July 21 in Napa. Their first
exhibition game is August 8 at Dallas.

FRIENDLY FIRE WINS FRENCH

 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It was a good day for a pesadilla _ a nightmare where he
comes from _ and that's exactly what Alex Corretja endured for 2
hours and 18 minutes Sunday in full view of 16,000 tennis patrons
at Stade Roland Garros, plus millions of freeloaders at teleside
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   In this nightmare he is playing for the championship of France,
but _ perhaps more importantly _ also the championship of his
hometown, Barcelona, which just happens to be Tennistown, Planet
Earth. Lumpy and forlorn lavender clouds drape menacingly. A cool,
skittish wind is gusting maddeningly, usually in his face, playing
mischievously with his shots. Corretja feels like he's running in
mud. ``All the time I'm trying to find the ball,'' he will say.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Corretja sees across the net a huge long-haired guy in
baggy clothes, resembling an old-time burlesque comedian, but
there's nothing funny about the way he smacks balls too hard and
fast to handle. He looks like Corretja's long-time amigo, Charlie _
Carlos Moya _ but would Charlie treat him this way?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Regrettably, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad, but not a dream after all. Unless you consider it from
Charlie Moya's standpoint _ a dream come true, winning the French
Open, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3, and rising to No. 5 in the world from No. 12.
Better still, retaining No. 1 in Barcelona, the capital of the
game, still ahead of Corretja, who ascended to world No. 9 from No.
14.
</P>
<P>
   The reign of Spain (a.k.a. Barcelona) stayed mainly on this dirt
plain in the Bois de Boulogne as 21-year-old Moya, a monster out of
a nightmare if there ever was one here, followed up on Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario's 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2 title victory over Monica
Seles Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Same scenario four years ago to the accompaniment of scarlet and
gold Spanish and Catalan flags ruffling and snapping happily. Only
then Sergi Bruguera was Arantxa's dirt-dancing partner. But Moya,
with his bludgeoning forehand and serve, startling speed, and
surprising volleying touch has more possibilities than Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
   Bruguera, the champ in 1993-94 (but a slower version this year,
beaten in the opening round by Hernan Gumy), was an inspiration. As
a 16-year-old reared on the island of Majorca, Moya ``saw on the TV
the last set of Sergi beating (Jim) Courier, who was No. 1. I saw
him hold that trophy up, and I was jealous, in a good way. I began
to dream about it, and today I cannot describe the feeling, the
greatest I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boys from Barcelona arrived in Paris a dozen strong of 19
Spaniards entered in the 128-man chase, and it came down to the
6-foot-3-inch kid from Avenida Foix to follow in the sneaker steps
of his Davis Cup captain, Manolo Santana, the champ of 1961 and
1964, Andres Gimeno, 1972, and Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja, losing six of his 15 service games, including the
opener, was in trouble from the moment Moya whacked a forehand to
win the first point of the day. He couldn't penetrate, and his
rolling topspin was no problem for the tall Moya.
</P>
<P>
   Moya shuffled around his backhand quickly to brutalize second
serves with forehands, whammed a service winner to duck an early
break point and reach 4-2, and patiently waited for openings as
Corretja struggled fiercely to escape break points and set points
deep in the second set. But there was no way for him to hold off
Moya for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Alex was nervous at first,'' Moya said. ``It was his
first Grand Slam final. After I lost the Australian final last year
to (Pete) Sampras I was calmer this time. I had the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Corretja, 24, the guy who turned Sampras's stomach inside out
and held a match point in that dramatic US Open quarterfinal of
1996, couldn't produce similar form Sunday. He had made his mark on
the French a week before by outlasting Gumy in 5 hours 31 minutes,
the longest major tournament match, and his ordeal at Moya's hands
may have seemed as long though not as draining.
</P>
<P>
   During an afternoon of rare good sporting feeling each man
contradicted judgments of line officials and awarded points to his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't need an umpire or judges,'' Corretja said. ``We
trust each other.'' They embraced at the finish while mom and pop
Corretja hugged mom and pop Moya in the friends' box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Espana wins!'' rejoiced Andres Moya, the champ's old man. ``We
all win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the audience won as the great soccer player, Pele, who led
Brazil to World Cups in 1958-62-70, appeared on the podium to help
present the prize, the sterling Coupe de Mousquetaires. Pele hugged
Moya and Corretja and, as soccer balls materialized, ping-ponged
headers with both men before the Spaniards booted the balls into
the crowd. Along with Pele was 82-year-old Don Budge, who won the
title 60 years ago, the second leg of the original Grand Slam.
Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Michael Chang may have evaporated fast,
but Budge gave the final an American presence.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether a fun time _ nevertheless a nightmare for Alex
Corretja.

A'S WANT TO HIT BACK AFTER LOSS 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Add the A's to the long list of people in
baseball who just don't like the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Deep into a 12-4 Diamondbacks rout Sunday that lost its suspense
early, Arizona manager Buck Showalter instructed reliever Russ
Springer to hit an A's hitter in retaliation for the A's hitting
Yamil Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   That might not have incensed the A's on its own. No, what had
them so irate was A) the choice of rookie Ben Grieve (a.k.a. The
Franchise) as the target for the message pitch; and B) plunking him
in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty weak when it happened,'' A's manager
Art Howe said. ``We had no chance to retaliate. ... There's always
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's reaction to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, good,'' he said. ``Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter did not actually confirm that he ordered Springer to
throw at Grieve, grazing him on his side. But he left no room for
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were upset about Benitez getting hit,'' he said. ``We've
been hit a lot this year. ... If you're going to throw at somebody
because the kid takes an extra base, that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters, the A's fourth reliever of the day, might indeed
have been throwing at Benitez. He might even have been mad that
David Dellucci had legged out a double earlier in the eighth after
the score was already 12-4. But Fetters made a strong argument that
he did not plunk Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think I hit him on purpose, they're crazy,'' he said.
``I've got more walks than strikeouts. I'm trying to get the guy
out. I'm struggling and he's hitting .200. That'd be real smart of
me to put him on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe, too, dismissed Showalter's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve was his usual unconcerned self. He got part of the game
off, his first rest day of the season, and came in late as a
pinch-hitter. He said the pitch did not hurt him. ``It just barely
grazed me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The way the A's saw it, that high-and-tight pitch to Kevin
Mitchell in the bottom of the eighth should have been enough of an
answer to any perceived offense Fetters committed. Mitchell got out
of the way but dropped his bat and sprawled to the ground. Mitchell
didn't think Amaury Telemaco's inside offering was aimed at him,
but he also didn't think much of the Diamondbacks going after
Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, 'Don't go after the man who threw it, go after the man
who called it,''' he said, meaning Showalter. ``He's just sitting
on his ass on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The chest-thumping and war of words might serve to fire up an
A's team that looked in danger of going flat. The loss brought
their only three-game home winning streak of the season to a
screeching halt. They headed to Los Angeles for a three-game series
with the Dodgers that threatens to be punishment enough to kill any
optimism generated by the team's 3-2 homestand, just the second
winning homestand of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks (20-43) reached double digits in scoring for
only the second time this season, the other time coming April 20
against the Florida Marlins (17-44). That was mostly because
knuckleballer Tom Candiotti had to leave the game in the second
with back spasms, handing the ball over to the A's bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Witasick, called up from Triple-A Edmonton on Thursday, gave
up a homer to the first batter he faced, Dellucci, and that pretty
much set the tone. He gave up three homers and six runs in his 31/3
innings. At least Witasick has some promise. It's hard to say the
same about Aaron Small or T.J. Mathews, the next two A's relievers
to squirt a little kerosene on the fire.

PEGRAM ENJOYED THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Darkness was falling upon Barn 9. It was nearly
three hours after one of the greatest Belmont Stakes in memory, one
of the most exciting finishes that ever could be scripted, and Mike
Pegram was leaning against a fence post by the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what my goal now is?'' said Pegram, the owner of Real
Quiet. ``My goal is to party more than the guys who won the race.''
</P>
<P>
   All the outward glitz of a party-to-be were there. More than 100
people were clumped here and there around Real Quiet's barn, a
whole caravan of white and black stretch limousines _ all with Real
Quiet placards on their sides _ were parked beyond the barn, and
even more were lined up near the Belmont training track a half-mile
away. But the party chatter was low, there had been tears and there
could be little joy.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram's horse had run 1 1/2 miles and had finished an inch
short, a nose shy in the jargon of horse racing. Pegram, the
ever-present can of Bud Light in hand, still seemed in shock. He
and his horse had come within an inch of a Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still was worth it, every minute of it,'' said the owner.
``I wouldn't trade the finish for all the fun we had ... really, it
was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram seemed almost believable. But still he seemed in shock as
he went through the motions of posing with a fan with a camera here
or giving an autograph to another fan with a Belmont Stakes program
there. The flash would not go off for the fan with the camera;
Pegram gamely posed a second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything Kent did,'' Pegram said of jockey Kent
Desormeaux. ``I don't want any heat on Kent ... I don't want to
hear anything about he moved too soon or he went wide ... We just
got beat, that's it. In horse racing you win or you lose and we
lost. That's racing, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But to lose the Belmont that way, to lose the Triple Crown in
that fashion, to see $5 million slip away when your horse has
opened 4, 5, and 6 lengths in the stretch only to lose it all by a
nose was the cruelest way to lose. Pegram's face showed it; his
words wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what was so good about this?'' he said. ``We showed
the Old Guard you can have fun and you can have a great horse and
you can do both. How many people do you think we brought out to
Belmont? How many people came out here because of the horse and the
fun we were having? What did they have here? Eighty thousand
people? ... You think 80,000 people ever came out to see the Old
Guard?''
</P>
<P>
   There had been many sights a few hours earlier. There had been
the haunting sight of D. Wayne Lukas, once the best of the New
Guard, striding into the jammed Belmont paddock to saddle not one,
but two horses ... and Lukas was all alone. Then, when his saddling
chores were done, Lukas walked through the tunnel that connects the
paddock to the track itself, turned left, and headed to the owner's
box ... again all alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there had been the stirring sight of Real Quiet
having the Belmont won, only to see Victory Gallop bearing down on
him in the final 16th of a mile, and finally catching Real Quiet in
the stirring, final jump.
</P>
<P>
   There even was a ludicrous sight of the press release from the
stewards' box and the stewards saying they would have disqualified
Real Quiet if he had finished a nose ahead of Victory Gallop, and
not a nose behind ... and virtually no one in racing believed a
Triple Crown winner would have been disqualified on what was, at
best, a 50-50 call.
</P>
<P>
   But, most of all, there was the sight of long-comatose Belmont
Park teeming and throbbing and bursting with fans and excitement.
Most, of course, were there to see a Triple Crown that was not to
be, but many were there also because they were drawn to the track
by the fun-loving crew that surrounded Pegram and trainer Bob
Baffert, who were on more New York City newscasts than Rudy
Giuliani or George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me how many fans the Old Guard ever brought out to this
place,'' said Pegram, now animated. ``The Old Guard ... I've had
enough of the Old Guard. The Old Guard kept people away from
racing. They never brought any excitement, they never brought any
fans to the track, and we did. That's what makes me happy, even
though we lost. You really got me on a roll now ... The Old Guard's
been in charge too long with their old ways. The Old Guard never
had any fun, did it?''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram walked away. There was to have been a party for winning
the Triple Crown, but that fell a nose short and the party was
lacking even more. But Pegram, very animated, had brought
animation, if not some much needed life, to horse racing. Only
great horses win Triple Crowns, not good ones or very good ones,
but, as Pegram put it, ``We had a ride, and so did horse racing.''

WHY U.S. IS CHANGING TACK ON ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From entrepreneurial darlings to evil monopolists,
from nerds in a garage to corporate titans, Intel and Microsoft
symbolize the technology industry, the fastest-growing segment of
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission will meet today on whether to file
an antitrust suit against Intel, following on the heels of a
similar Justice Department action against Microsoft. Sources expect
the FTC to approve an action against the Santa Clara chip giant.
</P>
<P>
   With these two historic antitrust cases, the federal government
is targeting the two companies that more than any other symbolize
the phenomenal growth and success of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits mark a sea change in antitrust enforcement. After
nearly 16 years of relative quiet on the issue of big-firm
domination, the federal government has opened an aggressive attack
on the twin behemoths of America's most prominent industry.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Should the lawsuits succeed, they will
impose rules and limits on an industry that has prided itself on
its freewheeling independence.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of decades-old antitrust cases against big oil and
big steel, these suits seek to rearrange the driveshaft of the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's right, but I'm sure that 10 or 15 years
from now, history will be very different depending on what this
court does,'' said Robert Litan, a former Clinton administration
antitrust lawyer who negotiated the original 1994 consent decree
with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions spring from government investigations into whether
the firms used their monopolies _ Microsoft's operating system
software and Intel's computer chips _ to squash competition.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither case turns on classic antitrust issues, such as
predatory pricing. Instead, Intel and Microsoft appear to have
drawn the government's attention because smaller players had
complained about the two giants' dominance in their markets.
</P>
<P>
   But why high tech, and why now?
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, antitrust action against dominant firms had
been in full retreat, led by University of Chicago economists who
argued that the goal of antitrust should be to protect consumers,
not competitors.
</P>
<P>
   More efficient and innovative companies serve consumers better,
they argued, even if it means the leader drives out weaker rivals.
This ``Chicago School'' thinking spread through mainstream academia
and took root in the federal judiciary, including the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, the Reagan administration virtually eliminated
dominant-firm cases; antitrust efforts were refocused on
anti-competitive mergers, collusion and criminal activity such as
bid-rigging and price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   A major exception was the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T; the
administration argued, however, that AT&AMP;T was more like a monopoly
created by government regulation than one derived by efficiency;
even as AT&AMP;T's divestiture was announced, the Justice Department
dropped its 13-year antitrust case against IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bush administration actually initiated the
investigation against Microsoft, dominant-firm antitrust action
began its real resurgence under President Clinton, with cases
against the mergers of Office Depot and Staples, and Lockheed and
Northrop, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Differing ideology clearly played some role. ``The current
administration is far more skeptical of the strength, vibrancy,
dynamism and self-correction of the marketplace,'' said Rick Rule,
a former Reagan antitrust chief now consulting for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is far more blind to the limitations of government, the
costs of enforcement and the relative weakness of the government in
correcting the marketplace.'
</P>
<P>
   But politics are hardly all-explaining. Microsoft's critics and
defenders straddle the ideological map. Former judge Robert Bork,
whose 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox did much to lead the
antitrust retreat, is now heading the intellectual attack on
Microsoft. And Sen. Patty Murray, a liberal Democrat from
Microsoft's home state of Washington, is among the company's
staunchest defenders.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the revival of antitrust zeal, some say, is that
the cute little baby high tech firms of 1980s have grown into big
ugly giants. They and their founders dominate the Information Age
like the robber barons did the Industrial Revolution: Bill Gates
and Microsoft are today's version of John D. Rockefeller and
Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the Reagan administration didn't have to confront
this is, of course, because Microsoft and Intel were not in the
dominant positions that they are today,'' said Litan.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed too. ``It's no accident that the law was
much more conservative at a time when American companies were
running for their lives against formidable Japanese and European
competitors,'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust scholar at George
Mason University.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Defendants in antitrust cases were winning when ``America had
clearly lost its unchallenged supremacy on the world economic
scene,'' Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies did a great job of saying, `We're not hideous
monopolists, we are national treasures, we are engines of
competitive success in the global marketplace,' '' he said.
``They'd look at judges and say, `Do you really want to take that
apart?' and in one courtroom after another, the federal judiciary
said, `No we don't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is high tech's greatest asset _ innovation _ that
makes it an antitrust target. Fierce global competition in mature
industries offers no room for monopolies in things like chemicals,
steel, automobiles and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no new ideas that are going to get you 60 or 70
percent of the cement business,'' said Robert Crandall, a Brookings
Institution analyst. ``Whereas with things changing rapidly in high
tech industries, you're more likely to hit upon something which
gets you a large share of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Theories have evolved too. Chicago School thinking has come
under attack from new theories of ``network effects'' and
``lock-ins.'' By this thinking, an inferior technology can gain
such a foothold that it blocks adoption of superior technologies.
Microsoft's Windows operating system is on so many computers, the
argument goes, that all new software applications have to run on
it; and the more applications that are written for Windows, the
less the chance that a better software platform can ever dislodge
it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many antitrust experts see an uphill battle for the
government. The courts, including the Supreme Court, remain hostile
to plaintiffs alleging predatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of this came with a recent appellate court decision
favoring Microsoft in which the government alleged that the company
violated the 1994 consent decree by bundling its Internet browser
with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   The court said judges should not be designing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``That language is very favorable to Microsoft,'' Litan said.
``It's a concern that many judges are going to have on their minds.
If Justice is going to win this case on the browser issue, they are
going to have to have a satisfactory answer to explain to the
courts why judges won't have to be involved in the minutiae (of
software development) or find a way to keep them from having to
arbitrate every new wrinkle that happens to come into (Microsoft's)
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton antitrust chief Joel Klein has taken a relatively
moderate approach, eschewing any breakup of Microsoft and instead
attacking exclusive marketing agreements and ``bundling'' of
Microsoft's Internet browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the FTC's anticipated case against Intel appears to
be quite narrow. It is expected to focus on whether the
market-leading chip firm had a right to withhold design information
on upcoming chips from companies that sued it for patent
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   But even these narrowly drawn cases could enmesh the courts in
disputes over basic business strategies: how to market products,
how to write customer contracts, how to price products and how to
design them, and what obligations dominant companies have toward
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Microsoft's tactics are a simple case of a monopolist
forcing consumers to buy its other products. Xerox tried it with
copier paper; IBM tried it with punch cards; even a manufacturer of
a salt dispenser to make snow melt tried to get everyone to buy its
salt too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been going on since 1890,'' said Irwin Stelzer, an
analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. ``I've been in this
antitrust racket for 40 years, and every business that gets
challenged begins by saying its industry is different. This is a
classic antitrust case with a very clever public relations overload
that is trying to say, `This is high tech. Dare not interfere with
us or the economy stops.' The fact is, innovation will stop if you
allow Microsoft to keep competitors out by tying new products to
their monopoly power.''

   &UR; WOMEN WITH MEN: THREE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Ford. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The three male protagonists in these post-macho tales, whether
in Paris, Montana or Chicago, are always with women, even when
they're not. They also share a sense that things aren't working out
as they should, or perhaps once did. In praising this ``superb
volume'' last year in these pages, Michael Gorra said of the
author, ``Nobody now writing looks ... more like an American
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLOOD RITES: ORIGINS AND HISTORY OF THE PASSIONS OF WAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Barbara Ehrenreich. Metropolitan/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author, armed with a Ph.D. in biology and a sweeping range
of historical literature, argues that it isn't self-interest or
immutable aggressive instincts that drive humans to war, but the
primordial trauma of being hunted by animals who might be appeased
with bloody rituals. ``One of today's most original writers has
tackled one of humankind's most intractable subjects,'' Michael
Sherry wrote in the Book Review last year. ``Properly awed by her
subject, she seeks to nudge and provoke readers, not overpower
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MERCY SEAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rilla Askew. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   This ambitious frontier novel, filled with echoes of the Old
Testament, is narrated by a tough 10-year-old girl who becomes the
prime mover in her extended family as it journeys from Kentucky to
the remote Indian Territory of Oklahoma. The author ``artfully lays
bare the sins and promises of a pioneer society,'' James Polk said
in these pages in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MANSION ON THE HILL: DYLAN, YOUNG, GEFFEN, SPRINGSTEEN, AND
THE HEAD-ON COLLISION OF ROCK AND COMMERCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Fred Goodman. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A former editor at Rolling Stone profiles some of
rock-and-roll's most influential musicians and managers, and in the
process tracks the growth of an industry that once aspired to
change the world. The result is ``an excellent chronicle of rock's
sad metamorphosis from a quasi-moral force into an unstoppable
money machine,'' Charles Kaiser said here last year.  &UR; INVISIBLE
REPUBLIC: BOB DYLAN'S BASEMENT TAPES &LR; , by Greil Marcus (Owl/Holt,
$12.95), focuses on a legendary group of more than 100 cowboy
ballads, Appalachian tunes and other folk songs recorded by Dylan
and the Band in 1967. ``No previous writer has so transportingly or
authoritatively revealed ... Dylan against the receding vistas of
American music and culture,'' Robert Polito wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TALKING TO THE DEAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Dunmore. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   A London photographer travels to rural Britain to care for her
older sister and her newborn son, a visit that stirs painful
memories of the sisters' infant brother and the increasingly
suspicious circumstances surrounding his death 25 years earlier.
This ``gripping and complex'' story ''metamorphoses from a simple
mystery into a moral whodunit,'' Carol Kino said in the Book Review
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE KISS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Kathryn Harrison. Bard/Avon, $11.
</P>
<P>
   The author tells of her obsessive affair with her father, a
handsome middle-aged preacher who turned up after a long absence to
seduce her when she was a college student. This ``powerful,
disturbing'' memoir is about ``the soul of a young girl and the
terrible injury inflicted by the man who should have been its
protector,'' Susan Cheever wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FUGITIVE PIECES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anne Michaels. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel by a Canadian poet takes shape in the journal
of a Polish Jew and orphaned Holocaust survivor, whose inner life
is filled with inquiries into the nature of memory, guilt, atrocity
and love. Last year, our reviewer, W.S. Di Piero, admired the
book's ``lyricism and sassy deftness.''  &UR; THE SHADOW CATCHER &LR; , by
Andrzej Szczypiorski, translated by Bill Johnston (Grove, $12),
features another protagonist scarred by Nazi-era Poland. In this
coming-of-age novel, a sensitive 15-year-old boy in Warsaw
gradually senses that his safe, privileged world is crumbling
around him. The author ``revels in smells and textures, bodies and
sounds,'' Piotr Michalowski said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE INHERITANCE: HOW THREE FAMILIES AND THE AMERICAN POLITICAL
MAJORITY MOVED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Samuel G. Freedman. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author charts the rise and fall of the New Deal coalition by
following three blue-collar immigrant families -- one Irish, one
Polish, one Italian -- as they claw their way to respectability by
the third generation. In 1996 our reviewer, James M. McPherson,
called this a ``timely, incisive, and engrossing book.'' The same
publisher has issued another personal account of the nation's
rightward shift,  &UR; RADICAL SON: A GENERATIONAL ODYSSEY &LR; , by David
Horowitz ($15), in which a son of communist parents details his
journey from Marxist radical in the New Left of the '60s to
militant critic of his former associates. This is a ``warmly human
and abrasive'' autobiography, Richard Gid Powers wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STORY OF JUNK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Linda Yablonsky. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator, an aspiring writer who deals heroin to pay for her
habit, is surprisingly sharp and upbeat as she plies her trade in
the East Village drug and art scene in the 1980s. Last year in
these pages, Catherine Texier called this first novel ``a
fascinating account ... of life at the edge of one's soul.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending May 30, 1998,
at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 7, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RICH-POLITICIANS-REVIEW _ The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a
half-billionaire businessman who spent $40 million of his own money
in the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, prompted a
certain populist euphoria _ a new conventional wisdom across the
land that even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters'
love. By Todd S. Purdum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-BOMB-REVIEW _ There is, today at least, no special reason
to believe that Pakistan's newly declared ability to build a
nuclear arsenal will provide a nuclear umbrella for other Islamic
societies, or that those other countries will find it easier to go
nuclear themselves. By Elaine Sciolino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-REVIEW _ A statistical look around the world on
abortion shows a complex picture. Assuming that cultural
sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a
remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where
abortion and its effects are concerned. By Barbara Crosette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDAL-HONOR-REVIEW _ Why they don't give medals of honor
anymore. By Eric Schmitt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-TAX-REVIEW _ Congress is well on its way towards
overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many married couples
into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they were
single. By Richard W. Stevenson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-REVIEW _ Monica Lewinsky has her new legal dream team.
She will also surely have bigger bills to go along with the bigger
names now defending her. By Jill Abramson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASHFLOW-REVIEW _ Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street
is securitizing virtually everything that produces a predictable
stream of cash. Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars
and fraternity houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused
airline tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
By Leslie Eaton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GINGRICH-REVIEW _ Newt Gingrich's brand of eclectic, activist
conservatism fits no distinct Republican mold. Moderates shy from
his confrontational tactics, while House conservatives tried to
oust him last year as too accommodationist. Party pragmatists
consider him too unpredictable and undisciplined. By Alison
Mitchell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-STRIKES-REVIEW _ Transportation strikes are an annoying
fact of life in France, yet most people sympathize with the
strikers when the subways shut down or truckers block the highways.
By Craig R. Whitney. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIA-NUCLEAR-REVIEW _ The world might be less dangerous than it
is today had the CIA and its sister intelligence services foreseen
India's nuclear tests last month. Armed with that foresight, the
United States might have been able to forestall a test, as it did
back in 1995, and thus prevent an arms race in one of the planet's
least pacific places. By Tim Weiner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOG-BITES-REVIEW _ Each day, man's best friend reportedly chomps
down on 12,000 Americans _ mostly children, but also 7 postal
employees daily on average _ for a total of more than 4 million dog
bites annually. The cost? Ouch: hundreds of millions of dollars
annually in medical bills and liability claims. A look at some
recent research and literature on the topic.

   An AIDS Vaccine Gets A Go-Ahead for Testing  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration gave Vaxgen Inc. of South San
Francisco the green light to test its AIDS vaccine among 5,000
uninfected volunteers in this country. The same vaccine is expected
to be tested among 2,500 volunteers in Thailand later this year.
Health officials say a vaccine is desperately needed to stem the
AIDS epidemic. But results of these trials will not be known for
four years. _

   A Plea to Ease Sanctions  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung begins a nine-day state
visit to the United States this weekend, and a few days before
leaving he called on Washington to ease sanctions against North
Korea. It was an unusual spectacle for the South Korean president
to ask his allies to lift sanctions against his mortal enemy, but
Kim said engagement with North Korea was more likely to open it up
and moderate its behavior.

   Merger Mania, Cont'd  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a deal that raised eyebrows on Wall Street, American Home
Products announced it would acquire Monsanto Co. for $34.4 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be the nation's largest seller of
prescription drugs _ and perhaps also the site of the biggest
boardroom brawl to come along in years.
</P>
<P>
   The two bosses _ John Stafford from American Home Products and
Robert Shapiro at Monsanto _ will share the chairman's duties but
probably not for long. A clause in the deal enables the company's
new board to reexamine the partnership after the first year.

<P>
   Seriously Settling  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years after Orange County, Calif., filed for
bankruptcy after losing $1.6 billion on a wrong-way bet on interest
rates, the affluent county is about to get a big check. It
announced a $400 million settlement with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
brokerage firm that sold the county speculative securities that
went sour.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, a record for municipal finance, heads off a
scheduled September trial in a $2 billion lawsuit the county
brought against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Orange County says it shares some responsibility. ``The
county was not blameless in these losses,'' said Thomas Hayes, the
state official heading the county's litigation effort.

<P>
   A Bishop Resigns  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years of priesthood, the Roman Catholic bishop of Palm
Beach, Fla., Joseph Keith Symons, resigned after admitting he
sexually molested five boys more than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the bishop confessed the abuse to another priest years ago,
he was told to abstain from alcohol and be chaste. This time,
prompted by a report from one of his victims, the 65-year-old
cleric left for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of Palm Beach that he led for eight years was
stunned. Victims' groups said the case of Symons, the first
American bishop to resign for molesting minors, underscored the
depth of a widespread problem.

<P>
   Derailing at 125 Mph  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Europe's worst rail crash in more than 20 years. A
high-speed express train hurtling through northern Germany at 125
miles per hour piled into the concrete support of an overpass,
killing at least 95 people. Officials said it was most likely a
broken wheel that derailed Inter-City-Express 884, a rare example
of mechanical failure in a land that prides itself on its
engineering prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Germans associate technological advance with safety, and the
crash shook the nation. As if to acknowledge widespread fears,
German Rail withdrew 60 of its 104 high-speed trains for
inspection, causing widespread disruption of its service.

   Switzerland and Company  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when the news about Nazi gold is good for the Swiss, it's
not so good for the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   The United States State Department turned out a final report
detailing how other countries that remained neutral during World
War II _ Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey _ took
looted gold in return for providing Hitler with much-needed war
materiel, including the ores that were used in making
armor-piercing shells. Their actions likely prolonged the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, like a Swiss commission that issued its findings
in May, found that more gold was stolen from the victims of the
Holocaust than previously believed. And much of it went first to
Switzerland, chiefly the Swiss National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in New York, the three major Swiss commercial banks,
which have been charged with obstructing Holocaust survivors and
their heirs from recovering their accounts, reportedly offered to
settle a series of suits for more than $1 billion. Negotiations are
continuing.

   Hold That Toast  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A well-known Bordeaux wine chateau, Giscours, was charged by the
French government with fraudulent winemaking practices. According
to indictments handed down in Bordeaux, Giscours' winemakers
stretched their good stuff by using wine from a lesser region,
mixing one year's wine with another's, adding sugar to boost
alcoholic content and soaking wood chips in the vats to simulate
aging in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   What worried Bordeaux was not Giscours troubles but the
possibility that wine buyers around the world, fed up with the
staggeringly high prices of Bordeaux wines, would use the scandal
as an excuse to take their business elsewhere _ perhaps someplace
like the Napa Valley.

   California voters delivered a decisive blow to three decades of
bilingual instruction in their public schools, voting by a 60-to-40

to one year of intensive immersion. Hispanic voters opposed it by
almost the opposite margin.

   An Appeal Denied  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first legal setback in the Monica Lewinsky investigation
in months, independent counsel Kenneth Starr was resoundingly
rebuffed by the Supreme Court, which refused to resolve quickly the
claims of privileges that have blocked the testimony of four grand
jury witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But his appeals prompted President Clinton to drop his executive
privilege claims. Starr must now decide whether to issue an interim
report to Congress in the next few weeks, or wait to write a more
complete report after the November election.

   Kenneth Kaunda, one of Africa's grand old men, is a free man

arrest for more than five months, Zambian prosecutors dropped all
charges against him. Their case had always looked weak. Kaunda was
originally accused of plotting a bungled coup attempt last October.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic sources said South African President Nelson Mandela
brokered a deal _ free Kaunda, who ruled Zambia from 1964 to 1991,
and he would return to retirement. But probably not quietly.

   Einstein's Dangerous Liaison  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Einstein in love? So it appears, according to nine letters
written by the legendary scientist in 1945 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The And the object of his affection was Margarita Konenkova, who
may have been a Russian spy.
</P>
<P>
   The heartfelt letters, written by Einstein in German, were found
by a member of Ms. Konenkova's family among her belongings and will
be auctioned by Sotheby's later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Konenkova's assignment was to influence prominent American
scientists while living in Princeton, N.J., according to a recent
book by former Soviet spy master, Pavel Sudoplatov. After Konenkova
returned to Russia with her husband, the sculptor Sergei Konenkov,
she and Einstein corresponded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that you find a happy new life in your old homeland, to
which you are so strongly attached,'' he writes in one note. ``Be

<P>
   One joy of working at The New York Times is the interchange with
readers _ smart, well-educated folks who care, a lot, about their
newspaper's standards. But it's an endless revelation to discover
what, precisely, floats their boats.
</P>
<P>
   A picture caption last Sunday about the world's largest cruise
ship incorrectly described its relationship with a nearby sailboat.
The ship was at anchor. It was not edging past the sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   What an uproar ensued! No mistake in years has prompted such an
outpouring. You'd think a photograph of Fidel Castro had been
misidentified as Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Readers seemed eager to underscore the clarity of it all, with
most letters wielding the word ``clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship is clearly at anchor,'' one reader wrote. ``The
starboard anchor chain is clearly visible.'' One charitable reader
tempered this to ``possibly,'' while another upped the ante to
``obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   And listen to the condemnation of the errant caption writer:
``Nautically challenged.'' ``Landlubberly.'' ``Are you slipping?''
``Should be assigned extended time at a shore resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most instructive was Rear Adm. David C. Brown, who
advised that ``the daytime signal indicating the vessel's anchored
status, a black ball, is clearly visible near the bow.''
</P>
<P>
   The editors got out their magnifying glass and, sure enough,
there it was! They hang their heads in landlubberly shame.

   The FBI's Most Famous &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle, Thurgood Marshall, Adolf Hitler, John Lennon,
Cardinal Francis Spellman, Paul Robeson and Pablo Picasso are just
some of well-known public figures whose FBI files just appeared on
the agency's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   They join Lucille Ball, Elvis Presley and other celebrities
whose dossiers were previously transferred to the FBI site
(http://www.fbi.gov). These nearly three dozen files are the most
frequently sought out and are open to the public at the J. Edgar
Hoover building.
</P>
<P>
   Also available on the Web site are files on the Hindenburg
explosion, the escape from Alcatraz and the Basque intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Long available to scholars, the files provide little new
historical information but cast an intriguing light on the dark
side of the agency under Hoover, when agents were preoccupied with
leftist activists and chased gossip and scandal as assiduously as
they tracked down criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's warm correspondence with Hoover is there, along with
background reports on Marshall before he became a Supreme Court
justice. So are reports from informers asserting that Picasso once
said he was a communist, and statements from people who claimed to
have seen Hitler alive long after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ball, the star of ``I Love Lucy,'' earned a file in the
early 1950s when she was investigated by the House Un-American
Activities because she registered to vote as a communist _ at the
insistence of her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also investigated legitimate extortion attempts and
threats like one against Mickey Mantle, the legendary New York
Yankee, who received a threatening note in 1960 suggesting that he
might be shot during a game. ``I have a gun with a microscopic
sight,'' a man wrote him, ``and I'm going to get you through both
of your knees and it's going to happen soon.''

MONEY POLITICS WASN'T DEFEATED IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Money is the mother's milk of politics,'' is the
maxim coined by Jesse Unruh, the liberal Democrat who reigned as
speaker of the California state Assembly in the 1960s, and indeed,
cash has always been an essential commodity in campaigns. The
primary in California last week was the most expensive statewide
election in U.S. history, with $100 million spent on races for
governor, United States senator and a handful of ballot
propositions.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: The rich guys lost.
</P>
<P>
   The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a half-billionaire
businessman who spent $40 million of his own money in the race for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, brought forth a certain
populist euphoria _ a new conventional wisdom across the land that
even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters' love.
</P>
<P>
   But tempting as it might be in light of current campaign-finance
scandals to conclude that voters rejected the corrosive power of
money in politics, the reality is considerably more complex, and
less uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the winning candidate, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a
23-year veteran of state politics, is himself a relentless
fund-raiser, one often accused of blending his campaign-finance
outings with his official duties. And even if he seemed a pauper
compared to Checchi, his campaign spending still broke the old $9
million record for a gubernatorial primary campaign here, set in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a contrary example of the power of money loomed
just as large here last week: A $20-million campaign by organized
labor managed to defeat a ballot measure that would have required
unions to obtain annual written consent of their members before
using dues for political purposes. The measure was favored in early
public opinion polls, but its opponents outspent supporters 3 to 1,
and union members went to the polls in unusually large numbers,
helping Davis in the process.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much evidence that the rules of wealth and politics
have dramatically changed. Since at least the days of Andrew
Jackson, Americans have been ambivalent toward the wealthy in
politics, celebrating the triumph of log cabin little guys and
viewing elites with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wealthy candidates, from Roosevelts to Kennedys to
Rockefellers to Bushes, have often been elected, though generally
when they managed to cloak their wealth in a populist noblesse
oblige and emphasize their empathy with the people. There was, for
example, Nelson Rockefeller's invariable ``Hiya, fella!'' and
George Bush's public fondness for pork rinds when his private taste
ran to popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those candidates spent money in ways that would almost
certainly be subject to intense media scrutiny now; for example, by
trading favors or greasing the palms of local political bosses. But
since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that the First Amendment right
to free speech bars limits on a candidate's spending of his or her
own money, millionaires have had an unchallenged license to test
the political waters.
</P>
<P>
   Money can buy name recognition for political newcomers like
Checchi but it is no guarantee of success. A study by the Center
for Responsive Politics in Washington found that of 149 candidates
for the House and Senate in 1995-96 who put more than $100,000 of
their own money into their campaigns, only 19 won. Still, the U.S.
Senate remains a virtual millionaires' club, and in recent years,
wealthy candidates from Ross Perot to Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin
have managed to turn their private wealth into a campaign plus;
they boast that they are free from the hold of special interests,
as Kohl did when he won office in 1988 spending $7.5 million, most
of it his own, with the slogan, ``Nobody's senator but yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He called to congratulate us,'' said David Doak, Kohl's
longtime media consultant, who worked here this year for Davis.
Doak said his old boss, commenting on the California race, noted
that it's one thing to use your own money to talk about yourself,
``but you have to be real judicious about attacking somebody else,
because people see it differently, and it can cross over into
bullying.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, politicians here and around the country said, Checchi's
money had less to do with his defeat than how he chose to spend it.
Even after 18 months crisscrossing the state talking to voters and
3 months of television commercials touting his private sector
accomplishments and teaching voters how to pronounce his name
(CHECK-ee), he drew about as many unfavorable ratings from poll
respondents as favorable ones _ not good news for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Rep. Jane Harman, herself a millionaire, entered the
race and promptly took the lead in public opinion polls, Checchi
unleashed a relentless barrage of commercials attacking her, often
in misleading terms. That helped destroy Ms. Harman, who spent some
$16 million of family money on her campaign. But, in a kind of
murder-suicide, it also quadrupled Checchi's own negative ratings
and created an opening for Davis, who had been saving his
advertising money for the final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Republican Senate nomination to challenge
Sen. Barbara Boxer, Darrell Issa, a multimillionaire car alarm
manufacturer who spent about $10 million, lost to state Treasurer
Matt Fong, but only after a wave of harshly critical news accounts
raised questions about Issa's business record and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Rich candidates have lost spectacularly in the past, of course,
including the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, who spent $14 million
in the 1989 Republican mayoral primary in New York City, and lost
to Rudolph Giuliani, who spent $2.5 million and won 67 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In California, former Rep. Michael Huffington, a Republican oil
heir, set the previous national record for individual spending here
four years ago, by pouring nearly $30 million of his family fortune
into a nearly successful campaign against Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   But Checchi's resounding defeat still set off ripples of shock,
precisely because Huffington, who was widely regarded as a
political and intellectual lightweight, came so close, and because
Checchi, an altogether more serious figure, spent about 30 percent
more in the primary alone than Huffington spent in his primary and
general election combined.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In general in recent years, polls have shown that most voters
are neutral-to-positive about candidates who finance their own
campaigns, while support for public campaign financing is often
tepid. But as this year's campaign wore on, voters here seemed
taken aback by the sheer reach of Checchi's record-breaking effort.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in April by the Public Policy Institute of California
found that 6 in 10 voters were indifferent to a candidate's
decision to finance his own campaign, but by May, voters indicated
a marked preference, 52 percent to 34 percent, for candidates who
took the conventional route of collecting money from supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his final days on the campaign trail, Checchi went low-tech,
riding a yellow school bus around the state to highlight his
proposals for fixing the state's troubled schools, and publicly
lamenting that his rivals had outfoxed him by turning the race into
a debate about his money instead of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But Checchi was also the victim of his own promises to shake up
the state's political establishment. Over and over again in
campaign appearances, he told audiences, ``If you don't want
change, don't vote for me,'' and voters appeared to take him at his
word. Surveys of voters leaving the polls found that two-thirds
thought California was on the right track after years of economic
collapse and natural disasters, and polls repeatedly found that
voters preferred candidates with experience in government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned against reading too much into Checchi's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of negativity in American politics, and
it's not going to go away,'' said Herbert E. Alexander, a retired
professor or political science at the University of Southern
California and an expert on campaign finance. ``In my view, that
would mean candidates would have to get a bigger bang for the
dollars that they can spend. The high cost of television means now
that you have to go for the jugular, and in those circumstances, it
would lead to even more negativity than we've experienced now.''

BUZZ WORDS: WHO'S AFRAID OF THE ISLAMIC BOMB? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)  
 (bl)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than two decades, the prospect that a
Muslim country could possess nuclear weapons has often been summed
up in two words _ ``Islamic bomb'' _ a phrase that captured the
imagination of some and terrified others.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase appeared as far back as the early 1970s, uttered in
private conversations by Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in
reference to his country's hopes to go nuclear. In the atmosphere
of the time, it seemed a serious warning: that once one Islamic
nation had nuclear weapons, it would enhance the power of them all.
</P>
<P>
   So when Pakistan set off nuclear explosions in the Baluchistan
desert in the last two weeks, the phrase was heard again. In
Karachi, a mockup of an atomic bomb, with ``Islamic Bomb'' painted
on the side, was paraded jubilantly through the streets, and in
Islamabad, crowds shouted for ``holy war'' against India.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we have an Islamic bomb as of today,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., a former ambassador to India. ``And it is
fitted with a missile, which can mean the destruction of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there such a thing as a bomb that exists for the sake of
Islam and for the destruction of Israel? Or do the phrase and the
oratory about it reveal other things instead _ a hunger and rivalry
for greatness by major Islamic countries, and the depth of Israel's
anxieties?
</P>
<P>
   There is, today at least, no special reason to believe that
Pakistan's newly declared ability to build a nuclear arsenal will
provide a nuclear umbrella for other Islamic societies, or that
those other countries will find it easier to go nuclear themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the idea of a global pan-Islamic community with a common
divine mission on earth has been trumpeted in Islamic oratory over
the years. But so far national interests have prevailed. Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini learned that lesson after he tried _
and failed _ to export his Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Pakistan got some help from Muslim countries like Libya
and Saudi Arabia years ago for its nuclear program. But much more
important support came from other places: blueprints, enriched
uranium, tritium and scientific know-how from China; technology
(stolen) from the Netherlands. And the United States gave its tacit
consent all during the years that Pakistan's help was needed in the
Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Pakistan, which desperately needs financial aid, has
offended the United States by staging its nuclear tests, it would
seem to be in Pakistan's interest to keep its technology from
spreading _ something that would only offend the United States
more. Even if Pakistan decided to export its technology at a future
point, the reasons would most likely have nothing to do with
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people talk about an Islamic bomb?'' Pakistani
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said in an interview with the
German news magazine Der Spiegel. ``This is a Pakistani bomb. In
the case of India, you don't talk of a vegetarian bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Fouad Ajami, author of ``The Dream Palace of the Arabs,''
agrees. ``Bombs are not devout,'' he said. ``Bombs in Russia are
not Orthodox bombs. Bombs in India are not Hindu bombs. And bombs
in Pakistan are not Islamic.''
</P>
<P>
   So why does the label persist?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the utterances of Muslims themselves, who over the
years have publicly declared the need for an Islamic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who ousted Bhutto and had him hanged,
condemned the rest of the world in 1986 for branding Pakistan's
bomb Islamic but in the same breath promoted the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why must they call Pakistan's bomb, supposing we have it, an
Islamic bomb?'' he said. ``You can see the mentality. They are
fearful that if an Islamic country such as Pakistan acquires this
technology they will spread it. In fact, if the Islamic world
possessed this technology, it means that 900 million Muslims
possess advanced technology. Hence comes the aggressive campaign
against Pakistan and the aggressive talk about the Pakistani
nuclear bomb. It is our right to obtain the technology. And when we
acquire this technology, the entire Islamic world will possess it
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, in the aftermath of U.S. air attacks on Libya,
its leader, Muammar Gadhafi, declared that the Arab world should
become one ``homeland,'' possessing missiles and even nuclear
bombs. And a few years later, Iranian Deputy President Ataollah
Mohajerani _ now the minister of Islamic guidance and culture and a
close ally of President Mohammed Khatami _ declared that because
Israel has nuclear facilities, Muslim countries needed them too.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the notion persists is that Israel and its
supporters have long found it convenient to demonize Islamic states
and movements whose leaders find it convenient to assert
religion-based claims to Jerusalem. For the Israelis, the idea that
Islamic fervor could go nuclear provides a justification for
maintaining its own unacknowledged nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel justified its bombing of Iraq's nuclear weapons facility
in the desert near Tuwaitha in 1981 in part by declaring that it
needed to destroy an ``Islamic bomb'' before it was built, even
though Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was the most secular of
leaders and never had much affection for his Islamic brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The tension over the prospect of an Islamic bomb continues
today.
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said Muslims worldwide were happy about the Pakistani explosions.
``Muslims now feel more confident that Pakistan's nuclear
capability would play a role of deterrence to Israel's nuclear
capability,'' he said. (By Thursday, after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the visit, Kharrazi had shifted his
tone; he told a disarmament conference in Geneva that ``this was
one genie that was much better to have stayed confined in a
bottle.'')
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the most serious impact of the nuclear
explosions by Pakistan _ and India _ within the Islamic world may
be to revive the lust of rivals among the Islamic nations to
possess their own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is, after all, a peer of a number of Middle Eastern
countries with grand ambitions and an even grander sense of their
place in the world's history _ Iranians who identify with ancient
Persia, Iraqis who remember Nebuchadnezzar, Egyptians who hark back
to the pharoahs and Syrians prideful of the ancient glories of
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   All can ask: Who are these upstart Pakistanis to think they lead
the Islamic world? What about us?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Egypt has underscored that the recent nuclear tests
prove just how urgent it is the make the Middle East a nuclear-free
zone. But some Egyptian commentators implied that Arab countries
made a mistake in signing on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear capacity has become the guaranteed deterrent to defend
national rights and the right of self-determination,'' wrote Salama
Ahmed Salama, a columnist for the semi-official newspaper Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
   She said nothing about Islam.

A GLOBAL DIVIDE ON ABORTION SPLITS POOR FROM RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review) 
 (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It has become an article of faith among those
who oppose abortion in the United States that promoting abortion
anywhere else, particularly in the world's poorest countries, is
tantamount to an attack on the cultures of those countries. It is a
new argument from the conservative right, but it echoes charges
that the radical left used to make, to the effect that family
planning programs targeted at the Third World were a kind of
neo-imperialistic genocide.
</P>
<P>
   A statistical look around the world shows that if cultural
sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a
remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where
abortion and its effects are concerned. But other statistics
demonstrate that the pattern of legality does not reflect how women
in those societies choose to act.
</P>
<P>
   In the global south, where abortion laws are the most
restrictive, abortion rates are still quite high; deaths from
abortion are much higher there than elsewhere, because the
abortions tend to be unsafe. The industrial countries of the global
north are almost universally less restrictive in their abortion
laws. They also have the lowest rates of abortion-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 20 million unsafe _ sometimes legal, but more often
illegal _ abortions estimated to take place each year worldwide, 90
percent occur in developing countries, according to the World
Health Organization. Of the 80,000 deaths that result, 95 percent
are in poor nations. That number does not include women who die of
miscarriages due to health problems or poor prenatal care; such
data do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-colonial case has been made forcefully by Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who has blocked U.S. payments to the
United Nations with an amendment denying money to any organization
that lobbies for liberalized abortion laws in any country. Smith, a
supporter of international child survival programs, says helping
poor children, not preventing them from being born, should be the
priority of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   His legislation, which President Clinton has vowed to veto when
it reaches his desk, has created alarm among family planning and
women's health organizations, who see its bar to advocating
abortion as a challenge to free speech and a chilling factor that
would reduce the amount of money going to all types of population
work, including contraception, in the poorest countries, where they
think it is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said in a telephone interview that he drew a distinction
between contraception and abortion. ``We have made it clear we
would put more money into family planning,'' he said. ``We offered
the administration $100 million dollars more in family planning aid
if they would get out of the abortion business.'' He added:
``Family planning is preventive and its use is up to the
individual. But those of us who respect the lives of unborn
children recognize that whether it be dismemberment, abortion or
chemical poisoning, abortions, legal or illegal, are violence
against children everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Family planning organizations and women's health groups do not
argue that abortion should be encouraged as a method of birth
control. But they do argue for less restrictive laws in many
countries on the ground that such laws would cut deaths. They also
say family planning and community health groups in Africa, Asia and
Latin America have to deal with the results of botched and
life-threatening abortions, sometimes by completing the process of
clearing the womb _ a procedure that would put them on the wrong
side of U.S. law if Smith's proposal were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Smith argues that he would rather spend money on programs like
immunizations, nutritional health for mothers and other forms of
health care that would help children in developing societies
survive, rather than aiding organizations that are associated with
abortion. When asked about the problems posed by unsafe abortion,
he said, ``We need positive alternatives like the 4,000 crisis
pregnancy centers here, where women who have difficulties can be
helped in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of family planning respond that the overall effect of
his proposals could be to harm the ability of mothers to care for
their families. ``Public health experts will be the first to tell
you that child survival is most enhanced by enabling women to space
their childbearing,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, the oldest and largest family
planning organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Populations
Fund, said the argument that family planners from richer nations
are coercing the women of the developing world should be turned
upside down. The real coercion in many places, she said, ``is that
women are being forced to have children by their families or by
social pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that women are getting choices, people seem to be starting
to object,'' said Sadik, a physician from Pakistan. ``It's being
made out that a woman wants to be pregnant all the time. That's not
what all the detailed surveys and research show. Most women don't
want to be serially pregnant. They want to have, if not two
children, maybe four children, not eight children _ and they don't
want to have them every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Because family planning services are not available to millions
of women who want them _ more than 350 million in the developing
world, according to surveys _ they turn to abortion, even where
illegal, and will continue to do so as a last resort, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to public belief, most of the unsafe illegal
abortions take place among married women,'' Sadik said.

WHY THE MEDAL OF HONOR IS SELDOM AWARDED NOWADAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's getting tougher to be a hero in today's
military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Pentagon still hands out plenty of Purple Hearts
and Bronze Stars. But the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest
honor, has been awarded only twice for valorous action since the
Vietnam War: to two Army sergeants killed in Somalia in 1993 as
they tried to help wounded comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Eight World War II veterans, including seven who were denied the
medal because they were black, have also received the medal in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Medal of Honor, authorized by Congress during the Civil War,
is awarded for ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk
of life above and beyond the call of duty in action with the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   In wars past, that meant a bloodied pilot flying a crippled
bomber back to base in war-torn Europe, miraculously saving the
lives of his crew. Or a lone infantryman in an Asian jungle
fighting off hostile forces to rescue injured comrades behind enemy
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bravery like that is hard to come by now, when the conflicts
that U.S. troops engage in are typically brief affairs in which
unmanned Tomahawk cruise missiles have replaced firefights and tank
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for people to be placed in those situations
has diminished,'' said Stanley Arthur, a retired admiral who
commanded allied naval forces in the Persian Gulf war and flew more
than 500 combat missions in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a former Navy SEAL who is the only
Medal of Honor recipient in Congress, said, ``It's just a matter
of, thank God, we're not fighting as many wars.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Congressional Medal of Honor Society meets this weekend
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., more than half of the 163 living
recipients are expected to attend. Since 1863, 3,399 people have
received the award, including one woman, Mary Walker, a Civil War
surgeon from Oswego, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While Pentagon officials insist the stringent requirements in
the statutes have not changed, some retired brass fear politics has
colored the selection process recently. There was even some
surprise at the Pentagon when President Clinton and Congress
approved the awards for the sergeants killed in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a chance that rewarding the soldiers' unquestionable
gallantry was a way to salve the wounds of a nation badly shaken by
the tragedy? Absolutely not, say Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   Given the reverence for valor in the military culture, it is
hard for civilians to understand the prestige the medal bestows on
its recipient. There are concrete benefits: an extra $400-a-month
pension and a lifetime pass for military aircraft. But the
intangibles are equally significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are revered,'' said Wayne Downing, a retired Army
four-star general who commanded the special forces that fought and
died in Somalia. ``There's an unwritten rule that they warrant a
salute, even from their superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   And recipients say it changes them. ``People expected more of me
and I expected more of myself,'' said Jack Jacobs, a retired Army
colonel who won the Medal of Honor for saving an American adviser
and 13 South Vietnamese soldiers during a firefight in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different kind of conflict now,'' said Jacobs, who used
to keep his medal in a sock drawer. He now hangs it in a closet
with his tuxedo.

YOUR ESSAY CAN WIN DINNER WITH A DEAD PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an unrelenting defender of the idea that we need to
understand history, I was pleased to learn of the current essay
contest in which writers are asked to explain why they'd like to
dine on a gourmet meal in the cemetery where President James A.
Garfield is buried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I apologize if I'm the one to break the news to you about
Garfield's demise. But it was in all the papers in the summer of
1881, when Charles J. Guiteau, known to history as a disappointed
office seeker, shot Garfield at a railroad station in Washington,
D.C., only a few months into Garfield's term. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garfield, of tough Ohio stock, did not immediately go flatline
and sprout wings, however. Rather, he signed an extradition paper
as his last official act and then slipped into long and awkward
unconsciousness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This makes him different from some presidents who have performed
official acts while actually being unconscious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Garfield _ no relation to the cat _ finally cashed
in his chips on Sept. 19, 1881, some 80 days after the disgruntled
Guiteau plugged him. I cannot find any record of whether this made
Guiteau a little more gruntled, but perhaps my research has not
been thorough enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garfield's remains were hauled off to Lake View Cemetery at
12316 Euclid Ave. in Cleveland, Ohio, 44106-4393. I heave in the
full address here because you need it to enter this 50-word essay
contest, and quickly, too. The deadline is Thursday (6-11) and you
need an entry form. (Call 216-421-2665.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have been to Cleveland dozens of times but never to the 285
acres that make up Lake View Cemetery, where, by the way, John D.
Rockefeller also is buried, to say nothing (and I intend to say
nothing) of Eliot Ness' ashes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So if I myself enter this contest, I will use as one of my
reasons for wanting to win my deep (about six feet) desire to come
to a place I've never visited. (Never having been there before is
also the only reason I can think of for my hope one day to visit
Idaho.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you enter this contest, you will need to provide a reason for
wanting to win, besides simply being hungry and willing to satisfy
that hunger while hanging out at the Garfield Monument in
Cleveland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You might, for instance, feign interest in Garfield's youth,
during which his father (apparently not of very tough stock) died
when James was barely 2 years old. Or perhaps you could say you've
always been intrigued by anyone whose early schooling was done at a
place named the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute in Hiram, Ohio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I certainly have never known anyone who attended anything called
an Eclectic Institute. The closest was my childhood friend Bob
Lippold who, as I recall, once went to an electric institute,
though probably that's not all that close. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another approach would be to focus on how a man who gained so
much so quickly also lost it with equally blazing speed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For, you see, Garfield, who probably would have been a good
president, served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 18
years, becoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, one
of a handful of such committees always preceded by the word
powerful. But in 1880 the Ohio legislature elected him to the U.S.
Senate, which was how, back then, senators were picked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That very same year, the Republican national convention in
Chicago got divided between James G. Blaine and U.S. Grant, so it
chose Garfield on the 36th ballot. In November he beat Winfield
Hancock, the Democrat, by a hair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later Garfield was decomposing in Cleveland. If
you can't compose a compelling essay with these facts, maybe you,
too, should be shot. &QL;

FOR THE MARRIAGE TAX, A MESSY DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To Republicans intent on damning the tax code as an
inequitable tangle that is strangling the American family, Sharon
Mallory's appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee a
few months back was just the ticket. Miss Mallory, a 41-year-old
factory worker from Indiana, testified that she and her live-in
boyfriend, Darryl Pierce, would like to get married but could not
afford the $3,700 in additional taxes it would cost them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl and I love each other very much and want to be
married,'' Miss Mallory said. ``But the IRS won't let us. We're
victims of the marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by such anecdotal outrage, Congress is well on its way
toward overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many two-income
couples into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
   The House took a big step in that direction Friday, adopting a
budget plan that makes eliminating the marriage penalty the No. 1
Republican tax goal this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all traces back to one simple question: Do Americans feel
that it's right to tax a working couple more just because they live
in holy matrimony?'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But if the political appeal of attacking the marriage penalty is
clear, the policy arguments are less so.
</P>
<P>
   More couples actually get a break from the way the tax code
treats marriage than pay a penalty. Single people _ who are already
at an economic disadvantage to couples, since they cannot spread
their living costs over two incomes _ would get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of eliminating or substantially reducing the
penalty for those who do pay it would be huge. Many Republicans
worry that it would crowd out other tax-cutting priorities, and
Democrats fret about lost spending opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for keeping the marriage penalty is a
treacherous business for members of both parties, few of whom are
willing to risk being seen as undermining a venerated institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, anybody want to defend the marriage-penalty tax?''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asked facetiously last week as
the Senate prepared to grapple with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The budget plan approved by the House on Friday would provide as
much as $100 million over the next five years to eradicate or
substantially reduce the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, both parties are seeking ways to use some of the
revenues that would be generated by the proposed tobacco
legislation to reduce the marriage penalty. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is developing a plan that would give a break to couples
earning less than $50,000, including those who are not affected by
the marriage penalty. Democrats are developing a narrower version
intended to help only couples who pay more because of the marriage
tax.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing momentum for a quick fix belies the complexity
of addressing the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the penalty is hardly universal. While more than
20 million couples paid more in taxes in 1996 than they would have
if they were single, 25 million couples got a marriage bonus: They
paid less as a couple than they would have if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bonuses already go to the very families that social
conservatives consider the most traditional _ those in which the
husband works and the wife stays home. That is because the husband
would be entitled to more exemptions and deductions than he got
when he was single. For 1996, total bonuses of $32.9 billion, or
$1,300 per couple, outweighed total penalties of $28.8 billion, or
$1,380 per couple, by $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, substantially reducing or eliminating the penalty
without raising taxes elsewhere would cost the federal government
at least $20 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   And while social conservatives want to allocate as much money as
possible to reducing the penalty, business groups and supply-side
Republicans and economists are queasy about allowing the issue to
crowd out cuts in other areas, like income tax rates, capital gains
taxes and inheritance taxes. Cuts that target a specific group are
considered by many economists to be an inefficient way of promoting
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most fundamentally, lawmakers have long found it
difficult to address the marriage penalty without creating some
other perceived inequity. Most of the proposals would do nothing
for single people. Most of the proposed fixes would also give more
help to people at the top of the income scale than those at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the proposals would complicate the problem by
levying different amounts of taxes on couples with the same
combined incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current law is the product of decades of swings in policy
and public opinion about how to treat the income of married couples
in a way that is fair to two-income families, single-earner
couples, unmarried people and people across the income spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a perfect system,'' said Iris Lav, deputy
director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research organization. ``I think that where we are
right now is largely a reasonable compromise given the competing
demands of the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   When the federal income tax was established in 1913, it was
levied on individuals, with no special provision made for married
couples. Starting in the 1920s, when relatively few married women
worked, some states passed laws allowing married couples to split
their income and pay at a lower rate than the husband would if he
had to file as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Congress responded by changing the law to allow joint
filing, widening tax brackets enough that most married couples paid
less than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Michael J. Graetz recounted in ``The Decline (and Fall?)
of the Income Tax'' (W.W. Norton, 1997), what couples saw as a
bonus, single people saw as a penalty. So in 1969, following years
of protests, Congress changed the tax brackets to reduce the amount
single people paid _ causing some married people, for the first
time, to pay more as a couple than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Soon protests about the marriage penalty were heard. Best known
of the protesters were David and Angela Boyter, federal employees
from Baltimore who would divorce for tax purposes each December and
then remarry early in the new year to reduce their taxes. Congress
responded by creating a two-earner deduction in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But the deduction was eliminated in 1986. Since then, as the
number of two-income couples has increased, more people have became
subject to the marriage penalty. And the pressure to fix the
marriage penalty has increased accordingly.

YOU TOO CAN BECOME A TRADEABLE SECURITY, RATED AAA

<P>
   Michael Jordan may be the best basketball player in history. He
may have more trophies and rings and sneaker contracts than any man
on the planet. He may even, as Fortune magazine has just
calculated, have contributed $10 billion to the global economy over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not yet made the big leap that, if Wall Street has
its way, is in the future for all sorts of athletes and artists:
the leap from marketable commodity to tradeable security.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone and everything seems to be turning into a
security these days. Chicacgo White Sox slugger Frank Thomas is
working on a deal with SPP Hambro Securities to offer investors a
stake in his future earnings. Dusty Springfield, the 1960s pop
singer, is cooking up something with Prudential Investments. The
songwriting team of Holland, Dozier and Holland, who penned such
Motown hits as ``Stop! In the Name of Love,'' just sold $30 million
of securities backed by their royalties (their investment banker
says the bonds got an A rating from Moody's Investors Service).
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street is securitizing
virtually everything that produces a predictable stream of cash.
Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars and fraternity
houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused airline
tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The alchemy by which Wall Street turns stuff into securities
varies. The old-fashioned method is the stock offering, which has
been used by a number of sports teams. But there are risks for
celebrities who go public: both Debbie Reynolds' casino and Wilt
Chamberlain's restaurant chain bombed in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are derivatives, so called because their prices are
derived from the value of something else, like an index or a
security or a commodity. Some involve relatively straightforward
bets on things like the price of soybeans or Microsoft shares. The
infamous variety _ like the ones that got Orange County, Calif., in
trouble _ often involve wagers so arcane as to be inexplicable. In
the works are derivatives that let investors bet on the temperature
or rainfall in a geographic region.
</P>
<P>
   But the really big idea on Wall Street today is securitization,
which began with home mortgages in the 1980s. Banks had made a lot
of them and wanted to sell them, but to whom?
</P>
<P>
   Then someone had a bright idea. If Wall Street put together a
whole bunch of mortgages, the bundles would look almost like
traditional bonds. They would be relatively safe investments,
because even if one borrower defaulted, there would be plenty of
others still paying. Bond buyers, like mutual funds, pension funds
and amateur investors, jumped on these mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a creative burst on Wall Street. If securities could
be made out of mortgages, why not car loans, credit-card
receivables, business loans or bad debts?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a number of firms on Wall Street are trying to
securitize consumers' electric bills. The goal is to lower
utilities' borrowing costs, creating savings that can be passed on
to consumers, said Joseph Fichera, an investment banker at
Prudential Securities. ``It's like refinancing your mortgage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest and sexiest twist involves using streams of income
from entertainers. In the first such deal, rock star David Bowie
sold $55 million of bonds last year backed by his anticipated
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Creating such deals has proved harder than many investment
bankers predicted, and the securities have been so complicated that
they are offered only to professional investors. Nonetheless,
several Wall Street firms have set up entertainment subsidiaries,
like one at Nomura that raised money for Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   David Pullman, the investment banker who successfully sold the
Bowie and Motown deals, says he has more up his sleeve. Film
libraries, television syndications, literary estates _ all could be
turned into securities, says Pullman, a managing director at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co., a New York-based securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Pullman said ticket sales at sports stadiums were another
possibility for securitization. Individual athletes' earnings are
trickier because their contracts contain too many outs like morals
clauses, he said. But he added, ``We could do it if they had no cut
contracts or endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few who might qualify is Michael Jordan, of course.
If Fortune is right, he'd be rated triple-A. Stockbrokers will be
standing by to take your call.

LEWINSKY'S TAB DREAM TEAM, NIGHTMARE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky has her new legal dream team. She
will also surely have bigger bills to go along with the bigger
names now defending her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the fact that she comes from a well-off family, her
ability to carry this growing financial burden is open to question.
This is undoubtedly weighing on the 24-year-old Ms. Lewinsky and
her parents as legal activity on her behalf intensifies, and she
faces the critical decision of whether to cooperate with or fight
against the sex-and-coverup investigation of the White House by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, whom she retained last week, are
both senior members of a select coterie of Washington lawyers.
They've performed legal triage for a host of players in past
political scandals, from Fawn Hall, the secretary caught up in the
Iran-Contra affair, to Ken Parkinson, a Watergate figure whose
acquittal Stein won.
</P>
<P>
   Their services do not come cheaply. Both men have hourly billing
rates in the range of $400 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Lewinsky is already deep in the hole. When the final
bill is tallied, she'll likely owe more than $300,000 to her first
legal team, led by William Ginsburg, the family friend who served
as her principal lawyer until he was dismissed Tuesday; so say
Ginsburg and others familiar with the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Her expensive new retinue, worthy of her star billing in one of
the biggest controversies to rock Washington, is not limited to
Cacheris and Stein. There is also Nathaniel Speights, a Washington
trial lawyer who worked with Ginsburg and will remain on Ms.
Lewinsky's legal team. And a month ago Judy Smith, a respected
lawyer who once worked in the Bush White House, was retained by the
Lewinskys as family spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky grew up in rarefied Beverly Hills and her father,
Bernard Lewinsky, who now lives in nearby Brentwood, is a
successful oncologist. Her mother, Marcia Lewis, long divorced from
her father, has apartments at the posh Watergate complex in
Washington and in New York. But despite being financially
comfortable amid trappings of wealth, family friends say, the
parents are not so rich as to absorb the six-figure legal bills
their daughter is incurring.
</P>
<P>
   In TV appearances, Ms. Lewinsky's father has said he can't
afford them. Appearing on ``Larry King Live'' in April, he
announced that the family had established a legal defense fund for
his daughter, though it hasn't raised much money yet. In an
interview Wednesday, Ms. Smith reiterated that ``the legal bills
have been a tremendous strain for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg has said that Ms. Lewinsky would eventually have no
choice but to write a book or sell her story in order to pay off
her legal bills. But no one has approached her or her family with
any such offer recently. And any tell-all deal would certainly have
to wait until Ms. Lewinsky was out of legal jeopardy, a prospect
probably months away at the very least, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   In part to minimize her legal expenses, Ms. Lewinsky did filing
and other routine office chores for Ginsburg and Speights. But this
was as much to fill her time as to make a dent in her debts.
</P>
<P>
   As the subject of intense public scrutiny, Ms. Lewinsky can't do
much of anything these days, in terms of producing income or
otherwise, except to meet with her lawyers or stay secluded with
one of her parents. When she goes out in public, a fleet of TV
cameras is almost always in tow. Several weeks ago, a camera crew
staked out a bank branch near Speights' office in downtown
Washington, where Ms. Lewinsky had been using a cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very disturbed that she has no life right now,'' her
father said in April. ``She's afraid she'll put all of her friends
in jeopardy if she talks to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In part to lift her sagging spirits, Ms. Lewinsky recently posed
in Malibu for a photo spread in Vanity Fair magazine. But according
to a spokeswoman for the magazine, Ms. Lewinsky wasn't paid
anything. And although she got to model some spiffy clothes, she
didn't get to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, her high-profile dinners at swank Washington
restaurants with the ubiquitous Ginsburg do not appear to have
added to her legal bills; some of the restaurants may have fed them
gratis in return for the publicity of having such celebrated
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is hardly alone in worrying about how to pay her
lawyers. After disbanding his legal defense fund, President Clinton
has established a new fund to help pay the more than $5 million he
owes to his lawyers at Williams &AMP; Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate
&AMP; Meagher.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones, who sued the president for sexual harassment only
to have her case thrown out of court this year, is in a tussle with
two of her lawyers over $800,000 the lawyers say she owes them. And
a slew of current and former White House aides have amassed
six-figure legal bills as witnesses in Starr's $40 million inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the marquee value of representing a client like Ms.
Lewinsky is considerable, and therefore her new lawyers may be
willing to discount their rates or be patient about getting paid.
There could even be lucrative book offers down the road, but last
week they vowed to maintain a lower profile than Ginsburg, by
avoiding the TV talk-show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And for the time being, at least, the lawyers are under orders
to scrimp where they can. One specific request: no limousines to
see Starr.

EVEN THE FRENCH HATE THIS STRIKE

 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

<P>
   PARIS _ Transportation strikes are an annoying fact of life in
France, yet most people sympathize with the strikers when the
subways shut down or truckers block the highways. After all, truck
drivers and railway workers don't make much money, and employers
seldom penalize workers for not showing up during transit strikes,
so it's easy to wish the strikers well.
</P>
<P>
   But the renowned Gallic sang-froid was severely tested last week
by a strike by pilots at Air France, the state-owned airline, just
days before the nation plays host to the World Cup, the World
Series of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, whose average annual salary of $123,000 makes them
better paid than their counterparts at other major European
carriers like Lufthansa and British Airways, were protesting a
management plan to trim their pay by an average of $26,000 over the
next three to five years, and replace the income with stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   With Air France, the official carrier for the World Cup, able to
fly only a fraction of its schedule, the French public was
outraged, for the first time in years, by what many saw as greedy
pilots. A poll published by Paris-Match last week showed that only
47 percent of those polled supported holding a transportation
strike during the World Cup. In December 1995, 62 percent of those
surveyed sympathized with striking rail and transport workers; in
November 1996, 74 percent supported striking truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad and almost ashamed,'' said Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement as negotiators were trying to reach a
settlement before the games kick off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were
elected a year ago by voters who never forgave Jospin's
conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, for trying to cut the
pension benefits of the rail and transit workers in 1995 as part of
an unpopular government austerity plan to prepare for the coming
single European currency. When strikers shut down rail and mass
transit networks, the country was paralyzed, but with Christmas
approaching many workers were just as happy to back the strikers
and stay home.
</P>
<P>
   This time things were different. The irony of a Socialist-led
government criticizing strikers is only one of many contradictions
in the latest episode in France's struggle to pull its cosseted
welfare-state economy into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement even had to deny rumors that he was considering
calling in the French equivalent of the National Guard to replace
the strikers the way that President Ronald Reagan replaced striking
American air traffic controllers in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The French feel as strongly about soccer as they do about social
justice. Taxpayers put up $450 million for a new stadium in Paris
for the World Cup, and Air France planes have been splashed with
bright color pictures of players from 32 countries. Buses in Paris
display welcome signs in many languages, and special trains have
been arranged to transport fans and players among the 10 cities in
which the 64 games will be played.
</P>
<P>
   France's national honor is at stake, the authorities keep
reminding people. No American-style private-sector improvisation, a
la Atlanta during the last Olympics and Denver during the 1994
World Cup, would do for the glory of France.
</P>
<P>
   With a sense that the eyes of the world were on them, many
French felt indignation when transportation unions started in with
business as usual _ by trying to hold up employers for ransom just
when their work was most needed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were not the only ones on the picket lines, though
truck drivers, who shut down the country's roads in 1997 and the
year before to get higher wages, promised they wouldn't think of
inconveniencing their fellow citizens during the World Cup, which
ends July 12.
</P>
<P>
   A union representing 30 percent of the engineers for the state
railway network called a strike to begin on the eve of the Cup
opening. Conductors struck and disrupted rail traffic around the
country Friday. Public transportation in Lyons, where five games
will be played, was shut down by a strike Tuesday, and workers on
the Paris municipal transportation system threatened another for
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the pilots who bore the brunt of public resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The French are notoriously suspicious of people who are better
off than they are, to the point of making anonymous telephone calls
to Finance Ministry inspectors to tip them off to people with
lavish life styles (one reason why owners of luxury homes in Paris
often hide them behind dilapidated building facades).
</P>
<P>
   So it was difficult to muster much sympathy for the well-paid
pilots, who after all were not striking for better wages but
demanding cash instead of stock options as part of their salaries
when Air France is partly privatized later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it needed to cut its annual payroll by $84
million to make itself more competitive in the European market, but
many French regard the stock market as a sort of untrustworthy
gambling casino. As elsewhere in Europe, there is great resistance
here to the idea of supplementing state pensions with the private
investment plans that make union pension funds such big players in
the stock market in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, a
member of the Communist Party, railed against the pilots. ``France,
the company and the World Cup must not be held hostage,'' he told
Parliament as pressure mounted on both the government and the
strikers to settle. ``We must negotiate and we must break this
logjam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Le Canard enchaine, a left-wing satirical newspaper, lost
patience with the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their maneuvering a week from the Cup, with thousands of
passengers about to pour into the country, could easily be mistaken
for blackmail,'' the newspaper wrote, pointing out that the pilots
also showed little gratitude for the $3.4 billion taxpayers pumped
into Air France during its money-losing years to keep it going and
safeguard the pilots' jobs.

NAIVETE AT THE CIA: EVERY NATION'S JUST ANOTHER U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Niccolo Machiavelli had it right: never assume the
other guy will never do something you would never do. Too bad
Machiavelli never worked for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The world might be less dangerous than it is today had the CIA
and its sister intelligence services foreseen India's nuclear tests
last month. Armed with that foresight, the United States might have
been able to forestall a test, as it did back in 1995, and thus
prevent an arms race in one of the planet's least pacific places.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by retired Adm. David Jeremiah, a former vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, blamed the failure on
systemic flaws in the way the intelligence community gathers and
handles information, trains its thousands of analysts and commands
its $27-billion-a-year empire.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying those failures, Jeremiah said, was a classic
American cultural assumption: ``This `everybody thinks like us'
mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``underlying mind-set'' was that India ``would behave as we
behave,'' he said. ``We should have been much more aggressive in
thinking through how the other guy thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, U.S. analysts decided that the newly elected
Hindu nationalist political party, the BJP, couldn't possibly be
serious when it campaigned on a nuclear weapons platform.
Westerners saw good reasons for India to eschew testing and
therefore thought Indians must understand their own best interests
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence professionals have a name for this kind of
thinking: mirror-imaging. It is considered one of the most basic
mistakes in the spy manual. ``Mirror-imaging _ projecting your
thought process or value system onto someone else _ is one of the
greatest threats to objective intelligence analysis,'' a senior CIA
officer, Frank Watanabe, wrote last year in Studies in
Intelligence, the agency's in-house journal. ``Avoid mirror-imaging
at all costs,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to follow such counsel led the United States to believe
that Japan would never attack Pearl Harbor and that Saddam Hussein
would never invade Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   But no analyst in the government imagined India testing a
nuclear bomb. ``The amazing thing was the unanimity,'' a senior
State Department official said ruefully. ``There was nobody
anywhere _ no voices _ saying `Watch out!'''
</P>
<P>
   As Watanabe notes, ``When everyone agrees on an issue, something
is probably wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something peculiarly American about the trap of
mirror-imaging. Americans overseas like foreigners to speak, dress,
eat and entertain as Americans do. They may well believe that
everybody also thinks as they do. The whole world buys Big Macs _
so the ideas must come along with them, like a side of fries. This
way of thinking meant that, last month, the United States
government looked down at India from its spy satellites _ and saw
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about the state of U.S. intelligence? First,
mirror-imaging filled a void. America had few or no spies in India
reporting on the nuclear program. So its analysts had to think
without the benefit of facts.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the CIA does not always teach people to think straight,
said Mark Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House
intelligence committee. ``They don't do a lot of training,'' he
said. ``They say, `Congratulations, you're the Mali analyst, have a
nice day.' They need to spend some time on thinking about how you
think. Very few analysts come by it naturally and almost none are
taught to do it. Crisis-driven as they are, they don't have a lot
of time to step back and say: `Have I missed something? Is this the
right way of thinking?'''
</P>
<P>
   Third, group think grinds top-secret papers into intellectual
pulp, said Angelo Codevilla, a former senior staff member of the
Senate intelligence committee. ``Our intelligence community thinks
in herds _ `Stay close. Don't get out ahead. Don't be thought of as
crazy,''' he said. ``There is a tremendous lack of diversity of
mind. The most typical phrase in an intelligence estimate is `We
believe' _ the corporate belief, the office view, calibrated to
satisfy _ not `I think.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, ``we have a brain-power problem'' in American
intelligence, said Robert Steele, a former CIA officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average analyst has 2 to 5 years' experience,'' Steele
said. ``They haven't been to the countries they're analyzing. They
don't have the language, the historical knowledge, the in-country
residence time or the respect of their private-sector peers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the CIA was not the only outfit in Washington
that had a mirror where its crystal ball should be. So had the
White House, the Pentagon and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's reporting on Pakistan's subsequent nuclear tests
was prescient and precise. But Jeremiah found the CIA misread
India's nuclear ambitions because it was short on insight,
expertise, training and leadership _ a strange state of affairs for
an intelligence agency created to be the deepest think tank in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, the admiral found, was not thinking clearly, and so
deceived itself.

ROVER RAGE: DOG BITES MAN

<P>
   ``Dog bites man,'' the quintessential nonstory, morphed into a
very newsy sports dream-come-true last week.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the New York Yankees right-hander, was nipped on the
index finger of his pitching hand by his mother's dog and had to
yield his turn in the pitching rotation to Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez, newly defected from Cuba. Thus a minor bite by a Jack
Russell terrier named Veronica facilitated the storybook odyssey of
a gifted pitcher, from ostracism in his Communist homeland to a
victorious debut in Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Developments on the dog-bite front aren't usually so uplifting.
That was also clear last week _ for in case you didn't notice (and
it's a good bet David Cone didn't) it was National Dog Bite
Prevention Week.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors, the U.S. Postal Service and the Humane Society of
the United States, say that each day man's best friend chomps down
on 12,000 Americans _ mostly children, but also 7 postal employees
daily on average _ for a total of more than 4 million dog bites
annually. The cost? Ouch: hundreds of millions of dollars annually
in medical bills and liability claims.
</P>
<P>
   Here are gleanings from recent research and literature on the
topic.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In January, the Journal of the American
Medical Association raised alarums with ``Incidence of Dog Bite
Injuries Treated in Emergency Departments,'' a study by researchers
at the University of Pittsburgh. They began with a long historical
perspective:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The close association between humans and domesticated dogs began
at least 12,000 years ago. Since then, people have been intimately
involved in domesticating the wild dog into hunter, guard and
companion. However, the domesticated dog retains many of its wild
instincts, including behaviors that all too often lead to human
attacks. This risk has always been present. Only now, however, are
we beginning to gain a full understanding of the impact of dog
bites on populations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)And how:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Recent work by Sacks et al has improved the precision of
national estimates for dog bite-related mortality and for dog bites
receiving any medical attention. For the 10-year period 1979
through 1988, an annual average of about 15 fatal dog attacks was
documented in the United States, with extrapolated estimates
suggesting that as many as 20 per year may have actually occurred.
Based on a random household survey, the Injury Control and Risk
Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it was estimated that about 800,000 bites occur annually that
require medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Of course, there are many minor bites that
go without medical attention. But by sifting national data on
emergency-room visits, the researchers were able to focus on the
most serious injuries:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The annualized weighted estimate of the incidence of new dog
bite-related injuries seen in U.S. E.D.'s (emergency departments)
was 333,687 (annually) for a rate of 12.9 per 10,000 persons. These
injuries comprised about 0.4 percent of all emergency-department
visits during the study period. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Ages of victims of dog bite-related injuries ranged from younger
than 1 year to 91 years (median age: 15 years). Incidence rates
were significantly higher among children aged 0 to 9 years,
especially among boys. The 5- to 9-year-old male age group had the
highest rate, 60.7 emergency-department visits per 10,000 persons.
The estimated 57,580 dog bite-related visits for boys aged 5 to 9
years represent 3.6 percent of all injury-related
emergency-department visits in this age and sex group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases in which body part area could be determined
(about two thirds of the cases), the face, neck and head (combined)
were the leading body-part sites affected (29 percent), followed by
the upper limbs and lower limbs. Among children aged 0 to 9 years,
73 percent of the injuries with attributed injury site were to the
face, head and neck, while all other ages had only 30 percent of
the injuries occur to the head, face and neck. There was a
nonsignificant trend toward a seasonal distribution of the
incidence of dog bite injuries, with the highest rates being
observed during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The researchers urged further study of
high-risk dogs to prevent attacks. But when the American Kennel
Club suggested in a revision of its ``Complete Dog Book'' this
spring that certain dog breeds were unsafe for children, it ran
into a host of objections and had to withdraw the edition. The
question of whether there are bad breeds as opposed to individual
bad dogs is quite complex, says Dr. Leslie Sinclair, director of
Animal Companion Care at the Humane Society. She wrote in the
summer 1997 issue of H.S.U.S. News:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Every animal is an individual and his/her character and
personality traits are determined by much more than genetic
background. Not every border collie is intelligent, nor is every
collie loyal to his/her owner. Certainly, not every rottweiler, pit
bull or German shepherd is a dangerous dog. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Data on human fatalities from dog bites do tend to implicate
specific breeds of dogs as killers. Of the dog breeds or breed
mixes known to have caused human fatalities from 1979 through 1994,
five breeds alone account for more than one of every three of those
deaths _ the pit bull (57), rottweiler (19), German shepherd (17),
Siberian husky (12) and Alaskan malamute (12). . . .
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, data linking breeds with NONFATAL bites are hard
to come by. There is no nationwide reporting agency for animal
bites; therefore, information about which breeds of dogs most
commonly bite is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)So what to do about preventing dog bites?
The Postal Service offers tips in a true-or-false quiz format: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. If a dog is sleeping in the yard, it is a good idea to
quietly slip by so you don't disturb the dog. True or false?
</P>
<P>
   A. FALSE. Dogs have keen senses; under these conditions, you
would probably startle the dog and increase the possibility of an
attack. The right procedure? Make a soft noise, such as a low
whistle, so the dog won't be surprised. Keep your eye on the dog,
and if you must withdraw, back up slowly and carefully to avoid a
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Turning away and retreating quickly from a dog will probably
prevent you from being bitten. True or false?
</P>
<P>
   A. FALSE. Turning and running often increases the dog's
excitement and provides an opportunity for it to bite while your
back is turned. The proper procedure? Stand your ground initially;
face the dog; use a purse, briefcase, book, coat or jacket as a
shield between you and the dog; and back away slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's a good idea to carry biscuits to make friends with dogs.
True or false?
</P>
<P>
   A. FALSE. Too often the dog will accept the treat, but still not
accept you. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)But even the Postal Service isn't completely
grim about dog bites, maybe since it has managed to reduce attacks
on its carriers through a variety of precautions. In an address in
Washington to kick off Dog Bite Prevention Week, Michael J. Shinay,
vice president of the Postal Service, noted that when it comes to
dog-bite humor, postal workers have heard it all:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   That brings to mind a classic scene from the movie ``The Pink
Panther Strikes Again'' (1976). Inspector Clouseau is standing at
the front desk of an inn, talking to the innkeeper. A dog lies at
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your dog bite?'' he asked the innkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the innkeeper replies.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector reaches down to pet the pup, which promptly sinks
his canines into Clouseau's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clouseau angrily turns to the innkeeper and says, ``I thought
you said your dog does not bite!''
</P>
<P>
   With a shrug, the innkeeper replies, ``That's not my dog.''

NEWT GINGRICH: A BREAKER OF MOLDS NOW TRIES TO FIT IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June 6.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask Newt Gingrich about former House speakers as
serious candidates for president and, ever the historian, he would
recall the likes of Henry Clay and James K. Polk.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was before the Civil War. But Gingrich has
defied historical trends; he helped break the Democrats'
decades-long control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And signs persist _ like his recent pledge before the Israeli
Parliament to support Jerusalem as the capital of Israel _ that the
54-year-old Georgian is considering a bid for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call the idea nothing short of delusional. Gingrich
still faces an ethics complaint relating to benefits he may have
received from Gopac, the Republican political action committee. And
while his public standing has improved, aides in his press office
groaned when a recent ABC News survey flashed onto a television
screen showing that only 37 percent of those polled thought that
the speaker was honest and trustworthy, compared to the 38 percent
who credited the embattled President Clinton with those attributes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gingrich's brand of eclectic, activist conservatism
fits no distinct Republican mold. Moderates shy from his
confrontational tactics, while House conservatives tried to oust
him last year as too accommodationist. Party pragmatists consider
him too unpredictable and undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gingrich has fervent supporters among Republican
grass-roots campaigners and small donors. And should he choose to
jump into a crowded primary field, he would, his strategists say,
do well precisely because in a race full of niche candidates he
would not be limited to any of his party's distinct constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are buckets full of every pond that Newt can dip into
and scoop out support,'' said Rich Galen, a Gingrich ally who now
heads Gopac, which Gingrich once ran.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition who is now a consultant, agreed: ``Newt's constituency is
not a piece of the pie. It's more like cake icing. It's spread
evenly throughout the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom, reasserted after Bob Dole's loss to
Bill Clinton, is that a legislative leader is a bad presidential
candidate. A speaker risks being defined not by his own positions
but by the legislation his majority passes. And the making of laws,
especially in a feuding, fractious House, is messy.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways Gingrich's dual roles, as a speaker seeking to
broaden his congressional majority and as a candidate needing a
wider constituency, fit together. They encourage him to be an
apostle of a Big Tent Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's close colleagues say it is in the ``center-right''
of the Republican Party that Gingrich feels most comfortable _ not
with the social conservatives but a few notches over with the
economic conservatives. He is a tax cutter who believes government
should invest in science, technology and highways.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans define his core constituents as the fans of
Rush Limbaugh who are probably anti-abortion but more interested in
pocketbook issues. They are the county commissioners, salespeople
and small-business owners who were the movement conservatives
before the religious right loomed so large in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who like Newt the most remember him when he was fighting
to get the majority,'' said Don Fierce, a Republican strategist.
``They remember when he came up with the Contract With America
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a funny way, Newt can cut across party lines pretty well,''
he added. Other Republicans point out that when conservatives tried
to oust Gingrich from his post, his base of support became
committee chairmen and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But watching him construct his brand of Republicanism can be
like staring at a de Kooning canvas. It's bold and eye catching,
but it's also hard to discern the pattern. One day, over objections
from conservatives, Gingrich is pushing through the House a bill to
allow a referendum on Puerto Rican statehood. A few months later,
to the dismay of moderates, he is aligning with the Christian
Coalition and promising to cut off funds for the National Endowment
for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Setting himself apart from Clinton and appealing to Jewish
voters, he recently called Secretary of State Madeleine Albright an
agent of the Palestinians, and in a speech before the Israeli
Parliament parted with U.S. policy on Jerusalem. But days later, he
popped up in Bosnia to support America's mission there.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans say Gingrich is trying to balance his
needs for the congressional elections this year with the
presidential election in 2000. ``The constituency for '98 we are
most concerned about this very minute is the hard right that we
need to have not angry with us,'' one House Republican said. ``He's
playing to that group today but trying to do it without
antagonizing the left-righters he needs for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's confidantes say he is focused only on 1998, aware he
has no future if he does not keep the House majority. If this
year's election imperatives require him to ditch the high-toned
policy speech he began the year with so he can sharpen a partisan
confrontation, which might also drive up his personal negatives, so
be it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says he will not decide whether to run for president
until Labor Day of 1999. Critical in his decision is whether his
wife, Marianne, is comfortable with a presidential bid. Unlike
other candidates, he has not put operatives into early primary
states.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others, Gingrich's star power, fund-raising base and
speaking ability give him the luxury to make a decision late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of candidates will be able to raise $10 million, which
is the threshold just to run,'' said Republican pollster Frank
Luntz. ``Only a few _ maybe a half dozen _ reach the $20 million
threshold to carry all the way through. More than $20 million makes
you truly credible. And Gingrich's Gopac, and his fund-raising
capability, is truly incredible.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The Longest Day can't get a minute
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, June 10, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 54th anniversary of D-Day, the Sixth of June, passed
Saturday without mention in my local newspaper, or on any of the
local and national TV news shows I saw.
</P>
<P>
   One of those all-movies cable channels I am fond of watching
actually showed war films all evening and night. But they were of
the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after much of the Western world commemorated the 50th
anniversary of the momentous 1944 Allied invasion of Nazi-held
Europe, the significance of it seems no longer worthy of a line of
observance, or a flash of film.
</P>
<P>
   With me, D-Day is a reverent occasion. As has been my long
custom, I pulled out my dramatic, albeit militaristic, soundtrack
of the 1962 classic war film ``The Longest Day'' and played it
loudly in my home.
</P>
<P>
   It's an empty nest now, been so for a while. Only my wife could
hear it, and she understands me.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, I insisted our four children listen to both it
and to me telling about why I believe D-Day was the most important
day in the history of our civilization _ an arguable opinion but
mine nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because I went through much of my impressionable
adolescence during World War II, the dates of seven critical events
during that war have stayed in my memory bank, although the total
number of Hank Aaron's home runs and the birthdates of several of
my nine grandchildren already have seeped out.
</P>
<P>
   They were Dec. 7, 1941 (Pearl Harbor); June 6, 1944 (D-Day);
April 12, 1945 (Roosevelt's death); May 7, 1945 (Germany's
surrender); Aug. 6, 1945 (Hiroshima); Aug. 14 (Japan's
capitulation); and Sept. 2, 1945 (Japan's formal surrender.)
</P>
<P>
   A friend who I asked said he thought one of the most memorable
dates in his life was the day we landed on the moon _ but he
couldn't tell me what the date was (July 20, 1969). And I confessed
to him that I could not remember the date of the end of the Korean
War although, on the very day it ended, I was on orders to ship
over there (July 27, 1953).
</P>
<P>
   Another friend once called me ``a collector of battlefields,''
inasmuch as I had twice visited the beaches of Normandy and the
American cemetery above it, and have twice been to Pearl Harbor, as
well as to Bastogne in Belgium, where the great Battle of the Bulge
was fought in 1944, and to Monte Cassino, site of a lengthy siege
during the Italian campaign, as well as to other battle sites in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he's right, but more likely I'm a keeper of memories
(and the dates of those memories) from a time when there was no
debate about whether a war had to be fought to save civilization.
My visits to those sites, particularly the cemetery in Normandy,
were more as a pilgrimage to give thanks to, and to honor, those
who died so that future generations may live.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, I took my grandson there. At age 13, it was
time he felt what I felt when I was 13.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds corny and sentimental to talk that way today, but
that's me. I'm going to keep playing the theme from ``The Longest
Day'' until the tape wears out, and I'm going to keep remembering
that day, and those other important wartime dates _ because someone
has to.
</P>
<P>
   And it would be gratifying if our newspapers, radio and TV
stations cut a little time out of their crime and sex reporting to
commemorate and keep alive the memories of those supremely critical
days that shaped our lives.

 &HT;    Short Takes: Goldwater's epitaph
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even liberals are elbowing each other out of the way to say nice
things about Barry Goldwater. Sen. Goldwater was the trusted
friend, straight-shooter, gallant warrior, true blue conservative _
the kind of conservative liberals want back. Yet, in one moment of
Goldwater's life he irrevocably splintered the terms of the
national debate.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1964 GOP convention, Goldwater, accepting his party's
presidential nomination, declared, ``Extremism in defense of
liberty is no vice. Moderation in pursuit of justice is no
virtue.'' It brought down the house the way Dwight Eisenhower's
petulant poke at ``sensation-seeking columnists'' _ pronounced
``col-yum-nists'' _ did in 1956. The cheering startled Ike more
than the Ardennes.
</P>
<P>
   If Goldwater meant what he said, one can only wonder what he
thought he meant. Containing Communism? The Bomb? The crowd knew,
or thought so. It was a stunning statement in a country whose
genius had been moderation, all of a sudden on its way to becoming
a semi-dirty word. The genie was out of the bottle, later to be
clothed in more respectable togs: Silent Majority, Southern
Strategy, Reagan Democrat, New Right. The incivility of your choice
could be noble pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater went on to other things, most notably talking Richard
Nixon out of office; Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig also claim
credit. Goldwater never took what he said back. Someone repeated it
at his funeral.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Push to stifle unions still threatens
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Partisanship aside for a moment, anyone with even vestigial
twitches of fairness has to be relieved that California voters last
week put the kibosh to a referendum that would have forced unions
to get written permission from their members to spend dues money on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was pitched as defending the little guy from the
predations of powerful union bosses _ ``paycheck protection,''
so-called _ but it was no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum was part of a national effort by Republicans and
conservative action groups to misuse the law to defund a political
opponent. Similar referenda are afoot in three other states. A push
for comparable legislation is being made in at least two dozen
state legislatures, and a look-alike bill is pending in the U.S.
House.
</P>
<P>
   The California vote will slow the drive but won't end it.
Sponsors figure they are bound to win in some states, and in
others, as in California, the push will help to keep the AFL-CIO
out of electoral politics by draining its treasury. The unions and
their allies had to outspend the proponents massively _ to the tune
of some $20 million _ to turn the California initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The unions' vigorous self-defense overcame an initial 30-to-70
percent deficit in the polls to win an impressive 53-to-47 percent
victory. Significantly for a measure titularly in their protection,
64 percent of union voters opposed the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was their vote just cash-and-carry politics. Once the rank
and file tumbled to the real agenda, volunteers scrambled against
the proposition. The unions figure, as a side benefit, they have
enlivened some 24,000 previous dormant members for grass-roots
politicking in California's fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to take organized labor out of political play is a
reaction to revived union activism. After years of hibernation, the
AFL-CIO bestirred itself some $35 million worth in the last
election cycle, either in overt support of Democrats or in supposed
nonpartisan ``issue'' advertising that covered its partisanship
only technically, about like a thong bikini covers a sunbather.
</P>
<P>
   Even that level of spending wasn't close to pre-emptive.
Union-backed candidates had only indifferent success, and the
Center for Responsive Politics calculates that even with
re-energized union political spending, corporations still outspend
the unions 11-to-1 in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Claims of union advantage are a falsehood of political
convenience for the GOP and for conservative interest groups,
lately so taken with what they believe should be their
inevitability that they have lost all patience with competitiveness
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   If fairness were more than just a hollow drum beaten on behalf
of neutralizing labor, the legislative push would be equally
demanding annual signatures from shareholders before corporations
could spend their mite for politics. Interest groups would be
required to get written permission from members for partisan
spending. It might be interesting to see how the National Rifle
Association membership would fall out.
</P>
<P>
   The folks trying to engineer at least a rough fairness into
politics are the ones pushing for broad campaign funding reform.
The groups trying to sideline the unions are notably absent from
that effort.

THE METROSTARS ARE HOT, BUT NOT REALLY BOTHERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ As the MetroStars played their third
game in a week, the temperature here on Sunday was a frying-pan-hot
97 degrees, with no clouds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not move,'' Coach Alfonso Mondelo said. ``We could
not think. Our midfielders were totally dead in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mondelo implored his players to seek ball control against the
Miami Fusion, to be patient and to focus on producing
high-percentage shots. And they did everything he asked in a 2-1
victory before 9,075 at Lockhart Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory lifted the MetroStars to 7-6 in Major League
Soccer's Eastern Conference and gave them 19 points in the
standing, 2 behind second-place Columbus. Miami (5-9) lost its
fifth straight game.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was far from easy. Tony Meola, who stopped 27 of the Fusion's
28 shots, said, ``I don't know how our guys lasted for 90
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars won the game near the end, when both teams were
heavy-legged from the heat and humidity. Eduardo Hurtado passed on
the left to Miles Joseph, who moved past a defender and beat an
on-rushing Scott Budnick, who was making his first start in goal
for the Fusion.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, a substitute for Giovanni Savarese in the 62d minute,
bowed after his goal in the 88th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad first touch and the crowd let me know about it,''
Joseph said, smiling. ``So I had to give them something back.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese had yielded to Joseph because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs were starting to tighten up,'' Savarese said. ``It was
unbelievable out there. I just felt somebody could give us more of
a lift at that point. I wanted to do the smart thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese had given the MetroStars the lead in the game's 35th
minute. Budnick left the net to wrest the ball from midfielder Paul
Dougherty, but he could not control it and, in a strange sequence,
the ball rolled down his back and over to a looming Savarese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the confusion,'' Savarese said. ``So I moved in to see
what else would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese found himself with a clear eight-footer for his fifth
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion evened the game in the 63d minute. Defender Matt
Knowles's attempted clearing pass bounced off Fusion forward Dan
Stebbins and went to midfielder Diego Serna, who burst through a
suddenly flat-footed MetroStars defense and beat Meola with a
15-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   Meola retrieved the ball from the net and angrily punted it
toward midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Knowles, who recently returned to the MetroStars from
the Staten Island Vipers of the A-League and today was replacing
the American World Cup player Alexi Lalas, made the defensive play
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Serna had raced around a diving Meola about 5 yards from the
goal in the 31st minute, and had nothing but daylight between him
and the net. But he tapped his shot instead of blasting it.
</P>
<P>
   That left precious moments for Knowles, starting because Mark
Semioli was sidelined with a possible broken big toe on his right
foot, to swoop down and intercept the ball inches shy of a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Tony take him wide, so I just closed in behind him,''
Knowles said. ``I felt good today, but what a day to get thrown in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Meola, ``If we had given up a goal there, we could have
been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Meola kept the MetroStars competitive. The 28 shots he
faced tied his personal high in M.L.S., matching a barrage he faced
against D.C. United earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a brilliant game,'' Mondelo said. ``He made four or
five really key saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather did not bother Meola all that much _ he remembers
playing three World Cup games in oppressive heat _ and he did not
think the Fusion got off very many challenging shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of 25- to 30-foot dribblers,'' he said.
``Really, the credit should go more to the character our guys
showed. We just kept fighting. And the fight paid off in the end.
We got ourselves a victory.''

JERSEY GIRL WINS FIRST TRIPLE TIARA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day after the 3-year-old colts ended their
pursuit of the Triple Crown, 10 3-year-old fillies began the road
to the Triple Tiara on Sunday at Belmont Park, and Jersey Girl took
the first leg of the series by winning the Acorn Stakes by 2}
lengths for her fifth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Girl was second in the betting to Countess Diana, winner
of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Eclipse Award as
2-year-old champion last year. But for the second time in a month,
Jersey Girl ran away from Countess Diana, who tired and faded to
fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really grown up since last year, and that's the
difference,'' said Mike Smith, who rides Jersey Girl for Todd
Pletcher and the Ackerley Brothers Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's bigger, stronger and faster this year, and she's got a
lot of her senses together. She's learning how to relax out there,
and that's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher said he was looking to the Mother Goose Stakes in three
weeks for his filly's next start, and added: ``She likes to train.
She's a smart filly, and a pleasure to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mott, who trains Countess Diana, said she had no excuse,
and added: ``I thought she was up for a better race than that. I
thought she was as tight as she needed to be, but she backed up too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Girl broke third before nudging up to second after a
quarter of a mile and then gaining the lead after a half mile.
Countess Diana took the early lead but tired after a half mile, and
lapsed back to fifth place as the field entered the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Girl ran the mile in 1:36 1/5, with Santaria second and
Brave Deed third.
</P>
<P>
   The winner paid $8.30 for a $2 bet to win as second choice to
the even-money Countess Diana, and went home with $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The series continues June 27 with the Mother Goose at a mile and
an eighth and closes July 25 with the Coaching Club American Oaks
at a mile and a half.

INJURIES STILL PILING UP FOR YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Yankees continue to win, their injury list
continues to grow. Jorge Posada, who has gradually become the
team's front-line catcher this season, sprained his right foot
during batting practice before Saturday's game. At the very least,
the Yankees will call up a catcher from Class AAA before starting
their next series in Montreal Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility that Posada, 26, will be placed on
the 15-day disabled list. Posada, on crutches after Sunday's game,
had X-rays that revealed no fractures. On Monday he will undergo
further examinations, including, in all likelihood, a magnetic
resonance imaging scan to test for soft tissue damage.
</P>
<P>
   Posada is usually upbeat and gregarious, but his demeanor had
changed markedly by the time he returned from the X-rays. ``I have
nothing to say,'' he said. ``I don't want to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada has started 32 of the Yankees' 57 games, and has 125
at-bats, 34 more than Joe Girardi, the Yankees' No. 1 catcher the
last two seasons. Posada has 7 homers and 23 runs batted in and is
hitting .248.
</P>
<P>
   As he took batting practice Sunday, he fouled a ball off the
instep of his right foot and apparently rolled his ankle in
reacting to the jolt. Girardi started in the Yankees' 4-1 victory
over Florida; Posada, sitting on the bench, felt no pain until the
middle innings, when his ankle began to hurt and he started to
limp.
</P>
<P>
   After he warmed up David Cone before the sixth inning, Posada's
foot began to hurt badly, and he retreated to the trainer's room
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said he should know
the extent of Posada's injury today. But because Posada probably
will not be available to catch tomorrow night's game, at least,
Cashman expects to call up Mike Figga, the catcher for Class AAA
Columbus. ``We won't play with only one available catcher,''
Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been extremely conservative in their treatment
of injuries, a luxury their fast start has afforded them. Scott
Brosius sustained a couple of bruises and, against his wishes, was
given two days off. Derek Jeter strained an abdominal muscle and
was immediately placed on the disabled list. The Yankees want their
best players fully healthy for the end of the season, and if
Posada's injury is at all debilitating, the team is likely to sit
him down for as long as necessary for him to heal fully.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells was scheduled to start Sunday's game, but when he
had trouble throwing in the bullpen Friday, team officials decided
to replace him with David Cone. Tendinitis was diagnosed in the
back of Wells's left (pitching) shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells and the Yankees expect he will be back in the rotation
either Friday or Saturday, when the Yankees will be playing the
Cleveland Indians at Yankee Stadium. Wells intends to throw
tomorrow, and if he cannot throw without discomfort, he will
probably be skipped in the rotation again and possibly placed on
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Wells is taking anti-inflammatory medication. ``At this point in
the season,'' he said, ``why risk making something that is very
minor and possibly turning it into something serious? It's best to
just miss a start and see how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hit a three-run homer Saturday and a solo home
run Sunday, and after not hitting a home run in his first 119
at-bats this season, he has 9 in his last 26 games, along with 30
rbi's. ``When he gets hot like that, it doesn't matter if he's
hitting lefty or righty,'' Tino Martinez said. ``He's in one of
those grooves, and you hope he just keeps it going.''

IN `TRUMAN' AND `BULLWORTH,' BIG MEDIA AS BIG BROTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is going to be difficult to escape ``The Truman Show.'' For
weeks, the film, starring Jim Carrey, has been featured on magazine
covers and brooded about in beard-pulling advance features. Now it
has finally opened, and escape is even less likely.
</P>
<P>
   But after seeing the movie, escape is what I yearn for. Like
Carrey's character, Truman, who has been, since birth, an unknowing
subject of a 24-hour-a-day television show, I seek fresh air, open
skies, new possibilities. Truman begins to suspect his seaside
village is not all it's made out to be; I am beginning to suspect
something similar about my cultural surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: I am being told, again and again, that we
are a lot like Truman. He is living in a world constructed by the
media. He is dominated by their desires, sacrificed to their whims,
and he doesn't even know it. It has become almost axiomatic that we
are in the same boat. The boundaries between television and reality
have broken down. We sit for months watching the O.J. trial as soap
opera. Networks interrupt their programming to broadcast a live
California suicide. Jerry Springer stages talk-show fights. So,
isn't ``Truman'' true?
</P>
<P>
   This is what we are meant to think. And that is what I want to
escape: the numbing insistence that we are the victims of higher
media forces that have constructed a prefab stage set, who pull our
strings and force-feed us useless products. And we, unknowing, turn
from our empty lives to submit to the moguls' intoxicating
fantasies. We are insistently told that we are duped, manipulated,
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   But I am beginning to suspect that this insistence is the real
duping and manipulation; we are duped into believing we are being
duped. Don't believe me? Try escaping that message. It is also
being drilled in by another recent film, Warren Beatty's political
satire ``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   There, too, television is so powerful it is sometimes difficult
to tell whether life is an image of the screen or the screen an
image of life. The television interviewer Larry King (who has
actually predicted that ``The Truman Show'' will ``revolutionize
the art form'') books the fictional Senator-candidate Bulworth, on
his talk show. And in that film, too, television can seem to
undermine perception of the real. In the midst of a mental
breakdown, the senator sits with a television remote in his hand,
channel surfing his way into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth, like Truman, tries to free himself from the media's
manipulating power. He opposes a television interviewer's attempt
to break away to a commercial. He challenges the independence of
the questioners on a televised debate, pointing out that they are
rich people working for other rich people who are running rich
media companies that have subsidized his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his villains are the same moguls and producers who put
on the televised ``Truman Show'' in Carrey's movie, enslaving
Truman to a life of staged broadcasts. In Beatty's fantasy, the
conspiracy is even more nefarious, because it extends so deeply
into the pockets of corporate America and keeps so many different
Trumans in penury.
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue with these films' vision, when our attention keeps
being drawn to similar notions even outside films? We blame
television for violence, advertising for smoking and the media for
political mediocrity. These ideas now form the familiar contours of
our culture's seaside village; they provide the foundations for our
prefab dystopia. And they offer a seamless web of ready-made
interpretation about our masters and oppressors, spiced, in these
films, with just enough humor and farce to make the message
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   But we, like Truman, can begin to notice certain oddities about
this message that is supposedly reiterated for our benefit and
insight. There are postures that seem out of place. It may be worth
questioning the authority of the voices making proclamations, and
perhaps even their noble intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Whose interests, after all, are being served by seeing the world
in this way? Beatty's film believes the Trumanesque victims are
inner-city blacks. And Bulworth rescues them by becoming what
Norman Mailer once called a ``White Negro.'' He takes off his suit
and tie and smashes the oppressive bourgeois mold. He dresses in
baggy shorts for a television interview, swigs liquor during a
television debate, raps insults to corporate donors and adopts a
vintage 1968 radical political line, promising to lead the poor,
particularly the black poor, to economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Truman doesn't carry the torch for anyone else, but his way of
undermining his handlers is similar: break the mold, act in
unexpected fashion, rebel against the constraints of family, job
and community (all of which, after all, are phony).
</P>
<P>
   The level of disdain and condescension in these visions is
astonishing. Beatty can envision Bulworth having an impact only
when he jettisons all manners, adopts crude political doctrines and
becomes a White Negro cartoon. He insults those he claims to
champion.
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that true of the makers of ``Truman'' as well? If we
are meant to root for Truman against the delusions peddled by the
media masters, why does the film portray ordinary citizens as so
horrific? The stage set created for Truman (which he believes to be
real) appears to be an ordinary suburban development. But Peter
Weir's direction treats the village with winking mockery. When
Truman weeds his garden, he wears bright red polyester shorts. His
wife, while plugging a brand of hot cocoa or an all-in-one kitchen
utensil, is an exaggerated 1950s housewife in a checked dress.
Truman's job as an insurance salesman fits the same vintage
cartoon. This is a town of Stepford Wives, Children of the Damned,
Body Snatchers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the town is meant to be cartoonish; the film, after
all, presents it as a set made by the mad media masters directing
Truman's life. But the filmmakers also want their condemnations to
resonate in the ``real world.'' The film even shows us the viewers
of the Truman drama, people who are our counterparts, who watch
television day and night. And they are even more grotesque than the
bourgeois villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Two old ladies pathetically hug a pillow decorated with Truman's
picture. Two half-witted parking attendants can't keep their eyes
off the television. A corpulent man soaks in a bathtub hypnotized
by Truman's escapades. The film's unremitting scorn leaves no one
but Truman untouched.
</P>
<P>
   So here is what this vision of moguls and manipulation gives us:
a world of flaccid, dull-witted oppressed and untrustworthy
citizens who can't see what is in front of their eyes except to
watch a screen. They are supposedly saved by visionaries whose
rebellion undermines the phony stage set of bourgeois life. But
this rebellion, it turns out, is itself full of scorn. Truman may
not show it, but his inventors, the filmmakers, do. And so does
Beatty in his condescension.
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly any room in these films for ordinary people with
their problems and struggles; either you are a grotesque victim of
the moguls or an unmitigated rebel, a Child of the Damned or a
White Negro. Nothing seems real.
</P>
<P>
   That is the vision I seek to escape. But the filmmakers and
their allies have things locked up tight. They insist that they
alone have a true vision. Only they dare to show the reality behind
the pap. In these films, behind cameras we never see, are the real
heroes who should be hailed for their provocative and courageous
films showing us as the dupes we are.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it peculiar that this courage and provocation are
really founded on cultural cliches and papier-mache politics?
Meanwhile, the results are so familiar and comfortable, we don't
even try to escape.

   Wolf Group to Acquire Partners &AMP; Shevack
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Group Integrated Communications Ltd. in Toronto has
acquired Partners &AMP; Shevack in New York in the second deal in two
days in which a foreign agency company bought a midsized American
shop.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which more than doubles the billings handled by
Wolf agencies, was announced on Friday, a day after Publicis S.A.
in Paris bought Evans Group in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's largest single advertising market, the United
States offers attractive expansion opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Partners &AMP; Shevack is the second big American deal for Wolf,
which acquired Meldrum &AMP; Fewsmith Communications in Cleveland in
April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, which is privately held, is paying Mickelberry
Communications Inc., parent of Partners &AMP; Shevack, an undisclosed
price in cash and stock for the agency, which has 120 employees and
billings of more than $250 million from clients like Aamco
Transmissions Inc., the Haagen-Dazs desserts brand sold by Diageo
PLC, Renaissance Cosmetics Inc. and the Scotts Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to find an engine that could fuel our growth,'' said
Brett Shevack, chief executive at Partners &AMP; Shevack. ``Now we're
part of a group of agencies that will grow dynamically.''
</P>
<P>
   Partners &AMP; Shevack, opened in 1988, will be an autonomous unit
of Wolf, which also operates an agency under the Wolf name handling
accounts with billings of more than $200 million at offices in
Buffalo; Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio; Rochester and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Partners &AMP; Shevack name will remain, said Larry Wolf,
chairman and chief executive at Wolf, as will present management
there, which includes Shevack; Lynne Seid, president, and Steve
Frankfurt, vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Key Personnel Moves Made at Two Agencies
</P>
<P>
   Two agencies have made top personnel moves.
</P>
<P>
   The GCI Group of Grey Advertising Inc. in New York is expanding
into management consulting services with the hiring of Keith Burton
as executive vice president and managing director of a new unit,
GCI Consulting, to be based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, 43, had been executive vice president at the Hill &AMP;
Knowlton unit of WPP Group PLC in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York has named Etienne Boisrond,
chairman and chief executive of Y.&AMP; R. France in Paris, to the new
position of chairman for the Asia/Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Boisrond, 45, who will be based in Singapore and Tokyo, assumes
his new duties from Tim Pollak, 52, who is leaving Y&AMP;R after 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Pollak, a vice chairman at Y&AMP;R, is departing to seek
opportunities with client companies. Among the posts he has held at
Y.&AMP; R. were president of Y&AMP;R New York and chief executive of HDM, a
joint venture with Havas Advertising and Dentsu Inc.

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURES SUMMARY No 2453 - JUNE 8, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. HONG KONG'S YEAR ONE UNDER BEIJING'S THUMB For the former
British colony of Hong Kong, Year One since the handback to Chinese
control, which ends June 30, has been what Queen Elizabeth II might
call an 'annus horribilis.' The stock market plunged, unemployment
is at record levels, and a bird flu that led to the slaughter of
millions of chickens was followed by an algae invasion that killed
tons of fish. For the most part, mainland authorities have observed
their 'hands-off pledge,' but in subtle and insidious ways, the
Beijing overseers are changing the face of what was one of the
world's most dynamic capitalist economies. From Der Spiegel. 2,000
words. (English translation available.)
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
JODY WILLIAMS AND THE EMBATTLED LANDMINE CAMPAIGN Last year,
Vermont's Jody Williams received the Nobel Peace Prize for her
efforts to ban land mines. And that's when the politics inside the
land-mine campaign were revealed. Here's an update. By James
Bandler. From The Boston Globe Magazine. 2,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
RAZOR'S EDGE Until about 10 years ago, teenage girls seldom fought
each other - even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors
and box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks. Today they do.
What is the nature of this dismal trend and what is being done to
stop it? By Royal Ford. From The Boston Globe Magazine. 2,000
words.

FROM LAWN CUTTER TO MULTIMILLIONAIRE :
</P>
<P>
   THE BLUE-COLLAR MIRACLE If ever there was a metaphor for the
boom in the American economy it is Laro Service Systems. Its
founders are part of a new class of service-industry entrepreneurs,
the blue-collar rich. In 1982, there were 29,000 self-employed
Americans making more than $100,000 in industries such as cleaning,
landscaping, food preparation, warehousing; today there are 80,000.
Competition is fierce; it is capitalism at its rawest. By Michael
Winerip. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,000 words.

WHAT'S DOING IN AMSTERDAM Events, sightseeing, hotels and
restaurants in Amsterdam. By Eric Weinberger. From The New York
Times Way To Go! 1,500 words + photos + B&AMP;W map.
______________________________________________________________ 6.
FREE AT LAST In NASA's high-flying ``vomit comet,'' students can
escape the grip of gravity and learn a few things about outer
space, astronauts and future life for humans in a state of
'zero-G.' Here's an account of what happened earlier this year,
when 19 students and two journalists boarded the same capsule Tom
Hanks was in for the harrowing scenes from the film ``Apollo 13.''
By David L. Chandler. From The Boston Globe Magazine. 2,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
TREATMENT FOUND TO RESTORE IMMUNE FUNCTION IN HIV PATIENTS New drug
combinations have revolutionized the treatment of HIV infection and
AIDS. Many patients on these new regimens have seen the amount of
virus in their bloodstream plummet and their white cell counts
rebound. But there is concern that the immune systems of these
patients may never fully recover from the damage caused by HIV
infection and that they remain vulnerable to life-threatening
infections. Researchers working in Paris now report that the immune
systems of at least some patients on new drug therapies can recover
important aspects of their immune defences even if their immune
systems had been severely damaged by the virus before starting the
new treatments. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000
words.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
MIRACLE WEED The hemp plant is packed with essential fatty acids
and amino acids, making it an ideal ingredient for beauty products.
Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance abuse,
but in fact industrial hemp is altogether different from the
smokable kind. It's virtually drug-free. By Alev Aktar. Faichild
Publications. 1,500 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
TREATING ASTHMA - NATURALLY Drugs and medications are useful tools
in controlling asthma, the lung disease which afflicts millions of
people. But conventional treatments have their own drawbacks, which
is why many doctors recommend supplementing them with natural
treatments. Kathy Sena looks at various nutritional supplements,
exercise programs and breathing techniques that can help control
asthma symptoms. From Let's Live. 1,400 words. 10. LEARNING TO READ
FOOD LABELS Dietician Mindy Hermann offers practical advice on
interpreting food labels and finding the food you want for yourself
and your family. From Family Circle. 1,400 words.

   POLITICAL-PRISONERS (Marion, Ill.) _ The closest thing the
United States has to political prisoners are members of the Puerto

</P>
<P>
   PINK-FLAMINGOS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Lawn ornaments aren't really

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ As the late Supreme Court Justice

</P>
<P>
   FLORES-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ I've never understood why men's
groups have bashed the annual Take Our Daughters To Work Day. What
about boys, the men's advocates say? Spare me. Is it not enough
that women in corporate America hold only 2 percent of executive
positions, yet make up 46 percent of the workforce? Seems to me,
boys are getting along just fine. By VERONICA FLORES.

concluding years certainly was savage and bloody minded, a time

reminded, then, that all was not lost during these 100 years. By
HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Democratic gubernatorial

 &HT;    T a s t i n g t h e s o u t h: Born on the bayou
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREAUX BRIDGE, La. _ Kenneth ``Half Pint'' Thibodeaux _ that's
how he's listed in the phone book _ sounded like a Cajun musician
playing washboard as he scraped a spoon across the bottom of a pot
burbling with rich brown gravy. He was making a kind of music, all
right; he was fixing crawfish etouffee in the hope of beating 17
competitors in a cook-off. But unlike his rivals, he didn't seem
particularly curious about what the Guidrys and the Heberts and the
others were up to at their stoves. ``I eat at their houses all the
time,'' he said, ``so I know what their etouffee tastes like.''
</P>
<P>
   And they know what his etouffee tastes like?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. ``What I'm making today is all crawdaddies,''
Thibodeaux said, pausing for a swig of beer. He pulled closer and
lowered his voice. ``When I cook for company, I put some cream of
mushroom soup in there to stretch it. Crawfish is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when crawfish (or crayfish, as biologists and
Yankees call them) were as cheap as mud and about as respectable.
When outsiders first came to work in the Louisiana oil fields
decades ago, they cringed to think anyone would eat the grubby
critters they saw skittering through the drainage ditches. The
locals actually were eating a cleaner breed of crawfish from
freshwater bayous, but that didn't keep them from acting sheepish
about it. ``People ate them at home, but when they went out they
hid it,'' says Dickie Breaux, a restaurateur in Breaux Bridge, who
remembers how the old Cajun dining establishments had private rooms
with closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   No one is ashamed of crawfish nowadays. Not only do people peel
and suck them right out in the open, they celebrate them at events
like the crawfish festival they've held every May since 1960 in
Breaux Bridge, a town of 6,000 near Lafayette. The little
crustacean has become a big red banner of Cajun pride, a cultural
trademark as distinctive as a spicy French drawl or a jumping
accordion on Saturday night. Mr. Mudbug has gone to town.
</P>
<P>
   Cajuns love crawfish for their taste, of course; the chef Paul
Prudhomme likens the tender curl of tail meat to lobster dipped in
butter _ only you don't need the butter. But Cajuns love crawfish
for another reason as well: It reminds them of themselves. It's a
culinary underdog from the backwoods that had to scrap and claw its
way to acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say a crawfish is the bravest thing in the world. It'll
take its pincers to a train,'' says Elaine Hardy, a supervisor in a
crawfish processing plant near Breaux Bridge, her voice filled with
an admiration that's common in southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Crawfish have been part of life for all her 59 years. ``I grew
up down in Butte la Rose when there was no roads, no electricity,
no nothing,'' she says. ``Whenever we wanted to have a party, we'd
just go out in the swamp with some bait and dip our basket in a
hole and get all the crawfish we wanted. We'd boil them bright red
and lay out some newspapers and, oh, it was delicious. I don't
think crawfish taste that good anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hardy was a girl, Louisiana had no crawfish industry to
speak of. Today there are 98 plants processing crawfish from 3,600
farmers and fishermen. The fishermen bring in the bulk of the
catch, knifing into the bayous before dawn in pointed canoes called
pirogues. The rest comes from farmers who grow crawfish in ponds
created from flooded, off-season rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, the harvest starts arriving at plants like
Bayou Land Seafood, a gamey-smelling complex on a murky bayou
outside Breaux Bridge. The crawfish men pull into the loading bay,
their thigh boots still wet, and deliver bags full of live
crustaceans that beckon through the mesh with their tiny claws.
Most of them are flash-boiled and peeled for tail meat. Eighty
percent of it never leaves Louisiana. ``The main market for
crawfish is as far as a coonass can drive in a day,'' says Tom
Hymel, the local extension agent, using a slang term for Cajuns
that a non-Cajun would use only if he had good health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Like wine, the quality of crawfish varies from year to year.
Last season's mudbugs were sweet and large due to favorable weather
conditions. Not so this season's. As he examines the specimens
coming into Bayou Land, owner Roy Robin cannot hide his
disapppointment. ``Look at those peanuts,'' he says, poking at a
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Size and taste aren't the only worries in crawfish country. In
the early '90s, China started flooding the American market with
tail meat at less than half the domestic price. Soon the imports
were outselling Louisiana crawfish. Last year, under pressure from
the industry, the federal government enacted tariffs on Chinese
crawfish that have brought prices closer to parity and given the
domestic producers the break they say they needed to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those producers are concentrated around Breaux Bridge,
where the biggest landmark is a drawbridge over Bayou Teche with
the image of a crawfish across the superstructure. It was there,
along a street marked ``Rue Pont,'' that crawfish fans started
gathering on an overcast Saturday morning last month for the parade
that kicked off their shellfish Mardi Gras. One of the topics of
conversation, as always, was the delicate matter of sucking.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of people when it comes to eating crawfish:
those who suck and those who decline to suck. Make of it what you
will, but those who decline to suck the peppery juices and buttery
fats from the head section of a boiled crawfish tend to be women.
The gung-ho suckers _ the party-hearties who wear T-shirts that
plead, ``Pinch me, peel me, suck me'' _ are usually men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met a woman who sucks the head,'' declared Cherie
Bourque, the recently crowned Miss Etouffee, as she sat in a
convertible waiting for the parade to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nasty,'' chimed in Mrs. Etouffee, Dawn Taylor, as
she straightened her tiara.
</P>
<P>
   The etouffee twosome were part of a royal turnout that included
a cracklin' queen, a boudin queen, a tamale queen and a crawfish
queen, king and pre-k queen identified by her sash as ``Li'l Miss
Pincer.'' They were joined in the procession by, among others, a
group of bon vivants who called themselves the Krewe d'Ecrevisse
(that's French for crawfish). Their float featured a 20-foot mudbug
with claws that might give Godzilla pause. ``We're confident that
we have built the world's biggest crawfish,'' said Steve Hebert,
resplendent in his sunglasses, Tabasco shirt and tie crawling with
plastic crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   After the parade, the festival got down to the serious business
of mass consumption. While hundreds stood in line for plates of
boiled crawfish, eight men with more ambitious appetites took their
places at a table in front of TV crews and a raucous crowd of
spectators. It was time for the ultimate test, the crawfish-eating
contest. There were eight entries from Louisiana (introduced to
cheers) and one from New York (booooooo!). ``You don't have to suck
the heads,'' the emcee told them mercifully, ``but you do have to
eat all the tail meat. We will be checking the shells.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd counted down the seconds, and they were off like a
pack of thoroughbred pigs. For 45 minutes, they peeled and
swallowed and guzzled beer and sweated and turned as red in the
face as their prey. Whenever a contestant looked like he was about
to keel over, someone in the audience would prod him on by shouting
something like, ``Go, big daddy, go!'' Halfway through, New York
threw in the towel. A few minutes later, another man stumbled off
the stage looking stunned and as bloated as a summer sausage.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the biggest daddy of all turned out to be a jowly
paper mill worker named Dane Howell. He laid waste to 19 pounds of
crawfish _ far short of the record set by a bar owner everyone knew
as ``Big Nick'' _ but an awesome performance nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had a novel explanation for his triumph. ``My wife left
me in December and I went from 260 to 180 pounds, so I've got
plenty of room for crawfish.''
</P>
<P>
   They always do in Louisiana.

   Southern Baptists push beliefs in Mormon territory
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist blitz is on in the home of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists from across the nation, meeting for their
national convention in Salt Lake City, are taking part in an effort
to persuade Mormons to change their beliefs, to reach the
unchurched with the gospel of Jesus and maybe to win back some
Southern Baptists who converted to Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will run in the city that was founded almost 151
years ago by Mormon President Brigham Young, who led a group of
pioneers into the valley to escape religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentalist-controlled Southern Baptist Convention
usually makes headlines from controversial resolutions adopted on
the convention floor, such as last year's boycott of the Walt
Disney Co. Though people have come to expect the unexpected from
the more than 5,000 messengers, or delegates, who attend the annual
meetings, what is known about this year's convention business seems
mild in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Patterson, a former Dallas resident and one of two Texans
who orchestrated the fundamentalist takeover of the convention from
moderates, is the shoo-in for president.
</P>
<P>
   Messengers a re also expected to adopt an addition to the
Baptist Faith and Message, a statement of core beliefs, o hat says,
in part, ``a wife is to submit graciously to the servant leadership
of her husband.'' The addition, the first to be added to the faith
and message statement in 35 years, is expected to pass with an
overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy this year, much to the chagrin of the Mormon
Church, is Southern Baptists labeling the Mormon faith a cult and
non-Christian and undertaking their most extensive pre-convention
evangelism effort. The program includes 18 neighborhood block
parties, door-to-door canvassing and sports camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do our best,'' said Phil Roberts, who is
spearheading the Southern Baptist evangelism effort that began
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelism in the cities where annual conventions are held is
nothing new, but the tension created between the 10 million-member
Mormon Church and the 15.9 million-member Southern Baptist
Convention rivals that of the NBA championship matchup between the
Utah Jazz and the Chicago Bulls being played out in the nearby
Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last time the church's beliefs were thrown
negatively into the national spotlight came during last year's
championship game _ played by the same two teams during the same
period. The National Basketball Association fined Chicago Bulls
star Dennis Rodman $50,000 for disparaging remarks he made about
Mormons. In a statement designed to apologize for the profanities
Rodman leveled toward Mormons, Bulls coach Phil Jackson defended
his player, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``To Dennis, a Mormon may just be a nickname for people from
Utah. He may not even know it's a religious cult or sect or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the kind of image the Mormon Church has worked hard
to shed. President Gordon B. Hinckley, who became the church's
prophet three years ago, is one of the key figures in the past 15
years who has worked tirelessly to gain public acceptance of
Mormons as mainstream Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists' belief
</P>
<P>
   Though the Mormon Church has gained respect in mainline
Christian circles, the Southern Baptists are bringing national
attention to the belief among many conservative Christians that
Mormons are not Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common misunderstanding that the Mormons are a
Christian denomination and vary in minor points,'' said Maurice
Smith of New Braunfels, who retired four years ago as the Southern
Baptist Convention's associate director for world religions.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons believe they have the one true church that was restored
by founder and prophet Joseph F. Smith, who was given the Book of
Mormon from the angel Moroni in the early 19th century. The Bible,
Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants (revelations given to Smith
and subsequent presidents of the church) and the Pearl of Great
Price (selected revelations, translations and narrations by Smith)
are the Scriptures and laws of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming themselves the only one, true church makes the
Mormon Church a cult, said Roberts, director of the interfaith
witness team for the Southern Baptist North American Mission Board.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot be Christians because ``they have changed radically
and revised major Christians beliefs,'' Roberts added.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, Mormons believe Jesus was the offspring
of heavenly parents and that God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost are
three separate physical beings.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons freely acknowledge that their faith differs from other
Christian religions, but they argue that it is unfair to brand them
non-Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is unfortunate that many believe we are not
Christians,'' said Ron Nielson, an Austin Mormon. ``Whenever I have
a discussion with anyone and/or know they believe in Christ, how
dare I say back to them, 'You are not Christian'?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never say or think otherwise, even though we may have
a different view or understanding of the nature of God. We should
at least accept and acknowledge each other's belief and faith in
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley has instructed ``the saints,'' as Mormons call
themselves, to treat Southern Baptists, ``our brethren and
sisters,'' with politeness and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accuse us of not being Christian,'' he said. ``I hope our
people will try to show them, by the very manner in which they act,
that we are truly disciples of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, during the church's annual General Conference,
Hinckley said Mormons should remain confident in their beliefs and
not become ``disagreeable as we talk of doctrinal differences.
There is no place for acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Southern Baptists favor the evangelism effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an arrogant thing to do,'' said the Rev. Becca
Gurney of Georgetown, who is a moderate Southern Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that as a loving thing to do,'' added Gurney,
president of the national Baptist Women in Ministry and former
associate pastor at University Baptist Church in Austin. ``It does
nothing to generate good feelings for people of different faiths.''
</P>
<P>
   In November former President Jimmy Carter, a Southern Baptist,
told a Salt Lake City newspaper owned by the Mormon Church that he
is against the evangelism effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing that we can do, among the worst things
we can do, as believers in Christ, is to spend our time condemning
others who profess faith in Christ and (to) try to have a very
narrow definition of who is and who is not an acceptable believer
and a child of God,'' Carter said in the Deseret News. Roberts said
Carter was off the mark. ``Our leadership takes exception to
that,'' he said. ``When a group violates historical Christianity,
we believe we have a mandate to share the gospel with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Roberts acknowledged, some Mormons are former Southern
Baptists. ``They do get a number of converts from the Baptist
ranks.'' The Mormon Church does not keep statistics on the previous
faiths of its members.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 2.6 million Baptists in Texas and almost 200,000
Mormons. No one from Austin preregistered to take part in the
evangelism effort in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by that,'' said the Rev. Harold O'Chester,
pastor of Great Hills Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years past, we would have been the one to send folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt Lake city is an out-of-the-way place. It costs a lot of
money to go.'' 'A calm convention'
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester is attending the convention with his wife, Barbara. He
predicts ``a calm, calm convention.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Chester said he supports Patterson for president but worries
that his longtime friend may be stretching himself too thin.
Southern Baptist presidents retain their professions, and Patterson
is president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C., where O'Chester's son-in-law is attending school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my son-in-law Paige really doesn't need to be president
of the convention,'' O'Chester said. ``He's up to ears. . . . This
is the fastest-growing seminary in the United States now.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition to the Southern Baptist statement of faith is
unlikely to draw fire from fundamentalists, but it doesn't sit well
with moderates likesuch Gurney, who is not attending the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we honor God when we seek to love and educate people
rather than dictate an unrealistic family model for all to
follow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ralph Smith, pastor emeritus of Hyde Park Baptist
Church in Austin, said the new addition does not make women unequal
to men in the marriage partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we know anything about has to have somebody who is
a leader,'' he said. ``The country has a president, the company has
a CEO, the newspaper has an editor, and a church has a pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a conservative who also is highly regarded by many
moderates, is expected to be unanimously elected by messengers to
deliver the official convention sermon next year when Southern
Baptists meet in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Kelly Boggs, pastor at First Baptist Church of Leander,
said the addition to the faith statement doesn't put women in a
subservient role but places the responsibility for the family on
the husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I define 'submit' there is to respect and respond to
the husband's leadership,'' he said. ``At the same time, it's not
being a doormat or anything of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Mormons also believe that the husband is the family's leader.
And, like the Southern Baptist Convention, they oppose gambling,
abortion, pornography, homosexuality and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Both denominations win converts through strong missionary
efforts at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now send missionaries into the world, including Austin,
telling all of us, 'You're going to hell,' '' O'Chester said.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelizing Mormons in Salt Lake City, he said, ``is just
getting a taste of what they have been doing to us for years and
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said part of the evangelism effort, which this year
included special educational materials explaining Mormon beliefs
and how to evangelize to them, is designed to instruct Southern
Baptists on how to ness to Mormon missionaries thatwho ma ock on
their door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Mormons is we don't have to come to them;
they'll come to us,'' he said. ``We're saying don't sicksic th g on
them, don't turn the sprinklers on them, but invite them in and
share the gospel.''

 &HT;    If Thomas speaks, he may listen
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
is going to break bread with the National Bar Association. On July
29, he will be the luncheon speaker at the group's annual
convention in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, invited speakers are admired and respected by the
groups they address. Justice Thomas does not meet that criteria
with the majority of the NBA. The organization of 17,000 black
lawyers, judges and law students opposed Mr. Thomas' nomination to
the high court in 1991. Nothing he has done on the court has
altered that negative opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In critical 5-4 votes, Justice Thomas took stands against
affirmative-action remedies and, in effect, ignored the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in employment.
To the horror of most blacks, the token appointed to represent
minorities in interpreting law slavishly follows the thinking of
his mentor, Justice Antonin Scalia, an arch-conservative. Other
justices, such as David Souter, demonstrate more awareness of the
realities of racial injustice than does Justice Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Justice Thomas said that, whether blacks like it or
not, he is a relatively young man in good health with an
appointment for life. He urged black detractors to get used to him.
Perhaps that reality prompted Louisiana Supreme Court Judge
Bernette Johnson to reach out to him.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the NBA's judicial branch, she initiated the
invitation for Justice Thomas, and he accepted. During a TV
interview, Judge Johnson admitted that she believes many of
JusticeThomas' votes _ such as his dissent when the court ruled for
the plaintiff in a prison brutality case _ have been unfair. She
insisted, however, that black jurists need a dialogue with the
nation's most prominent black jurist.
</P>
<P>
   A group of NBA members led by retired federal appeals court
Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. disagrees. They asked the NBA to
rescind the invitation. In a letter of protest to the executive
committee, Higginbotham said it was like asking former Alabama Gov.
George Wallace to speak. ``We have to have some response to
individuals who articulate policies that are so very harmful to
minorities,'' argued Higginbotham, now a private lawyer and Harvard
professor.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the executive board's 12-3 vote last week to cancel
the invitation, it has not been withdrawn. On Wednesday, NBA
President Randy K. Jones, speaking by phone from San Diego,
confirmed that the luncheon date is still on. He said the
controversy is ``settling down some'' and added: ``NBA members have
different political philosophies and views. The NBA is not a
monolithic organization.''
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach County judge who will be attending the convention
believes Justice Thomas should be heard. A local lawyer agrees.
``If Clarence speaks, maybe some miracle will occur,'' the young
man laughingly commented without explaining further.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad Justice Thomas accepted this engagement. Like Judge
Johnson, I believe black jurists need to talk with this man, who
represents us regardless of whether he represents our best
interests. Having him address an audience of peers uniquely aware
of the racial injustices inherent in so much of this nation's legal
system could be enlightening for him. To his discredit, he often
embraces a philosophy that excludes logic.
</P>
<P>
   A strange thing it is to be a Negro, wrote James Baldwin. In the
crucible of racial tensions that condition our lives, one can
easily become deformed. Rejection is such a potent force that one
may deny the truths of one's own experiences to be accepted by
whites. Justice Thomas has gone that route.
</P>
<P>
   For our sake, we need him to come back among us to reacquaint
himself with the legal realities of our lives. For his own
self-respect, he needs to understand that one can be black and
American without denying one identity to gain the other.

   COMMENTARY: My life in the gobbledygook trade
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   I used to be one of those anonymous people who mail
important-sounding letters nobody understands. The kind of people
Vice President Al Gore talked about recently when he called for
plain language in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's writing must be in plain language,''
he wrote plainly. ``By using clear language we send a clearer
message about what the government is doing, what it requires and
what services it offers.''
</P>
<P>
   My work dispensing gobbledygook was not, however, on behalf of
the U.S. government. I performed this vital service for the private
sector. After an unexplained gap in my resume, I had bought myself
a $25 polyester jacket and an unstained Goodwill tie and went to
work for an insurance conglomerate in a big building.
</P>
<P>
   My resume says I was a paralegal. Actually, I was barely a
semiparalegal. Maybe even a quasiparalegal or pseudoparalegal. I'm
sure there are guidelines that could tell me which.
</P>
<P>
   My job was to keep loan deals alive and moving. The system was
easy. You'd look at a checklist, and if anything was missing, you'd
write a letter asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write'' is the wrong word. ``Select'' would be more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   I'd go to a big loose-leaf binder and find the right
form-letter, photocopy it, fill in the company-name-here line, and
give it to a secretary. The secretary would type it up on nice
stationery, then I'd sign it and mail it.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, like clockwork, I'd get a worried call from a
business, bank or lawyer asking what the letter was about and I'd
tell them. They were always relieved when I told them and happy to
talk to me. That's because some of these were scary-sounding
letters.
</P>
<P>
   And all of them were baffling. Every one a real puzzler. They
might as well have been written in Sumerian, Morse code or COBOL.
</P>
<P>
   The only way I could pick out one letter from another was by
reading a short title on top. ``Letter asking for site plan.''
``Letter requesting construction status-report.'' Things like that.
Very handy.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew the model letters were unintelligible but
deviating from them was strictly forbidden. They had been approved
by lawyers, I was told. The words contained hidden meanings we
could not hope to understand. Only the lawyers knew. Change one
word and the whole spell might be broken. You can't be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   I was a poor semiparalegal but the experience was instructive.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has left me immune to mailbox panic.
</P>
<P>
   There's a kind of writing that always sounds worse than it is.
The pronouncements of governments, insurance companies and bill
collectors often are vague, but when things go bad, these same
institutions always find a way to express themselves with great
forceful clarity. Gobbledygook tells you there is still time to fix
things. That's reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   My office experience also taught me to say ``I don't know what
this means.'' No small accomplishment. The average person's entire
classroom experience, by contrast, teaches one never to do this.
You'll look dumb.
</P>
<P>
   But saying you don't understand is OK. It's better than OK. It's
empowering. It confounds your opponents. It makes bureaucrats
squirm. It is a reporter's most useful interview tool.
</P>
<P>
   Because I never expected anyone to understand the letters I
mailed, I only half expect to understand anything under an official
letterhead. Somehow the practice did not end when I wandered off
the job.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it has spread. With computerization, offices no
longer need big loose-leaf notebooks of form letters.
Unintelligible writing is only a mouse-click away. This is great
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to communications technology, we can efficiently produce
and instantaneously transmit letters nobody can understand. So I
fear the vice president's crusade already may be too late.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least insufficiently proactive to have a strong degree of
probable wide-level implementation within any near-term determinate
time-frame.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to know I haven't lost the old touch.

 &HT;    Considering a few angles on the math controversy
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Thursday newspaper not having a travel section, my wife, a
direct descendant of Marco Polo, had to settle for the local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see they're starting to teach your math method in the
Fayette County schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since I haven't been known for mathematical innovations, I was
puzzled by her statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says here one way they teach math these days is by having
students count windows in their houses,'' she said. ``A lot of
parents are upset.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly can understand why they're upset,'' I replied.
``Having kids count their windows at home is about the most
insensitive, undemocratic, politically incorrect thing I can
imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is counting windows undemocratic and politically
incorrect?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think kids from the trailer parks are going to feel
when they count only three or four windows while Peachtree City
kids can count several dozen? Poor kids who only have a few windows
at home won't ever learn to count high enough to get into Georgia
Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see your point,'' she said. ``To tell the truth, I never did
think much of your way of counting and keeping up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think my system is like the New Math?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same principle,'' she said. ``They count windows. You
count check stubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with my counting check stubs?'' I demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing. Except you don't write anything on the stubs. When I
try to balance our bank account all I can tell from your checkbook
is how many checks are missing. You never take time to write on the
stub how much the check was for, or what it was for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep those things in my head,'' I explained.
</P>
<P>
   A chore best left to someone else
</P>
<P>
   Early in our marriage, when I was away from home a lot, I talked
her into being our bookkeeper and bill payer. That got me out of
chores I didn't like to do, but at considerable sacrifice of
financial freedom. Over the years I've found it's not in my best
interest to record certain purchases in black and white until I
absolutely have to.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she doesn't always appreciate how expensive it is
living in a semirural area with lawns to feed, all sort of weeds
and bushes to keep in check, and armies of bugs to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Checks made out for TroyBilt repair, goat purchases, shotguns,
fishing rods and seed catalog orders get more attention than they
deserve. This makes timing critical in a domestic accounting
system. For example, if I have to pay a $200 repair bill to get the
TroyBilt tuned up for planting peas and corn, it's best to keep the
canceled check out of sight until roses start to bloom. Then I can
claim the TroyBilt needed new tines to plow the rose garden.
</P>
<P>
   What's the big deal, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   I really don't understand what the big flap over New Math is all
about. How much about math can change after ``readin,' writin'
</P>
<P>
   'n' 'rithmetic, taught to the tune of a hickory stick''? Seems
like 4 times 4 will always be 16, and 9 times 8 will always be 72.
Just to be sure, I checked it out on my solar-operated pocket
calculator I bought at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   What they're teaching in our public schools is a mystery to me.
My middle school granddaughter knows a lot more than I did when I
was in the seventh grade. She brings home more books than I did in
four years of high school, and spends two or three hours every
afternoon studying. Teachers must be doing something right, and
probably could do a lot better if hickory sticks were still
politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of disturbed parents on both sides of New Math are writing
letters to newspapers. I found a perfectly astonishing paragraph in
one. ``My second-grader,'' it read, ``recently came home all
excited that he had learned algebra that day...''
</P>
<P>
   Learned algebra in the second grade! We didn't know what algebra
was in our second grade. In fact, I'm still not sure exactly what
it is. When I was about to flunk out at North Georgia College, my
professor told me some people were cut out to study algebra and
others were cut out to plow a mule. He advised me to go home and
plow a mule, which suited me fine except that my parents had other
ideas. No doubt I was mathematically deprived because our small
farmhouse didn't have many windows.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to see people get in a squabble about their kids counting
windows when they ought to be memorizing multiplication tables. In
fact, I don't see any reason to teach mathematics anymore when kids
can go to Kmart and buy a good pocket calculator for less than $10.
If they don't want to bother with a calculator they can always go
to journalism school.

 &HT;    COLUMN:
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Last Friday I asked my eighth-graders to
close their books (Saroyan's ``The Human Comedy'') and define the
word dignity. For a long few seconds, nothing happened. Then Johnny
went for a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity,'' he read as he stood in front of the class making
like an orator of old (being the class ham), ``bearing, conduct, or
speech indicative of self-respect. Nobility or elevation of
character.'' Satisfied with his performance, Johnny sat.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen puzzled faces focused on me, waiting for the other shoe
to drop. They've come to expect a method to my apparent madness.
``Who has some?'' I ask as I swivel my chair for emphasis. No
takers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ellen asks the obvious: ``Some what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dignity. How many of you respect yourselves?'' Brows knit in
obvious concentration, but no one answers. I wait for them to mull
it over. I know that if one of them takes the initiative, the
others will follow. Fourteen is an insecure age.
</P>
<P>
   After what seems an eternity, Jenny tentatively raises her hand.
``Sometimes I think I have some,'' she begins, apparently uneasy
with being the first to speak, ``but then something wrecks it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some(ITAL)thing(END ITAL),'' I ask, ``or some(ITAL)body(END
ITAL)?''
</P>
<P>
   While Jenny's thinking that one over, Bobby picks up: ``Parents
wreck our dignity. The other night I was helping my dad rototill
the garden and I messed up. He called me stupid. That hurts a kid's
self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy agrees. ``My sister calls me stupid all of the time, but
that doesn't bother me because I know she hates me. But parents
shouldn't call their kids names. They're supposed to love us. All's
I know is (I cringe but now's not the time for a grammar lesson)
I'm never going to call my kids `dumb' or `stupid,' because it
really hurts our feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Patty wants into the discussion. ``Kids wreck each other's
self-respect. We call each other names all of the time.'' I nod,
recalling voices I've heard in the hall raised in less than praise.
``Stupid!'' ``Faggot!'' ``Pervert!'' are three of their favorites.
Worst of all, many of the kids who use them aren't even sure of the
meaning of the truly tasteless terms they're mouthing. A few days
earlier I'd hauled Benny and Art into my room for just such a
display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you call Art a faggot?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he acts stupid,'' Benny grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faggot is a derogatory term for a homosexual. Are you offended
because Art is gay?'' Art choked and denied any such proclivities.
Benny had the decency to blush and admit that wasn't what he meant
at all. He said he had been annoyed because Art had been paying
attention to Susie in study hall and she was Benny's girlfriend. I
asked if calling Art a faggot in this case might not have been a
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   Benny scrutinized his shoe-tops and admitted, ``Yeah, I guess.''
I ask him what he might have said to Art instead of calling him a
name. He was stumped for an answer. Art asked Benny why he didn't
just come up and ask him if he was out to steal his girlfriend.
Says if he had, he would have explained that his sister wanted him
to ask Susie if she was going to be riding the bus home that
afternoon so she could return some gym shorts she'd borrowed from
her. Benny still studied his Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do others have to respect us before we can respect
ourselves?'' I ask of no one in particular. Quite a few say yes,
and that if others don't treat them well they feel really down on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't respect yourselves first, how is anyone else
going to do it for you?'' I ask. Teddy wants to know why he should
respect himself. That's the opening I was looking for. I direct my
questions to the entire class, asking them not to answer aloud, but
just to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you earn your own grades, or do you sit for a quiz with the
answers written all over your sneakers?'' A couple of giggles. They
think teachers don't notice stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you tell the truth, even when it means you'll have to pay
the consequences? Do you compliment instead of criticize? Do you
encourage rather than belittle? Do you listen more often than you
talk? Do you avoid gossip? Do you dress like you're proud of
yourself? Do you choose friends for `quality' rather than for
`cool'? And do you more often think about what you can do for that
friend rather than what he or she can do for you?''
</P>
<P>
   They're looking a bit bored, and I'm beginning to think maybe
I'm whistling in the wind - again. Saved by the bell.
</P>
<P>
   But as they storm out the door, Sandy slows down long enough to
add a postscript: ``It just hurts more when grown-ups call us dumb
and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Shame on us.

 &HT;    Booksellers gird for continue war with chains
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Abe Zimmerman had not been to a trade show in years,
and never to one for booksellers. But as the new president of Book
People, he flew to Chicago for a quick, total immersion at Book
Expo.
</P>
<P>
   He took along experienced guides: the Austin store's buying
director Tracey Tarlton and marketing manager David Hutts, a
veteran of the Book Expos that serve as the American Bookseller
Association's annual conventions. By Saturday night Zimmerman was
eating dinner with author Tim O'Brien, swapping golf stories and
talking about store events. But he found the atmosphere at the
convention perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that's changing dramatically right now,''
Zimmerman said, ``and I'm not so sure how many people know what's
going on and how to react.'' A businessman who helped start Katz's
Delicatessen and was part of a hi-tech start-up company called
Technology Works, he said he found the energy at Book Expo less
than dynamic. ``I felt like these were people who weren't in
control of their fate any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers face tough times. Those who have lasted
through changes in the business continue to quietly look for ways
to do better and more efficiently what they have a reputation for
doing: providing personal service. ``I did feel everyone
understands the importance of independent stores,'' Zimmerman said.
``As an independent, I felt well received (by publishers).''
</P>
<P>
   Last year several top publishing houses, including Random House,
skipped the convention because of tensions with the ABA, which had
sued them for making discount deals with chains. This year most
large publishers came back, though in reduced numbers, and used
less exhibit space. The convention attracted 1,500 exhibitors, with
400 authors promoting their books.
</P>
<P>
   In this era when a recent newsletter from the famed Tattered
Cover bookstore in Denver warned that the big chains are ringing
the independents with stores, attempting to squeeze them out, and
when books are sold at Randalls and Sam's, not to mention on the
Internet, Austin independents face a clear challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer purchasing report released by the Book Industry Study
Group shows that independent booksellers experienced a 1.4 percent
market-share decline last year, down to 17 percent of the books
purchased. Chains accounted for 25 percent. Most books are now sold
in nontraditional outlets _ everywhere from car washes to discount
stores _ or through book clubs and electronic bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for independent bookstores to have a
distinctive flavor and still cover the bases,'' said Tarlton, ``to
also carry the bestsellers people expect to see.'' She spent much
of her time gathering galleys from better smaller presses.
</P>
<P>
   At Toad Hall, children's events including author readings and
special lunches have been a priority to bring customers to the
Austin store, which is owned by Barbara Bonds Thomas, outgoing
president of the ABA. This year the store was singled out at Book
Expo and awarded the Pannell Award for innovative children's
events.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, independent booksellers appear to be facing the
reality that increased service _ the more specific the better _ is
their best chance of keeping customers at a time when sales have
been disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost
half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed. Sales
were flat last year and consumer spending on adult fiction and
non-fiction increased by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An independent bookseller manager in Missouri said that she
realized that with 55 churches in her area the residents had a deep
interest in religion. She came to the convention to check out
religious titles. ``Our customers still don't trust the Internet to
send them books,'' the bookseller said. ``They'll come into the
store with a list they've printed off Amazon.com and want us to get
the books for them.'' Now she is looking at a process introduced at
the convention by Ingram Distributors called Lightning Print. It
allows books to be stored digitally and printed one at a time on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Although conglomerates increasingly control publishing, there is
still room for specialized service, and individual stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bookstore that's enthusiastic can make a book of poetry,''
said Michael Wiegers, managing editor of the award-winning Copper
Canyon Press in Port Townsend, Wash., though he says such a store
might be part of a chain or an independent.
</P>
<P>
   The bookseller of the year for the African American booksellers'
group, Blackboard, Michele Lewis of New Orleans started a store in
her mid-20s. She has seen her business grow in a few years to a
second store and stresses personal service to a niche market.
Accepting the award, she thanked God, her mother, and her family
and friends for allowing the business to grow. Emma Rodgers, owner
of Black Images in Dallas and a director of the ABA, said an
African American Booksellers school held in Chicago before Book
Expo was well attended.
</P>
<P>
   During the convention, the sale of Random House to the
Bertelsmann German conglomerate was confirmed and many sellers saw
that as bad news. Avin Domnitz, executor director of the ABA, said:
``Consolidation of books and publishers has never worked to the
advantage of the independent.'' Increasingly, the booksellers
association is involved in litigation as independents fight back
any way they can against changes they see as threatening their
survival in the industry. A suit by the ABA accusing Borders and
Barnes &AMP; Noble of antitrust violations is still awaiting a formal
response. ``We're still in the early stages (of litigation),'' he
said. Though they may be tired from fighting for economic survival,
the booksellers showed their trademark idealism. They rallied
around Bill Kramer, whose Washington, D.C., bookstore refused to
hand over the bookbuying records of former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky to independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Said ABA
board member Oren Teicher: ``There's no more important issue than
that information about books they have purchased is personal and
confidential.'' Booksellers have long seen themselves as involved
in a marketplace of ideas and, as such, different from the owners
of hardware and drugstores. The Kramer case gives them an
opportunity to cling to that while all around them appears to be
changing.

 &HT;    Cherry Coke and its promo game ... it's the online thing
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You need 32 different bottles of Cherry Coke to win
the new CD-ROM game, ``Alanna.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if you don't want to scour every store in town for pop
bottles cluttered with clues, there's the official Cherry Coke Web
site (http://www.cherrycoke.com). There, players will find a Web
site for the fictional Standlake University. That Web site is
riddled with real clues for the game, whose players traverse the
deserted island of ``Alanna'' collecting objects and solving
riddles to get past gateways, boulders and rivers. (The answers to
the first puzzle are on the site now, for example.)
</P>
<P>
   Marketing on the Web isn't easy. But Coca-Cola's clever Web
promotions make it one of the smartest Web marketers around.
</P>
<P>
   Brand manager Tom Halloran says the ``Alanna'' promotion _ the
latest in Coca-Cola's use of the Web to promote various brands _ is
designed to increase the appeal of Cherry Coke to teens and young
adults who are part of what he calls ``the emerging wired
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-thinking Web surfers are usually loathe to visit a
marketing site just for the fun of it. Most savvy Web marketers
know that a site that engages users, with games or polls or other
interactive components, reinforces the brand and gives users and
potential customers a reason to come back.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands this as well as Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran says the bulk of his consumers are young and spend a
lot of time on the Net and playing computer games. ``We thought,
`How can we tie in the fact that a lot of teens are playing
computer games and drinking Coke?'''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Coke promotions especially unusual is that they
are not designed to be Web staples. They are used on an ``as
needed'' basis for seasonal promotions tied into its traditional ad
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola says the Cherry Coke promotion and the ``Alanna'' game
will run at least through November, with new clues and information.
</P>
<P>
   All this interactivity is designed to leave game players and
their friends with the impression Cherry Coke is a hip, cutting
edge product.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coca-Cola is mindful of its young target audience,
``Alanna'' is not a bloody shoot-'em-up game but a lush, quiet
``Myst''-like game with an educational component designed to help
players win the game.
</P>
<P>
   To add a touch of realism, the company also enlisted the help of
an Emory University professor who created the fictional Standlake
University of Cultural Anthropology Web site. Once there, you must
read through each page of that site to find out about topics such
as cuneiform symbols and ancient Babylonia _ just a way to add an
educational component to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely put an educational slant to the game,'' Halloran
says. ``We want to educate our teen customers. A lot of the clues
on the game site are based on ancient cultures. It's kind of a
study of archaeology.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no official list of hints or clues to help users solve
the puzzle. Folks intent on winning must keep visiting the site or
checking out different bottles of Cherry Coke. They can also check
out Coke and gaming Usenet newsgroups to swap clues and information
with other game players.
</P>
<P>
   A recent check of newsgroups shows several postings to
``comp.sys.ibm.pc.games'' and ``alt.food.cocacola'' talking about
the game and swapping tips and hints. Halloran calls this
world-of-mouth buzz ``viral marketing'' since he hopes it'll spread
that way. ``We're hoping there will be online chat and posts,'' he
says. ``We're hoping people will interact with the brand and each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The promotion appears to be an expensive proposition, but
Coca-Cola won't say just how expensive it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we really didn't want to go down the route of a
traditional soft drink promotion,'' Halloran said. ``We think the
bang for the buck using the Internet and gaming is going to be
substantial for this particular brand.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no print ads, nor are there CD-ROMs available at any
Coke point of sale. The company is relying on word of mouth and the
Web to spread the word about Cherry Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``This promotion is very different,'' Halloran said. ``It will
require consumers to think and act differently. It's a way to show
off the new version of Cherry Coke and get them engaged with the
product by playing the game. We want to be seen as something very
different from Coca-Cola.

   &UR; EDITORS: In honor of Father's Day on June 21, The New York Times

   Much is written about the struggles of working women balancing
work and family. But what about the working dad? In the 1990s, more
and more fathers want to play a significant role in rearing their
children, but the workplace is not always so accommodating. Levine
and Pittinsky describe how a father's work affects his family and
vice versa, and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better
balance. (slugged:

   As many women have children later in life and divorced men
remarry and have second families, many men in theIR late 40s, 50s
and 60s are finding themselves the fathers of newborns. They may
get mistaken for grandfathers, but this new breed of fathers brings
a fresh new perspective to fatherhood, the authors say, often
valuing their children as much or even more than work. But older
fathers also face doubts about whether it's fair to raise a young
child at an advanced age. (slugged:

   It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is
beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where
two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Suddenly, they hear the creaking of a door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the figures in the bed stirs, turning over onto his back.
This is Adam, who, somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness,
feels a weight on his body and then his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy,'' a tiny voice says next to his ear, ``it's time to get
up. It's light out.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam groans, his eyes still closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to sleep, honey,'' he manages to say. ``It's
nighttime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, still without moving, not addressing anyone in particular:
``Can't you do something about this? I'm 54 years old and there's a
child sitting on my head at 6:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam says that on mornings like these, he feels as if he's
living in a lost episode of ``The Twilight Zone.'' He is a member
of a fast-growing group of men who are fathering in their late 40s,
50s and even 60s. At a time when they should be basking in the
midafternoon sun of lives well lived, these men are raising young
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mornings when I'll wake up _ I most likely, get
awakened,'' says Adam, ``and I'll say to myself, where the hell am
I? And who's this insane person in my body who's doing this? And
then I realize, it's me. I'm the insane person.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's had his morning coffee, that attitude has begun
to improve. And by midafternoon _ the time he usually takes his son
to the park _ he feels quite good about himself and the decision
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but I don't see myself as any older than those
guys over there,'' he tells us, pointing to a couple of men in
their early 30s playing with their children nearby. ``Sure, at some
level I know I look like Alex's grandfather, and sometimes I catch
strange looks, but in my mind's eye, I'm no different than they are
_ just another father in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam is typical of these fathers ``of a certain age.'' They have
always been around, but now there seem to be a lot more of them.
They are the grayheads standing in line at the supermarket or the
folks you mistake for grandparents at the local nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing _ and,
many would say, inappropriate _ interest in fathering relatively
late in a man's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing
by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate. And
technology has made it much more possible today for older women _
and their older husbands _ to have children even if the wife is not
significantly younger than the husband.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like fun _ older men finding new meaning in life
and women attaining professional success first and then having
families, too.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing. Those who
object see older parents as acting selfishly, against the interest
of the children they choose to parent. They do not find the
grayheads with preschoolers cute. For many Americans, middle-aged
parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values
and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction
ahead of the greater social good.
 &UR; THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is an everyday miracle,'' a friend in his 50s
tells us, smiling. Steve has three grown children, all boys, from
his first marriage, and a girl, age 2, from his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take the incredible gift of a child for granted when
you are in late middle age,'' Steve goes on. ``The unfolding of
life has to be savored _ observed carefully, contemplated and
understood _ when your own mortality confronts you daily in the
unforgiving reality of the early morning mirror. My attachment to
my daughter also has an immediacy and unconditionality that seems
more like what mothers are supposed to feel. I have discovered real
parenting skills, the ones I was too busy to work on when I was
climbing the so-called ladder of economic and social success.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk
a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have
this second time around. Fathers in their late 40s, 50s and beyond
tend to value children as much as their work, and often more. They
seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers.
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on
roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the intensity of later fatherhood, the new role is
not easy. The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the
energies of a new life demanding attention. Even if an older father
may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more
concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on
himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his
grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the
needs of his still-young child.
</P>
<P>
   One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old
friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents. The
woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other
men her husband's age are fathering young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Alan (her son) today, at 27,'' she said, quite
agitated, ``if he had been born to a father in his 50s. Suppose his
father had even lived that long, he would be 80. Could a man 80
years old provide the emotional support that a typical kid like
Alan still needs in his 20s? Could that same father at 70 have had
any meaningful connection with a teenager?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``More likely, Alan would now have to
be taking care of an old man with serious health problems. I don't
think kids in their 20s are ready to do that. They should not have
to do it. They should be free to think about themselves. God knows,
the ego trip ends soon enough, why make them take on the worry of
aging parents when they should be exploring life?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what it is to lose a parent when you are
young,'' she continued, getting angrier. ``I lost my mother when I
was 21, and I never got over it. It is devastating and unfair.
Sure, it happens even when you are born to young parents like I
was. But fathers who start in their 50s stand a good chance of
dying before their kids are 20. You may not like that idea, but it
is true. It leaves a tremendous void.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry says the conversation shook him to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I irresponsible in having a child so late in life?'' he
worries. ``Do children who have older parents and lose them
prematurely suffer a harm that makes the whole enterprise pure
self-gratification? I realized that in the decision around this
child, neither my wife or I had given much thought to whether I
would be alive at 75 or what I would be like in my 60s as our then
teenager confronted puberty and high school. Our main concerns had
been around our own lifestyle and how it would have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he thought about it further, Larry realized that having a
father at age 50 or even 35 as a normal turn of events is a recent
phenomenon. His own father was 33 when Larry's grandfather died a
``normal'' death at 62, and this grandfather was 34 when his father
died in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a man reaches 50, he will, on average, live past 80.
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father,
his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many
children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their
fathers. But there is an even better chance that the father will be
there for the child's wedding and the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Larry also contemplated the quality of the relationship with his
young child. Older parents know that they risk making their
children face a father's ``early'' death. Yet they also know that
they can give their child a higher material standard of living,
more father time, perhaps a higher quality of the father's time and
probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the
father is present.
</P>
<P>
   When we ask Larry about this conundrum, he is still not sure
what the right answer is. But he does feel that he has probably
spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents
do _ certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at
the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Larry seems to have settled, at least in his own mind,
that he is doing the right thing.

 By JAMES A. LEVINE AND TODD L. PITTINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Before I leave work, I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old
son, Will, has been up to,'' says Michael Johnson, a general
manager at a printing company in Portland, Maine. ``Then when I
come home, I can tap right into Will's world. I'll say, `I hear you
were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today.' It
lets him know I have been thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between
their work life and their family life. Nearly 70 percent of working
men say that family is just as important as their job, or more
important, according to a national Roper Organization survey. As a
result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that
was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 46 percent of fathers today say they don't spend enough
``quality time'' with their children. And when they're unable to do
this, 78 percent of men say they feel guilty, according to a survey
of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio's University of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   So in these times, it's no longer enough to simply ask whether a
working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the
day. We now also need to address the brand-new question: What are
the consequences for families _ and businesses _ when fathers work?
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been a fact of life that dads' jobs typically
take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day.
It's been through their work, through being good economic
providers, that fathers have established their very identities and
taken care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   So it never occurred to families or employers that business
should do anything _ aside from providing a paycheck _ to support
men as fathers. After all, why would it matter? Weren't work and
family separate worlds?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two
decades, a new wave of research on child and family development,
which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers, has
begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their
children's lives. This has led to a revolutionary understanding of
working dads: A man's dual roles as father and worker have an
enormous impact on each other.
 &UR; HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are the unseen stakeholders in the American workplace,''
says Stewart Friedman, director of the Wharton Life Interests
Project at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
``Fathers' work is an unseen and underappreciated influence on
children's development.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some surprising ways that a father's work has impact,
positive or negative, on his kids.
</P>
<P>
   + When fathers are satisfied with their jobs, their children
have fewer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus, professor of management at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that children ages 4 to 17
whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer
behavioral problems such as shyness, withdrawal and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a dad is able to sit at the dinner table and talk about
his work with a positive attitude, confidence and pride, that seems
to rub off on his kids,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   + Too many or too few work hours affect children's learning and
development.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 3-to-6-year-old children undertaken at Ohio State
University in Columbus, sociologists Toby Parcel and Elizabeth
Menaghan, the authors of ``Parents' Jobs and Children's Lives''
(Aldine De Gruyter, 1994), found that a father's unemployment may
be linked to increased behavior problems such as whining, hitting
and acting out. Conversely, working sustained overtime _ not just
putting in occasional long hours _ may also have a negative effect
on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, vocabulary will not be as developed,'' Parcel observes.
</P>
<P>
   When Dad is around, on the other hand, there are big benefits
for kids, numerous studies show. For example, at 6 months of age,
babies with actively involved fathers score higher on an
intellectual ability test, according to a study by F.A. Pederson,
author of the ``The Father-Infant Relationship'' (Praeger, 1980).
</P>
<P>
   And for girls, feeling competent in math is linked to a close
and warm relationship with their fathers, according to studies at
the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   + How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell, who has custody of
his three children, often has to come in late to work for family
reasons. Fortunately, he has a supportive boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be able to stay with the company,'' Lovell says,
``if they didn't trust that I'll always get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem
for a dad, according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of
Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely that when parents see themselves succeed at work,
they feel more confident as parents,'' she says. ``And they are
clearer about what they expect from their children, too.''
 &UR; HOW FAMILY AFFECTS WORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do businesses value a man for being a good dad _ and show it in
their policies?
</P>
<P>
   Not as often as dads would like. Flextime is rarely an option.
Paternity leave is rarely paid. And since men typically continue to
earn more than women, it is usually not financially feasible for a
father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it.
</P>
<P>
   But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the
interdependence of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   At Corning Inc. in Corning, N.Y., manager Ed O'Brien lets his
employees define their own schedules. And he values the expertise
good parents bring with them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empathy, listening skills, knowing how to teach others and how
learning takes place _ all of these child-rearing practices are
directly applicable to the workplace,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing
agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his
4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look more closely for nonverbal signals now,'' he says,
``and I can use this skill when I'm talking with colleagues and
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company is sensitive to a father's family
responsibilities, dads want to keep working there. Mike Dedek, a
software engineer and father of three who works at Lexis-Nexis in
Miamisburg, Ohio, says, ``My dedication to this company is
primarily due to their family friendliness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company's policies and programs take family needs into
account, employees are 45 percent more likely to ``go the extra
mile'' for their employer, say researchers at Dupont in Wilmington,
Del.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these kinds of programs increase worker dedication,
but, as consultant Richard Federico of William Mercer Inc. in New
York observes, ``When people are less stressed out, they tend to
produce better on the job.''
 &UR; ACHIEVING A BETTER BALANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act,
especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses?
Here are some strategies.
</P>
<P>
   + Ask, don't assume.
</P>
<P>
   Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work
schedule, or that they'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of
commitment to the job? If so, you might actually cheat yourself of
what you need.
</P>
<P>
   One father was hesitant to ask his supervisor if he could stay
home with his son, who wasn't feeling well, so his wife took time
off from her own job. The next day his boss _ a working parent
herself _ happened to ask how things were going at home. When he
mentioned that his wife was at home with their sick child, the boss
said, ``Why don't you do your work at home if you need to?''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: If you don't ask for what you need, you
won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   + Frame your request in terms of work.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss doesn't have to hear every detail of a family problem.
He or she just needs to be convinced that, in an emergency, you
have a plan for getting your work done, such as doing it at home or
having a colleague cover for you.
</P>
<P>
   + Use your human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   HR professionals today often receive special training in helping
employees negotiate sticky work/family issues. So, again, ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
   + Turn down extra work with business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   As downsizing leads to bigger workloads, it's increasingly
important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your
family's needs.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to present your boss with options for reprioritizing
your work: ``I'll be able to take on this assignment if I give up
some other stuff on my plate. Can we review my assignments and see
what I might delay doing, or perhaps delegate to someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   + Find strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having work/family problems, it's likely that your
fellow employees are, too. Chris Colbern, who supervises payroll
services at Cigna, a Philadelphia-based insurance company, gathered
a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had
implemented flextime. The result: a new Cigna scheduling system
that virtually all employees prefer.
</P>
<P>
   It may not yet be the law of the land, but a member of the
nation's highest court is recognizing dads' family needs. In 1994,
shortly after her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked why she agreed to a flexible schedule
for law clerk David Post, who was attending Georgetown University
at night. His wife, an economist, had a demanding job, so Post
needed to care for their children during part of each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my dream of the way the world should be,'' Ginsburg
said. ``I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are
doing a parent's work, who do not regard that as strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like David, I hope, will be role models for other men
who may be fearful they won't succeed in their profession if they
spend time caring for their children or are concerned they will be
thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance.''

 By JOE APPLEGATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is 5 a.m. on Father's Day, and you have decisions to make. Do
you lie quietly and wait for your children to come tumbling in with
their annual offerings of gratitude and affection, their homemade
cards, fund-raiser tie clips and bad cologne?
 &HT;    Or do you sneak out for a quick nine holes before anyone's the
wiser?
 &HT;    You turn and in the dimness can just make out the sleeping face
of your wife. You ask yourself where in the world you would be
without her.
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach?
 &HT;    Naah! This is where you belong, you tell yourself angrily. You
dope! A wife and children, good health, a steady job _ be honest
with yourself, you sorry hacker, would you trade them for anything
on this planet? Would you?
 &HT;    You choke back a tear.
 &HT;    Yes! Tiger Woods' swing.
 &HT;    Again, wearily, you try to imagine playing golf for a living,
having a job where you don't have to answer a phone, phone in an
answer, estimate budget figures, figure budget estimates or budget
estimated figures while answering the phone.
 &HT;    You are not so naive as to think that professional golfers don't
hate their jobs sometimes. And yet, try as you might, you cannot
imagine Woods telling himself that if he can just finish the back
nine by 5 o'clock he might be able to wedge in a quick staff
meeting before dinner.
 &HT;    OK, dude, you tell yourself, that's enough for one morning, get
a grip. Back to reality _ and a good, sane reality it is. You've
got some blessings to count:
 &HT;    + A wife who accepts your form of folly and who gets her
exercise hauling heavy packages around shopping malls. You both
carry your own bags.
 &HT;    + Kids who can be induced to come and play golf with you _ even
if it is for a price. You control the bets, however, and every
penny you have to pay out is worth it. The expression on a kid's
little face when a 20-foot putt is worth 20 bucks is priceless.
 &HT;    + Your own good sense, when all is said and done, in knowing
when to go for the greens and when to lay back, as now, in bed.
 &HT;    There are those Sundays when a full round of golf is a natural,
healthy choice. Is there any better alternative to the stupor of
the Super Bowl than a bracing round of golf on a deserted course,
even a snowy one?
 &HT;    And then there are those Sundays when abandoning your family to
play golf is maybe just a little bit sick. Father's Day is one,
Mother's Day definitely another.
 &HT;    So today, of all days, it's best to be still and enjoy your
status as father. Maybe one day your kid, interviewed after winning
a tournament and a big check on Father's Day, will smile at the
camera, wave and shout, ``I love you, Dad!'' _ just the way Woods
did on Mother's Day, except, of course, that he said, ``I love you,
Mom!''
 &HT;    And just think how popping proud you'll be that Father's Day,
watching it all on your VCR after coming in from your
late-afternoon round.

 By TIM HERRERA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Thanks to past Father's Days, I can go a month without washing
underwear and my necktie collection rivals the discount racks at
any department store. As the father of four children, I own
countless mugs, T-shirts and finger-paint artwork that read
``WORLD'S GREATEST DAD!''
 &HT;    I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one
daughter have ever made, because they made them for me. However, my
hopes may be too high for 1998.
 &HT;    ``What do you want for Father's Day this year?'' my boys asked.
 &HT;    Despite the countless strips of colored cloth that seem to mate
in my closet, I could always use another necktie. Coffee-shop
coupons beat scraping pennies off my dresser for a morning cup.
 &HT;    But this year, I want something radical: I want peace on
Father's Day.
 &HT;    I'm not talking about world peace _ although that would be nice,
too. I want tranquility within the four walls of our two-story
house.
 &HT;    I answered, ``What if you guys quit fighting on Father's Day?''
 &HT;    You see, a day rarely goes by in our house without ``He hit
me!'' followed by ``He hit me first!'' Then comes the witty
``Did-not-did-too!'' exchange.
 &HT;    I'm asking for a one-day truce, one that even NATO diplomats
would have trouble arranging. The treaty doesn't have to be in
writing _ I'll accept a verbal agreement, with or without
handshakes.
 &HT;    But I want an entire day without hearing ``Dork!'' ``Dog
breath!'' or something worse echoing through our house as the kids
battle for the Nintendo, the VCR or the remote control _ my remote
control.
 &HT;    My request puzzled them. Either they didn't understand or they
knew the mission was impossible. I could tell they were hunting for
an escape clause in an agreement they were reluctant to make.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, no fighting's good, Dad,'' they said. ``But how 'bout if
we go to the movies like we did last year? Maybe we can go see
`Godzilla?'''
 &HT;    ``What the heck,'' I said. ``Who needs peace and tranquility,
anyway?''
 &HT;    It seems we are forming a Father's Day tradition. Last year, we
also commemorated the day by watching loud, frightening and scaly
creatures engaging in noisy rampages. No, we weren't watching ``The
Jerry Springer Show'' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see ``The
Lost World.''
 &HT;    It was a memorable day, but not because of the film. It was
memorable because the outing was their idea.
 &HT;    I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the
``Jurassic Park'' sequel. I felt the younger kids were too little
to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans, even at matinee prices.
 &HT;    While driving to the theater with the boys, I started thinking
about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the
two of us going to the movies.
 &HT;    It was a cool, spring Pennsylvania day. Dad and I carried light
jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater, strolling along
the steep hills, past the Veterans Memorial and my school, St.
Joseph's Elementary.
 &HT;    Dad was barely 5-foot-4, but I was still much smaller and
struggled to keep up with his quick stride.
 &HT;    Sometimes I get angry because I can't recall everything about
that day. However, I am grateful for one image still floating in my
mind: I remember looking over, seeing the light from the movie
screen flickering on Dad's face and thinking how cool it was that
he was just spending time with me.
 &HT;    All the way home from the theater, I replayed the film for my
father. Since Dad laughed, I was positive he liked the Batman movie
as much as I did. But I never really found out _ I never thought to
ask.
 &HT;    Dad died about five years ago, and every third Sunday in June I
think of our day at the movies.
 &HT;    As my sons and I walked out of the theater after ``The Lost
World,'' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking
lot, my middle son turned and asked: ``Dad, did you like the
movie?''
 &HT;    ``I sure did, pal.''
 &HT;    He'll never know how glad I am that he asked.
 &HT;    When we're coming out of the theater this year, maybe I'll catch
them in a weak moment and ask them to pick up the smelly sweat
socks they've scattered from the corner of the kitchen to the edge
of the driveway.
 &HT;    While we're at it, let's have an armpit-noise ceasefire _
especially at the dinner table and at church.
 &HT;    But perhaps I should just appreciate the time with them. The
time a child spends alone with his or her father is special. Too
often it's taken for granted by both parent and child.
 &HT;    Maybe peace at home on Father's Day is a bit much to ask. Maybe
all we need is another nice monster movie and some time together to
create some moments worth reliving.

 &UR; By JIM MCKAY &QL; 
 &UR; (Excerpted from ``The Real McKay: My Wide World of Sports'') &QL; 
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, I have walked the fairways of the world
behind the game's greatest artists, playing in the most famous
championships on the planet's most storied courses.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, golf has exploded, both as a spectator and a
participant sport. Why?
</P>
<P>
   To me, it has principally been the result of the sterling
careers of certain players, and not Arnold Palmer alone. I'll be
audacious enough now to list my top 10 players, whose achievements
I have described on ABC and CBS during the past 40 years.
 &UR; The McKay Ratings &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Jack Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   Twenty majors in all. Will anyone ever equal that?
</P>
<P>
   Tack on a total of 70 wins on the PGA Tour, two Walker Cup
teams, six Ryder Cup teams (twice captain), two U.S. Senior Open
titles and a Senior PGA. He intimidated his peers like no one since
Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was not, however, without his crushing defeats or his
personal insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest loss came at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open. At
the age of 42, he had finished his final round of the championship
and was standing beside the scorer's tent waiting to be interviewed
as the first player ever to win five U.S. Opens, if Tom Watson
bogied either of the last two holes. And Watson was in trouble, his
ball sitting in long grass behind the green of the par three 17th.
</P>
<P>
   From our tower at 18, I looked down on Nicklaus. He was staring
at a monitor showing Watson lining up his shot. From the difficult
lie, it might well run far across the green, leaving him a likely
bogie and setting up victory for Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson made ``the shot heard round the world,'' knocking the
ball into the hole for a birdie. In that instant, as he stood just
below me, Jack's expression was not his usual ironic half-smile of
defeat, but a look of total shock and deep disappointment, the face
of a stricken youngster, not of the most famous golfer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   2. Arnold Palmer
</P>
<P>
   To understand Arnold Palmer and his endless appeal to Everyman,
it helps to sit with him as I did at the home (in Latrobe, Pa.) he
and his wife, Winnie, have lived in for more than 35 years and
understand that he IS Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   He still loves to sit by the pool, looking down toward the
course he grew up on, just at the bottom of the hill. That day some
four or five years ago, he smiled and told me how he used to lie
outside his family's house on the edge of the course and wait for
the woman to come by the sixth hole--the woman who always gave him
a nickel if he would hit her ball over the water hazard for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself now when I was really small,'' he said.
``Making sure my dad couldn't see me because I wasn't allowed on
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Arnold Palmer how he has kept such a hold on his
fans. He looked at me, a faint smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' he said, ``maybe it's because they understand who I am.
I think I am an honestly sensitive and sentimental person. Maybe
they sense that I care a great deal about what I do and that their
encouragement means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Lee Trevino
</P>
<P>
   My most vivid memory of Trevino in his heyday is at the 1972
British Open on the Muirfield links in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as
far as his attitude was concerned. He kept up a running
conversation, or more properly a monologue, with the Scottish
gallery all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on one tee, he turned to the crowd and said, ``They
took me to an old castle for dinner last night. We had food like
they ate back in the old days, and we ate like they did--with our
fingers. Heck, back home in Texas I even have a cat I taught to eat
with a fork!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual
left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Watson
</P>
<P>
   Of his remarkable five British Open victories, four of them were
won by a single shot, one in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of
championship golfers, certainly Tom Watson, as he plays on in his
late 40s, still convinced that he will win another major, is the
most tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gary Player
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1954, at the age of 18, Gary Player stepped off a
train at a small town in Scotland, carrying a cardboard suitcase
held together with a piece of rope. Since that day, he has become
the world's most traveled athlete, flying around the globe year
after year, winning the national championships of the United
States, Great Britain, Australia, Chile, and Brazil, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication to fitness and proper diet borders on the
fanatical, and some of his beliefs approach the mystical. In the
earlier days, he would usually dress totally in black. ``Why?'' he
was asked. ``It must be terribly hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``but it makes me feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Greg Norman
</P>
<P>
   I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket.
Today, he is probably the best-known golfer in the world, having
won 55 tournaments internationally, as well as 16 on the American
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Every great player has performances he would rather forget, but
Greg's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have
come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image, despite
all his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   7. Seve Ballesteros
</P>
<P>
   His emergence was sudden, his impact enormous, his downfall
unforeseen and shocking.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? No one knows, although some theorists blame
imperfections in his swing, others the explosive nature of his
character. But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40, unless he
can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the
Senior Tour. His impact on the game remains, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches
from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus
all of Europe. As a result, the matches,have become an increasingly
competitive and major event.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nick Faldo
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game, partly because
of his rather phlegmatic personality and, in the minds of some
people, because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David
Leadbetter, who completely rebuilt Nick's swing and follows him
around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a
student, not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, I have found myself thinking, Can you imagine Ben
Hogan being followed every step of his career by a coach?
</P>
<P>
   9. Ray Floyd
</P>
<P>
   How's this for career longevity? He was only 18 when he turned
pro 35 years ago. Now, as he nears his mid-50s, he is still winning
on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour
to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with
skill and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   10. To round out my top 10, I'll have to resort to that old cop-
out, a tie. In this case, a three way tie, among Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now what shall I do about Tiger Woods and Ernie Els?
</P>
<P>
   All three of the world's famous championships were won in '97 by
men in their 20s; Woods, 21, the Masters; Els, 27, the U.S. Open;
and Leonard, 25, the British Open. Might one of them be the new
Nicklaus or Palmer? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as ranking any of them, I can only echo the comment
made long ago by Red Smith. After Willie Mays had turned in his
second great season in the majors, someone asked Red if he thought
Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back and ask me that in 20 years,'' he said, ``and I'll
tell you.''

   TV-SURFER _ With ``The X-Files'' movie gearing up (it opens June
19), David Duchovny says he often feels like he's had enough of his

   MONSTERS _ As Godzilla tromps into town, parents need to make
sure they arm their kids with the best weapons against monsters:
common sense and sleep. Psychologist Stephen Garber, author of
``Monsters Under the Bed and Other Childhood Fears,'' says the
bottom line is this: Kids under 8 or 9 really are not clear on the
difference between reality and fantasy -- no matter how well they
articulate to the contrary. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   CRAWFISH _ Cajuns love crawfish for their taste, of course; the
chef Paul Prudhomme likens the tender curl of tail meat to lobster
dipped in butter _ only you don't need the butter. But Cajuns love
crawfish for another reason as well: It reminds them of themselves.
It's a culinary underdog from the backwoods that had to scrap and
claw its way to acceptance. (Auchmutey, Atlanta

   LAST-MILKMAN _ He is one of a dying breed. Yet Rick Lee will not
go gentle into that good night. His job won't let him. When you're
one of the last milkmen in Atlanta, those days start early, around
2:30 a.m. For 27 years Rick Lee has been rising at that hour to
thank his luck, curse his luck, and deliver milk, eggs, butter,
cottage cheese and orange juice. (Scott, Atlanta

<P>
   WEB-MARKETING _ Marketing on the Web isn't easy. But Coca-Cola's
clever Web promotions make it one of the smartest Web marketers
around. Brand manager Tom Halloran says the ``Alanna'' promotion --
the latest in Coca-Cola's use of the Web to promote various brands
-- is designed to increase the appeal of Cherry Coke to teens and
young adults who are part of what he calls ``the emerging wired
generation.'' (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKWARS _ Independent booksellers face tough times. Those who
have lasted through changes in the business continue to quietly
look for ways to do better and more efficiently what they have a
reputation for doing: providing personal service. ``I did feel
everyone understands the importance of independent stores,'' Abel
Zimmerman, president of Book People, said. ``As an independent, I
felt well received (by publishers).'' (Morris, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   KIDSNEWS-HUNGER _ Rick Bragg is a writer for The New York Times
and has plenty of money for food. But some people _ even today in
our rich country _ don't. A lot of times, adults who don't have
much money find it hard to buy groceries, pay rent and buy all the
other things their families need. They may put enough food on the
table, but it's a struggle _ and it's a bad feeling. (Simonton,

   BAPTISTS-CONVERT _ Southern Baptists from across the nation,
meeting for their national convention in Salt Lake City, are taking
part in an effort to persuade Mormons to change their beliefs, to
reach the unchurched with the gospel of Jesus and maybe to win back
some Southern Baptists who converted to Mormonism. (Perkes, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   GAYDAY-DISNEY _ ay Day at Walt Disney World featured the
predicted open displays of affection: hand-holding, hugging,
snuggling and kissing. But on this day, as on other days, most of
those displays involved couples of opposite sex, and nearly
everything turned out as tame as an old-time Disney movie. Even
tamer were the dissenters who had threatened such a ruckus that
county deputies were put on riot alert. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post)

   TRAVEL-MILENNIUM _ Where will you be when the clock strikes

<P>
   Gay Day at Walt Disney World featured the predicted open
displays of affection: hand-holding, hugging, snuggling and
kissing. But on this day, as on other days, most of those displays
involved couples of opposite sex, and nearly everything turned out
as tame as an old-time Disney movie.
</P>
<P>
   Even tamer were the dissenters who had threatened such a ruckus
that county deputies were put on riot alert.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Rescue, known nationally for its confrontational
anti-abortion protest, made good on its vow to send members into
the park to preach to gays. But instead of a charging phalanx led
by the group's lightning-rod leader, it sent a Louisiana pastor
followed by a few teenagers reading Bible verses. Hardly anyone
except reporters and Disney security staff paid attention.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the park, thousands of gay men and lesbians stood out
from the crowd in their bright-red shirts but otherwise followed
familiar protocol: standing on the seemingly endless line for Space
Mountain, posing for pictures with Mickey Mouse and jostling for a
prime spot to watch the Main Street parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Josue Santiago of New York. ``I'm
having the best time ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Kat Campani, one of Santiago's friends, said the ride from their
hotel was marred by an encounter with roadside demonstrators who
shouted that Jesus could make them heterosexual. A banner plane
that made several passes over the park carried a similar message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then some people in our car started to shout back that Jesus
made us gay, and that ruined everyone's day,'' said Campani, who
was much happier with the more relaxed atmosphere inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   It was, for the most part, a quiet crowd. Gay Day at Disney is
not so much party as it is prelude to more than 40 related events
held in the Orlando area throughout the weekend as a kickoff to Gay
Pride Month. Early in the day, red shirts appeared to account for a
quarter of the crowd but less later on.
</P>
<P>
   The privately organized day at Disney has been an annual feature
at the park since 1991, but the atmosphere leading up to this
year's gathering was more highly charged.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is under intense criticism and even boycotts nationally
by several political and religious groups that consider its
employment policies, movies and television shows too friendly to
gays, and Gay Day has become the focus of protests.
</P>
<P>
   Three Treasure Coast elementary schools canceled trips to Disney
and other theme parks after some parents said they wouldn't let
their children attend during the gay events. School officials said
the plans were changed to avoid scheduling conflicts, but parents
made it clear they were concerned about what children might see.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christian groups were encouraging members last week
to call stores that sell Disney merchandise to remind them of the
boycott. Gay groups were asking members to counter that by
purchasing Disney merchandise with $2 bills so the source of the
money was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Tension was evident at demonstrations throughout the Orlando
area and during a city debate over plans to fly gay pride flags on
light poles. The flags won approval.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Rescue's national director, the Rev. Philip L.
``Flip'' Benham, led protests at Orlando book stores and abortion
clinics and against Disney. He was arrested on charges of violating
a court order outside one clinic.
</P>
<P>
   News that Benham planned to enter the park prompted Disney to
cancel agreements for television coverage inside the gates. ``We
were concerned that a big media horde following him around would
create a distraction that would keep guests from having a good
time,'' said Bill Warren, a Walt Disney World spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Benham's emissary, Bill Shanks, wound up in a heated-but-civil
debate with Robert Pitman of Austin, Texas, who suddenly stopped
and shook his head. ``Hey, I came here to go on the rides, not talk
to him,'' Pitman said, and walked off with companion David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which does not allow any group to demonstrate or hand
out leaflets on Disney World property, doesn't sponsor, organize or
publicize Gay Day, its spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People encourage other people to buy tickets, which they have
a right to do,'' Warren said. ``Our park is open to everyone from
all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Swallow, one of the original organizers of Gay Day at
Disney, said he was dismayed by the event's current political
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was started as a purely social gathering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After attracting a few thousand people the first year, Gay Day
grew to more than 60,000 last year, Swallow said. This year's crowd
was predicted to top 100,000. There is no one group behind the
event. Attendance is fueled by publicity, promotions for events at
nearby night clubs and word-of-mouth. Gays are asked to wear red
shirts, which makes the crowd easier to count.
</P>
<P>
   Disney doesn't reveal attendance figures, and Warren said the
parks always reach capacity by mid-morning at this time of year.
But there is no comparable, privately organized theme day. ``This
one's unique for its magnitude,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney does sponsor several special events, such as Grad Night
and Night of Joy, which features Christian music, but they are held
after normal closing hour.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Caton, president of the Florida Family Association,
said he asked Disney to shift Gay Day to later hours to avoid
conflicts with those who are upset by seeing gays kiss or hold
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Caton, who has fought gay-rights proposals around the state,
said he has attended several Gay Days at Disney and heard visitors
complain that weren't told what to expect. He and other members
planned to videotape this year's scene, but not protest.
</P>
<P>
   Two Gay Day parties were scheduled for after closing hour at
Disney World sites, but Disney says it has no control over the rest
of the day. Disney won't talk about visitor complaints, but Warren
said the company's policy is to make customers happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A complaint is conceivable any day,'' he said. ``If they're
dissatisfied about something beyond our control, we can offer them
the opportunity to come back another day.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer would suit the Gibson family of Pennsylvania
perfectly. Robert Gibson said he saw nothing that upset him, heard
nothing rude and thought everyone at Gay Day got along well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't have come today if I'd known about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, he exchanged looks with his wife and paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just may have been a better day,'' he said. ``That's
all.''

 &HT;    When there's not enough food
 &HT;    By Stell Simonton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Thirty or so years ago, Rick Bragg was a poor boy
growing up in northeast Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know then, like I know now, that my mama never ate
until we were done,'' he writes in his book ``All Over But the
Shoutin'''.
</P>
<P>
   His mother ate what was left over. She was making sure her three
sons got their fill, because there wasn't quite enough food to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bragg is now a writer for The New York Times and has plenty
of money for food. But some people _ even today in our rich country
_ don't.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of times, adults who don't have much money find it hard to
buy groceries, pay rent and buy all the other things their families
need. They may put enough food on the table, but it's a struggle _
and it's a bad feeling.
</P>
<P>
   About one out of every eight households in this country have
that kind of trouble, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. The department _ along with the Census Bureau and
other government departments _ learned this by gathering
information from 45,000 people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Those households reported that they had to do things such as cut
back on the amount of food the adults ate so the children would
have enough. Or they borrowed food or got groceries from a church
or food pantry that gives away free food. Or they bought cheaper
food that was not as healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture calls this being ``food
insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are worse than insecure for about one out of every 25
households. Adults in those households told the Census Bureau they
often go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst case _ in about one out of every 100 households _
even the children did not get enough to eat. The department calls
this ``severe hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that if you are in a classroom of 25
students, probably three of those kids belong to families that have
trouble buying enough food.
</P>
<P>
   If your school is in a rich neighborhood, maybe no one has
trouble buying groceries. But if your school serves kids who live
in poor areas, more kids may be going hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Families are embarrassed and hurting when they can't buy food,
says Sandra Robertson of the Georgia Citizens Coalition on Hunger.
``Not many people are willing to share that kind of pain in
public,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKOUT - OPTIONAL
</P>
<P>
   Hungry for answers
</P>
<P>
   By Benita Dodd
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgians are starving,'' actress Jane Fonda said in a speech
in April. She was talking about how poor some people are in
Georgia. The very next day, she said she was wrong and apologized
for the remark. People are not actually dying of hunger in our
state. But her speech made many people want to know how big a
problem hunger really is.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is the main cause of world hunger. About 20 percent of
the world's 4 billion people are underfed, according to Margaret
Missiaen, an agricultural economist formerly with the Department of
Agriculture. Of the people who don't get enough to eat, about half
live in or near India. About two-fifths live in African and Asian
countries.Hunger 101
</P>
<P>
   In a class called Hunger 101 taught by the Atlanta Community
Food Bank, instructors pass out raisins, with some kids getting a
few, some kids getting a handful, others getting none. It's a
lesson that helps show how things are not always fair and equal in
this world. The class also explains why people suffer from hunger
and how you can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me see through the eyes of those in need,'' said one
student who took the class. The free, one-day class is held for
groups of all ages _ kids through adults. For more information,
call 404-892-3333 or check the Web site at http://www.acfb.org/
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Web site also has a great explanation of how you can
organize a food drive.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency help
</P>
<P>
   A food bank is a place that gives free food to those who need
it. Many churches sponsor food banks, sometimes called a food
pantry. To find if there's one near you, call 211. To find out how
you can help volunteer at a food bank.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do to help
</P>
<P>
   Find out the nearest food bank or food pantry. Volunteer to help
out there. Maybe you could organize things on the shelves or help
clean up.
</P>
<P>
   Groups and organizations can hold a food drive: collect food
items for a food bank.
</P>
<P>
   Go with your family to a community kitchen to help serve food.
Go on a day that's not a holiday, because plenty of people usually
help on holidays.

 &HT;    Volunteering: 10 ways you can help out
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look around. It doesn't take Superman's X-ray vision
to see that not everyone is lucky enough to have a happy and
healthy family, plenty of food on the table and enough money to
make ends meet. In fact, many people in our society need help.
Fortunately, there are many good organizations that come to their
rescue. And those organizations depend on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering may not seem like a very good deal. After all, you
are giving something to someone else free of charge. But most
volunteers have found that what they give is paid back to them in
many ways. When you volunteer, you make new friends, expand your
horizons, develop leadership experience and learn new skills.
Sometimes, volunteering can even lead to a paying job. But most of
all, it gives you a good feeling inside _ just by knowing that you
helped someone who really needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are 6 or 16, there are many ways you can begin
volunteering this summer, whether you spend time with a needy
person or help out an arts organization. News for Kids rounds up
some of the best volunteer opportunities for youngsters:
</P>
<P>
   Help the hungry
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Community Food Bank is an amazing operation. It
distributes 1.5 million pounds of non-perishable food a month to
700 agencies that serve the hungry. They are looking for kids 8 or
older (anyone under 18 needs an adult chaperone) to help sort and
inspect the food, making sure it is safe to eat. You might look for
dents in cans or a hole in the potato chip bags, or _ yuck _ a
half-full jar of peanut butter that has an imprint of a spoon
someone has licked. Those get rejected. ``Kids have a blast, and
it's great for families or a summer camp project,'' says volunteer
program manager Kathleen Kelly. Call 404-892-3333, Ext. 229.
</P>
<P>
   Serve homeless kids
</P>
<P>
   Many kids must live in homeless shelters with their families.
The Atlanta Children's Shelter serves as a day care facility for
preschoolers (kids 5 and younger) while their parents work or look
for jobs. The shelter needs youngsters to play with the kids, read
stories, supervise arts and crafts, and serve snacks. You'll get a
good feeling when you enrich a youngster's life. Volunteer Tatianna
Troutman, a seventh-grader at Atlanta's Paideia School, says: ``I
like teaching the children new things, like their colors. At first
this little girl did not know the difference between green and
yellow, and now she does, because I taught her.'' Volunteers must
be 14 or older (younger if accompanied by a parent or other adult).
Call 404-892-3713.
</P>
<P>
   Be a buddy
</P>
<P>
   All kids need good role models such as a big brother or sister
they can look up to. The 22 service sites for Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of
Metro Atlanta need young people 12 and up to serve as mentors to
kids 6-11. Activities range from coaching sports to working with
computers. Call 404-527-7100.
</P>
<P>
   Feed sick people
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty bad when you're so sick you can't cook _ or earn
enough money to buy food. That's where Project Open Hand steps in.
Every day, the organization prepares and delivers two freshly
cooked meals a day to 550 people with AIDS or HIV-related
disabilities. The organization needs volunteers 15 and up to pack
up meals, as well as volunteers 17 and up to work in the kitchen.
Delivery routes are available to those 16 and older with a car,
drivers license and insurance. Call 404-872-2707.
</P>
<P>
   For animal lovers
</P>
<P>
   While you must be 18 to work directly with the animals at the
Atlanta Humane Society shelter, the city's oldest charitable
organization welcomes all creative fund-raising from kids of all
ages. For instance, one family donated $38 that it earned from a
lemonade and bake sale. And all are welcome to make pet toys or
even homemade dog biscuits (there's a special recipe available from
the Humane Society) to be sold in the gift shop at the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Three 11-year-old Buckhead girls _ Ashley Jones, Tessa Morris
and Libby Spears _ raised $200 for the Humane Society from their
pet-sitting service.
</P>
<P>
   Explains Tessa, a student at the Westminster Schools: ``We
started the pet-sitting service because we really liked animals. We
wanted to buy a horse, but decided that was impossible, so we
decided to donate the money to the Humane Society to help
animals.'' It took the three girls a year and a half to raise the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Call 404-875-2600, Ext 234.
</P>
<P>
   Brighten up a senior citizen
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting young people together with senior citizens is an
incredible combination,'' says April Cooks, outreach coordinator
for the volunteer organization Hands On Atlanta. The elderly just
light up when kids are around, she says. Cooks has many projects
for youngsters _ from serving meals to just visiting. You must be
18 if unaccompanied by an adult, but kids as young as elementary
school level are welcome, if they have adult supervision. Call
404-872-2252, Ext. 33.
</P>
<P>
   Help the earth
</P>
<P>
   Litter is a serious problem in Georgia. It not only looks bad,
it also can be dangerous to health and safety. You can help create
a better environment by volunteering for DeKalb Clean and
Beautiful's monthly cleanups of streets, vacant lots and illegal
dumping spots all over the county. These beautification events are
held the third Saturday of every month. Volunteers also are needed
to plant flowers and trees and to mark storm drains to remind
people not to dump chemicals that pollute creeks and rivers. You
must be at least 12; adult supervision will be provided. Groups are
welcome. Call 404-371-2654. And there are plenty of similar
opportunities in other counties. To find the Keep America Beautiful
affiliate nearest you, call the information line of Keep Georgia
Beautiful: 1-888-657-1122
</P>
<P>
   Especially for bookworms
</P>
<P>
   One of the main ways Goodwill Industries raises money for its
job-training programs is through its annual used book sale, the
nation's largest. The enormous preparation for this sale goes on
year-round, and hundreds of volunteers are needed. Duties include
sorting thousands of donated books and magazines into categories,
and cleaning and pricing them. ``Kids love using the pricing
guns,'' says book department director Monique Huiet,``and enjoy
racing each other to see who can empty a bin of books and put them
in the right place the fastest.'' Goodwill can use unaccompanied
children 12 and up; under that age, adult supervision is required.
Families and groups (such as Scout troops) are welcome. Call
404-377-0441, Ext. 156.
</P>
<P>
   Stagestruck?
</P>
<P>
   There's much more to putting on a successful show than just
actors and scenery. The Academy Theatre gives high school students
a chance to participate behind the scenes. These volunteers help
with everything from tours to administrative tasks. Call
404-525-4111.
</P>
<P>
   Explore other cultures
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta International Museum introduces us to the cultures of
the world through art. Volunteers 15 and up are needed to serve as
tour guides, work in the gift shop and office, greet visitors, help
install exhibits and more. ``It's real fun and a great learning
experience,'' says volunteer coordinator Jane Arthur. Call
404-688-2467, Ext. 5.

 &HT;    A worldly guide to greeting the millennium
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where will you be when the clock strikes midnight on Dec. 31,
1999? As we fast approach the year 2000, big celebrations and
observances have already been planned around the world. If you want
to make the scene, there may be a travel book in your future: ``The
Millennium: A Rough Guide to the Year 2000'' (Rough Guides, $8.95).
</P>
<P>
   The pocket-size 264-page guide, due in stores this week, is
packed with information on festivals, projects and mega-events as
well as answers to questions about potential chaos on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Author Nick Hanna provides information on everything from the
Millennium Wheel (the world's largest Ferris wheel and a symbol of
time's passage) in Greenwich, England, to a papal ceremony in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   There's also advice on places where you can avoid the hubbub.
</P>
<P>
   If the millennium turns out to be a time bomb _ with everything
from water supplies to bank vaults controlled by computers shutting
down or going haywire when their internal clocks read 00 _ what's
the alternative but to ... party!
</P>
<P>
   The guide rounds up hundred of ways to embrace millennium
madness, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Odyssey 2000: This around-the-world bike trek, beginning and
ending in Los Angeles, gets under way Jan. 1, 2000. The trip covers
20,000 miles and 54 countries in 366 days. The cost: $36,000,
including transportation on non-biking sectors. 206-322-4102.
</P>
<P>
   _ Party surfing: A Web page for millennium-eve parties (www.jepa
</P>
<P>
   .co.uk/shopping/party.html) is a quirky international register
of celebration places.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walk like an Egyptian: The pyramids are destined to be one of
the most popular party spots. Hang out with mystics and prophets.
The Egyptian Tourist Authority, while confirming there will be a
bash, hasn't nailed down the details. One thing's for sure: It will
be a dry celebration; no alcohol is allowed on site.

   MONSTERS _ As Godzilla tromps into town, parents need to make
sure they arm their kids with the best weapons against monsters:
common sense and sleep. Psychologist Stephen Garber, author of
``Monsters Under the Bed and Other Childhood Fears,'' says the
bottom line is this: Kids under 8 or 9 really are not clear on the
difference between reality and fantasy -- no matter how well they
articulate to the contrary. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CRAWFISH _ Cajuns love crawfish for their taste, of course; the
chef Paul Prudhomme likens the tender curl of tail meat to lobster
dipped in butter _ only you don't need the butter. But Cajuns love
crawfish for another reason as well: It reminds them of themselves.
It's a culinary underdog from the backwoods that had to scrap and
claw its way to acceptance. (Auchmutey, Atlanta

   LAST-MILKMAN _ He is one of a dying breed. Yet Rick Lee will not
go gentle into that good night. His job won't let him. When you're
one of the last milkmen in Atlanta, those days start early, around
2:30 a.m. For 27 years Rick Lee has been rising at that hour to
thank his luck, curse his luck, and deliver milk, eggs, butter,

   WEB-MARKETING _ Marketing on the Web isn't easy. But Coca-Cola's
clever Web promotions make it one of the smartest Web marketers
around. Brand manager Tom Halloran says the ``Alanna'' promotion --
the latest in Coca-Cola's use of the Web to promote various brands
-- is designed to increase the appeal of Cherry Coke to teens and
young adults who are part of what he calls ``the emerging wired
generation.'' (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   BOOKWARS _ Independent booksellers face tough times. Those who
have lasted through changes in the business continue to quietly
look for ways to do better and more efficiently what they have a

Zimmerman, president of Book People, said. ``As an independent, I

   Woodham, society columnist for the Atlanta Journal and

her mother be matron of honor? Can the bride ask a guy to be one of

and other thorny questions head-on. (slugged:

   Newlyweds may discover that the person whom they love has
domestic habits that they hate. What if the bride is a neatnik and
the groom is a slob? What if he can't bear to talk to anyone when
he first wakes up and she is all bubbly? Even bathroom habits, such
as how one squeezes the toothpaste tube and whether to leave the
toilet seat up or down, can cause domestic turmoil. DeMorier offers
ideas on how to keep the home from turning into a battleground.

 By DEBBI J. KARPOWICZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Cakes topple. Drunken relatives fight. Brides turn out to be
allergic to their flowers. Gowns and tuxes don't arrive in time.
 &HT;    These are some of the mishaps that can beset a wedding, no
matter how carefully it is planned. Even wedding coordinators admit
that some things are beyond their control.
 &HT;    For example, Phyllis Block, head of the wedding team at The
World Trade Center in Boston, once handled a wedding at which the
couple's dog walked down the aisle _ and relieved himself.
 &HT;    Toni deLisi, a consultant in Waldwick, N.J., once planned a
wedding at The Plaza Hotel in New York, only to have thieves steal
the flowers from the delivery truck parked on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    Then there are times when things go really awry: Guests have
fistfights and get arrested. An ex-girlfriend sets the limo on
fire.
 &HT;    If anyone has seen couples get hitched _ with about every hitch
possible _ it's the Rev. Dennis James Robinson, a justice of the
peace and Unitarian minister based in Hopkinton, Mass.
 &HT;    Robinson, who performed 327 weddings in 1997, once married a
couple in a Jacuzzi filled with orange Jell-O. It involved 72
packets of gelatin, 268 gallons of water and a canoe-paddle
stirrer.
 &HT;    At one wedding over which Robinson presided, the bride's
divorced parents were on bad terms. After the groom's father gave
an emotional toast to the newlyweds, the bride's embittered father
grabbed the microphone and launched into a tirade.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to let you all know that my ex-wife is a no-good
 !!% !%!,'' he ranted. Everyone gasped, as he continued, ``I also
wanted you all to know that I contributed to this wedding.''
 &HT;    He was interrupted by his ex-wife, who shot back, ``No, you
didn't, you  !!%!'' The ex-wife then jumped up, grabbed her
ex-husband's throat and punched him in the stomach.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the ex-husband's new girlfriend clawed at the ex-wife
with her fingernails, while both reached for the microphone to use
as a weapon.
 &HT;    The fight eventually spilled out into the parking lot. When all
was said and done, 11 people were arrested.
 &HT;    Another time, Robinson officiated at a ceremony on a patio
overlooking a golf course. During the nuptials, he realized there
was a ruckus behind him, but he didn't dare turn around. When it
came time for the bride to say her vows, a breathy voice in back of
him yelled, ``I do.''
 &HT;    It was the groom's ex-girlfriend, decked out in a wedding gown,
determined to get revenge. Pandemonium broke out faster than you
can say ``Fatal Attraction.'' The groom then warned everyone to be
careful, as his former flame had recently broken into his house,
trashed it and slit his car tires.
 &HT;    When the chauffeur left the limousine for a moment, the angry ex
took lighter fluid, wrote ``I Love You'' on the hood of the car and
set it on fire.
 &HT;    ``I left before I heard what happened next,'' Robinson says.
 &HT;    Another memorable affair was an Irish wedding at which the
budget-conscious couple relied on a relative and a boom box instead
of hiring professional musicians. Unfortunately, Uncle Joe got
inebriated and played tunes that were inappropriate, to say the
least. The parents danced to ``Send in the Clowns,'' the newlyweds
waltzed to ``The Stripper'' and the groom and his mother danced to
``Do It to Me One More Time.''
 &HT;    Doug Giordano, director of food and beverage at New Jersey's
Woodcliff Lake Hilton, once had a bride who was assaulted by
strangers in the restroom.
 &HT;    This happened at another hotel, where the ballroom and the bar
shared a restroom. Apparently, three jealous _ and intoxicated _
female customers came upon the happy bride in the bathroom, held
her against the wall and burned holes into her gown with their
cigarettes.
 &HT;    At another wedding that Giordano handled, three rap stars, who
had just performed at The Meadowlands, returned to their hotel and,
out of boredom, crashed the wedding in the ballroom. They ran out
onto the dance floor and started to sing and dance, Giordano
recalls. When one of the bridesmaids confronted them, it evolved
into a fistfight ``with split lips, black eyes and five police
cars,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least there were no threats of bullets. Teddy Lenderman, a
wedding coordinator in Terre Haute, Ind., wore a bulletproof vest
for one of the weddings she worked on _ as did the priest, groom
and several members of the wedding party.
 &HT;    Apparently, the groom's irrational mother didn't like the bride,
and told him, ``If you marry her, I'm going to come in and blow you
all away.''
 &HT;    No one took Mom seriously _ until she showed up at a relative's
funeral, where she slapped the corpse and slammed the casket shut.
When the funeral director approached her, she kicked him and broke
his leg in three places.
 &HT;    On the day before the wedding, she called the rectory five times
and threatened the clergyman with bodily harm.
 &HT;    On the wedding day, the nervous groom called his mom and forbade
her to come.
 &HT;    ``She didn't show,'' Lenderman says. ``But in my 14 years of
business, at that point, I had never experienced anything so
nerve-wracking.''
 &HT;    The bride was the tremulous one at a wedding attended by Barbara
Sheehan, an executive at The Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii.
 &HT;    Sheehan recalls that the bride got halfway down the aisle, then
turned around to ask one of her bridesmaids a question:
 &HT;    ``You can learn to love someone, can't you?''

 &UR; By MARTHA A. WOODHAM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``The Bride Did What?!''
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that
they panic. It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out
you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do
and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e., tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother is sure she knows what's correct. Your beloved's
mother has her own ideas, and your neighbor down the street can't
wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she's
attended. You begin to feel queasy at the thought of ``Your Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, worry no more. Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths _ and
the right answers, no matter what anyone says. Folks will swear
these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and
handed down by some Etiquette God. Well, they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   1. The bride and groom must ask their siblings to be bridesmaids
and groomsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be
attendants, the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish
_ best friends, pals from the office, a buddy from a favorite bar.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: This could be deadly. Friends come and go, while
your families are there forever. You avoid a lot of hurt feelings
by asking brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky brides wail, ``But I don't feel close to his sisters. I
want my friends instead.'' A wedding is a great place to get
acquainted. After the ``I do's,'' those strangers will be your
sisters, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. The bride must be escorted down the aisle and given away by
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when
men bought brides from their fathers or, even worse, captured them.
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic. Somehow it was
charming when a woman went from her father's home directly to her
new husband's, but that's not true of most couples today.
</P>
<P>
   With so many women going to college, supporting themselves and
marrying later, being ``given away'' seems terribly out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want it, leave it out of the ceremony. And if you
choose, walk down the aisle by yourself. Not every bride has a
father, nor does every bride like her father. Some brides say going
solo made them feel like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   3. The bride's father must sit in the first pew with the bride's
mother, even if they hate the sight of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, divorced mothers and fathers would overcome
their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child's
wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get real. Divorce is a 1990s fact of life. When divorced
parents get along, it's wonderful. Mom and Dad can sit together,
one big happy parental unit on the first pew.
</P>
<P>
   This changes if stepparents are in the picture. Mom _ and her
new husband _ should sit in the first pew. Dad _ and his new wife _
should sit in the next pew.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not get along, Dad and his new wife should sit even
farther back in the church _ far enough away to avoid bodily harm.
(All of this goes for the groom's parents, too.)
</P>
<P>
   4. The number of groomsmen must equal the number of bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   So who's counting? Unlike many other areas of modern life, there
is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality.
</P>
<P>
   An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the
altar _ and makes life easier for the wedding consultant _ but this
is not mandatory. You can have all men, all women _ even all
children if you like.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be politically correct at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   5. A bride cannot ask her mother to be the matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can be a best man, there is no reason a mother can't
be matron of honor. It's a beautiful, loving gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one. The
mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many
duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But if a bride's mom is extremely organized and is her best
friend, she should ask her.
</P>
<P>
   6. A bride cannot ask her mother to escort her down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can escort his daughter, there is no reason a mother
can't. More and more brides are asking their moms to make the
stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew. This
custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies, where both parents
escort the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lovely gesture, and most moms are thrilled to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   7. A flower girl must be under age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The littler they are, the cuter they are _ and the more they can
disrupt your ceremony! The same goes for ring bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their
petals. One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl's basket,
dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it.
</P>
<P>
   And my mom loves to tell of when I was a flower girl: At a
crucial moment in the ceremony, I stage-whispered, ``Mommy, I have
to tee-tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer
should be how important a child is to you. If the little girl or
little boy is someone you want to include, by all means do it, no
matter how old _ or young _ the child is.
</P>
<P>
   8. Brides and grooms must pick attendants who are close to their
own age.
</P>
<P>
   No, the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere
attachment to the bride or groom _ and the ability to pay for the
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s,
and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   9. A pregnant woman cannot be a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have
a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the
bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about. Perhaps a
bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed, and it's hard to run when you
are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child, other
than logistical ones: She may have trouble fitting into her dress,
and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.

   10. There can be only one maid of honor and one matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   A bride may have two of either if she wishes. And she doesn't
have to limit herself to women.
</P>
<P>
   If the bride's best friend is a guy, she should ask him. But she
shouldn't call him, as one Atlanta bride did, her ``mister of
honor.''

 c.1998 Elegant Wedding, published by Philadelphia magazine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His parents: ``Your turkey is dry, you didn't take the family
name and you're five years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Your parents: ``He's not your religion, he's supporting an
ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for
their child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battle No. 1 is, `Where's your primary loyalty?''' says
Watson, who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy
graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Your primary allegiance needs to be with your
partner, but you can't exclude parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to put down your spouse's parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the
parent,'' Watson says. Instead, explain to your mate what the
problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the
conflict.
 &UR; COUPLES AT RISK: WHO ISN'T? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people sail into in-law relationships without some
apprehension and discomfort at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a transition for everyone,'' Watson says.
``You're bringing together two sets of rules, and each family feels
its rules should be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating
to their in-laws than those over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger
people, for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still
exist,'' Ascher notes.
</P>
<P>
   In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Bilofsky, a Cherry Hill, N.J.-based psychotherapist and
co-author of ``Inlaws/Outlaws: How to Make Peace with His Family
and Yours'' (Villard Books, 1991), encourages newlyweds to reassure
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy doses of `I love you, I will always love you and I will
always be your child' go a long way toward easing a parent's
troubled heart,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as
parents,'' she says. `` They may call to ask for money, become very
protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest.
 &UR; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Wedding planning.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   + Juggling families.
</P>
<P>
   One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used
to the visitation demands of her husband's large, very close
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this huge family who did everything together. My
family felt like I was always with my husband's family for
birthdays, Sunday dinners and holidays,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says, she had to deal with ``the insanity of
having to be at both sets of parents' homes for every holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is up for grabs!'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
</P>
<P>
   + Negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
</P>
<P>
   + Money.
</P>
<P>
   Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't accept large gifts unless you're willing to accept the
negatives that may go with them,'' Ascher advises. ``If you accept
a house down payment, expect visits and interference. Decide if
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   + Criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   + Cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may just have to give a parent time,'' she says. ``Stay in
there and have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you plain don't like one of your in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best bet is to be patient, cordial and mannerly,''
according to Bilofsky. ``You have a loved one in common. Do it for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, she adds, ``Remind yourself that your in-laws
must have done something right _ look at the child they raised.''

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT DeMORIER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage''  
 &HT;    Whether you've been living together since junior high school or
spent your first night together on your honeymoon, the agenda for
the first year of marriage is pretty much the same. Just when you
thought you knew your spouse better than your spouse knew himself
or herself, you're really meeting each other for the first time.
 &HT;    Many young couples tend to see married life as an extension of
single life, with an additional person. But as soon as two people
step across the marriage threshold, with sweater-drying rack and
dartboard in hand, two sets of histories and expectations must
join.
 &HT;    Studies of marriage show there is no correlation between an easy
first year of marriage and living together prior to being married,
but living together does get a few of those
put-the-old-milk-carton-in-front-of-the-new-one-so-we-use-the-
old-one-first type of rules out of the way. Some of them, but not
all.
 &HT;    Below are some of the most common issues in the first year of
marriage, and some suggestions for how couples can deal with them.
 &HT;    + Feeling at home.
 &HT;    Having a housewarming or a dinner party is a great way to make a
new home your own, whether you have moved in with your spouse or
the two of you have moved into a new home together. Having friends
and family there to see you in your new surroundings can create a
sense of pride in your home, and a feeling of ease and comfort.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the little things that help establish roots, such
as being the voice on the answering machine, planting a garden or
making friends with the neighbors.
 &HT;    + The slob factor.
 &HT;    If your spouse's housekeeping skills leave a bit to be desired,
if clothes and dishes pave a path from the couch to the
refrigerator, the pile method is a great alternative to bashing
your spouse with a tire iron.
 &HT;    The pile method simply involves picking a neutral location _ a
desk, a dresser, a closet, somewhere you can live with a mess _ and
placing all the wallets, car keys, dirty socks, magazines, dishes
and so forth in that place.
 &HT;    This works for the ``neatnik,'' because everything can be picked
up and deposited quickly, and it works for the slob because
everything is in one place. Note: This is a treatment, not a cure.
 &HT;    + The clash of expectations.
 &HT;    Sit down and discuss in detail how you expect your life as a
couple to be. Maybe your mental picture is unrealistic. You won't
know until it's out in the open. Be specific.
 &HT;    Do you expect coffee to be brought to you in the morning like
your father did for your mother? Do you expect your mate to be home
exactly at 5 o'clock? Do you expect to be able to have friends over
every night?
 &HT;    The majority of newlyweds' fights occur when one spouse is not
acting the way the other spouse expects. But no one, not even
Robert Duvall, can act without a script.
 &HT;    + The age-old toothpaste dilemma.
 &HT;    This type of conflict is quite normal and really simple to
resolve when you get right down to it. If your mate insists on
leaving the cap off the toothpaste, or worse, squeezing the tube in
the middle (gasp!), just buy two tubes of toothpaste.
 &HT;    To solve the problem of whether to roll the toilet paper over or
under _ believe it or not, this actually accounted for an entire
segment on Oprah _ try installing two rollers.
 &HT;    Of course, having separate bathrooms would solve not only both
these problems but also that perennial problem in the battle of the
sexes: Should the toilet seat be left up or down?
 &HT;    The best advice is just to get over it. Sure, you think the
world would be a lot better place if your mate would just ... But
would it really?
 &HT;    Personal habits take some getting used to. Any two people need
time to adjust to each other, a new lifestyle and new surroundings.
Relax. A routine will develop soon enough, and you will quickly
forget that you were ever uncomfortable.
 &HT;    + ``Don't talk to me before I have my coffee.''
 &HT;    There are morning people and there are night people. And then
there are peppy morning people. If you've married one of those
people who pop out of bed, draw open the shades and sing in the
shower ... first of all, my condolences. On the other hand, your
mate is probably a happy person, which may be why you fell in love
with him or her in the first place.
 &HT;    + ``Isn't the game over yet?''
 &HT;    Husbands watching sports all weekend is one of the most frequent
complaints heard from newlywed women. While women often complain
about their husband's sports-viewing habits, however, many women
actually like watching sports on television, particularly with
their mates. Where couples run into trouble is when watching sports
occupies the entire weekend.
 &HT;    One possible solution is planning specific games and sports to
watch, rather than just watching anything that's on.
 &HT;    Here are some other solutions:
 &HT;    Have a sports party. Invite friends or other couples over to
watch the game.
 &HT;    Participate in a sport together. Join a volleyball team or a
bowling league. Take up tennis or golf. Being involved in a sport
makes it more interesting to watch it on television.
 &HT;    Go to the sporting event together. Rather than lounge in the
easy chair all day Saturday, buy tickets to the local college
football game and make a day of it.
 &HT;    Go do something else on your weekend time together, and listen
to the game on the way.
 &HT;    + Sharing the covers.
 &HT;    There's not much people can do to change their behaviors when
they're fast asleep. Thus, newlyweds often complain about the
spouse's snoring, hogging the covers or kicking them in the middle
of the night.
 &HT;    There are some things both partners can do before falling
asleep, however, that can reduce the occurrence of cover stealing.
For instance, if the partner who steals the blankets dresses more
warmly for bed, he or she may not be as likely to feel cold during
the night. Likewise, if the partner who ends up without covers
during the night dresses more warmly, he or she will not mind as
much when the covers disappear.
 &HT;    Another solution would be to keep an emergency blanket next to
the bed so that whoever finds himself or herself without covers
during the night can use a substitute blanket.
 &HT;    For a more romantic option, try sleeping closer together. Body
heat is better than a blanket any day.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta's business leaders have long been
stereotyped as blue-blazered boosters, relentlessly bragging about
the area's growth during their Kiwanis Club meetings. In the 1980s,
one could scarcely read a national news story about Atlanta without
seeing a mocking reference to our dogged ``boosterism.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in the late 1990s, the optimists don't have to talk it up
any more. Turns out that metro Atlanta's growth has outstripped
even the rosiest predictions of the most gung-ho Rotarians. A few
years ago, business leaders here were willing to concede that after
the 1996 Olympics, the area's economy would slow a bit in 1997 and
1998. But instead of taking a breather, the economy has roared
toward hyperventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on I-285 has gone from terrible to nightmarish to
suicidal. Georgia Power is struggling to churn out enough power to
keep air conditioners humming. The air is getting filthy.

   Still, the North Georgia gold rush goes on. This is no
exaggeration: Metro Atlanta has the hottest housing market in the
region, which happens to be the fastest-growing region in the
country, which happens to have the strongest economy in the world.
In terms of growth, it really doesn't get any better than this.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like booster bullfeathers, take another look at
the statistics. Last week the Commerce Department reported that the
nation's sales of new homes surged to a record in April, climbing
5.2 percent to an unprecedented annual rate of 888,000, seasonally
adjusted. But that growth was extremely uneven: Sales declined in
every region except the South.
</P>
<P>
   And what an exception. The South's new-home sales shot up 18.1
percent. Within the region, metro Atlanta is even hotter. According
to statistics compiled by Property Data Systems for Northside
Realty Associates, housing starts rose 23 percent in the metro
area's northern arc during the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For many older Atlantans, this economic explosion brings a sense
of pride. After years of being labeled as bumpkins and boosters,
they are getting rich and having the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the daily hassles behind the growth statistics are getting
harder to handle. Everywhere in metro Atlanta, trees are being
turned into mulch as the bulldozers and chainsaws create room for
subdivisions and shopping centers. Red clay runs into streams and
brown haze hangs low.
</P>
<P>
   Last week brought more evidence of how good these times are in
terms of making money, and how bad they are in terms of protecting
air quality or reducing commute times. In Hall County, the planning
commission endorsed the construction of the Lake Lanier Country
Club, a 589-home gated community on the lake's far north side. The
homes will be priced from the mid-$200,000 to $2 million-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the area north of Lake Lanier would have
regarded the opening of a live-bait shop as a step toward economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for Lake Lanier Country Club reflect the growing
wealth of metro Atlantans. You can't help but be happy to have
prosperous families moving into beautiful homes.
</P>
<P>
   But you also can't help but be horrified at the prospect of
another huge subdivision being created long before more sewers and
transportation systems are added to handle such rapid population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, it was a lot easier to be a civic booster
than a thoughtful planner. Metro Atlanta was blessed with lots of
people willing to promote business. Unfortunately, it had too few
visionaries willing to plan the commuter rails, park systems, sewer
pipes and water lines that would have made the resulting growth
more enjoyable for everyone.

THE FUN OF FUND RAISING FOR TEXAS POLITICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Short of spotting an illegality, major
candidates for statewide office in Texas have little room to
complain about an opponent's fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Money is the fuel that drives the media campaigns that have
become so essential to success on Election Day. And although many
politicians like to howl about the excesses of campaign finance,
most, in truth, are alarmed only when opponents are able to raise
more money than they are.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic gubernatorial nominee Garry Mauro may feel like he
has good reason to complain, since he is about as far behind Gov.
George W. Bush in collecting dollars as polls indicate he is in
capturing the hearts and minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro hasn't exactly been empty-handed. A spokesman said he has
raised about $2.2 million during the past 12 months. He has even
had enough money to go on television with advertising, much earlier
than most campaign-watchers would have thought.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has raised about $15 million for his re-election effort
and will rake in another pile of cash with a fund-raiser scheduled
for June 18 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   News of Bush's upcoming event renewed suspicions _ actively
cultivated by Democrats and shared by just about everybody _ that
the Republican governor is seeking re-election as a prelude to
running for president in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has carefully avoided confirming the speculation, but he,
nevertheless, likely views the Washington fund-raiser as a
``twofer.''
</P>
<P>
   First, it will be a major opportunity to increase his campaign
coffers and enhance his ability to buy large amounts of TV time
this fall as he seeks to bury his challenger.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington gathering, hosted by a number of lobbyists and
associates of former President George Bush, the governor's father,
also will give the governor more exposure to influential people on
the national scene _ the kind of exposure he pretends to hate but
is essential for someone contemplating a race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is trying to make an issue of Bush's perceived
presidential ambitions. He claims Bush is more interested in being
president than governor and thus may not be giving full attention
to the state's needs.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro can't legitimately fault the governor for going to
Washington to raise money because the nation's capital also has
been a major source of funds for the Democratic candidate. And
Mauro's star hosts have been his longtime friends, the First
Couple.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton helped
Mauro raise funds in Washington a year ago. Mrs. Clinton came to
Austin and Dallas in February to raise more money for Mauro, and
the president has written a fund-raising letter for the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has still more events planned with the Clintons in
Washington on June 23. Contributors will have to pay $5,000 apiece
to have dinner with Mauro and Mrs. Clinton but can attend a Mauro
reception featuring the president for only $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, just two days later, Vice President Al Gore, another likely
presidential contender in 2000, will fly to El Paso to help Mauro
raise some more cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro attended fund-raisers with Clinton in Houston and Dallas
last week, but those events raised money for Democratic
congressional candidates and the national Democratic Party, not for
the gubernatorial nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The president's interest in the Texas governor's race has been
so obvious that Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes remarked last week
that it was ``beginning to appear as if the Clinton administration
is underwriting the campaign of Garry Mauro.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats deny _ but not very convincingly _ that Clinton is not
only trying to help an old friend but also would like to see Bush
bruised up a bit in his re-election race before the governor
officially launches a national bid.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Clinton's help, Mauro is not likely to come close to
matching Bush in fund raising. But there is no doubt that Clinton
owes Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, the longtime state land commissioner, was Clinton's Texas
campaign chairman, both in 1992 and 1996, and one of the
president's biggest boosters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never carried Texas, but that certainly wasn't Mauro's
fault. Mauro worked tirelessly for Clinton, even to the point of
almost getting himself into deep trouble _ the legal, not the
political, kind.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was investigated by Travis County District Attorney Ronnie
Earle over reports that state telephones and state employees at the
General Land Office were used to campaign for Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Earle let Mauro off the hook, but the land commissioner
apologized and reimbursed the state.

PLANTING FOR THE YOUNG GARDENER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My granddaughter, who's 4, has a passion for picking flowers.
I would like to plant a cutting garden for her. It must be one,
however, that will withstand plucking, pulling and pruning, and
continue to produce a bloom. The flowers don't have to be
spectacular, just prolific. The area I have in mind is 6 feet by 3
feet and has an eastern exposure.
</P>
<P>
   A: This can be a fun project. Before you plant, make sure the
soil in the area is organically enriched and drains well. If you
have your doubts, work in some compost. You might add a stepping
stone or two to improve accessibility. And possibly a small
birdbath or a shallow dish with a small stone that will provide
water and a basking place for butterflies. Then plant thickly,
especially since prolific blooms, not a beautiful design, is your
goal.
</P>
<P>
   You can plant yellow melampodium, purple angelonia and white
Mexican zinnias for blooms into fall. The melampodium averages a
foot in height; the angelonia is 12-15 inches tall; the zinnias
make a 10-inch mound. The flowers are relatively easy to pick.
Another summer annual about the same height, the bachelor button or
gomphrena, comes in purple, a reddish-orange, lavender and white.
These flowers are small globes, and I would think enticing to a
child. They dry nicely. She'd also probably have fun with the
feathery blooms of celosia. Multicolored zinnias are fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wishbone flower (Torenia) is perfect for a small child. This
foot-tall annual produces small, cupped flowers with stamens that
form a wishbone. The cups may be white with blue or rose rims or
pale blue with dark blue rims. They appreciate afternoon shade, as
do impatiens, another easy-to-pick annual.
</P>
<P>
   Every child, in my opinion, should have the joy of growing
sunflowers. These are so easy from seed. She could sow the seed,
watch them come up and pick the flowers in a couple of months.
Heights vary considerably, so look for the shorter ones for easy
access, the tall ones for oohing and aahing. You all could harvest
some of the large flower heads and roast the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Black-eyed Susans and purple coneflowers are prolific summer
bloomers, too. The stems on these perennials, however, are a little
tougher than those of the above annuals. Grandmother might need to
stand by with a pair of small scissors.
</P>
<P>
   `Batface' cuphea is a drought-tolerant, sun-loving plant with
tiny blooms that resemble a bat's face. The ``face'' is purple; the
``ears`` are red. It flowers continuously spring-frost. This tough
little plant survives less-than-tender touches.
</P>
<P>
   When it's cool this fall _ what a thought _ plant alyssum,
calendula, dianthus, Drummond phlox, petunias and snapdragons. If
you plant daffodil bulbs in November, she'll have fragrant yellow
or white blooms next spring. Sow larkspur and toadflax, which has
colorful, tiny, snapdragonlike blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've grown tomatoes for years and have learned to pick them
just as they begin to turn pink to avoid birds pecking at them. The
birds have always left the green fruits alone. This year, the
squirrels are pulling the largest green tomatoes off the plants,
carrying them across the yard and eating about a third of the
fruit. How do I protect my tomatoes? I'm about to try bird netting
over the tomato patch, but have you heard of a tobacco (nicotine)
home brew that will work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Early one morning this week, I startled a squirrel that had
just picked a neighbor's green tomato and carried it across the
street. When I picked up the fruit, a big chunk was gone. I think
the animal was just after the water in the tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to keep water in your bird bath, and put up the netting
or erect a barrier with chicken wire. I think this is the most
effective control. Products that contain nicotine can be really
strong, and I'm wary of using them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Problem: Little to no tomato production. We have five tomato
plants, planted in March, that have good green color, have been
slow to bloom and have few green tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The key to good tomato production is planting in March,
which you did, in a sunny area where there is soil that drains well
and is highly enriched with organic matter. You want to encourage
good plant growth so that the tomatoes can set fruit on their
flowers when night temperatures are above 55 degrees but below 72
degrees while daytime temperatures don't climb above 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Nature is not always obliging. This year the window of
opportunity was shortened. I can't help but think that the lack of
rain have contributed to various tomato dilemmas. Several gardeners
have said their tomatoes seem to be ripening later.
</P>
<P>
   Other causes of poor production are too much nitrogen
fertilizer, poor pollination, irregular watering, inadequate
sunlight and/or planting a variety not suitable for our area.
Tomatoes produce best with a full day of sun.

PUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS SAY U.S. POLITICS KEEPS THEM LOCKED UP

By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARION, Ill. _ When he looks in a mirror, Oscar Lopez Rivera
sees a middle-age freedom fighter facing the rest of his life
behind bars for trying to liberate his beloved native land from the
grip of its colonial oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a man imprisoned for his political beliefs, a man who
embarked on an armed struggle out of necessity, not choice, but who
harbors no regrets about sacrificing the past 18 years of his life
to that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The image seen by his captors and the agents of the U.S.
government who put him behind bars, however, is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   To the Department of Justice, Lopez Rivera, prisoner 87651-024,
is a terrorist, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s he and his compadres embarked
on a campaign of bombings and robberies and conspired to use force
to bring to an end the U.S. stewardship of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   For those acts, Lopez Rivera and 14 other Puerto Rican
``independistas'' have spent the major part of the last 20 years in
some of America's most well-known penitentiaries, and many are not
yet a third of the way through their sentences. Their motivation
may have been political, the government concedes. And they may have
been, as one prosecutor remembers, the most principled, honest and
dedicated group of people he has ever put behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   But official dogma holds that there are no political prisoners
in the United States, only criminals. The ``independistas'' used
bombs and armed robbery to wage a war against the government. For
that, they were tried and convicted of seditious conspiracy and
weapons offenses and put away for a long time. A very long time.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Rivera, who is 55, is doing 70 years, most of them in
virtual solitary confinement. Elizam Escobar, 40, a writer and
artist whose work is acclaimed throughout Latin America, is doing
60 years. Ricardo Jimenez, 42, who runs an AIDS/HIV awareness and
education program at the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., is
not scheduled for release until the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the 15 Puerto Rican nationalists _ none of them
directly linked to a particular incident in which people were
killed or wounded _ were sentenced to an average of 70.2 years in
prison. That is almost 60 years longer than the average sentence
for all violent federal crimes committed during that same period,
including kidnapping and murder.
</P>
<P>
   After serving 10 or 12 years, three prisoners who sought parole
were turned down and told not to come back for another 15; one was
told not to bother coming back. The rest have declined to request
parole.
</P>
<P>
   All have refused to disavow their actions. Most offered no
defense at trial. In fact, if they were freed tomorrow, Lopez
Rivera vowed from behind the bars at Marion, the fight would
continue. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I have no regrets for serving a noble cause, but ... there
has been a lot of pain and a lot of suffering,'' he said. ``Would
we be willing to renounce the struggle for Puerto Rico's
independence to get out of jail? I will never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the quandary for President Clinton. He has been
petitioned to free the prisoners by hundreds of thousands of Puerto
Ricans, five Nobel Peace Prize winners, international human rights
advocates and emissaries representing millions of Christians who
believe that, regardless of the politics, the ``independistas''
have done enough time.
</P>
<P>
   As the government's attorneys investigate the merit of a
clemency application, the political climate in Washington seems to
be warming to resolving the Puerto Rican ``problem,'' which
includes not only the island's political status, but the
incarceration of its unrepentant patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the petitions very seriously,'' said a senior White
House source. ``They are actively and seriously being considered.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE `MANDELA' OF PUERTO RICO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The courtyard at the Centro Cultural Eugenio Maria de Hostos in
Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, was the setting one sultry evening for a
gathering of intellectuals and students who believe the only way to
save their identities, their culture, their nation is for Puerto
Rico to become independent.
</P>
<P>
   The man they had come to listen to is one of the movement's
great heroes, Rafael Cancel Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Nelson Mandela,'' gushed an attorney while the
object of his affection slapped backs, clearly savoring his status
as icon.
</P>
<P>
   Even those Puerto Ricans who do not approve of the man or his
beliefs, grudgingly admire Cancel Miranda and his three nationalist
compatriots who in 1954 etched their names in infamy by storming
the U.S. House of Representatives, unfurling national flags and
opening fire with pistols. Five lawmakers were wounded as they
dived under their desks.
</P>
<P>
   The four _ Andres Figeroa, Irving Flores, Lolita Lebron and
Cancel Miranda _ were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   They each spent 25 years behind bars until pardoned by President
Carter in 1979. Oscar Collazo, who was convicted in 1950 of trying
to kill President Truman, was also pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Alcatraz, Marion, Leavenworth,'' Cancel Miranda said
at his small house in the village of Cabo Rojo. ``The Harvard, Yale
and Princeton of American prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   At 67, he is no longer the firebrand of his youth, but his blood
is boiling again.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives, by one
tenuous vote, approved a law that will give Puerto Ricans, once
again, the right to decide their future. If the Senate follows
suit, there could be a vote to choose statehood, the status quo or
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Puerto Ricans performed this exercise was in 1993
when no faction could win the majority needed to change things, and
independence attracted only 4 percent of the vote. For all their
fervor, passion and dedication, the chances are slim that the
``independistas''' cause will fare much better this time.
</P>
<P>
   Some Puerto Ricans maintain that there is a conspiracy by the
United States to enslave economically the island so that it would
be suicide to sever ties. Some maintain that 500 years of colonial
domination have created a national psychosis of dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 400 years under Spain and for 100 years under the United
States, (we) have been told from the moment we get up to the moment
we go to bed that independence is bad, that it is anarchic, that
Puerto Ricans will destroy each other,'' said Luis Nieves Falcon,
an eminent San Juan sociologist and supporter of the nationalists.
``Can you be amazed that people who have been subjected on a daily
basis to the negation of independence don't have more support for
it?''
</P>
<P>
   More mainstream thinking holds that the majority of people
either favor statehood or Puerto Rico's current status as a
self-governing commonwealth of the United States, whose people can
vote in political primaries but not general elections and who have
a voice in the House of Representatives but no vote. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Carlo Romelo Barcelon, the island's representative in Congress,
knows the only way he gets to vote is if Puerto Rico becomes the
51st state. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I represent 3.5 million people, more than any other
congressman, and I can't vote,'' Romelo said. ``We are
disenfranchised. We are not participating in the democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among international scholars, human rights experts and legal
experts, there is consensus that, in fact if not in name, a
colonial relationship exists between the United States and Puerto
Rico, and that as such the people have the right to struggle for
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``independistas'' who made that struggle their life's
work have labored largely in obscurity. Vilified and dismissed by
the world's most powerful and influential democracy, their movement
never achieved the international attention of the anti-apartheid
effort in South Africa, or The Troubles in Northern Ireland. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; This was the imperative that drove the Armed Forces of National
Liberation, known by its Spanish acronym FALN, and the nationalists
who came before them, like Cancel Miranda, to embark on a campaign
of violence. To be heard, the Puerto Ricans felt they would have to
make noise.
</P>
<P>
   So they started setting off bombs in Chicago and New York and
San Juan. And they started robbing armored cars and spending the
money on social programs in the barrios. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Ideological violence has to be understood for what it is,''
Lopez Rivera said. ``In the colonial reality, the violence
perpetrated against the people is never measured or talked about.
But it is more detrimental to the society and more nefarious than
political violence. To fight this violence you have to use
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a risk. If you are engaging in political military
action, you cannot cover all the variables. But there was not a
single action we took where there was the possibility of loss of
human life. It is self-defeating if human life is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INNOCENT FAMILY PAYS PRICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a beautiful, unseasonably warm day 23 years ago in
January when Frank Connor, a young New York City banker with a wife
and two boys, was killed by a terrorist bomb while eating lunch at
the famed Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He had been expecting a routine day and wanted to be back home
in time to share the lasagna his wife was making in honor of the
boys' recent birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by that evening the newspapers were listing him as a
victim of a bomb placed outside the tavern by extremists seeking
the liberation of Puerto Rico, and his family was gathering to
grieve and begin asking themselves questions to which they probably
will never find answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have anything to do with Puerto Rico,'' said Joe
Connor, who was 9 when his father died and now, at age 32, is
himself a banker in New York City. ``There is no correlation
between Puerto Rican independence and blowing up innocent people in
a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems to eat away at Joe and his brother Tom, 34 and also a
banker, is that while the FALN claimed responsibility for the
explosion, no individual members were tied to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are spending a lot of time in jail for crimes
that may have included the one that killed their father, but they
still don't know who made the device or who detonated it.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Rivera denies he had anything to do with it; the action
bore no resemblance to any of the 130 incidents his group
acknowledged being involved with.
</P>
<P>
   The Connors couldn't care less. They have no problem with people
struggling to shrug off the constraints of colonial rule. But Lopez
Rivera and his friends were members of the FALN, and the FALN
killed their father, they say. Clemency is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard any one of these people express remorse or
apologies for what they have done,'' Joe Connor said. ``As far as I
am concerned, they are serving a just sentence. In my opinion ...
politics is not an excuse to kill or commit violence.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine years, the group's bombs were directed at political and
military targets, including the 1974 blast that took the eye of a
police officer and the Fraunces Tavern incident that killed four
and wounded 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were real crimes,'' said Jeremy Margolis, a U.S.
Attorney who prosecuted most of the ``independistas.'' ``When you
take hostages, place bombs in buildings and subways and kill people
who don't even know where Puerto Rico is, that's a crime plain and
simple. Were they given very long sentences? Yes. They deserved
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolis and the Connor brothers believe a just cause does not
validate unjust acts. Even Amnesty International, the global human
rights organization, draws the line of legitimacy at the use of
violence to achieve political goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are true political prisoners throughout the world,''
said Tom Connor, ``and calling these people political prisoners
does the real political prisoners a disservice. There are no
political prisoners in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AN IRONIC ARGUMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officially, he is correct.
</P>
<P>
   This is a constitutional democracy, the argument goes, in which
those seeking to change the political or social order have the
means to do so in a legal, nonviolent manner. The path to
independence for Puerto Rico, for instance, leads through Congress
and the courts, not bomb laboratories and underground political
cells.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic, though, writes American University law Professor
Nicholas Kittrie in ``Rebels with a Cause: The Mind and Morality of
Political Offenders,'' that a nation with such a rich history of
``dissent, civil disobedience, dissidence, rebellion and
revolution'' has consistently sought to ``downplay or even overlook
the very existence of political offenses and offenders on these
shores.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittrie asserts that ``from colonial times to the present''
there is a formidable list of people jailed in the United States
for political offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the list who are currently imprisoned, their defenders
claim, include Lopez Rivera; American Indian Movement member
Leonard Peltier, serving a life sentence for the shooting death of
a federal officer at the 1973 siege of Wounded Knee, S.D.; Mumia
Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who is under a death sentence for
shooting a Philadelphia police officer; and former Roman Catholic
priest Phillip Berrigan, an anti-war protester who is serving a
two-year sentence for damaging a U.S. Navy warship.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project,
which operates under the auspices of the National Council of
Churches, there are about 150 people in U.S. prisons who could be
classified as political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that in the United States today there are
political prisoners,'' said the Rev. Michael Yasutake, an Episcopal
priest from Chicago who heads the Interfaith project. ``If we
define a political prisoner as one who has been convicted by the
U.S. government for his or her beliefs, associations and practices,
how can there be any question?''
</P>
<P>
   For Oscar Lopez Rivera, the argument over whether he is a
political prisoner is moot. He did what he had to do and it is
simply his fate that gave him the most powerful nation on earth as
an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is the worst place to be a political prisoner,'' he
said. ``The primary reason there is so little focus on us as
political prisoners is that the colonizer we are fighting is the
United States, and we must not underestimate how powerful the U.S.
can be in bringing attention to an issue. If the U.S. decides there
are political prisoners in China, or Cuba, or that Tibet has the
right to self-determination, then the rest of the world takes
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of who is doing the defining. We have been
defined by the U.S. as almost an irrelevant issue. And so that's
what we are.''

WOMEN OF THE WORK FORCE, UNITE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

 By VERONICA FLORES  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ I've never understood why men's groups have bashed
the annual Take Our Daughters To Work Day. The program, created by
the Ms. Foundation for Women, sets aside a day for adults to focus
on girls by taking them into the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Girls ages 9-15 throughout the country had their day in April,
but many Texas schools postponed the event.
</P>
<P>
   What about boys? the men's advocates complain.
</P>
<P>
   Spare me. Is it not enough that women in corporate America hold
only 2 percent of executive positions, yet make up 46 percent of
the work force? Seems to me, boys _ ahem, men _ are getting along
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, however, that boys need positive guidance, too. How
else will they grow to recognize how wonderful we are?
</P>
<P>
   But guys, lighten up. Take Our Daughters to Work is only one
day. Those who care about the development of boys have 364 other
days to pick from.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Take Our Daughters to Work can be ignored.
Doing so would be a grave oversight. Society's best interests will
be served when girls grow up to fulfill their potential in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Ms. Foundation reports that by the turn of the century eight
out of 10 women between the ages of 25 and 52 will work outside the
home because they want and, in most cases, need to work. And for
the first time, most new jobs will require education or training
beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet girls face stumbling blocks all along the way.
</P>
<P>
   They are bombarded daily by images that reinforce the ignorant
notion that looks matter more than brains. Then we are surprised
when gregarious girls grow to be insecure adolescents who shy from
competition in front of boys, or worse yet, dumb themselves down
because they don't want to appear smarter than a boy they like.
</P>
<P>
   And we shake our heads again when the fragile teen who believes
boys won't like her if she says no, winds up pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Educators often are inadvertent culprits, as several studies
over the years have noted. For example, they are more likely to
attribute boys' failure to lack of motivation, while girls' failure
is attributed to lack of ability, one study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Adults are guilty too, as the study indicates they often don't
believe girls are capable of doing things the girls themselves
believe they can do.
</P>
<P>
   But girls also get very strong cues, perhaps the strongest cues,
from the women around them. The Ms. Foundation often repeats the
refrain, ``A girl is watching; what is she learning?''
</P>
<P>
   They are watching when women manage households, and they see the
contributions that the men in the women's lives do or don't make.
And they are watching, too, when women and their partners interact.
Do they see women asserting themselves or giving in?
</P>
<P>
   As girls watch women in the workplace, what will they learn?
</P>

CARTER, HABITAT AIM TO BUILD 100 HOMES IN ONE WEEK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Project begins Monday, June 15) 
 
By ERIC BERGER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With a mix of worship, work and wood, a former
president and 6,000 volunteers hope to raise 100 homes in the
Houston area in a single week.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next Monday, the 1998 Jimmy Carter Work Project aims
to build houses in Houston's Fifth Ward, a historic
African-American hub that fell on hard times between 1970 and 1990,
and Magnolia Park, a neighborhood with a rich Hispanic tradition
that dates to about 1910.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the largest project ever attempted by Habitat for
Humanity in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage is set for us to make history,'' said Millard
Fuller, founder of Habitat for Humanity. Internationally, his
ecumenical organization has built 65,000 homes for low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Between 7 a.m. next Monday and midafternoon Tuesday, walls,
roofs and plasterboard for 100 new homes will spring up,
transforming once vacant lots into neighborhoods overnight.
Painting, wiring, landscaping and other new-home trimmings will
follow during the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is under the watchful eye and hammer of former
President Carter, participating in his 15th such project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, challenging and always unpredictable,'' Carter
said of his Habitat experiences. ``Rosalynn and I don't consider it
a sacrifice. Each year that we go, it's an adventure for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,500 local volunteers culled from businesses, churches and
other groups will be joined by 1,500 sojourners with hard hats.
</P>
<P>
   Many will stay at the University of Houston, Rice University and
Texas Southern University while working different shifts from early
morning to late at night. For some the weeklong event will be their
first bout with Houston's summer heat and sultry humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said he considered that when recruiting volunteers for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just explained that it would be a worthwhile spiritual
experience,'' Fuller said. Then, tongue in cheek, added, ``Because
if you build 100 homes in June in Houston, you'll never consider
going to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the local Habitat affiliate dedicated its first home
slightly less than a decade ago, Houston attracted interest as a
Carter project site as far back as 1989. But organizers determined
it was not feasible at the time and the project was shifted to
Milwaukee at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Houston Habitat turned to Michael Shirl, a chaplain and
six-year volunteer, to expand their organization and finally bring
the Carter project to Houston, the fourth-largest city in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Habitat had just built its 52nd home in Houston and
no one seriously contemplated a 100-home project.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, local organizers planned 25 homes, a typical
number for a Carter work project. After they were selected as the
host city from more than 20 other applicants, however, they
discovered Fuller had grander visions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked us what we could do to make the project unique,''
Shirl said. ``What was it going to take in Houston to get the
public's attention?''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the ambitious goal of 100 homes grew Project Houston,
Shirl's plan to hike the local organization to ``the next level.''
Including the Carter project, Shirl wanted Habitat to build 385
homes between 1997 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Project Houston also meant major bucks for the organization,
with a goal of raising $15 million. Of that, $10 million has
already been raised. Some money was used for new office space and a
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has grown beyond my wildest dreams,'' said Carl
Umland, Houston Habitat's first president.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the 22-year-old Habitat For Humanity
International. On its 10th anniversary in 1986, the organization
had built only 1,000 homes. Not until after Carter began his work
projects in 1984 did the organization really bloom.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Habitat had built 49,000 homes. The organization plans
to build its 100,000th home in New York City by September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Habitat's mission, Fuller said, is not only providing
homes for those in need, but also raising public awareness of the
dearth of affordable housing in Houston and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just coming to Houston to put on a show,'' Fuller
said. ``We're going to spread the message that if you are a city
official, pastor or businessman and you know people in your city
living in poverty and are doing nothing about it _ that's a
disgraceful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Housing and Urban Development study released in
April, about 64,000 Houston-area households face unaffordable rents
and poor living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Better living conditions, Habitat's credo goes, creates a better
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of making good citizens out of people,'' Carter
said. ``These folks have been dependent on society, they've
probably been on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't felt like they were part of the community,'' he
said. ``They were alien no matter where they existed. They get a
house, they become a taxpayer, they become constructive citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their work at various Carter project work sites,
the 100 Habitat families or individuals receiving new homes have
already worked 300 ``sweat equity'' hours for their new homes. To
qualify, the applicants had to be first-time homeowners and earn
between $11,000 and $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   The homes, ranging in size from 1,100 to 1,250 square feet, will
cost between $43,000 and $46,000 with a no-interest, 15- to 30-year
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Each house completion culminates with a dedication service,
often a teary moment for the participants. Prayers are said and the
home's keys are given to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Browning, house construction leader for a Carter project
home sponsored by Southwestern Bell, has been through two such
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't wipe the smiles off the families' faces with a
Brillo pad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its initial difficulties finding environmentally clean
land and a recent concrete shortage, Shirl said Habitat remains on
schedule with the upcoming Carter project:
</P>
<P>
   The foundations and sidewalks are laid.
</P>
<P>
   The materials are in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers are lined up.
</P>
<P>
   But a looming question remains _ will the weather cooperate?
</P>
<P>
   Summer heat can be managed with preparation, Shirl said. He
estimates volunteers will consume 40,000 gallons of water to combat
the humidity. Ultimately, moisture of a form other than
perspiration or humidity presents the greatest threat to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get past Monday afternoon without any rain then we're
home free in terms of weather,'' Shirl said. By then the walls and
some of each home's roof will be in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it does rain, then I suspect some of us will be working
a few late nights.''

INSIGHTFUL READING FROM THE STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``I will never forget the day I moved in. I was
so happy I was crying. I was thinking to myself, now I have a place
to call my own.'' _ S.R.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have trouble these days remembering that every one of
``the homeless'' is actually a human being? Do you ever pass one of
those animated bags of rags in a doorway and bother to try to find
its eyes?
</P>
<P>
   Have you convinced yourself the homeless all prefer begging on
the street to living a normal life? Do you care anymore how each
man or woman got so down and out?
</P>
<P>
   Read ``We Are Home Now.'' It is a compilation of 36 essays by
people who lived in Hell but who managed to find the skinny, uphill
path that leads out.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are only part of the way out. Homeless for years,
they now live in the Canon Kip Community House in San Francisco.
They fill their days with classes and activities designed to keep
them from going backward.
</P>
<P>
   Drug and alcohol rehabilitation. Training in job and life
skills. Psychiatric appointments. Support groups. The dentist.
Literacy class. Basic math. A writing workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in the streets not only demoralizes you, it actually
zaps the emotional as well as the spiritual strength from you. How
many times had I thought of simply swimming out into the bay until
I could swim no more?'' _ M.L.C.
</P>
<P>
   Although it should, ``We Are Home Now'' will never make the New
York Times bestseller list. You won't find it in Barnes and Noble.
Written by 27 students in the Episcopal Community Services writing
program, it was edited by Ireri Valenzuela, an Adult Basic
Education teacher. The ever-philanthropic Miller Freeman Inc.
published it pro bono.
</P>
<P>
   The content is tough going. It contains very little nonsense. Be
they a 50-year-old Vietnam veteran or a 25-year-old HIV-positive
mother, the essayists are honest about what they have in common:
Alcohol or drug addiction. Jail. Subhuman living conditions.
Chronic poor health. Mental disorders. Shattered families. Hitting
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a drug addict in denial and blamed my bad luck on
everything and everyone but myself. For six years I was living in
the gutters of Oakland. My mind was filled with trash and I was on
a head-on collision with death and/or jail.'' _ R.W.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had sunk to the lowest level, and the only thing that was in
me that drugs couldn't kill was my soul. And that alone made me
take notice of my poor existence, and it haunted me every day. I
would think, what kind of man or woman would stay in the hellhole
of no existence? I had made myself sick, and I was tired of being
everything I didn't want to be.'' _ L.M.
</P>
<P>
   Some were born into poverty and substance abuse. Too many fell
into the hole after Vietnam or when a factory or small business
closed and left them unemployed and unskilled for the job market.
Divorce pushed some of the women to the edge. Alcohol and drugs
shoved almost everyone over.
</P>
<P>
   They never dreamed they could sink as low as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my car, my house and soon found myself on the streets.
I was in and out of ... hotels, where they won't let you stay for
more than a month. I have been raped and stabbed while sleeping
outdoors. Once, I almost committed suicide.'' _ C.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would lie face-to-face with some total stranger who has,
like me, walked all day from one soup line to the next on dirty,
smelly feet that stretch across the cold, overcrowded floor, just
short of going into someone's mouth for lack of sleeping space.'' _
A.W.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in each story is one man or woman who got through to
the homeless person: A not-yet burnt-out social worker. A volunteer
at Catholic Charities. A staffer at Swords to Plowshares or A
Woman's Place. A Veteran's Administration nurse. A hotel night
clerk. A bag of rags on the next cot in an emergency shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned ``supportive housing,'' and Canon Kip, and
that suggestion led the ``We Are Home Now'' writers to Episcopal
Community Services.
</P>
<P>
   Once accepted and given an apartment, no one's life miraculously
turned around. The struggle to change is slow, hard work. But it's
easier with a room of one's own and people around who know progress
when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning and felt good to be alive. I know that
I can't go back onto the streets. I need help, and this is the
place where I can get it.'' _ C.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless the fact that I am able to acknowledge in my right
mind the life I have so much detested ... God bless the chance this
place is giving me to do what is right without diverting off
path.'' _ P.B.

TWO COURT RULINGS GIVE MEANING TO THE WORD `JUSTICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At first glance, neither appears a matter of much
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares if some boxing trainer is stiffed by his top fighter?
And who cares if a bunch of cops out on the town raise a little
hell? Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both are fairly big deals, however. That's because what happened
in these two court cases demonstrates that our legal system,
despite all its inane complexities and black-robed aloofness, is
essentially designed to see that the right thing gets done.
</P>
<P>
   The system exists for a reason _ to keep those with money and
power from riding roughshod over everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   As the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
said, ``The law is not an end in itself, nor does it provide ends.
It is preeminently a means to serve what we think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, anybody sensible would be hard pressed not to conclude
that the New York Court State of Appeals did the right thing the
other day. By a 4-1 ruling, this state's highest court ruled that
multimillionaire Mike Tyson, who promised that Kevin Rooney would
be his trainer for his whole career, has to keep his word _ or, at
least, cough up some money in compensation. The ruling was more
arcane than that, but that's what it boils down to.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals ruled that the intent of contract law in
New York is to ensure that a deal remains a deal, that a handshake
is worth as much as an agreement engraved in stone and that movie
producer Sam Goldwyn was simply wrong when he said that, ``An oral
contract isn't worth the paper it's written on.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is good news to Kevin Rooney to the tune of several
million bucks, even though his legal fight will go on for a while
in another court. That ruling is good news for the rest of us, too.
</P>
<P>
   It tells us, as the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black
once wrote, that the courts stand against any winds that blow as
havens of refuge for those who would otherwise suffer injustice
because they're not as rich or powerful as the people doing them
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the same day, another state appeals court issued
another ruling that sends a related and equally important message.
The City of Schenectady and its police union had refused to release
the names of a squad of cops who'd behaved like goons at a bachelor
party, getting tanked up and throwing eggs and beer cans at
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   This was a private personnel matter, said the union _ and city
officials supposedly answerable to the public. Sure, these guys are
paid with tax dollars. Sure, these guys are paid to arrest people
who behave the way they behaved. But nobody has a right to know
precisely which Schenectady police officers were involved in this
incident.
</P>
<P>
   That's none of the public's business.
</P>
<P>
   Two newspapers, the Albany Times Union and the Daily Gazette of
Schenectady, sued them for the names and won in that appeals court
decision. Just as the Rooney-Tyson ruling illustrates that the rich
and the non-rich are equal under the law, the decision in the
Schenectady case also illustrates two other rather crucial points
in the relationship between the rulers and the ruled.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the law is more than merely the expression of the
will of those in positions of power at any given moment. And the
other is that nobody has a more sacred obligation to obey the law
than those who enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Who protects the public when it's the police violating the law?
Who polices the police? The independent court system.
</P>
<P>
   And thank God it's there.

   UNDATED _ The more I learn about labor and delivery, the more
I'm convinced that the women who have given birth and the men who
have ``helped'' them belong to some secret society.
</P>
<P>
   They must make you take an oath of silence while you're still in
the delivery room, holding your brand-new bundle of joy, figuring
that at that point, after all you've been through, you'll agree to
anything.
</P>
<P>
   They MUST. If they didn't, it's all that anyone who has gone
through it would ever talk about.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I have completed our birthing classes and patiently
await the Big Event. It's sort of like being trained as a
firefighter and sitting around the station, waiting for the alarm
to ring. You know it's going to. You just don't know when.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us think we have a general idea of where babies come
from. As kids, we start out with the basics: stork, cabbage patch,
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Then we move on to scandalous grade-school gossip for the more
anatomically correct version, which is greeted by shock, outrage
and strong denials, because there is no way any grown-ups _
especially your PARENTS _ could ever engage in something so . . .
so . . . WEIRD. &QL; 
THE TRUTH BEHIND SANTA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walter Crigler was my school's source of information. He knew
everything first; in addition to the baby rumors, he had some
disturbing information about the legitimacy of Santa Claus as well.
Walter would have made a fine reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at least for people my age, we studied sex and birth in
school. The information was taught in such a clinical,
avoid-the-real-issues way that it made conception and delivery
sound about as enticing as changing the oil in your parents' car.
</P>
<P>
   Which was sort of the point, I think.
</P>
<P>
   This was the body of knowledge I was armed with when we began
the classes. Things started out great. Our excellent instructor
asked how much weight the expectant mothers had gained. Answers
varied.
</P>
<P>
   I asked how many partners had gained weight, partly as a joke
and partly as an explanation for my sympathetic belly.
</P>
<P>
   Every single partner raised a hand. One guy had gained 17
POUNDS. He also suffered from morning sickness. I don't want to be
around when he starts getting contractions.
</P>
<P>
   After more discussion and instruction, all of which was
informative and had everyone feeling good about things, we moved on
to . . . the movies. &QL; 
A FINGER ON THE PULSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the car-wreck films shown during driver-education
class, designed to scare impressionable teens into not driving like
maniacs? Compared with birthing movies, those might as well be Bugs
Bunny cartoons. I'm surprised anyone who sees these ever has a
second kid.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the story with the couples in the movies who allow
themselves to be filmed? ALL of themselves, if you get my drift; I
thought I'd have to go to medical school to get such a thorough
look. I don't know if the filmmakers pay the couples, but they
should. A lot. And a little digital technology to change the
identities of the people involved might be nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   I took the instructions to heart despite the feeling that my
role in the actual process will be to stand around and say things
like, ``Breathe!'' every so often and then run for cover. My wife,
who isn't nearly as bewildered about all this as I am, despite
being the one who will have to do all the work, decided I might
feel like a bigger part of things if I volunteered to cut the
umbilical cord after the baby is born. OK, I said, and read up on
how this is done.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh. I wasn't thrilled to learn that the cord can be tough but
was relieved to know that neither the baby nor the mother feels any
pain, so I convinced myself this would be a good plan. Until I read
a passage suggesting you might want to wait to cut the cord _ after
it stops pulsing.
</P>
<P>
   Pulsing? PULSING? Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   The couples who have been through this before, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd never know it. They're not saying anything. &QL;

A PACIFIC LOOK AT THE 20TH CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The century now in its concluding years certainly
was savage and bloody-minded, a time when tyrants or fools reigned
too long, and men and women and the nations in which they lived
suffered grievously.
</P>
<P>
   It is good to be reminded, then, that all was not lost during
these 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   That is what strikes me so much about the fine art exhibit now
on display at the New York State Museum in Albany. It is titled
``Still Life: The Object in American Art, 1915-1995,'' and its 66
paintings reveal the creative power of the artistic imagination
that flourished during the same years that all that savagery was
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, the work of 59 artists, are representative of the
varieties of approaches to art that thrived in this century, which
is one of the striking attractions of this show. You can stand and
view the work of one artist, working in one style, and walk a few
feet further on, to see another artist's esthetic appreciation of a
still life from a much different viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is drawn from the collection of The Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the greatest museum in this country and likely the
world, which attracts nearly 5 million visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Life'' is on display in the State Museum until July 26.
It is here as part of a special series of Great Art Exhibitions, in
which the Met has played the key part.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Life,'' you will find the work of Georgia O'Keefe,
Franz Kline, Stuart Davis, Marsden Hartley, James Rosenquist, Max
Weber and so many others, providing a rich menu of artistic
expressions. These are the painters who contribute heavily to
defining American art of this century.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they have also made a statement, asserting the
quality of American painters, who, it seems to me, tend to be not
appreciated to the extent that they should be. This exhibit reveals
them in all their creative glory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the striking contrasts of the ``Still Life'' show is one
work by George Grosz, a German painter renowned for his bitter
caricatures of the post-World War I German state. With the rise of
Nazism, he emigrated to American and lived and worked here for 27
years. His contribution to the State Museum show is titled ``Still
Life with Walnuts,'' which vastly differs in outlook and execution
from the biting satire that had been the hallmark of his work in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Art Exhibitions not only will continue to host
exhibits from the Metropolitan Museum. Next year, two important
shows are already scheduled, one drawn from the Museum of Modern
Art and the other from the Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   These exhibits are worth your time and effort to go to see them.
They will make you feel better about yourself and the times in
which you have lived.

A BOOK SCOUT WHO BEATS THE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DONALD G. SMITH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ Rollie is a book scout. He buys old books
and sells them to dealers. Book scouts, as they say in the
business, buy from the dumb and sell to the smart.
</P>
<P>
   I met him at least 10 years ago. I have seen him no more than a
half-dozen times since then and really don't know him all that
well. Rollie has beaten The System. He has no office, no employees
and no forms to complete. He works his own hours.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a business for everyone. A book scout starts with a
solid education in literature and then spends a long apprenticeship
learning the book business; reading catalogs and periodicals;
becoming familiar with obscure publishing houses, past and present;
becoming acquainted with dealers in various cities, and knowing
what they are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The daily routine includes visits to used-book stores, thrift
shops, swap meets and garage sales, always on the lookout for that
jewel on the bottom of the pile.
</P>
<P>
   He deals entirely in cash. I have no idea of his arrangement
with the Internal Revenue Service _ and I don't want to know. Armed
only with superior knowledge, he starts usually around mid-morning
and works about a four-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   His base of operations is Los Angeles, but he travels to San
Francisco at least once a month and makes an annual ``New
York-Boston run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollie has sometimes been compared with a professional gambler,
but this is a false impression of a book scout. Rollie never risks
anything. He buys only books that are going to bring a higher
price, often only a block or two away. The worst that can happen is
a day with little or no profit.
</P>
<P>
   He insists on total independence. He has no bank account and no
credit cards. Whenever he can't pay in cash, he uses a cashier's
check. He gets around by bus or cab. He doesn't own a car, which
means no driver's license, no vehicle registration and no
automobile insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He has no money invested _ where he stores his cache is a matter
for conjecture. I remember one occasion when a man said that it was
wise to have one's money invested and ``working for you.'' Rollie's
answer was that when financial transactions are recorded, the money
can only work against you.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when we had a lot of Rollies in this country.
There were independent farmers, itinerant peddlers, circuit-riding
preachers and traveling craftsmen who could fix anything that
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are mostly gone. We are left with a nation of people
who exist only in the depths of a giant computer and whose lives
are controlled from the darkness of that well.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Rollie is such a rarity. He has beaten the system
because he isn't a part of it.

PINK FLAMINGOS FLY BACK INTO FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although they don't actually fly north for the
summer, pink flamingos have been somewhat popular lawn ornaments
since the 1920s and hold sway, along with elves, frogs, fawns,
toadstools and rabbits, among the various commercial lawn oddities
and decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn ornaments aren't really new. They actually date back to the
ancient Romans, who would set up altars to pagan gods.
</P>
<P>
   But come summer in America, it's time to get out the pink
flamingos, statues of large, tropical wading birds that,
historically, began appearing on lawns and in gardens as early as
the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Early flamingos were made of bronze and were expensive, compared
to today's hollow pink plastic version that costs approximately $10
a pair (one with head up and one with head down) at Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   The English were fond of using stone statuary of animals in
their 19th-century gardens.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and 1930s, lawn flamingos were made of concrete,
which can still be bought for about $58.99 per bird. Some of these
leggy versions also came in enamel-painted plywood cutouts, and
then foam, but dogs tended to chew the latter.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s, the pink statues were created from plastic and
began appearing on the front lawns of modest American homes,
especially those in areas that lacked natural fauna.
</P>
<P>
   As new housing developments and mobile home parks flourished
after World War II, so did the lawn ornament industry, producing
gnomes and other cutesy critters or folksy images.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, Florida was becoming a major vacation and
retirement destination, and the hot pink plastic flamingo lawn
ornament a must-see souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   The three-dimensional hollow plastic version of the bird,
featuring long straight black legs to stick into the ground, was
designed in 1957 by Don Featherstone, who designed them for Union
Products in Leominster, Mass., a lawn-ornaments manufacturer. (The
company had already been producing two-dimensional plastic pink
flamingos.) More than 20 million of Featherstone's pink flamingos
have been sold since then.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, plastic pink flamingos were persona non
grata, except among those who love kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   But they winged their way back toward mainstream America in the
late 1980s, when retro became hip. Plastic pink flamingos are
available at many garden and lawn centers.

   PIXEL-MYSPACE (Seattle) _ If Microsoft Windows were a religion,
a core belief would be that the computer screen and the Windows
desktop are nearly the same thing: The desktop fills the screen and
displays everything the user needs to know. Time for some heresy,
Seattle software designer Tom O'Rourke says. O'Rourke's new

desktop for a new control bar called MySpace that is separate from
Microsoft Windows and can launch applications, find Internet
content and control devices such as CD and DVD players.

   BANKS-CROSS-SELLING (Undated) _ ``Cross-selling'' is the new
mantra of the financial services business. The gargantuan
combination of banker Citicorp and insurer Travelers is predicated
upon the idea that the way to survive and thrive is to offer every
type of money product under one roof. The NationsBank-BankAmerica
combination is similarly designed to provide a coast-to-coast
retailer of financial products.

SET YOUR TABLE WITH SUMMERTIME HUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's the summer season and to many that means
eating alfresco around the swimming pool, on the patio or deck.
This is the perfect time to have fun with colorful dishes and
whimsical patterns.
</P>
<P>
   You can create a nautical theme to one with a woodsy flavor or
vibrant artistic one with custom hand-painted earthenware.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to experiment, but if you are the timid type,
don't fret. Tabletop designers have color coordinated most of
today's selections, so that you can't make a color faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our designs are exclusive to Pier I Imports, said
Kimberly Chaumont, company buyer for picnic and poolside products.
``Everything is based on being able to be mixed and matched, so
that you can play and have fun with shapes, patterns and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaumont added that through their research, consumers want a
more upscale look in acrylics and pieces that can be used inside as
well as outside, as acrylics have become a year-round business.
</P>
<P>
   ``To meet this request, we have added aluminum stems and sleeve
to many of the acrylic tumblers, wine and martini glasses,''
Chaumont said. ``This is our third year to repeat our petal shaped
dishes. Don't worry about the hot bright colors you may be buying
this year, because those colors will continue through the spring of
1999. So you will still be able to add on and coordinate future
purchases with those that you may make this year.''
</P>
<P>
   By mixing and matching, you don't have to worry about buying a
whole set of dishes at once, you can add on from one season to the
next, as your budget allows. Most dishes are sold individually as
open stock, while pricer dishes are often sold as sets. Even still,
you can often buy serving platters, sugar and creamers, salt and
peppers and serving bowls separately. Mixing colors, patterns and
shapes makes for a most interesting table.
</P>
<P>
   There is a myriad of patterns and shapes from which to choose to
produce a fun and festive table setting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides solid or frosted colors in bright, jewel and pastel
hues, there are gingham, polka dot, stripe, floral, geometric,
fruit, vegetable and artistic hand-painted designs.
</P>
<P>
   Each store may put its own spin on a place setting, but with
careful shopping, you should be able to produce a variety of
colorful and patterned mixtures in various shapes, whether it be in
acrylic, stoneware, porcelain, melamine, ceramic, earthenware,
enameled tinware, glass or polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always read the directions for the type dishes you are
buying,'' Chaumont said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our acrylic pieces are dishwasher safe and should hold up for
about five years, before showing some wear and tear. In time,
injected acrylic colored plates may begin to crack and get cloudy.
Anything that is hand-painted should always be hand washed to
preserve its design. Polypropylene plates, knives, forks and spoons
are very durable and should exhibit no signs of color fading. You
should also be careful with picnic and poolside dishes, as many of
these are not suitable for the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   Patio dishes feature a large dinner plate, salad/dessert plate,
cereal/soup bowl, mug and demitasse cup and saucer. By shopping
around you can also find decorative chargers (large service plate
under the dinner plate), in metalics or matching acrylic hues.
Frosted glass chargers can be found at Pier 1 for $20, although
they must be hand washed and $20 earthenware chargers in clay red,
royal blue and teal that are dishwasher safe.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 1's acrylic flower picnicware is $2.50 to $4 each for
8-inch and 12-inch plates and an 8-inch bowl, $3.50 to $4 each for
matching drinkware, which includes a Margarita, goblet, tumbler and
double old fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition there are festive acrylic martini shakers for $10
and corkscew stemware for $4 each. Lending a more formal touch are
aluminum stemmed martini and goblet drinkware with acrylic tops for
$6.50 each. In keeping with the formal look, there are 24 ounce
acrylic tumblers with removable aluminum sleeves for $8.
</P>
<P>
   Colored acrylic trays can be found at Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond for
$7.50 each and matching beverage pitcher for $12.99. The chain
store also carries a colorful selection of Melmanine, which is
suitable for the dishwasher but not the microwave. A 21-inch
platter is $6.99, 10-inch dinner plate $2.99, 7-inch salad and a
soup/cereal for $2.19 and serving bowl for $3.99. All of the dishes
can be paired up with a four-piece set of plastic flatware for 99
cents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whimsey and country elegance can be added to the table with
earthy stoneware plates.
</P>
<P>
   When considering price and dining out of doors, diversity can
also be found by purchasing one inexpensive set for breakfast, tea
or dessert and a different set for dinner and lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Or supplement a new fun set of dishes by using your good china
or antique plates for dessert. Better yet, serve each course with a
different pattern or color.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's acrylic dishes can also be paired up with
coordinating paper plates, which are cost effective as well as
saving on clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   Before rushing out to buy new dishes, it's always best to take
an inventory of what you have and build upon it, just like you
would with your wardrobe.

ONE WAY AROUND WINDOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Microsoft Windows were a religion, a core belief
would be that the computer screen and the Windows desktop are
nearly the same thing: The desktop fills the screen and displays
everything the user needs to know.
</P>
<P>
   Time for some heresy, Seattle software designer Tom O'Rourke
says.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke's new venture, The Pixel Co., unveiled technology
Monday that uses the dark border at the edge of the desktop for a
new control bar called MySpace that is separate from Microsoft
Windows and can launch applications, find Internet content and
control devices such as CD and DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting technology,'' said analyst Bob Sakakeeny of The
Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``We can't think of anything that comes
close.''
</P>
<P>
   If it wins market acceptance, MySpace might loosen Microsoft's
lock on the PC screen. And it could lob a new rock into the pond of
legal, technological, political and economic issues surrounding
Microsoft that led to the federal antitrust lawsuits filed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   While supporting Microsoft's key legal claim that the software
industry is rich with innovation, MySpace could give computer
makers something the government says they lack _ non-Microsoft ways
to customize their machines. It also undermines claims by
Microsoft's critics that the Redmond company stifles innovation by
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a case where a small company did something that Sun,
Oracle and Netscape all said couldn't be done, and that's get
around the Microsoft franchise,'' said Rob Enderle, an industry
analyst with the Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new, it's fresh, it's different,'' said Martin Mortensen
of The Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a piece of technology that basically shows that Microsoft
isn't that dominant, that they do allow other technologies to come
up to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the company couldn't comment
because it hadn't yet seen the MySpace technology.
</P>
<P>
   At Ark Interface II, Pixel's parent company, O'Rourke has
specialized in software that sits atop the Windows operating system
to give users what he believes are easier ways to find files and
programs.

   Ark developed a program called Navigator (older than and
completely different from the Internet browser made by Netscape
Communications) that employed a home metaphor similar to that of
Microsoft's short-lived ``Bob'' project.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell liked Navigator so much that it first licensed
Navigator to install on its machines, then purchased Ark Interface
in 1994. Over time, however, Microsoft's efforts to standardize the
Windows experience made it more difficult for computer makers to
offer shell programs like Navigator, O'Rourke said.

<P>
   The MySpace project was born 15 months ago, he said, when, in a
fit of frustration, he noticed a picture-in-picture display on his
television and wondered if the same thing couldn't be done on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said, `You can't go there,''' O'Rourke said. He
begged to differ, gradually persuading colleagues that it would be
possible to use the dark territory outside the desktop, called the
overscan area, to deliver new features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken over that dead space and built a little kernel of
an operating system that lets it have some functionality,'' said
Lora Loftis, Pixel's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   That's a key point: MySpace isn't an application that runs on
top of Windows, it's a separate system.
</P>
<P>
   It can launch Windows applications, but it could just as easily
launch some other operating system _ Linux, Unix, or an eventual
Java OS, O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a space where other companies can offer their
content to computer users in partnership with Pixel and the
computer makers, instead of or in addition to partnering with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   An entertainment company, for example, could put buttons on the
MySpace control bar that connected people directly to its Web sites
for books or television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ark Interface II spun off The Pixel Co. last year. The two were
recently sold by the parent company, now called Packard Bell NEC,
the fourth-largest PC vendor in the United States and the
fifth-largest in the world, according to International Data Corp.
It shipped 2.8 million units in the United States last year and 4.2
million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC plans to offer MySpace on new Packard Bell
machines and NEC's consumer line, called Ready, in the near future,
though not on its first Windows 98 machines, said Mal Ransom,
senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technology that makes sense,'' Ransom said. ``When you
see it, you think, why did it take somebody so long to discover it?
But the market will have to speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Enderle said MySpace offered computer makers a way to make their
products stand out in the marketplace, while Sakakeeny noted that
the legal and political attention focused on Microsoft may work to
Pixel's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is pretty good for acceptance of a product like
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both analysts echoed Ransom's cautionary note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest struggle is not for them to do a good job creating
the product, it's getting the product accepted,'' Sakakeeny said.
``That's not an easy feat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens a number of doors,'' Enderle said. ``The question is
whether (software) developers will take advantage of them....
</P>
<P>
   ``In reviewing the people they have on board, I certainly think
there's a reasonable chance they can do this,'' he said. ``But it's
by no means a slam dunk.''

CROSS-SELLING THE NEW MANTRA OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have a checking account with one bank, a credit card with
another, a car loan from the credit union, a home loan from the
mortgage company, insurance from the local agent and mutual funds
from half a dozen investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you really prefer to buy all your financial services
from one company, much like you buy all your food from a single
grocery store?
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say? You don't mind dealing with half a dozen
different companies for your savings, investments and credit
accounts?
</P>
<P>
   Gee, that's too bad. Those banks, brokerages and insurance
companies are really, really counting on talking you into one-stop
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-selling'' is the new mantra of the financial services
business. The gargantuan combination of banker Citicorp and insurer
Travelers is predicated upon the idea that the way to survive and
thrive is to offer every type of money product under one roof. The
NationsBank-BankAmerica combination is similarly designed to
provide a coast-to-coast retailer of financial products.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot of debate over how successful financial
services companies will be at cross-selling _ and whether consumers
will accept one-stop-shopping for mutual funds and car loans the
way they do for hamburger, lettuce and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Financial companies have some solid strategic reasons for hoping
consumers buy into cross-selling. It costs less to sell an
additional product to an existing customer than to recruit a new
one. Deanna Oppenheimer, executive vice president for consumer
banking at Seattle-based Washington Mutual Inc., said there's a 30
percent likelihood that a customer who buys one type of product or
service will still be with the bank two to three years later; that
jumps to 75 percent when the customer has three products or
services.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there's a big difference between knowing the importance
of cross-selling and doing a good job of it. In the past,
cross-selling meant dumping thousands of pieces of junk mail on
customers and hoping someone would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most banks don't have a clue'' how to cross-sell effectively,
said Todd Gurley, senior vice president with Aragon Consulting
Group in St. Louis. ``They haven't spent time over the last 10
years building databases or talking to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another failed attempt at cross-selling was the ``financial
supermarkets'' banks set up in the 1980s to offer not just banking
but discount brokerage services, insurance, even travel agencies,
often literally all under one roof. Customers seemed perfectly
content to shop around and, by the early 1990s, the concept had
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   What's different this time, industry executives say, is that the
approach is much more tailored to customer interests.
</P>
<P>
   For banks like Washington Mutual, the strategy starts with a
checking account. While customers can and do hop among credit cards
and certificates of deposit, ``If you've ever tried to dislodge
yourself from a bank, it's a painful process,'' Gurley said.
``There are real barriers to changing. There are real opportunities
for banks, if they get their acts together, to market one-stop
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the most of those opportunities, banks want to get close
to their customers, building relationships off that first account.
That runs counter to the industry trend in which, because of
cost-cutting, customers are being pushed more and more to
impersonal contacts like automated teller machines and telephone
and computer banking.
</P>
<P>
   The way the banks hope to reverse the trend is to mine the
mountains of data about their customers sitting in their computer
files _ data collected on home loan, credit card and insurance
applications, for example.
</P>
<P>
   By knowing more about their customers, banks can tell who might
be demographically ready for a home loan, who is about to finish
paying off a loan and might be in the mood to divert that money to
an investment account. Said Gurley, ``It's not junk mail if you're
interested in it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Washington Mutual, the job of cross-selling starts when a
customer opens an account. ``We talk about other products and
services, and as we have special offers we have mailings, and the
branch folks will call to follow up,'' Oppenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   KeyCorp has a database management system it says will analyze
its 8 million customer households and allow ``our sales force to
focus on the most profitable relationships and sales.'' The idea,
said Barrie Macdonald, senior vice president for retailing banking
at KeyCorp's Seattle-Bellevue district, is to move from being the
supplier of a single account to becoming ``the trusted adviser for
all of those (financial) products.''
</P>
<P>
   To make cross-selling work, banks will have to overcome several
obstacles. One is the reluctance on the part of customers to become
overly chummy with their banker or broker, particularly when it
comes to the details of their finances.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of The Privacy Times, a Washington, D.C.,
newsletter, said customers may not understand the amount of data
about them being shared by the various divisions of financial
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of an information arms race going on,'' he said.
That arms race can be expected to escalate as companies compile
files on customers not only from what they've already got but add
information from outside databases. Consumers _ and regulators _
are also likely to be unhappy about the sharing of sensitive health
information compiled by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said a national policy should require financial
companies to tell consumers why data are being collected and to
seek permission for those uses.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service companies say they are aware of the potential
objections. Oppenheimer said Washington Mutual's system is set up
so that if customers say they don't want solicitations, the account
can be flagged so it doesn't happen. The system also limits the
number of mailings a customer will get from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not overmail our customers,'' she said. ``We think
it's important from both the bank's and the customer's perspective
that you don't overuse that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual also says it won't sell its customer lists.
``We're very protective of keeping customer confidentiality within
the bank,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other potential stumbling block to cross-selling is the same
one that waylaid the financial supermarket _ customers may prefer
to shop on their own, particularly if they believe they can get
better deals by buying from more than one source.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal preference is to seek out each specific objective
from all available sources,'' Shorewood investor Patrick Haugen
said. He likens it to shopping for plants and gardening tools: The
local discount store may carry some along with the auto parts,
school supplies and clothing, but there's a far better selection at
the local nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same applies to all financial products,'' Haugen added.
``There is a `best' checking account, another `best' credit card,
another assortment of mutual funds that provide the mix I seek, and
another selection for stocks and a broker. It may be time-consuming
but that is how I would desire to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research has shown probably a quarter of customers are
disposed to buy all of their financial services from one source,''
said Bob Dickey, president of Safeco Corp., the Seattle-based
insurance and mutual fund company which says it isn't interested in
offering every type of financial product.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the financial services industry believe there are
plenty of customers who do like the convenience of one-stop
shopping, particularly if they trust the person they deal with
regularly or trust the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people lead very busy lives juggling jobs and families.
It sure would be easier for them if they could depend on one source
to provide them with the financial services they would require,''
investor William Crotteau said.
</P>
<P>
   But Crotteau and other consumers are wary that ``insurance and
financial services are so very different that it would be difficult
for an organization to offer quality products and services under
one roof.'' Banking and investment services themselves are so
different, he added, that finding a company adept at both would
also be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see one difficulty in having one-stop financial services
competing with those companies offering only one, and that is the
big guy gobbling up the small one,'' said investor Peggy Kramer of
Port Ludlow. ``I do believe in competition in the marketplace.''

BAPTISTS MAKE FORAY INTO UTAH: MORMONS, VISITORS `AGREE TO
DISAGREE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A much-ballyhooed Southern Baptist effort to
evangelize Mormons, which began over the weekend and is continuing
this week, has so far been a peaceful exchange of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been some rough spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to disagree, and we did it agreeably,'' said Rob
Lee, a Utah Baptist official who was one of more than 2,000
Southern Baptists who went door-to-door in this area, which is
believed to be more than 50 percent Mormon, during an evangelistic
blitz Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptists' Crossover Salt Lake City campaign
includes block parties, sports clinics and advertising through
billboards, radio and TV spots and newspaper ads. It will continue
on a smaller scale throughout the national Southern Baptist
Convention, which officially begins Tuesday and continues through
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 young people from the First Baptist Church of
Euless, Texas, participated in Crossover events or served as
greeters at the weekend Pastors Conference. The Rev. Claude Thomas,
First Baptist's pastor, is president of the Pastors Conference, one
of the Southern Baptists' pre-convention events.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Baptist videos and books about Mormons state that
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a non-Christian
cult, the Mormons have generally have been amicable to the visiting
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Banners at the airport declared, ``Welcome Southern Baptist
Convention _ Exalting the Unchanging Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Mormons said they are perturbed that Baptists are
saying the Latter-day Saints are not Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are really Christian, you don't judge people,'' said
Tricia Larson, a longtime Mormon who was visited in her suburban
home below the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains by Baptists. ``Calling
us a cult and not Christian is not a Christian thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson's son, Scott, 16, said he was taken aback when one young
Baptist approached him while he was working at a downtown Salt Lake
City restaurant Saturday and gave him a comic book about Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that the comic book was the most important thing I
would ever read,'' Scott Larson said. ``He was a nice guy, but I'm
already a believer. So I thought he was kind of a nut case for
saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Chirban, 46, the Larsons' next-door neighbor, who is an
inactive member of the Greek Orthodox Church, said he was glad to
see the Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see somebody come by besides Mormons,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime Mormon, Don Uhlmer, 65, said he and the Baptist
evangelizers had a friendly dialogue. But he readily concedes that
the two faiths have a different view of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jesus Christ we believe in is not the same one the
Baptists believe in,'' he said. ``And I guess we could say Baptists
aren't Christians because of that. But I don't think that's
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was one of the Baptists who visited the Larsons,
Chirbans and Ulmers, said Baptists don't want to be argumentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just here to sell the love of Jesus Christ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists reported scores of professions of faith during the
weekend blitz, including some by Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign by the nation's biggest Protestant denomination is
being carried out among some 1.6 million people who live in the
metropolitan area known as the Wasatch Front, extending along the
mountains from Ogden, Utah, on the north through Salt Lake City to
Provo. Surveys indicate that more than 50 percent of residents in
the area are Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 to 12,000 Baptists are expected to attend the
convention at the Salt Palace, just a few yards from the soaring
Mormon Temple, the symbolic center of 10 million Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Paige Patterson, who is expected to be elected
president of the Southern Baptists this week, said he had met with
two of the Mormon church's highest-ranking members, Neal A.
Maxwell, one of the 12 Mormon apostles, and James E. Faust, who
ranks just below Mormon president Gordon B. Hinkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We differed on many things _ for instance, we don't believe we
can become gods as the Mormons do _ but our meeting was mostly
friendly. We talked about what we agree on, such as the need to
support families and fight pornography,'' said Patterson, who is
president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.

 &HT;     LEADERS OF U.S. REFORM JEWS RETURN TO FIGHT ISRAELI PROPOSAL ON
CONVERSIONS
 &HT;     By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Standing behind police barricades at the holy site
of the Western Wall, American leaders in the less-traditional,
Reform branch of Judaism Monday opposed an Israeli proposal on
religious conversions that they say is an attempt to
``de-legitimize'' their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a slap in the face to Diaspora Jewry,'' said Eric
Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations
(UAHC).
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement with police, Yoffie's group held a short prayer
ceremony behind portable police railings far from the Western Wall,
one of Judaism's most holy places.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, men and women from the less traditional Reform and
Conservative branches of Judaism, even when far away on the plaza
facing the wall, have had things thrown at them by Orthodox Jews
who object to men and women praying together.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony went peacefully Monday, with only a few
disapproving Orthodox Jews even looking on at the Reform
worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be Jewish, you should be Jewish. Not 50-50,''
said Eliyakeem Gobay, a 23-year-old Orthodox Jew. ``Israel is
Jewish. It's not America.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie and more than 100 rabbis and members of Reform
congregations came to the Western Wall directly from the airport at
the start of a week-long attempt to dissuade Israeli leaders from
passing the so-called Conversion Law that is inflaming many
long-time Israel supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox advocates of the law seek to derail cases in Israel's
supreme court in which non-Jews, who converted to Reform and
Conservative Judaism, have sought to be recognized as Jewish by the
Israeli government's religious authorities.
</P>
<P>
   They have not been recognized by the country's religious affairs
ministry because of policies that only recognize conversions under
Orthodox Jewish rabbis, with much more strict adherence to Jewish
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Religious members in the coalition of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu have threatened to bring down his government if
it does not elevate the current policies into national law _
roughly the current proposal.
</P>
<P>
   That would short-circuit the court cases and, according to many,
end efforts to loosen up the religious influence on the country's
laws governing conversions, weddings, funerals and just who is
considered Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox leaders have argued that the policies are needed to
make clear who is truly Jewish and to retain the Jewish nature of
Israel's culture and laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and Conservative leaders agreed to postpone the court
case in the winter in order to seek a compromise, but now the case
is resurfacing in the courts again. Most American Jews are either
Reform or Conservative and they have been outraged at what they
consider an Israeli snub.
</P>
<P>
   This group has meetings scheduled this week with Israeli
officials, including Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position will always be one for religious pluralism in
Israel,'' said Russell Silverman, of Coral Gables, Fla., who is
treasurer of the UAHC. ``There will be a groundswell of resentment
against the (Israeli) government if this passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Al Riesenburger, of Columbus, Ga., and member of the UAHC
board: ``They can't help but listen to us. We're here to let them
know we represent 900 congregations with more than a million
members.''

THE VIEW FROM ABOVE CALLS FOR A PERFECT CALIFORNIA SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I took a daylong flight across Northern
California last week for a firsthand look at the land, lakes and
streams, a preview of the coming summer for camping, hiking,
boating and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice is how there is still an overall look
of greenness to the foothills in the San Francisco Bay area, rare
for June. Then you can see how full the lakes are, all 75 of them
(including 25 that are off-limits to the public), with Lake
Berryessa east of Napa the most dramatic, huge and blue-green, with
silver trails from power boats streaking across the surface.
</P>
<P>
   We popped over the hills and toward the vast Central Valley, and
while the golden tint of summer is just now taking over here, there
are still countless pockets of water, ponds and flooded rice
fields, the latter green from fresh sprouts. I've never seen so
much wetland habitat in California, and I believe duck nesting
success will be among the best this spring and early summer in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   I leveled the plane off at an altitude of 11,500 feet, set
cruise settings and trimmed for level flight, and charged toward
the Sierra at 185 mph. In the foothills near Grass Valley, looking
north, I could see 125 miles across the mountain ranges all the way
to Mount Shasta, and to the south, past the Sierra Buttes to the
peaks south of Lake Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   I banked the plane, dropping the right wing, then slowly turned
to the east, scanning hundreds of miles of public recreation lands,
a piece of the 20 millions acres of national forest in the state.
Looking down across the mountain country, you can see why the
coming summer has the chance to be the best ever for outdoor
recreation in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   From Mount Whitney on past Tahoe all the way to Mount Shasta,
the snow line is roughly 7,000 to 7,200 feet on north-facing
slopes, 6,000 to 6,500 on south-facing slopes. Directly under snow
line, from 3,000 to 6,000 feet in the alpine zone, spring is just
arriving, with blooming dogwood and wildflowers, and ferns
unrolling like they're reaching for the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week as summer advances and the snow line recedes
into higher country, it will unveil fresh, spring-like conditions,
perfect for camping, hiking, boating and fishing. This is a rare
treasure, the chance to experience spring over and over again as
the high country emerges from a colossal winter.
</P>
<P>
   By my calculations, for instance, you will have the chance to
see spring as late as August in the 10,000 to 12,500-foot country
north of Mount Whitney, in the John Muir and Golden Trout
wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the Bay-area foothills, it is stunning to see how
full the lakes now are, one after another, everywhere you look ...
Union Valley, Englebright, Oroville, Bullards Bar, French Meadows
and beyond to the north of Bucks, Almanor, Eagle and Shasta. The
only lake that didn't appear full was Folsom Lake near Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   I checked later with Jeff McCracken at the Bureau of Reclamation
and he said space is being reserved for emergency storage, in case
of hot weather and a flood of snowmelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at 96 percent capacity across Northern California right
now, and there's so much water entering the lakes that we could
fill everything to 100 percent overnight if we wanted to,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   California has 373 lakes you can drive to, 483 significant lakes
you can hike to, most all with campgrounds, and the forecast is for
all lakes to be full with water throughout summer. As water is
released from dams, it will be replaced at about the same rate by
water from melting snow.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down at Yosemite National Park, Half Dome dominates the
landscape. In the high country, Tuolumne Meadows at 8,000 feet has
about a foot of snow left, and it's going fast. But in shaded
canyons, such as Dana Meadow, there's still six feet.
</P>
<P>
   The air was lucky smooth, so I could cruise the plane up and
down canyons, often a source of lifting air and turbulence. From
the Sierra to the Central Valley, every stream in these canyons was
charging full, many pig-ugly brown from such high runoff, with the
Bear River the most off-color of all.
</P>
<P>
   California has 185 major streams, many with a dozen tributaries,
and almost everywhere you look, they are still running bank-to-bank
with high, cold water. While that has wiped out the trout season in
May, it means conditions will be great in July and even August
during the vacation season, a time when streams are typically
reduced to a warm trickle.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Plumas County, I turned a full 360-degree circle
over the Sierra Buttes, and looked down and saw that many of the
high-country wilderness lakes are still frozen, yet starting to
thin. Gold Lake near Graegle, for instance, had signs of thinning
ice near the outlet at the dam.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled as I looked down at nearby Mount Elwell, 7,812 feet
elevation, and the dozens of lakes at different stages of meltoff
in the surrounding Lakes Basin Recreation Area. Yeah, I thought, it
won't be long and it will be perfect here, and I dreamed of the
coming summer day when I'll be standing on that mountain top.

WASHINGTON: A FINE PLACE TO RAISE FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They love to beat up on Washington here in the
state capital. For that matter, they love to beat up on Washington
in Washington. But when it comes to raising money, there's no place
like the land of the gilded Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and his Democratic challenger in the
gubernatorial race, Garry Mauro, both have Washington fund-raisers
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's invitation touts a June 23 ``reception with President
Bill Clinton/Dinner with First Lady Hillary Clinton'' at the
Sheraton Carlton. The event also features players in the Clinton
White House's controversial fund-raising past.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm handling the invitation is Mercer and
Associates, a D.C. firm headed by David Mercer, former deputy
finance director at the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer was once caught on an MSNBC hidden camera offering
big-time White House access for big-time bucks. A 1997 Los Angeles
Times piece said that ``the going price, according to Mercer, for a
seat next to then-White House aide George Stephanopoulos (was):
`100 to half a million.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Erica Payne, the Mercer employee hired by the Mauro campaign
to handle the event, was identified in 1997 congressional testimony
as the aide who probably prepared a memo showing ``projected
revenue'' and money ``raised to date'' stemming from one of those
White House coffee gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee klatches led to accusations that Clinton used the
White House as a fund-raising tool.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro campaign manager Billy Rogers said that discussing Payne
and the White House fund-raising controversy in the same sentence
is below the belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erica has an excellent reputation. She's worked in Texas for
five years raising money for the Democratic Party,'' he said.
``These are good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Donors will shell out $5,000 for both the reception and dinner,
and $1,000 for the reception only.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush is holding two fund-raisers June 18. Ticket
prices range from $500 a person for a reception at the Willard
Hotel to $10,000 a couple for dinner at the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The events rely heavily on deep connections to Bush's father.
Among those helping to organize the event are President George
Bush's White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray; his ex-spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater; and his erstwhile top campaign hand Fred Malek.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush, who has a campaign war chest approaching $15
million from donors all over the country, said it's natural to
raise out-of-state money; he figures that non-Texas dough will end
up composing 15 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who live outside the state who
understand how important it is for the governor's office in Texas
to be held by a fellow like me,'' Bush said. They may also be
thinking that now is a good time to get in good with a potential
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that it ``should not surprise you that mutual friends
of mine and my dad's are supporting me. The best kind of support to
have is from friends. They don't have unusual expectations.''

DECADES AFTER HIS DEATH, MAHLER RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Gustav Mahler had not come along to give
artistic utterance to our contemporary dilemmas, we might have been
forced to invent him.
</P>
<P>
   What other composer so mirrors the anxieties of a world he left
87 years ago? What other musician so eloquently reflects the doubt
and despair of a planet on the brink of the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Since Mahler's death we've experienced two world wars, the
threat of nuclear annihilation, the advent of Freudian psychology
and other scientific theories that have nibbled away at our notion
of free will. In that time, the composer's popularity has soared.
His was music once deemed protracted, difficult, neurotic and not
quite healthy, in keeping with the expressionist fervor sweeping
the arts at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the last 35 years have witnessed among American orchestras
a frequency of performances of Mahler symphonies and song cycles
that makes the previous 50 years' treatment seem inconsequential.
Record companies now produce Mahler symphony cycles the way they
used to dash off Beethoven Fifths; the current Opus catalog lists
41 performances of Mahler's Symphony No. 2 alone, and that is not
an easy project to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   The Symphony No. 5 was once an event. In 1998, it is not
uncommon to find it programmed in the same community four or five
times a season, by different orchestras _ as much as, if not more
than, Beethoven's ``Eroica.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the San Francisco Symphony and its music director, Michael
Tilson Thomas, will not risk alienating the paying customers when
they launch their 17-day Mahler Celebration Thursday in Davies
Symphony Hall. One is hard-pressed to name another composer who
evokes a greater response in the conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Why audiences have fallen under the spell, despite Mahler's
often mammoth structures, his dense counterpoint and his allusions
to obscurities of Teutonic folklore, is simple. People love Mahler
because he is ``about something'' and his music ``goes somewhere.''
His symphonies trace an arc that always, even in the gentle Fourth
Symphony, flirts with Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution means either cataclysmic breakdown (in the Sixth
Symphony) or fusion with a vast humanist organism (the Eighth) or
abnegation (the Ninth) or ironic, even hysterical triumph (the
Fifth and Seventh). The search for secular spirituality _ for
communion with an enigmatic universe _ is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, we love Mahler too much. Perhaps, we have made of him
an auditory mood ring. Perhaps, we have imposed the values of our
own age upon him to the extent of altering the shape of the music.
The contemporary emphasis on ``feelings'' _ ours, rather than the
composer's _ may have pushed us, listeners as well as interpreters,
to sentimentalize and inflate Mahler, sometimes to the point of
fulsomeness.
</P>
<P>
   It seems peculiar to discuss authentic performance practice in
connection with a composer who has been dead less than a century.
But Mahler's leading champions among conductors, Bruno Walter and
Willem Mengelberg, both left us ample evidence about how their
mentor wanted his music to go.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one movement (the most famous in Mahler, thanks, in
part, to countless bad ballets that have used the music) _ the
fourth movement, Adagietto, from the Symphony No. 5, which Tilson
Thomas conducts Friday and Saturday and repeats next season.
Mengelberg's 1929 recording, the music's disc debut, runs 7:04
minutes. Walter, in his 1947 recording of the entire symphony, does
it in 7:35 minutes. Since then, conductors have stretched the
Adagietto like warm taffy. Leonard Bernstein, in his 1987 reading
with the Vienna Philharmonic, jumps to an astonishing 11:13
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1973, Herbert von Karajan, in a remarkable act of
self-communing bravura, elongated the movement to 11:53 minutes,
proof of the Berlin Philharmonic's capacity for sustaining lengthy
phrases but a subversion of the symphony's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   It is Gilbert Kaplan, the renowned Mahler fan and auto-didact
conductor, who comes closest to that first generation of
Mahlerians, dispatching the Adagietto in 7:53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know that performances of most Romantic music have slowed
down in the past century; and while audiences would likely reject
such distentions in Beethoven, they seem not to object in Mahler.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans, I believe, can trace their permissive attitude to
Bernstein. For many, he remains the most ubiquitous and eloquent,
if not the most consistently persuasive, Mahlerian of the past 35
years. And he has contributed substantially to our perception of
the composer. Thus, in the context of a Mahler celebration, Tilson
Thomas' June 19 tribute to Bernstein, in his 80th anniversary year,
seems entirely appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But this country boasted an active Mahler performance tradition
before Bernstein. It was Eugene Ormandy who made the first
electrical recording of the Symphony No. 2 with the Minneapolis
Symphony, in a live performance in 1935 (it's on a Biddulph compact
disc). The same orchestra premiered the Symphony No. 1 on record in
1940 under Dimitri Mitropoulos (Sony Masterworks recently reissued
the performance on CD in its Heritage series).
</P>
<P>
   Mitropoulos, who was Bernstein's predecessor at the New York
Philharmonic, included six of Mahler's completed symphonies on his
subscription programs; four (and two others) are collected in a
fascinating new set on Music &AMP; Arts, an outstanding addition to the
Mahler discography. Mitropoulos' febrile approach was not lost on
Bernstein. And Tilson Thomas extends that lineage.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Mahler tradition, it would seem, personality
sometimes prevails over discretion. We want this musician served up
without inhibition. That can be annoying and understandable, too.
Of all the major symphonists of the 20th century, Mahler is the one
about whom it is the most difficult to remain objective.

THERE IS A LESSON IN INDIAN AND PAKISTANI NUCLEAR MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The wild scenes of popular jubilation we all saw on our
TV screens after India and Pakistan exploded their first nuclear
devices were a strong reminder that the voice of the people can
sometimes be as ugly as that of their rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Being nuclear powers will certainly prove to be an economic
calamity for both countries and could turn into a human catastrophe
as well. The vast numbers of their poor will be the worst affected.
Already there are signs that the huge cost of developing nuclear
arsenals will make life materially harder for hundreds of millions
who even now exist at subsistence level.
</P>
<P>
   But these same impoverished Pakistanis and Indians cheered
loudest when the nuclear explosions were revealed. Both governments
counted on overwhelming domestic approval, and they were right. As
we know, for politicians it's domestic favor, not international
condemnation, that really matters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the American Congress can denounce the New
Delhi and Islamabad regimes as much as they wish and carry out
their threat to cancel much-needed economic assistance. Such
actions will make not a jot of difference.
</P>
<P>
   India is often referred to as the world's largest democracy, but
as Winston Churchill once noted, democracy is a poor political
system except, of course, for all the others.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan also has an elected government. In both cases, almost
no one uttered a word of dissent against the testing initially.
Opposition leaders rushed to endorse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   A political cliche of our era is that democracies don't
instigate wars. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
said that the spread of democracy around the world fundamentally
enhanced the prospects for permanent peace. Thatcher is a wise
person, but she could be proved wrong on the Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s and '60s, India's leaders posed as the world's
moral guides, laying down strictures especially to the United
States and the rest of the supposedly depraved and power-lusting
West. Some gullible American liberals fell for the Indian line.
What they overlooked was that India itself had already engaged in
naked aggression by seizing much of the rich state of Kashmir
before the subcontinent was finally partitioned between newly
independent India and Pakistan in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In a free vote, Kashmir would have joined Pakistan, but the
self-righteous Indians wouldn't allow it. So for 50 years the two
countries have engaged in both hot and cold wars over the contested
territory. Analysts have pointed out that Kashmir is at the root of
both governments' decision to go nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   However, something more is involved. Becoming nuclear powers has
fed their sense of national pride and self-esteem. It's clear that
India's professed moral superiority to the West was good only as
long as New Delhi lacked the technology and resources to build the
bomb. After that, morality became irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't bode well for the future. Other Third World
countries also see a nuclear arsenal as the hallmark of national
greatness. They won't wait long to join India and Pakistan.

   SCI-PLANT-INVASION (Undated) _ Invasive, non-native plants are
out of control in many on the nation's fields, forests, marshes,
stream sides and waterways. The ubiquitous invaders with roots,
leaves, shoots and seeds are running roughshod over native plants,
changing the quality of the soil, water and landscape and wiping
out countless creatures _ from microorganisms to mammals _ that
cannot withstand the onslaught. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOLAR-NEUTRINOS (Undated) _ Just as the neutrino conference
in Japan seemed to clear up one mystery, it raised another: The
same team claiming the existence of neutrino mass may have also
cast doubt on the most elegant version of the changing-flavor
hypothesis, in favor of an alternative that many theorists find
ugly and contrived. The dispute is far from resolved. Gathering and
interpreting data about these particles is among the most delicate
and frustrating challenges of physics. For all the excitement over
last week's breakthrough, it may still be years before anyone knows
what's going on with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASIA-SCIENCE (Undated) _ Despite the contrast between the
carefully tended icons of the Japanese town of Hida (which bespeak
ancient religious mysticism) and the cutting-edge research on
neutrinos that was unveiled nearby during the past week, many Asian
scientists view the two worlds as complementary rather than
conflicting. ``We say that Buddhist tradition makes it easier for
us to grasp the dualities and transformations of particle
physics,'' said one of the Japanese scientists. An essay by Malcolm
Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MISCONDUCT (Undated) _ Citing a string of recent cases, the
British Medical Journal says that scientific misconduct is a bigger
problem than scientists are willing to admit and that they have
often failed to adequately police their colleagues. By Lawrence K.
Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SEX-SMELL (Undated) _ When it comes to love, sex and
friendship, do birds of a feather flock together? Or is it more
important that opposites attract? The argument is so old that even
Aristotle mentioned evidence for both sides. Recently, a new
chapter has been opened by researchers who say that for at least
one type of gene people find difference sexy and sameness boring _
and that they use their noses to tell which is which.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-DRUG (Undated) _ The heart drug Posicor has been
withdrawn from the market because of dangerous interactions with
other drugs. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IMMUNE-THEORY (Undated) _ Dr. Polly Matzinger, 50, a tenured
medical researcher at the National Institutes for Health, is
turning the world of immunology upside down with her radical theory
suggesting the human immune system is activated not by alien
substances in the body, but rather by dangerous ones _ her ``Danger
Theory'' of immunology. She explains her theories in Q&AMP;A.

   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Viewpoint Datalabs International
Inc. has helped create many computer-generated models for
television and the movies, including the latest version of
``Godzilla.'' Liveart98, its first product for the general public,
trades the monsters for bugs. When it works it is hard to beat, but
it does not work that often. By Stephen Manes.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN-SCI (Undated) _ By Stephen Manes.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Your science questions answered.
</P>

   SCIENCE-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH PAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVAL-ODDS-HEALTH (Undated) _ Most terminally ill patients
think that their odds for survival are far greater than they really
are, research shows. But physicians say that they have trouble
setting their patients straight for fear that they will lose hope
and, with it, the slim chance of beating the odds. Now a study of
terminally ill cancer patients reveals that false hope has its own
hazards, leading patients to choose aggressive therapies that are
useless and increase suffering.

   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: The revised
formula for determining who is overweight could have major
implications. By Jane E. Brody.

SHOULD WE SELL OLD HOME OR RENT IT OUT?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 40 and my husband is 43 and we have three young
children. We hope to purchase a single-family home in the next
year. We own a condominium with a mortgage principal of $57,000 and
a market value of about $85,000. We intend to purchase a $200,000
house, and have saved $40,000 for a down payment. Here's our
dilemma: Should we sell the condominium and use the additional
money to reduce the size of the mortgage on our new house, or
should we keep it and rent it out?
</P>
<P>
   C.O., Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't give you an answer, but I can ask a lot of questions
back, and your answers should lead you to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, how financially stable are you? Do you have a lot
of job security, and ample savings beyond the money set aside for
the new house to tide you over unexpected bumps?
</P>
<P>
   If there's doubt on either score, I'd favor selling the condo.
</P>
<P>
   Second, draw up a financial projection sheet showing best-case
and worst-worst case results of a rental.
</P>
<P>
   In the best case, you would begin with the expected income from
a full year's rental, and then subtract from that the cost of your
mortgage payments on the condo, the taxes on the condo, the cost of
your insurance for the property, and the fee levied by the condo's
management entity. To the resulting figure you can add the positive
effect that renting the condo would have on your tax liabilities
(remember, since it has become a rental property, you can now
depreciate its value). To the resulting figure add the increased
equity in the property you would achieve through the year's
mortgage payments. If that number isn't positive, abandon the
exercise right now _ and sell.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the number is positive. Then consider the effects of
selling. Suppose you did achieve that $85,000 asking price (and
remember that most people tend to overestimate the value of their
homes). If you pay a 6 percent commission to a real estate agent,
that would reduce your net to $79,900, and after you paid off the
mortgage that would leave you $22,900 to add to your down payment
on the new home. If you got a 7 percent mortgage on your new home,
the addition of $22,900 to the down payment would reduce your
mortgage cost by $1,603 a year. How does that number compare to the
benefit you would realize by renting the condo? If the benefit is
equal to or less than $1,603, I suggest selling _ because you
should remember that the figures we worked out were a best-world
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   (An additional factor you might consider here is that if you
made a 31-percent-plus down payment on the mortgage on the new
house, you would probably get a better interest rate than if the
down payment was only 20 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at the downside. What would happen if there were
a significant increase in taxes, insurance costs, and/or condo
maintenance fees? What would happen if a major maintenance project
were dictated for the entire condo project, resulting in an
unexpected levy on you? What would happen if your particular condo
required significant maintenance expenses? And most important, what
would the numbers look like if the condo were vacant for a couple
of months a year (or if you had the poor luck to rent to deadbeat
tenants)? To work out a bad-case financial projection, you might
work the numbers with a projection of nine months rent rather than
twelve. To work out a still-worse-case projection, look at where
you'd be if you collected only six months' rent in the course of a
year. I'll bet these numbers are getting pretty ugly.
</P>
<P>
   It probably boils down to this: Do you feel the local rental
market is strong? Do you know the community well enough to feel
confident you can find a good tenant? Do you feel that the local
tax structure is likely to be stable? Do you think significant
increases in maintenance costs and/or condo management fees are
unlikely? Do you have sufficient financial reserves to deal with
unexpected problems? Finally, did the financial benefit of renting
very significantly exceeds the benefit of making a larger down
payment on your new home? If you came up with six yesses here, then
maybe renting is a good idea. My guess, though, is that for most
people the answer would be no.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 45-year-old single woman and I sold my condo this
spring, hoping to purchase a single-family home. I didn't find what
I was looking for in time, so I am now renting, with a lease ending
next May 1. The proceeds from the sale were $62,000, which I now
have in a savings account with a 4.76 percent annual rate. I need
to keep $10,000 in this account, which entitles me to avoid bank
service fees, but I would like to do better with the other money,
while still enjoying quick access in case I find the property I
want. I have considered a six-month CD, which would pay at a 5.75
percent annual rate. Do you have any other suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   M.G., Winchester
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there are a couple of things you might do to get a
slightly better rate. You could shop around for a slightly better
CD rate; entering this week the nation's best rate for 6- month CDs
was 5.99 percent at First National Bank and Trust Co. of Minnesota.
Or you could scan the money market funds for those with the best
yields, and some of them currently are in excess of 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But you might also consider that over the next six months the
dollar difference between a money market fund that might yield 5.5
percent and a 5.75 percent CD would work out to $65, and that
tactic would involve moving the money twice, once to the CD and
then into a money market fund (or back to the bank) as the time for
your projected home purchase gets closer. I think if it were me,
I'd simply bung it into one of the better-yielding money market
funds right away and forget about it, diverting your energies
instead to the search for the perfect home. When you are dealing
with the short-term investment of a relatively small amount of
money, chasing a few extra basis points of return (a basis point is
one one-hundredths of a percentage point of yield) usually isn't
worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 79 1/2-year-old mother has $425,000 in six different CDs
with maturity dates ranging from 9 months to 3 years. She receives
approximately $1,100 a month in Social Security. Her checking
account always has at least $2,000 in it, and she keeps $5,000 to
$8,000 in a money market account. She is in good health and travels
some, and feels comfortable with CDs because she understands them.
I set up her finances after my father passed away. Is this too
conservative? My brothers think I should be more aggressive with
her money. I think not. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   R.K., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that much more important than what you think and what
your brothers think is what your mother thinks. If she is
comfortable with CDs because she understands them, and would not be
comfortable with more aggressive investments either because she
doesn't understand them or _ more likely _ because she understands
enough to know that better returns mean a level of risk that would
upset her, you should honor her wishes. Suppose you directed the
lot into GNMA funds, which are a favorite of many retired people;
you might achieve a yield of 6.5 percent, or $27,625 a year. How
does that compare to the portfolio yield on the CDs? If the average
is 6 percent, the difference works out to $2,125 a year. Your
mother may well figure it's worth $2,125 a year not to have to
worry about the vagaries of the bond markets. Her opinion and
comfort should dictate the policy, from my point of view.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are two things you might think about. If all of
the CDs are in a single institution, you should spread them out as
they mature so that no account exceeds the FDIC insurance limit for
the bank. I know, worries about banks have been almost nonexistent
for a number of years, but I still feel this conservative
precaution is worth taking. Second, if the ``money market account''
in which she maintains a $5,000 to $8,000 balance is a bank money
market account, you might urge her to move this to a mutual fund
money market account. Entering this week, the nation's average
yield for bank money market accounts was 2.52 percent; most money
market mutual funds have yield in excess of twice that. She would
be allowed the same quick access to her funds as with a bank,
(through check writing privileges) and the additional level of risk
between an insured bank money market account and an uninsured
mutual fund money market is, in my opinion, so small as to be
negligible.

<P>
   ``What did you say?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried, of course,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   When she relayed that story, I almost cried myself.
</P>
<P>
   And so on a brilliantly sunny March day _ the kind where the
gentle breeze had already swept the clouds from the sky _ I
couldn't help but shed tears when brand-new homeowner Sheryl
Holliday rounded up my family and unveiled a sign in her front yard
that said, ``The Garden of Penny Semple.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that Sheryl had felt had been given to her by the
Habitat for Humanity workers and volunteers, she wanted to give
something back.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I've always wanted to do volunteer work for Habitat. I thought
its mission was noble, and I liked the fact that you could actually
see the results of your time and effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although volunteering for Habitat was always on my ``to-do''
list, work and home commitments always preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   When my mom told me her news about the Habitat dedication, I
knew I had to work on that house. It was a way for me to honor the
woman who had loved me and taken care of me for my entire life. I
had to be a part of any project with her name on it.
</P>
<P>
   My mom's involvement with the Consumer Action Center (CAC) and
with Habitat began with her admiration of Atlanta radio and
television personality Clark Howard. His radio show, TV segments
and books primarily cover consumer advocacy and protection issues.
Clark had also provided funding for two Habitat houses; two more
were to be built in February. My mom liked what Clark had to say;
it was an unusual conversation when my mom didn't have a tidbit of
information from one of his shows.
</P>
<P>
   As a person always ready to roll up her sleeves and help others
hash out their problems, it was a natural progression for my mom to
begin volunteering for the CAC through Howard's WSB-AM radio
station soon after my brother _ her youngest _ left home for
college. From there she was promoted to day supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's health was progressively getting worse during the
fall of last year, but that was something I noticed only in
hindsight. She had stopped working at the CAC and was eating less.
We all thought it was just a phase she was going through _ we just
needed to give her a pep talk and a jump start _ but she was
admitted into the hospital the Friday after Thanksgiving for
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   For four days she was stable, but on the first Wednesday of
December, my father called me and asked me to come home. My mother
died after sunrise Saturday morning with those she loved and those
who loved her with her.
</P>
<P>
   After my mom battled for five years, a rare form of cancer took
her from us.
</P>
<P>
   Now the house would be dedicated to her memory. Working on this
house was a way to keep speaking her name, a way to bring our
family together from the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, Texas
and the South, a way to again see her friends from the CAC.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A Habitat house takes seven days to build. ``Our'' house took 6
1/2 days. When I arrived on Friday, March 13, the house was in fine
shape: roof shingled, windows and bathtub installed, porch and
stairways erected.
</P>
<P>
   I figured that any work I would do would only be details,
somewhat insignificant. I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   On that first day _ a cold Georgia morning _ I had opted to help
create the front yard. Flowers, shrubs and tree landscaping were
important to my mother, and it was appropriate work for me to do.
</P>
<P>
   It felt good to do manual labor as a change of pace. I spend
most of my workdays navigating on a computer and thinking my way
through problems and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat volunteers walk in prepared to work and prepared to
sweat; there is no ego. As the volunteers working on the yard
formed a chain and passed fragrant rectangles of sod to one
another, I realized that I was working beside a former Georgia
gubernatorial candidate as well as Clark Howard himself.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while I was trimming sod with a carpet knife, I paused to
look up at the sky. I took a long breath as I scanned the expanse
from left to right. I returned my gaze to straight above me, smiled
and quietly said, ``Love you, Mom.'' I dropped my head and returned
to work.
</P>
<P>
   I later told a fellow volunteer _ one who knew my mom _ that she
was probably having a laugh at my doing all this yard work,
something she could rarely get me to do during my teen-age years.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   After laying sod, I spent the rest of my day working alongside
my sister; she had been dubbed the ``Caulk Queen'' by our Habitat
house leader, and I was recruited to help her seal the outside and
inside of the windows and along the interior baseboards of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was younger sister leading older sister as she
showed me how to properly perform the task, praising my work along
the way and sharing stories of Sheryl and her family, who would be
moving into this house.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day had ended, I was fatigued; I wasn't physically
prepared to volunteer for Habitat, but my mental and emotional
stamina was there.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's workday began at 8 a.m. My brother had arrived from
college in Alabama, and for every 20 minutes of work I did, I spent
five seeing what he was doing. In almost every part of the house,
inside and out, there was a Semple (or a Friend of a Semple)
present.
</P>
<P>
   We finished the house about 11:45 a.m. and rested on the newly
laid grass, waiting for the dedications to begin.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl's house sits next door to Evelyn's house. The two women
met at a Habitat function and struck up a friendship. Potential
Habitat homeowners must complete 150 hours of ``sweat equity''
building houses, both others' and their own. When the time came for
their houses to be built, Sheryl and Evelyn requested that they be
built side by side.
</P>
<P>
   On that final Saturday, Evelyn's house was dedicated first. A
local quilting group presented Evelyn with three quilts; a
queen-size quilt for the mom and full-size quilts for each of her
children. A reading advocacy group called Jack &AMP; Jill presented the
children with a bookshelf decorated by children and new books to
place on it.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn's minister spoke; a Habitat board member spoke and
presented her with a Bible; and Evelyn's house team leader, Larry,
stepped forward to present Evelyn with her house keys _ except he'd
misplaced them. Instead, he offered his car keys; we applauded.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was Sheryl's turn. As Sheryl, her daughter, mother
and fiance and Clark arranged themselves on the front porch, Clark
hollered: ``Will the Semple family gather on the porch?''
</P>
<P>
   My dad turned around and with a sweeping hand motion said,
``Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   I kept my gaze toward the sod as I walked to the porch; I was
already fighting back tears and didn't want anyone to see me crying
so soon into the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Clark spoke first, introducing my family and telling the crowd
how the house was dedicated in honor of the CAC volunteers and in
memory of my mother _ a woman, Clark said, who ``was someone very
important to me ... she had a courage I didn't possess.''
</P>
<P>
   I could hear my sister softly crying beside me. The dedication
continued, with Sheryl and her family receiving their quilts, Bible
and bookshelf. Then Clark called the CAC volunteers who were
present to come to the porch to receive a plaque.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who was one of my mom's closest friends at the CAC
handed my father a wrapped package. As he opened it, Beverly said,
``And there's Penny in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   I craned my neck to see what he was holding. It was a photograph
of him from the first Habitat weekend, standing on a ladder,
smiling and looking down at the camera. In the background is the
sky, moon and clouds _ and heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Sheryl was handed the keys to her house, she said,
``I need all the family to come with me.'' She led us to the
largest landscaped area in the front yard, just off the front
porch. Sheryl continued: ``I was so excited to know the dedication
of the memory of your wife, Penny Semple. There was something I
felt I needed to do out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her fiance, Marty Thurman, gingerly stepped between the
flowers and shrubs, kneeled at the porch and pulled away trash bags
that concealed a sign. When they were done, they stepped away as
the group began to murmur. The sign read, ``The Garden of Penny
Semple.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl continued, ``As I build my garden, and as the flower bed
comes out, this is in remembrance of Penny.''
</P>
<P>
   My dad wasn't shy about his tears, nor were any of us, at that
point. He embraced Sheryl and then Marty. My grandmother clutched
Sheryl, and then it was my turn to hug her. I simply said,
``Sheryl, you're awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl and her family returned to the porch to receive their
keys from team leader Mark Butler. He had brought something extra
for them: a loaf of bread, ``so this family will never know
hunger''; salt, ``so they always know the spice of life''; and
sparkling grape juice, ``so this family knows joy and laughter of
life.'' With tears, he handed Sheryl her keys, and they embraced.
The house was finally hers.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a conglomeration of sounds and sights: five
tables groaning under the weight of barbecue and all the trimmings,
children darting in and out of food lines, shrieks of ``One more
picture ... now look here ... where's my camera? I want a picture
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   I dutifully posed for photograph after photograph, still not
quite believing it was all over. As I took this scene in, I felt
detached. Here I was, the oldest daughter of this woman who'd had a
house dedicated to her memory, and I felt like an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Although all these people around me knew where they were going,
I didn't have that luxury. Now that this house was built, what was
I to do?
</P>
<P>
   After lunch and dessert, people slowly made their way toward
restocking the trailers with work equipment. Volunteers and guests
exchanged hugs and goodbyes and milled toward their cars.
</P>
<P>
   I got my day's ``pay'' _ a Habitat T-shirt _ and went to say
goodbye to Sheryl. I told her I'd help her weed her garden the next
time I was in town.

CONTROVERSY MAY FOLLOW THIS LOOK AT GAY HISTORY OF BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IMPROPER BOSTONIANS &QC; 
Lesbian and Gay History from the Puritans to Playland &QC; 
Compiled by the History Project &QC; 
Beacon Press, 212 pp., illustrated, $30 &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A richly illustrated history of lesbians and gay men, ``Improper
Bostonians'' may court as much controversy as the traveling exhibit
from which it evolved. When the History Project first mounted
``Public Faces/ &QC; 
Private Lives: Boston's Lesbian and Gay History'' at the Boston
Public Library in June 1996, detractors accused its members of
everything from outing notable personalities to historical
fabrication.
</P>
<P>
   Since few American cities revel in their history as much as
Boston does _ the city gave the early History Project its initial
funding in 1980 _ such denouncements seemed narrow-minded, even
homophobic. Perhaps in anticipation of critics, Representative
Barney Frank, who wrote its foreword, affirms the book's necessity
and scolds those who see it as yet another backbreaking bow to
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, it is reasonable to argue that the fact of
someone's homosexuality should be ignored by his or her biographers
only if one is prepared to argue that no other basic facts of the
private lives of prominent people should be recounted,'' Frank
writes. Further, he states, ``people who complain that they are
being told more than they want to know about the private lives of
lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals are, often without realizing it,
not only objecting to honesty but arguing in favor of outright
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   Those topics addressed, the History Project _ a Boston-based
group of archivists, writers, and activists dedicated to preserving
gay history _ presents an informative, engaging chronicle of
lesbians and gay men in and around the city, from ``Boston
marriages'' to butch balls, from Emily Dickinson to drag queen
Sylvia Sidney, the self-proclaimed ``Mess in a Dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Improper Bostonians'' begins with the Puritan colonists. In
creating a new community, the Puritans turned to biblical teaching
to establish a social order. Homosexuality was implicitly outlawed
through laws forbidding sodomy, since it undermined the religious
notion that sexual relations were permissible solely for the
purpose of procreation. The earliest anti-sodomy laws made it a
crime punishable by death, though only two people were executed in
the New England Colonies.
</P>
<P>
   An early supporter of the sodomy statute was John Winthrop, the
first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. After one
execution, Winthrop referred to the condemned as ``a monster in
human shape'' who indulged in ``unclean practices.'' Yet Winthrop
himself may have shared a passionate relationship with Sir William
Springe, a longtime friend. In 1646, Winthrop wrote to Springe, ``I
loved you truely (sic) before I could think that you took any
notice of me; but now I embrace you and rest in your love: and
delight to solace my first thoughts in these sweet affections of so
dear a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Winthrop was likely involved in a ``masculine friendship,''
which allowed two men to profess their mutual love so long as it
was not considered in defiance of anti-sodomy laws. It was somewhat
easier for women to develop close, passionate relationships without
inviting suspicion. By the 19th century, some women of independent
means lived as couples in ``Boston marriages,'' a term popularized
in Henry James's 1886 novel ``The Bostonians.'' James's sister,
Alice, had a long-term relationship with Katharine Peabody Loring
that was one model of the ``Boston marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say homosexuality was widely accepted. By the end
of the century, medical authorities were declaring same-sex
attractions ``deviant.'' Still, lesbians and gay men were
developing a vibrant, albeit underground, culture. By the 1920s, a
majority of Americans resided in cities, and gay people found
sanctuary in cafes, hotels, speak-easies, and bathhouses.
Especially popular were several bars, such as the Crawford House
and Half Dollar, dotting Scollay Square and the downtown Washington
Street area, then known as ``Gay Times Square.'' (Playland, a
gloriously tawdry dive open since 1938, still thrives as a remnant
from that era.) Of course, all the establishments were well-kept
community secrets, since the police and self-appointed authorities,
such as the New England Watch and Ward Society, kept constant vigil
for behavior considered criminal.
</P>
<P>
   In covering so extensive a period _ 300-plus years in 212 pages
_ some eras, especially the post-Stonewall years, are given short
shrift. Where, for instance, are the Hat Sisters, Buffy Dunker, or
the Reverend Peter J. Gomes? The book pretty much ends with the
election of openly gay Elaine Noble to the Massachusetts
Legislature in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a minor quibble; this is more coffee-table book than
encyclopedia, and far more enjoyable for it. The history presented
is well balanced between men and women, and people of color _
including sculptor Edmonia Lewis and writer Angelina Weld Grimke _
are also featured, a rarity in books on lesbian and gay history.
But, then, this is a rare book in many ways, both entertaining and
educational, as it uncovers a welcome slice of this city's
long-hidden, but no less worthwhile, history.

GAY FELLOWSHIP: NEW FACILITIES TO ACCOMMODATE MEETINGS IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For years, Houston has been about the only major U.S.
city without a community center where gays and lesbians can gather
to discuss issues or hold a potluck dinner in a safe and homey
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But that's recently changed with the opening of two new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Lesbian and Gay Community Center opened recently in
an artsy section of the city known as the Montrose area. The
3,300-square foot house has meeting rooms, a large kitchen and
several bulletin boards that list upcoming events and roommate
searches.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus has moved into
offices upstairs and other community groups are expected to occupy
space in the building, said Carl Riedl, the center's president.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to add a library, a ``cyber room'' with
computers, and monthly exhibitions of artwork and exhibits, such as
a salute to Lesbian and Gay Pride Week later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to become a showcase of our history and what's
going on in the community,'' Riedl said.
</P>
<P>
   So what took so long?
</P>
<P>
   The oil bust, the AIDS crisis, and an atmosphere of fear and
distrust that existed after Houston voters rejected an ordinance to
protect gay and lesbian city workers from discrimination in 1984
are among the reasons cited for the lack of such a center before
now.
</P>
<P>
   The independent nature of Houstonians also worked against
previous efforts, some observers believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a more make-it-on-your-own kind of place,'' said
Alan Cranfill, executive director of the Hollyfield Foundation,
which also is opening new meeting spaces for gay and lesbian
community-based organizations. ``People don't seem to collaborate
as much. But in the last two years I've seen (it change). It's
finally coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollyfield Conference Center, which opened Sunday in the
Montrose area, offers more than 3,000-square feet of meeting space
in an historic Italianate villa.
</P>
<P>
   The conference facilities will be available for rental to the
public at rates ranging from $80 to $500 and to gay and lesbian
community-based organizations at a reduced rate. There are also
three offices that will be rented to community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Houston real estate figure Jay Hollyfield, who died of
AIDS-related complications in 1994, endowed the Hollyfield
Foundation and requested his assets support equal rights for gays
and lesbians and those affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation distributed $48,000 in grants last year to
organizations committed to such goals.
</P>
<P>
   Cranfill said the foundation surveyed community-based nonprofit
organizations and found the lack of meeting space a problem in
Houston. He envisions the center will be used for fund-raisers,
educational forums and board retreats.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the Hollyfield Conference Center as a complement to the
Houston Lesbian and Gay Community Center, not competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so few places for gays and lesbians to meet besides
people's homes. It's a positive thing that we're both available,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riedl agrees that the centers can complement each other. He
points out that the Lesbian and Gay Community Center will function
as a clearinghouse for information and referral services.
</P>
<P>
   The Lesbian and Gay Community Center is open on Mondays and
Wednesdays from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and on Saturdays from noon to 4
p.m. It plans to extend its hours as soon as more volunteers are
found and trained.
</P>
<P>
   The center is privately financed by donations, grants and rents
from organizations using meeting rooms. Such fees are flexible
depending on a group's ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a seeding group for organizations to
develop,'' Riedl said.
</P>
<P>
   Such non-gay groups as the Houston chapter of the National
Organization for Women also plan to use the space for monthly
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Riedl is convinced the timing is right for the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay and lesbian community is very much a reflection of the
community it's in,'' he said. ``We've seen Houston energized
lately. The economy is better, and we have progressive leadership.
We're really seeing that diversity is good.''

RICHARD POWERS'S ``GAIN'' IS ONLY OCCASIONALLY POIGNANT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intellectually dazzling and literarily frustrating, Richard
Powers is a wiseguy novelist of ideas whose books are equal parts
irony and erudition. With five previous novels (most recently
``Galatea 2.2'') and a MacArthur genius grant to his credit, he is
often perceived as a kid brother to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon,
but the real lineage probably goes back to George Eliot _ though
she would rue the day. Like Eliot, Powers is in love with his
narration to the point of upstaging his characters; like Eliot, he
is no slouch when it comes to medicine, science, politics, history,
and human foible. There the parallel paths diverge. Powers often
uses the scaffolding of fiction as an excuse to construct wild
tangents _ about artificial intelligence, literature, the everyday
presence of evil _ and his prose sometimes has to sprint to catch
up to the mind that conceived it. At worst, as a stylist, he can be
wooden, sketchy, and vexatious; the payoff (and it is considerable)
is in the plethora of brainpower behind that runaway voice.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Galatea 2.2,'' a cyber-update of the Pygmalion myth and
arguably his best novel, Powers even managed to be tender: Imagine
a computer-protagonist named Helen, whose heroic defense of
literature actually brings tears to the eyes. ``Gain'' enjoys such
poignancy only occasionally, though such moments are frequent
enough to make one hang in to the end. By turns ambitious,
wrenching, and downright dull, this is a novel whose ironic
subtitle could be ``A Social History of Soap.'' Along with the
birth of mass-marketed hygiene, it manages to take on business and
labor history, commerce, urban development, the birth of the
railroads, philanthropy, and better living through chemistry. Oh,
and one of the darker miracles of the modern world: chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming in factoids with a tragic theme running throughout,
``Gain'' is about American progress and its nonchalant evils _ the
story of the rise of a little soap company, born in Boston in the
1830s, transformed into an international behemoth of the modern
age. The novel is also, just as unstoppably, the story of Laura
Bodey _ a 42-year-old real estate agent in Lacewood, Ill.,
gardener, mother of two, a woman with ``no problem that five more
years couldn't solve.'' The five years will be the problem.
Resident of the same little town that houses Clare International's
Agricultural Division headquarters, Laura is diagnosed with ovarian
cancer. How she got that way _ whether Clare is responsible,
legally liable, even morally identifiable, in its corporate
anonymity _ is the suspense tale woven through ``Gain.'' But the
novel spends most of its time tracing the history of Clare Soap and
Chemical, familiarly known to Lacewood simply as ``Clare'' _ an
idea born of two enterprising brothers and an Irish candlemaker,
with the simple notion that, if cleanliness was indeed next to
godliness, it could also be delivered for a price.
</P>
<P>
   This overriding metaphor of ``Gain'' is justifiably dark,
delineating as it does the hidden costs and cruelties of unchecked
corporate growth, of products that promised a better life. From bar
soap to napalm, in other words, with stock options for everybody
involved, while Laura only has to look around the house to count
her dividends: cleaners and hairsprays and window coating and
linoleum and wallpaper, all triumphs of Clare. But following this
arc, from the Clare brothers' first business ventures to the
nameless monolith of the 1990s, reveals not so much the course of
nefarious greed as the story of America itself. The mercantile
capitalism of the 19th century soon enough had to contend with
westward expansion, several depressions, the Civil War, a newly
industrialized nation, and the rise of the labor movement; in one
struggling form or another, Clare was there for all of it. When
Benjamin Clare, the third brother and moral conscience of the
family, is killed by his own well-intentioned experiments with
anesthesia, the mishap seems emblematic as well as foreboding. Only
the good die trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gain'' is an impressive synthesis of this swatch of history
that made America huge, but at times it's also boring. Powers's
tirades about commerce and alkaloids and international
diversification seem as unchecked as Clare itself; the mind spins
even as it wearies. This is a Powers trait: In ``Galatea 2.2,'' he
pontificated endlessly, but his subjects were literature and the
nature of intelligence, and it was a gorgeous choreography of
insight and knowledge. Here, the endless stream of information is
less ethereal and more historical; less imbued with the wistful
wisdom that dominated ``Galatea 2.2,'' and more driven by skeptical
revisionism. So when Powers rips through the end of agrarianism or
the rise of limited-liability laws, one is admiring, but exhausted.
The history of commerce may be a fascinating subject to a lot of
people _ I am not one of them _ but it hardly seems fitting to give
it an imaginary anti-hero and call it fiction.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Powers's dead-on insights can have the terse impact
of a revolver. He gets modern malaise in a sentence: ``Ease upped
the ante on the whole notion of existing.'' More compelling than
these cerebral fortune cookies, though, is Laura's story _
relegated to the shadowlands behind Clare, both in Lacewood and in
``Gain.'' Her cancer, of course, mirrors the ascent of the industry
that probably gave it to her: reproducing endlessly and mindlessly,
eventually sacrificing the host. And her struggle takes on the
ordinary cast of humanity's endless hope-tinged days: her
quarrelsome relationship with her ex-husband, her son's
disappearance into cyber-comfort, her daughter's angry efforts both
to love and lose her. When Laura leaves the sanctuary of her
wheelchair long enough to make a snow angel, the moment has more
impact than 50 pages of Clare's rise to faceless tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want everything,'' Laura whispers to her daughter from
her hospital bed. ``That's their problem.'' ``Gain'' may not take
any prisoners in its assault on corporate America, but part of the
force of its argument is that all of us _ Laura Bodeys, every one _
have been cheerful, sometimes unwitting, foot soldiers for the
captains of industry. If the same folks who brought us rubber tires
and household cleaners were also capable of Agent Orange, blessed
few of us attempted a real cost analysis until it was too late.

ESSAY: BUDDHISM AND NEUTRINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HIDA VILLAGE, Japan _ Everywhere in this restored 17th-century
village, old wayside shrines remind visitors of the belief that
Buddha could assume several manifestations, each representing one
of the deep tenets of Buddhist teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a mile away from the old wood houses of this village is
the modern provincial town of Takayama, where trailblazing physics
is coming to light at an international conference on neutrino
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contrast between the carefully tended icons of Hida
(which bespeak ancient religious mysticism) and the research that
has been unveiled nearby during the past week, many Asian
scientists view the two worlds as complimentary rather than
conflicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that Buddhist tradition makes it easier for us to grasp
the dualities and transformations of particle physics,'' said one
of the Japanese scientists here, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, the duality of particles and waves manifested in
all the ingredients of matter has long been known, but although
everyone accepts this duality intellectually, the idea may be hard
to feel in your heart, unless you are Asian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last Friday that a coalition of Japanese and
American scientists had found strong evidence that neutrinos
undergo transformation from one type to another (and therefore have
mass) also evokes comparisons with Buddhist traditions of dualism.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrino particles have been called ``ghostly'' because of their
extraordinary ability to evade entrapment by the electromagnetic
and ``strong'' nuclear forces, which affect most other particles.
By contrast, a neutrino can easily zip through the entire earth
without hindrance, although once in a great while a neutrino may
bang into an electron orbiting an atom and send the electron
careening away (where a man-made detector may spot it).
</P>
<P>
   It has been known for a decade that neutrinos come in three
families. Physicist generally believed that each type had no mass,
did not transform itself into something else, had a property called
``spin'' of one-half, and that its spin was left-handed, relative
to the neutrino's direction of motion.
</P>
<P>
   But that description has been radically changed in the past
week. Now it seems, neutrinos have mass, and because of that, they
can also have right-handed spin, said Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, former
director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, who
is attending the meeting in Takayama.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s Goldhaber discovered the left-handed spin of
neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrinos,'' he once wrote, ``induce courage in theoreticians
and perseverance in experimenters.''
</P>
<P>
   Muon neutrinos _ neutrinos associated with short-lived, highly
penetrating muon particles _ are now known beyond reasonable doubt
to ``oscillate'' over distance into one of the two other known
types, or perhaps even into a fourth, hypothetical, type called a
``sterile neutrino.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the conclusion of the 120 Japanese and American
physicists who have been looking for neutrino oscillations during
the past two years using a cathedral-size underground water tank
called Super-Kamiokande about 30 miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is relatively easy to express the idea of neutrino
oscillation in words or equations, it is less easy to grasp the
counterintuitive wonder of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Wojcicki of Stanford University in California, one
of the neutrino scientists attending the conference here, compared
the discovery of neutrino oscillation to what light would undergo
if it could also oscillate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beam of light in any color can be thought of as composed of
the three primary colors: Red, Green and Blue,'' Wojcicki wrote in
a recent summary. ``Imagine a beam that starts out as pure red
slowly acquiring a green or bluish tinge as it shines through
space.''
</P>
<P>
   By analogy, this is a kind of transformation that neutrinos are
known to undergo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent neutrino experiments confirm the belief by many
physicists that neutrinos come in three _ and only three _
varieties. But controversy has arisen over an experiment performed
by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Other laboratories have not
been able to confirm the Los Alamos result, but if the Los Alamos
work (and some related experiments by other groups) should prove
true, theorists would have to accept the need for ``new physics,''
specifically the existence of one or more sterile neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothetical sterile neutrinos would be at the very edge
between existence and nonexistence, since they could be detected
only by the trace of gravitational pull they would exert.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leon Lederman, retired director of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, shared in the award of a Nobel
Prize for showing that there are more than one type of neutrino. He
once wrote that ``a particle that reacted with nothing whatever
could never be detected. It would be a fiction. The neutrino is
barely a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   This definition places the neutrino perilously close to
nonexistence, and a sterile neutrino that is affected only by
gravity becomes even more tenuous. Many physicists, who regard
``beautiful'' ideas in physics as more likely to be true than ugly
ones, regard sterile neutrinos as esthetically inelegant and
therefore improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Another peculiar hypothetical particle which has been sought for
four decades is the magnetic monopole _ an entity that has been
compared with the Zen Buddhist notion of the sound of one hand
clapping.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic monopole, a supposed relic of the Big Bang explosion,
would have only a single magnetic polarity. An ordinary magnet,
whether it is a simple iron bar or the entire earth, always has
both a north and south pole. Cutting a magnet in two yields two
magnets, each with a north and south pole _ never a single pole.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, physicists have not ruled out the existence of
monopoles. Experiments at Fermilab in Illinois and within the Gran
Sasso mountain tunnel in Italy, among other laboratories, continue
to look for the elusive particle among the cosmic ray fragments
that hit the earth.
</P>
<P>
   If it is ever found, scientists from countries steeped in
Buddhist tradition will not be unduly overwhelmed.

GAY FELLOWSHIP: NEW FACILITIES TO ACCOMMODATE MEETINGS IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For years, Houston has been about the only major U.S.
city without a community center where gays and lesbians can gather
to discuss issues or hold a potluck dinner in a safe and homey
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But that's recently changed with the opening of two new
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Lesbian and Gay Community Center opened recently in
an artsy section of the city known as the Montrose area. The
3,300-square foot house has meeting rooms, a large kitchen and
several bulletin boards that list upcoming events and roommate
searches.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus has moved into
offices upstairs and other community groups are expected to occupy
space in the building, said Carl Riedl, the center's president.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to add a library, a ``cyber room'' with
computers, and monthly exhibitions of artwork and exhibits, such as
a salute to Lesbian and Gay Pride Week later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to become a showcase of our history and what's
going on in the community,'' Riedl said.
</P>
<P>
   So what took so long?
</P>
<P>
   The oil bust, the AIDS crisis, and an atmosphere of fear and
distrust that existed after Houston voters rejected an ordinance to
protect gay and lesbian city workers from discrimination in 1984
are among the reasons cited for the lack of such a center before
now.
</P>
<P>
   The independent nature of Houstonians also worked against
previous efforts, some observers believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a more make-it-on-your-own kind of place,'' said
Alan Cranfill, executive director of the Hollyfield Foundation,
which also is opening new meeting spaces for gay and lesbian
community-based organizations. ``People don't seem to collaborate
as much. But in the last two years I've seen (it change). It's
finally coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollyfield Conference Center, which opened Sunday in the
Montrose area, offers more than 3,000-square feet of meeting space
in an historic Italianate villa.
</P>
<P>
   The conference facilities will be available for rental to the
public at rates ranging from $80 to $500 and to gay and lesbian
community-based organizations at a reduced rate. There are also
three offices that will be rented to community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Houston real estate figure Jay Hollyfield, who died of
AIDS-related complications in 1994, endowed the Hollyfield
Foundation and requested his assets support equal rights for gays
and lesbians and those affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation distributed $48,000 in grants last year to
organizations committed to such goals.
</P>
<P>
   Cranfill said the foundation surveyed community-based nonprofit
organizations and found the lack of meeting space a problem in
Houston. He envisions the center will be used for fund-raisers,
educational forums and board retreats.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the Hollyfield Conference Center as a complement to the
Houston Lesbian and Gay Community Center, not competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so few places for gays and lesbians to meet besides
people's homes. It's a positive thing that we're both available,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riedl agrees that the centers can complement each other. He
points out that the Lesbian and Gay Community Center will function
as a clearinghouse for information and referral services.
</P>
<P>
   The Lesbian and Gay Community Center is open on Mondays and
Wednesdays from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and on Saturdays from noon to 4
p.m. It plans to extend its hours as soon as more volunteers are
found and trained.
</P>
<P>
   The center is privately financed by donations, grants and rents
from organizations using meeting rooms. Such fees are flexible
depending on a group's ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a seeding group for organizations to
develop,'' Riedl said.
</P>
<P>
   Such non-gay groups as the Houston chapter of the National
Organization for Women also plan to use the space for monthly
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Riedl is convinced the timing is right for the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay and lesbian community is very much a reflection of the
community it's in,'' he said. ``We've seen Houston energized
lately. The economy is better, and we have progressive leadership.
We're really seeing that diversity is good.''

TIE BETWEEN WEDDING COST, DIVORCE RATE NEEDS INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has anybody looked into the relationship between wedding
inflation and the divorce rate? The average wedding in the United
States costs $17,634, according to Modern Bride Research. That
figure probably factors in Las Vegas wedding-chapel weddings and
other cut-rate nuptials, which means that the average ``real''
wedding probably costs even more. And things are getting
increasingly elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, accepting a wedding invitation involved a one-day
commitment, maybe an overnight, if you had to travel any distance.
As a mere guest you were expected to show up for the ceremony and
the reception, after which you were free to drive home and talk
about what an awful time you'd had, speculate about how much it all
cost, and lay odds on how long the marriage would last.
</P>
<P>
   Now some couples want their wedding celebrations to go on for
three or four days. Everybody _ family, friends, the wedding party,
guests _ are invited for a land-locked equivalent of a cruise to
nowhere. I was agog the first time an invitation to one of these
affairs arrived, inviting my husband and me to a wedding in
California. It must have weighed almost a pound and looked more
like a Frommer's guide than an invitation. It was a booklet,
professionally printed. It included details about the wedding and
three days of related events, maps, lists of recommended hotels,
restaurants, beaches, running trails, golf courses (regulation and
miniature), and a lot of other local attractions.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, a similar invitation arrived asking us to
travel to Maui for a week of celebrations surrounding the marriage
of an old friend. It would have been nice to drop everything and
fly to the slopes of ``the mighty Haleakala volcano,'' as the
invitation described it, and join the happy couple and the
assembled throng for cycling, snorkeling, and whale-watching, among
other promised activities, but it just wasn't in the (credit)
cards.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about these weddings reading Cambridgian Dan Zevin's
``The Nearly-Wed Handbook: How to Survive the Happiest Day of Your
Life,'' which I found filed under ``reference'' in the bookstore,
instead of ``humor,'' where it belongs. Actually, it belongs on
both shelves. Anybody thinking even vaguely of getting married
should run to a bookstore and buy at least one copy. That way you
can't say you weren't warned.
</P>
<P>
   Zevin makes a distinction between getting married and getting
weddinged. For example, in getting married, ``you publicly declare
your love in front of the people who mean the most to you.''
However in getting weddinged, ``you desperately revise your guest
list according to which of the people are worth the seventy-five
bucks a head it's costing to feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading Zevin's book made me wonder why more people don't elope.
Why not? There are so many reasons. Family expectations. Gifts. The
bride's dream of having her ``big day.'' Relentless pressure from
the wedding industry.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wedding juggernaut is on a roll, crushing everything in
its path, it's almost impossible for the bride or bridegroom to
escape. The bigger and more expensive the wedding, the harder it is
to back out. That's why I wonder if there's any correlation between
the high divorce rate and the escalating cost of weddings.
</P>
<P>
   How do you back out of a $50,000 wedding at the last minute? You
don't. ``I hate the sight of him,'' says the prospective bride, a
week before the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just nervous,'' says her mother.
</P>
<P>
   No, she really hates the sight of him. She knows she's making
the mistake of her life. But it's too late. The wedding is a major
investment. The marriage? Two years, tops.

FIGHTING FAT BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR THE MAJORITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   With bathing suit season just approaching (and already here in
some parts of the country), nearly every popular magazine in the
last month or two seems to have touted one scheme or another for
shedding that winter padding and achieving a movie-star figure in
eight weeks or less. Even without the beach as an incentive,
millions of Americans are perpetually struggling to lose pounds, an
effort that has spawned a $33-billion diet industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the National Institutes of Health gave Americans a
far better reason to be self-conscious about their bodies and to
redouble their efforts to lose weight, not just for summer but
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an evaluation of many big studies linking excess body
fat to a long list of chronic and potentially fatal diseases, an
expert panel convened by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Disease announced a new definition of overweight, a
definition that brings to 55 percent the proportion of the adult
population that should become more diligent weight watchers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, according to the revised guidelines, more than
half the population is too heavily larded, which makes us by far
the fattest people on earth. The point at which an American would
be considered overweight has been shifted downward, from a body
mass index of 27 to one of 25. Those with an index of 30 or more
are classified as obese.
</P>
<P>
   It is a guideline already established by the World Health
Organization for people everywhere. If approved by the 115 health
experts reviewing the guidelines, the new definition would add
another 25 million adults to the 72 million who were previously
considered overweight.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance took strong
objection to the new guidelines, saying that changes in diet and
exercise habits can improve a person's health risks even if no
weight is lost. The association is concerned that the increased
attention to weight will prompt even more people to try diets
doomed to fail and add to the number of people who avoid going to
doctors for fear of being harassed about their weight.
</P>
<P>
   While the association may be correct in its belief that some
people would be better off staying fat than spending their lives
struggling to get their weight down to a level they simply cannot
maintain, for the vast majority of overweight Americans, the
problem is not genetic and not incurable. It is a consequence of
eating too much, especially too many calorically dense foods like
fats and sweets, and exercising too little.
</P>
<P>
   WHO IS OVERWEIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   The body mass index, or BMI, is considered a better measure of
the amount of fat on a person's body than would be indicated by the
traditional height-weight charts. Though the BMI is officially
calculated by dividing body weight in kilograms by height in meters
squared (hard for Americans who don't know their dimensions in the
metric system), you can also figure your BMI by multiplying your
weight in pounds by 703, then dividing the result by your height in
inches and dividing that result by your height a second time.
</P>
<P>
   However, even the BMI is not a perfect measure of fatness. A
person who is very muscular but who has a low percentage of body
fat could end up with the same BMI as someone who is truly fat.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the new guidelines, which will be issued to the
medical community next week, also call upon physicians to measure
their patients' waistlines. Fat that collects around the belly is
the most serious health threat, and the guidelines say that among
those with a BMI of 25 to 35, men with waists of more than 40
inches and women whose waists exceed 35 inches face an increased
risk of developing serious health problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even if your BMI falls into the low-risk range of 21 to
25, if you carry too much weight around the middle you're at
greater risk than someone whose weight sits on the hips or thighs.
Likewise, people with an acceptable BMI who gained 10 or more
pounds as adults (say, after age 21) are at greater risk than those
who have maintained their college weight.
</P>
<P>
   WHY WORRY ABOUT WEIGHT?
</P>
<P>
   The main impetus for changing the weight guidelines is the
growing realization that just about any amount of excess body fat
is a potential health risk. Although there is some evidence that
being a little overweight when you're old is actually beneficial,
this is still being debated.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent analysis of data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey revealed that as BMI rises above 25,
average levels of blood pressure and artery-damaging blood
cholesterol rise, average levels of protective HDL cholesterol fall
and it becomes more difficult to maintain normal levels of blood
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the BMI rises, the risk of developing a long list of
ailments rises, too. They include coronary artery disease and
resulting heart attacks, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes,
gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and accompanying
respiratory problems and certain cancers, including cancer of the
breast and endometrium. The National Institutes of Health estimates
that obesity-related disease costs the nation about $100 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with causing disease, of course, obesity can shorten life.
In fact, the Institutes' statement on the new guidelines noted that
obesity is the second leading cause (after smoking) of preventable
death in the United States today.
</P>
<P>
   In calculating an individual's risk, the new guidelines state
that more than the BMI should be considered for many individuals in
the lower ranges of overweight. Physicians will be told to look at
individual risk factors for disease before deciding whether to urge
patients to lose weight or merely avoid gaining any more.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if your BMI exceeds 25, before urging you to lose weight
your doctor should take into account your blood cholesterol, blood
sugar and blood pressure, evidence of arthritis in your knees or
hips and any respiratory problems, as well as your family medical
history and your own risky behaviors, like smoking, eating poorly
and not exercising.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the 24-member expert panel that formulated the new
guidelines recommended that normal-weight people should also remain
vigilant and have their BMI reassessed every two years. It is
easier to nip encroaching weight problems in the bud than to have
to shed scores of excess pounds that have hung around your frame
for years.
</P>

MCANUFF STAGES A SCREEN CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whoever said ``all the world's a stage'' must've
never worked in Hollywood. Otherwise, he'd know that the motion
picture industry generally treats the theater world like some
highfalutin but impoverished relative who's always begging for a
handout.
</P>
<P>
   Des McAnuff spent half a lifetime in that world before making
the leap to movies three years ago. He had thrived there, too:
During his 11-year term as artistic director of the La Jolla
Playhouse (1983-94), the theater snagged more than 200 awards,
including the 1993 Tony Award for outstanding regional theater. His
1985 Broadway staging of ``Big River'' won seven Tony Awards, and
he picked up his second Best Director Tony in 1993 for his
dazzling, pop art-inspired production of ``The Who's Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Toronto-born director is launching what he hopes will
be a new career as a big-screen auteur with Fox Searchlight's
``Cousin Bette.'' His debut is a lushly intelligent adaptation of
Honore de Balzac's deliciously nasty 1846 novel about a scheming
Paris spinster who wreaks death and ruin on the relatives and
friends who've betrayed and abused her.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Lange stars as Balzac's embittered yet sympathetic
heroine, a kind of female Iago trapped in a self-made theater of
cruelty. The two-time Oscar-winning actress didn't hesitate when
offered the chance to play a character she'd fallen in love with in
her early 20s _ part of a lifelong infatuation, she says, with big,
fat European novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say exactly what it was about the book that I loved
when I read it, but I do remember it was one of those books where I
just hated to come to the end of it,'' says Lange, during a recent
interview at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great escape, a leisure thing for me, 19th-century
novels. And for the longest time the French were my favorite. I
never enjoyed the English as much as I did the French. I think the
French were just a little juicier.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitch-black comedy has everything Jackie Collins fans could
want: revenge, greed, bitchiness, wanton lust, gorgeous costumes
and numerous revealing glimpses of Elisabeth Shue, who plays a
heartlessly seductive burlesque performer named Jenny Cadine
(actually a composite of three characters from the novel).
</P>
<P>
   Rather like Joel Grey's leering Master of Ceremonies in the
Broadway musical ``Cabaret,'' Shue's Jenny functions as a solo
Greek chorus, offering saucy asides on the main plot line. Her
domain is the Theatre de Varieties, a rowdy Paris music hall
specializing in raunchy vignettes that mock France's moral and
social chaos on the eve of the 1848 revolution. Jenny also becomes
Bette's partner in crime, using her curves and creamy white
complexion the way Bette uses cunning intelligence to ensnare her
victims.
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff says the spectacular theater sequences, which form a
sort of play-within-the-play, were conceived and embellished by
screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr, also the film's
co-executive producers. He believes they add a wittily corrosive
dimension to Bette's appalling _ and appallingly funny _ quest for
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the theater's very much a presence in the novel, Balzac
_ because there's no need to do it _ doesn't really get into any
description of specific songs or scenes,'' says McAnuff, 45. ``But
I think they (Siefert and Tarr) saw, and I saw, a nice opportunity
there. And I think what's important about the theater in the novel
is that ... it's a metaphor for manipulation and illusion and
deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we very much tried to shoot it that way. Bette at one
point appears almost like a puppeteer above the stage, and you can
see her kind of drawing on this and perhaps absorbing the
stagecraft and the conceits. And also I think Balzac was playing
with these various theatrical genres, and switching back and forth
from farce and satire and melodrama and even tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff emphasizes, however, that he didn't intend to make a
movie that takes place partially in a theater. It just worked out
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually pushed that somewhat further than maybe they (the
screenwriters) had intended, and not because I'm a stage director.
Because in a sense it was kind of the last thing I wanted to do
with my first film, was to spend time in a theater. It was exactly
what I was trying to get away from. But it did seem important to
create a sense of theatricality so that we would have a right to go
through those (genre) shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lange says McAnuff's hybrid sensibility was an asset in carving
up a portly (450-page) slab of literature like ``Cousin Bette.'' So
were his many years of working one on one with actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew this piece very well and was extremely passionate
about it, coupled with extraordinary energy,'' says the 48-year-old
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what he was doing. He was prepared, he rehearsed, he
really believed in the rehearsal process. I had a great time
working with him. I never felt like he wasn't getting it. Now,
that's not saying that you're in agreement on every aspect of his
interpretation, but he knew what he wanted and knew how to get it.
And that says a lot, I think, for a first-time film director.''
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff admits there was a certain perversity in casting ``one
of the great beauties of our time'' as a dowager. For most of the
film, Lange appears in a drab, dun-colored frock and an oiled wig _
a far cry from the high-cheekboned, Nordic goddess glories of
``Country,'' and closer to the ravaged persona of ``Frances.''
</P>
<P>
   By casting against physical type, the movie underscores the
basic artificiality of 19th-century concepts of beauty, which
utterly devalued women of a certain age if they lacked husbands and
cash flow, McAnuff says.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers also saw Lange as one of the few actresses
capable of projecting both rock-ribbed determination and tragic,
love-starved vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessica was the actress that we wanted, not just me, but Fox
Searchlight, too,'' says McAnuff. ``The most important reason is
that there aren't that many actresses out there who have that kind
of ability, simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing was, I felt, having seen her in other films, I
knew that she was a real changeling, that she had the ability to
kind of transform herself and wasn't all that concerned about _
certainly I shouldn't say she's not concerned about self-image _
but that she's a very serious actress and she puts the acting
first.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it harder to play a repressed woman brimming with heartbroken
rage than one who lets her emotions all hang out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's harder, for me at least it is,'' Lange replies,
``because it's very easy for me to play those kind of big emotional
sweeps. This is calibrated much more specifically. ... I was so
limited in what I could reveal, and how I could reveal it, that I
had to be very specific to make sure that the audience
understood.''
</P>
<P>
   McAnuff, known at La Jolla for patronizing offbeat theater
artists like iconoclastic director Peter Sellars and New
Vaudevillian Bill Irwin, mourns the disappearance of great,
villainous screen roles for middle-age women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get to know many people like Bette in the cinema. I
think there was a time when it might've been a little more
common,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody mentioned that it's the kind of role that Bette Davis
would've loved to play. I think in some ways that roles fall out of
fashion. I think we may be less interested, in this day and age, in
that class of character, too. I think it's become less common than
in the days of `Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte' and `What Ever
Happened to Baby Jane?' when we celebrated great actresses as they
got more senior.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides taking us on what he calls ``this kind of insane
journey,'' McAnuff hopes the film's depiction of Paris in the 1840s
will suggest parallels with America in the 1990s. In Bette's time,
the French imperial aristocracy _ a faux nobility created by the
spoils of Napoleonic wars _ had been resting on its laurels for 40
years. It had mortgaged its future and slipped into
pleasure-seeking idleness while poverty and discontent seethed in
the Paris streets.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising of 1848 became one of many aftershocks that struck
France following the Revolution of 1789. Like Anton Chekhov, whose
plays 70 years later would eerily foreshadow the Russian
Revolution, Balzac seemed to predict the coming storm.
</P>
<P>
   Lang compares ``Cousin Bette's'' milieu with that of ``Cabaret''
_ ``a period of time where it was just kind of wanton,
self-indulgent, pleasure-oriented, whatever they could do, you know
_ sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at periods like that in history, like 1848 before
the February revolution, and then Berlin right before the advent of
the Third Reich, it seems to spin out and spin out and spin out,
until finally it's kind of like, boom! And all that has to come to
an end. And we seem to be spinning out. Who knows what's up ahead?
But I wouldn't say we're on the right path, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it's impossible not to laugh along with
Balzac's bitter human comedy _ even if the joke's on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's rare to see something that's truly insightful
without having a certain amount of distance,'' McAnuff says. ``I
think what it proves is that these works are universal. When you
can take something and apply it to your own time, I guess it says
something about the remarkable mind that created it.''

HAVE BUGS, WILL DELIVER (HELP! HELP!) 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 (jt)  
 By STEPHEN MANES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewpoint Datalabs International Inc. has helped create many
computer-generated models for television and the movies, including
the latest version of ``Godzilla.'' Liveart98, its first product
for the general public, trades the monsters for bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The program costs about $90 and is designed to help users create
clip art by letting them modify three-dimensional models in a
variety of amusing ways. But it refused to work properly on one
computer until I spent hours diagnosing the problems, and on
another it refused to work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Given the list of problems that comes with it, I was unwilling
to give it a chance for a third strike, but apparently I can
consider myself lucky. ``You should have seen the bug list a month
ago,'' said Chris Lowery, the company's director of business
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of exterminating the bugs before they crawled into the
box, Viewpoint chose to grace its Web site
(www.viewpoint.com/liveart/) with a list beginning: ``These are the
known bugs which we couldn't get out at shipping time. Updates will
be made available.'' Is there another industry where people get
away with this?
</P>
<P>
   The known problems include examples that range from ``Right and
Left mouse buttons sometimes gets confused'' to instructions about
what to do ``If you are using a hardware acceleration card and are
experiencing blue screen crashes after working for a while.'' Blue
screen crashes are an especially nasty breed in which the whole
system fails all at once, but I saw not blue but red when Liveart98
locked up my computer to the point where rebooting was required.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots and lots of problems with any new product,''
Lowery said. ``There are certainly a lot of rough edges in the 1.0
package.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed some of the problems on Microsoft's shortcomings:
``We're intersecting with at least three component technologies
that are not well implemented and not well documented.''
</P>
<P>
   The technologies he referred to are three pieces of leaky
software plumbing known as OLE, DirectX and OpenGL, which Microsoft
includes in Windows 95 and applications. Developing software that
relies on all three is slightly less daring than hiring Moe, Larry
and Curly.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jeff Prosise, an author and lecturer on Windows
programming, for a reality check. ``If you ask who's at fault,
there's plenty of blame to go around,'' he said. ``Developers are
often guilty of not testing their product adequately, but if
they're working with a technology that's complex and not well
documented, there's only so much they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's OLE technology, he said, ``is poorly documented and
does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every programmer curses it,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's implemented differently in every application,'' Prosise
said, ``and you can't say one way is correct, because the
documentation is so miserable. OLE is an ugly and ill-conceived
protocol that deserves to die a slow and agonizing death.'' But if
you want your program to appear as a more or less seamless part of
Microsoft Office 97 applications, as Liveart98 can when it works,
OLE is hard to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   DirectX has been a shaky technology since its outset. Designed
to make Windows multimedia applications run faster, it often causes
video problems that can be hard to diagnose and repair, even after
you download and install the latest video driver software to help
insure that the driver is not the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   One such download and some other tweaking finally got Liveart98
working on one of my computers, no thanks to Viewpoint's
documentation or the support technician I contacted. On the other
machine, the program remained intractable no matter what I tried.
Lowery said that only one person in 50 or 60 was having problems
and that the company was working on improvements.
</P>
<P>
   What does Liveart98 deliver if you manage to get it running?
Clip art that looks different from, but not necessarily better
than, the usual breed of graphics that lend church newsletters what
passes for visual spice. The program works on its own or from
within Microsoft Office 97 applications, but it will not rescue the
low repute of clip art or turn a visual incompetent into
Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Your computer renders Live-art98's images from a library of
several thousand three-dimensional models on CD-ROM. A built-in
search engine lets you find possibilities from the broad
collection. When you type ``cat,'' the program cleverly proposes
everything from a feline skull to a Caterpillar tractor and a milk
carton, not to mention a pronghorn antelope and other unrelated
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Customization is the watchword. You can tilt and rotate the 3-D
models on the screen, so you can see a green tiger beetle from
above, from the side or from a worm's-eye view. Combinations of odd
angles and close-ups can make for arresting effects. For further
tweaking, you can render the models in various synthetic drawing
styles, create shadow effects by lighting them from nine different
points, and sometimes change their colors.
</P>
<P>
   In general, heavier stylization and inanimate objects give
better-looking results; more realistic modes give the
oversimplified surfaces of animate objects a disconcerting
artificiality reminiscent of the computer-generated humans in the
film ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendering 3-D images takes plenty of computing power. If you
were wondering what kind of program might show off a high-powered
machine, this sort of thing is the answer. Viewpoint recommends a
166-megahertz Pentium processor and 48 megabytes of random access
memory, but even a machine of that caliber is likely to seem
lethargic. On the 400-megahertz computer that was able to run the
program, performance was fairly snappy, even though I had to turn
the video card 3-D acceleration off.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware and software makers see 3-D graphics, particularly for
games, as one way to help sell faster, more expensive computers.
But in their effort to improve computers' 3-D performance, they
have lost sight of the one great advantage of game machines and
their software: they just work.

THE SKINNY ON MENOPAUSE-RELATED WEIGHT GAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You're a woman who's been dieting, but seem to be
gaining instead of losing weight? The waistband of your jeans seems
to be shrinking? And you find you have more food cravings than
ever?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry _ it just means you're approaching menopause,
reassured Debra Waterhouse, a Bay Area dietitian with a master's
degree in public health who just penned her fourth book exploring
the unique biology of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that your body, as it approaches menopause, needs
estrogen, and it gets it from your fat cells,'' Waterhouse said.
``It's in your female blueprint. It's not your fault. It's not lack
of willpower or anything else. I want women to !ital!know!off! this
and not be crazy about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell: Winning Weight Control
Strategies for Women over 35 to Stay Fit Through Menopause''
(Hyperion; $22.95), Waterman warns that women's bodies begin
preparing for menopause as early as the mid-30s. And before they
turn 55, most women will gain an average of 12 pounds, and their
waistlines will have grown by an average of two inches.
</P>
<P>
   To keep weight gain to a minimum and survive menopause fit and
healthy, she says, women must change both their eating habits and
their exercise routines to outsmart their body's fat cells, which
she talks about almost as if they were shrewd, thinking beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They !ital!do!off! seem to have a personality and they
!ital!are!off! smart and stubborn,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The most important advice for a perimenopausal woman: ``Don't
even think about a diet,'' Waterman advised. ``Your body is
programmed to fight any drastic effects at weight loss because it
needs estrogen from fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starving yourself, eat what your body's craving _ no,
not chocolate cake three times a day _ !ital!really!off! craving,
like fruits and vegetables and milk and grains, which keep you
satiated. And instead of having a cup of coffee for breakfast,
skipping lunch and scarfing down everything in sight at dinner
time, eat five or six small meals a day, just enough to fill your
stomach _ which, by the way, is about the size of your fist.
</P>
<P>
   And forget those halfhearted spins on the exercycle. To burn
menopausal fat, exercise sessions should be scheduled three to five
times a week ``for as close to 60 minutes as you can,'' Waterhouse
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 30 minutes of what we're doing _ walking, bicycling,
whatever _ our fat cells are laughing at us,'' she said. ``As we
get above those 30 minutes, they sort of give in and we start to
burn fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with changes in diet and exercise, don't expect to emerge
from menopause unscathed, Waterhouse warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can hold down the weight gain. But I'm not going to
guarantee you're going to get your 20-year-old body back,'' she
said. ``That's impossible. Gravity does exist. But you'll come out
of menopause at 55 healthy and fit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When William Roy Bond learned last year that he had cancer, his
doctor was honest about the grim diagnosis: end-stage lung cancer
that had spread to the liver, stomach and pancreas. The doctor
assumed that the diagnosis spoke for itself, that Bond would
understand that treatment was futile, recalled his wife, Helen.
``But he didn't hear it,'' she said. ``My husband said he wanted
chemotherapy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until three weeks later, when a second doctor told
Bond directly that chemotherapy would do more harm than good, that
he opted for comfort care instead. ``He died at home, as he
wanted,'' said Mrs. Bond, who lives in Chester, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bond, most terminally ill patients appear to believe that
their odds for survival are far greater than they really are,
research shows. But unlike Bond's second doctor, physicians say
that they have trouble setting their patients straight for fear
that they will lose hope and, with it, the slim chance of beating
the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Now a study of terminally ill cancer patients reveals that false
hope has its own hazards, leading patients to choose aggressive
therapies that are useless and increase suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a widespread belief among oncologists that
hope is the most important thing and that there's no real cost to
allowing patients to have somewhat unrealistic expectations about
their prognosis,'' said Dr. Jane Weeks, director of the center for
outcomes policy research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston and lead author of the study, whose findings were reported
in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients didn't have a good understanding of their
prognosis,'' Dr. Weeks said, ``which is information that they
needed to make choices that were right for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The research by Dr. Weeks and her colleagues involved 917 adults
hospitalized with advanced lung or colon cancer that had spread to
the liver. At that stage, cancer is generally considered incurable
and associated with a short life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, which was part of a larger, continuing study of
terminally ill patients nationwide, each patient and physician
rated the patient's chance of surviving at least six months. Their
choices were 90 percent or more; 75 percent; 50 percent; 25
percent, or 1 percent or less. Patients were then asked to state
their preference for either life-extending cancer therapy or
therapy directed strictly at controlling pain, such as hospice
care.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of patients said they thought that they had a 90
percent chance or better of living another six months, Dr. Weeks
said, though only 45 percent actually lived that long. The study
also found that patients were far more optimistic than their
doctors and that their optimism was often misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   For example, among doctors and patients who estimated at least a
90 percent chance of six-month survival, doctors were correct 71
percent of the time and patients 57 percent of the time. The most
optimistic patients were also the most inclined to want aggressive
anti-cancer treatment. And yet those who got it did not live
longer, the study found, after controlling for factors that
influence longevity, like age, education and income. Instead, they
were more likely to experience grueling treatments and
resuscitation or to die while attached to a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study did not try to assess patients' reasons for
their optimism, the researchers said that a likely one was that
doctors did not give patients enough information about their
conditions. Dr. Weeks and other doctors agreed that they often have
trouble telling terminally ill patients the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you from personal experience that it's
extraordinarily painful to give bad news,'' Dr. Weeks said. ``You
feel for the patient. I would guess that one out that some
physicians take is to tell patients, but to tell them in terms that
they don't understand. We'll talk about the chance of response to a
therapy and patients don't understand that it's not a cure, but
rather something that adds at most a few months to life.''

<P>
   Some doctors justify withholding information from patients
because the patients do not ask, said Dr. Thomas J. Smith, a
hematologist and oncologist at the Massey Cancer Center at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond. Smith has spoken with many
doctors on the subject as a faculty scholar with Project on Death
in America, an organization started in 1994 to pay for efforts at
major institutions to improve communication between doctors and
dying patients. Billionaire George Soros financed the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, said that even if
patients and their families did not ask questions, doctors were
obliged to tell them the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say that we should bludgeon the patient,'' he
said. He often begins by asking patients how much they want to know
and then taking the conversation from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine percent of patients will say, `Tell me
everything,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with terminally ill patients and their families
indicated that most did want to know the truth, especially when
death was likely to come within just weeks or months. ``Most
patients I talked to wanted to know how much time they had to wind
up business and do the things they had to do,'' said Marilyn Webb,
author of ``The Good Death,'' the accounts of 15 dying patients
published last year by Bantam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors would say that they weren't telling patients the truth
because they'd lose hope. In my view, the hope that patients had
was not the hope for survival but the hope that they wouldn't
suffer and that they'd get the chance to finish the things they
needed to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Nena Radtke of Wellesley, Mass., said that she and her family
were denied that hope because doctors were not honest about her
husband's prognosis. Four years ago her husband, Mark, learned that
he had intravascular lymphoma, a rare cancer that attacks the
nervous system. He was 43, and the couple had children ages 6 and
9.
</P>
<P>
   Even though this form of cancer was considered incurable, Ms.
Radtke said that the doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston had hoped for a cure and recommended aggressive chemotherapy
and radiation. The treatment was given in the intensive care unit,
which meant that Ms. Radtke could not see her husband most of the
time, and their children could not see him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thursday before my husband died, I thought he was dying,
and he thought he was dying,'' Ms. Radtke said. ``But the doctor
was talking about aggressive chemotherapy. I asked if this was
palliative, and he said that he still hoped for a cure.'' Mark died
three days later, just two months after the disease was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was with him at the time of his death, but the room was
filled with eight other people hanging bags of blood and monitoring
vital signs,'' she said. ``It was about as horrifying as anything
that could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, from conversations with her husband's doctors, Ms.
Radtke realized that they had known how slim Radtke's chances were
but found it impossible to give up hope because he was a young man
with a family. One doctor even said that it was especially hard for
him because he had children the same ages as the Radtke children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were trying to mislead us,'' she said.
``They thought he might be the one case that would have a positive
outcome.'' Hard as it would have been to hear that her husband had
only a few months to live, Radtke said that she wished she had
known the truth so that they could have made more of the time left.
``We could have spent days with the children, together,'' she said,
``not filled with painful regimens in the hospital.''

SHE'S 86 AND AS FEISTY AS CAN BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE NORMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I was ready for him to tell me I had cancer,'' she told me as
I drove her away from the doctor's office Tuesday. My aunt Goldie,
a frail 86-year-old, was not willing to take that news quietly. ``I
was going to tell him that I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few minutes earlier, we sat in front of the doctor's
desk, waiting for him to finish with another patient and come tell
us the results of a battery of high-tech tests.
</P>
<P>
   A wall full of medical textbooks and reference guides were on
his side. Goldie was at the mercy of medical reality, but _ even
though she is shortened in stature because of the effects that
aging has on bones _ she was ready to stand up and fight.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, a nurse who is Goldie's Sunday School teacher
and dear friend took her in the middle of the night from her west
Fort Worth home to the hospital emergency room. Severe stomach
pains had plagued her the entire day, and she began vomiting during
the night. She called her friend for help; the measure of the
friendship is that the help came immediately.
</P>
<P>
   She spent a full week in the hospital, with new tests every day
aimed at diagnosing the problem. Her thin arm was stuck repeatedly
for blood tests, intravenous feeding and medication. The doctors
were about to give up when they discovered something wrong with her
pancreas, a ``poorly defined area of soft tissue'' about the size
of a hen's egg.
</P>
<P>
   It could be cancer. They couldn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   At Goldie's age and delicate state of health, there was not even
the suggestion of cutting her open to take a closer look at the
problem. And if it turned out to be cancer, the typical treatments
_ radiation and strenuous chemotherapy _ also could be too much for
her.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors decided to give Goldie antibiotics in case they were
dealing with some kind of infection. They would wait a month and
run the tests again _ the change in results, one way or the other,
would literally tell this silver-haired, cheerful woman whether she
had been struck by a disease that would kill her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived a long time,'' she said. ``If I'm going to die now,
that's nothing that God and I can't handle. But I'd rather live a
few more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldie has lived in Fort Worth since 1943. Born in 1911, she and
the rest of my mother's siblings grew up in the tiny community of
Bangs, near Brownwood in Central Texas. It was World War II that
took her away. Rather, it took her husband away to the Army, and
she followed him while he was stationed stateside. When he _ and
one of his friends, later my dad _ shipped out to Europe, Goldie
took a girlfriend's advice and moved to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rosie-the-Riveter time at the city's big bomber plant,
when thousands of American women pitched in to help make the
airplanes and other arms that their servicemen brothers and
husbands used to fight the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there and asked for a job,'' Goldie said. ``They
said, `keypunch operator.' I said, `What's that?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a job in the plant's payroll department. In the early
dawn of the computer era, it taught her a skill. After the war, she
took that skill to a Fort Worth insurance company and transformed
it into a career.
</P>
<P>
   Goldie didn't have children of her own. Now, with her husband,
my parents and the rest of her family gone, my brother and cousins
and I try to keep tabs on her. She's fairly independent, has a
close circle of friends from her church and makes friends easily.
</P>
<P>
   What she seems to hate most about getting older is giving up her
car. She taught herself to drive in 1933 by taking a car out into a
Brownwood pasture, getting behind the wheel and making it go until
she knew what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   She hates the way older people are sometimes treated. Her
favorite television show, ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' recently
was canceled. ``They said the only ones who were watching it were
old people, so they canceled it. That just makes me so mad.''
</P>
<P>
   So we sat there in the doctor's office, waiting for word on her
fate. She talked about how she had already fought off cancer once,
with surgery a little more than a year ago that left her weak but
still going. And her defiant streak showed: ``I just don't believe
I have it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The office door opened. The doctor came in, and he was smiling
broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the good part about being a doctor,'' he said.
``Sometimes you get good news.''
</P>
<P>
   He never knew Goldie was ready to fight him if he had told her
she has cancer. She doesn't. She was happy.

   440&AMP;ADD  SURVEY SHOWS REGRETS, HIGH
MOBILITY AMONG COLLEGE GRADS
 &HT;     By BOB DART 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The grass often seems greener on the other side of
the computer screen, a national career survey of college graduates
showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half (43 percent) of the college-educated workers said
they would choose a different major if they could start over _ with
many favoring science or technology for the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   However, about 40 percent of the respondents now working in the
high-tech information industry would also pick a different course
of study _ with liberal arts or education being the most popular
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that non-technical people want to know more about
technology, while technology people are finding there's more to
life than bits and bytes,'' said Alan G. Merten, president of
George Mason University, the Virginia college that co-sponsored the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 400 college-educated workers aged 30 to
55 was conducted by Market Research Institute. The respondents were
all employed and had been out of college for at least 10 years. The
nationwide survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed a mobile work force, with 51 percent of the
workers saying they had already switched careers at least once
since graduating from college. Within careers, respondents had held
an average of four different jobs since entering the work force.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that information technology workers are
considerably more restless than the average employee. A third of
the high-tech workers expect to make a future career change,
compared to one in five of all college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The workers realized that education is a lifelong process, the
survey indicated. More than half the respondents (57 percent) have
taken college-level courses since graduation, mostly to advance
their careers. Nearly half (46 percent) said they would need to
take more computer-related courses in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While he would ``have assumed more satisfaction'' with their
college majors, the findings were not shocking ``when you think of
the pace of change in the workplace,'' said David Potter, provost
at George Mason University, which has about 24,000 students and is
located in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The desire of technical workers for a broader education and of
other grads for more technical training indicates that colleges
need to increase interaction between fields of study, Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no longer a dichotomy with two kinds of education,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't narrowly educate'' engineers, programmers and other
technical workers, he said, and a working knowledge of technology
is required in every field from law to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   About four in every 10 respondents both inside and outside the
information industry would pursue a different major if they could
start over. Over all, 44 percent of these respondents cited
personal enjoyment as the reason they would choose a different
course of study, compared to 40 percent who cited career
advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech workers who would change majors, however, 70
percent cited personal enjoyment, compared to only 26 percent who
said their careers would be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their majors, most of the respondents expressed
confidence in their ability to keep up in the Internet age. Only 7
percent feared that change would pass them by, and 60 percent said
they were comfortable with the technology in their homes and on the
job. About a third said they can handle the technology now but were
a little concerned about what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   Along with George Mason University, the survey was co-sponsored
by The Potomac KnowledgeWay, a business that works with information
technology industries, educational institutions and state and local
government officials in the Washington, D.C., area.

   Romanov Funeral
</P>
<P>
   Q. What can you tell me about funeral arrangements for Czar
Nicholas II and his family in St. Petersburg this summer? _ Gene
Horton, Blue Point, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Romanovs will finally receive a royal sendoff on July 17,
80 years to the day after Nicholas II, his wife, Aleksandra, and
their children were killed by the Bolsheviks. Several years ago,
DNA tests proved that bones found near the Ural Mountains city of
Yekaterinburg were those of the royal couple and three of their
five children (the remains of Aleksei and either Anastasia or Marie
have not been found).
</P>
<P>
   The Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg, with the family
crypt for 300 years of Romanovs, is where the remains will be
buried and where the ceremony will be conducted. But because the
cathedral in the fortress can hold only 150 people, attendance will
be limited to relatives and church and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Others will watch the ceremony on a public square outside the
fortress, where television screens will be set up with
translations. The ceremony is scheduled to begin at about 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tudor Tour
</P>
<P>
   Q. A high school graduate I know will be in England this autumn.
She has a fanatical interest in Tudor history, and wants to visit
relevant sites. Chances are, the friends she travels with won't be
as interested in the subject. Are there Tudor clubs she could
contact in England to meet like-minded people? _ John Charles,
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is at least one, and your young Tudor fan will get a
much friendlier greeting than the one Henry Tudor gave to King
Richard III at the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when Henry's
forces defeated those of Richard, who was slain in the process.
Henry began the Tudor dynasty as King Henry VII, and was followed
by Henry VIII, who in turn was followed by his three children:
Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. But all three of the third
generation of Tudor monarchs were childless, and so in 1603, the
dynasty faded.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the Tudor banner is upheld by the Tudor Group, 16
Lower St., Quainton, Bucks HP22 4BJ, telephone (44-1296) 655309,
run by Mark and Ruth Goodman. They do a variety of events
throughout the year to recreate Tudor history. The group has
members throughout the country, according to Ruth Goodman, and she
can put you in touch with local members.
</P>
<P>
   A Tudorite will feel at home at Kentwell Hall, Long Melford,
Suffolk CO10 9BA; (44-1787) 310207. The main part of this private
home dates from 1520. The domestic history of the period will come
to life here on Sept. 19 and 20 with up to 250 people in costume
showing what it was like to be anything from a peasant to a lord.
It's an hour by train from Liverpool Station in London to Sudbury.
Open Sundays in September and October from noon to 5 p.m., 11 a.m.
to 6 p.m. on Sept. 19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
   English Heritage helps organize living-history events and has a
calendar listing them. Tudor events in the autumn include ``Murder
and Mis-Marriage: the Two King Henrys,'' Sept. 19 and 20 at St.
Augustine's Abbey, Kent. Henry II and Henry VIII are featured, as
well as Anne of Cleves. For the strong of stomach, ``A Tudor
Surgeon'' at Deal Castle, Kent, on Oct. 17 and 18, is a look at
16th-century medicine. Contact English Heritage, Customer Services,
Post Office Box 9019, London W1A 0JA; (44-171) 973-3434.

<P>
   A Papal Visit
</P>
<P>
   Q. I understand that Pope John Paul II plans to visit the United
States again. If so, where will he go and how can I find out about
attending any Mass that he might celebrate? _ Jim Hunt, Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. If all goes as planned, the pope will be in St. Louis in
January to celebrate a Mass there and see the head of the St. Louis
archdiocese, Archbishop Justin Rigali. But details are sketchy at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop and pope knew each other for many years while
they worked together in the Vatican and became close friends,
according to Maureen Bergin of the archdiocese offices; in 1994,
the pope appointed Rigali to his current post.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergin said that tentative plans called for the pope to fly
from Mexico to St. Louis on Jan. 26 and celebrate a Mass the
following day in the Trans World Dome, the 66,000-seat domed
football stadium near the Mississippi a few blocks north of the
Gateway Arch.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergin said that there were no ticket-distribution plans,
and no additional details are likely to be announced until after
the papal planning team's visit around Labor Day. She suggests that
you call her at (314) 533-1887 sometime after.
</P>
<P>
   Live From the Falls
</P>
<P>
   Q. A while ago, I saw a telecast of ``Live! With Regis and Kathy
Lee'' from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. They stayed in a
large hotel with great views of the falls. Which hotel was it, and
how can I get there by bus or train from New York City? How long
will it take by car? _ Mary Li, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Usually, you wouldn't want to stay in a hotel where the water
runs all night. But not in this case. As for which hotel you saw,
the Niagara Falls Canada Visitor and Convention Bureau says it
could have been either of two featured on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheraton Fallsview, (800) 267-8439, charges $184 (at $1.41
Canadian to the United States dollar), with breakfast, for a double
room with a falls view, $138 without, in summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Skyline Foxhead, (800) 263-7135, charges $170 to $205 in
summer for a falls view, $127 to $162 without; no meals included.
</P>
<P>
   Two bus companies serve Niagara Falls, Ontario, from the Port
Authority Bus Terminal at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue in
Manhattan. Trailways, (800) 858-8555, and Greyhound, (800)
231-2222, have numerous departures daily to Buffalo, where you
transfer to a Canadian line. Round-trip fare is about $110; 10 to
12 hours depending on number of stops.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak service from New York to Niagara Falls, Ontario, takes
about 9 to 10 hours each way, with round-trip fares of about $120.
Call (800) 872-7245 for exact schedules and fares.
</P>
<P>
   By car, it is about 400 miles; allow 9{ to 10 hours. Ask your
insurer for a nonresident liability-insurance card for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Native-born Americans should take a birth certificate and a
photo I.D.; naturalized citizens should carry their naturalization
certificate. Passports suffice for both.

   Ambiguous Fish
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that some fish are both male and female?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, some fish are simultaneously hermaphroditic, possessing
the reproductive equipment of both sexes at one time; a few can
fertilize their own eggs. In some species, called sequential
hermaphrodites, an individual can change from male to female, from
female to male or back and forth. Some fish species are entirely
female and reproduce by cloning their own DNA, though the process
is triggered by sperm from males of closely related species.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion from male to female is called protandry; conversion
from female to male is called protogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Sex changes in fish were once thought to be extremely rare. It
is now known that changes from female to male occur in at least 14
families and changes from male to female in at least 8.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of a reef fish called the bluehead wrasse, reported
in 1984, sexual identity and behavior were found to vary with the
density of the population and the size of the reef. For example,
sometimes a large dominant male fertilized the eggs of many
females, and sometimes fish took turns releasing eggs to be
fertilized by sperm of other fish, which in turn released eggs for
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   In another wrasse species, a solitary male fertilized the eggs
of several females; if the male died, one of the harem became male.
</P>
<P>
   In some hermaphroditic species, the adaptation is thought to
help insure reproductive success when other members of the species
are few and far between. Changes in fishes' sex are presumed to be
influenced by hormones, but the mechanism is not fully understood.
</P>

FAITH DIRECTS THESE PILGRIMS' LONG WALK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA SMITH 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zen Buddhists and agnostics, Catholics and holyrolling Baptists,
Bahai and Unitarians and Pentecostals, whites, blacks, sinners, and
candidates for sainthood lined up at 7 a.m. yesterday for ham
quiche, apples, cantaloupe, poppyseed bagels, thick slabs of raisin
bread, honey, cream cheese, jam, coffee, and tea. It was spiritual
sustenance, necessary fuel for an eclectic assemblage of pilgrims
who would later lace up battered Reeboks and Nikes, swig warm water
from rippled plastic bottles, and take yet another step toward
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The meal at Cambridge's First Baptist Church _ a site that once
was a station on the Underground Railroad _ was a brief respite for
members of the Interfaith Pilgrimage of the Middle Passage, a
journey that began at the Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist Peace Pagoda
in Leverett last week. A determined core group of approximately 60
walkers set out on a year-long trek retracing the route of the
slave trade through the United States, the Caribbean, Brazil, West
Africa, and South Africa. Others will participate in segments of
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   In this physical reversal of the horrific passage in which
millions lost their lives, the pioneers hope to redefine the word
``freedom.'' They can't erase the bitter reality of slavery, but
they can teach new ways to live with its legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a journey of group consciousness,'' said Kansas City
native Clyde Love, 38, who intends to walk all the way. ``My
personal reason for doing this is not important. I will say this,
though _ I will not teach my child one thing about racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Anderson, a 23-year-old native of Northampton, will
rejoin the trek in New Orleans, where the pilgrims set sail for the
Caribbean. After that, he's in for the duration. ``The whole
journey is a walking, living prayer,'' he said. ``I feel at home
with the spirituality of it all. This is not, I repeat, not a
political event.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge banner above the table of food was a welcome to the
walkers from the children of the Cambridgeport Children's Center,
who, at 7 a.m., were probably all asleep, dreaming of less weighty
matters, unaware of the impact their message had on the gathering.
To join symbolically in the march, they had dipped their bare feet
in paint and walked the width of the banner. Some of the tiny
footprints were brown, some rust, others peach, some white. ``We'll
ride on their shoulders,'' said Erika Koslow, a 20-year-old
divinity student who'll officially join the march in Philadelphia
on June 25. ``Those strong little feet will carry us whenever we
get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reclaimed my life for this,'' said co-organizer Ingrid
Askew. ``This is about unearthing the truth and keeping it above
ground for the world to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Marching several blocks through sleepy Cambridge streets to St.
Paul AME Church, the drum-beating, flag-waving group loud-whispered
a Buddhist prayer before roaring out a chant of its own making. To
the strains of ``Sunshine in My Soul'' by the church choir, the
doors opened and the interfaith travelers filed into pews reserved
for them. It was a thrilling sight _ Asians with dreadlocked hair
and unwieldy backpacks, a wispy redhead with four rings in her
right nostril, aging hippies, businessmen in pinpoint Oxfords, the
gleaming bald heads of Buddhists, cameras clunking, gym shoes
squeaking, tie-dye and spandex alongside the crisp white uniforms
and erect bearing of brown-skinned ushers, stiff Sunday-suited
greeters, and the impeccably dressed matrons of the AME church.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation's prayers were driven, fervent, thanking God
for the journey. And meant to grant the workers Godspeed: ``We
know, God, even in the midst of all our struggles that You are the
one who brought us out, resurrected us, stood us on our feet,
enabled us to call Your name.'' The singing was urgent,
celebratory, and infectious, with much stomping of tired, calloused
feet. In a shaking, barely audible voice, Earline Robertson, a
43-year-old grandmother from Amherst, presented the Rev. LeRoy
Attles with a keychain _ one of 2,000 she has handmade to
distribute to friends along the passage.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is marching even though she just had a cervical disc
removed. ``I know my pain will stop once I bring my ancestors
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   We'd do well not to lose sight of these pilgrims. They are part
of a journey fueled by song and great gushes of spirit, by the
insistent heat of history and maybe most of all by the sight of a
young white kid in chunky sneakers and beige corduroy pants
streaked with grime. Removed from slavery's shame by time and
privilege, he hunched over in the pew of Saint Paul, weeping into
his cupped hands.

BRITISH CAST SPOTLIGHT ON MISCONDUCT IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little can rival the misery of a medical researcher who
discovers that a co-author has committed scientific misconduct. One
who feels that most keenly is Dr. Cameron Bowie, emeritus director
of public health in Somerset, England.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bowie retracted a published paper that had been
influential in developing health policy on community care in
England and that was incorporated in national testing of public
health doctors. The paper, on the need for and cost-effectiveness
of community-based care for the disabled, had won acclaim for Bowie
and his co-author, Dr. Mark H. Williams. Fellow researchers had
called it a fundamental report.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie had trumpeted the findings with gusto until British
officials found that Williams had committed scientific misconduct,
including falsifying statistics in another research paper.
Williams, a trusted friend, had put Bowie's scientific credentials
into question, and in an interview last week, Bowie said his
``reaction was one of disbelief that it could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Medical Journal published Bowie's retraction in an
issue focusing on various forms of scientific misconduct, like
fabrication of data, plagiarism, redundant publication and conflict
of interest between reviewers and authors.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a string of recent cases, the journal's editor, Dr.
Richard Smith, said that scientific misconduct was a bigger problem
than scientists were willing to admit and called for a national
body with powers to investigate researchers without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Though most scientists have contended that scientific misconduct
is a trivial problem, it has been the focus of congressional
inquiries in the United States, and after years of inactivity is
drawing increasing attention in many other countries. Medical
leaders say that scientific misconduct flourishes, despite their
efforts to encourage research institutions to detect and eliminate
it. The magnitude of misconduct is unknown, and its detection is
largely serendipitous. It is an international problem because
scientists from one country routinely publish in other countries'
journals.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a White House committee is to review a final draft
of a plan to develop uniform governmentwide policies for research
misconduct in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie's retracted paper described the unmet needs for ways to
allow 181 severely disabled adults to live independently. The paper
said the patients were interviewed and examined in 1989 and 1990.
The study found that health professionals inadequately monitored
such needs but that assistance from a social worker in a
coordinated approach could sccessfully improve care at minimal
cost. Bowie and Williams published the research in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996 Bowie was shocked to learn that Williams, who had
moved to a nearby university, faced disciplinary action for
falsifying statistics in another research paper, forging letters of
recommendation and citing bogus degrees and qualifications to
secure academic positions.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie, hoping to find evidence to support Williams and to
forestall any challenge to their joint paper, searched for the
questionnaires and computerized records of their study but could
not find them. So, using Williams' list, he visited the patients to
check they had been interviewed. None said they had.
</P>
<P>
   In February, acting on the other charges, British officials
revoked Williams' medical license. Bowie said he moved to retract
the paper because he ``could not assume the information was bona
fide.'' Bowie said he had confronted Williams, who at their most
recent meeting last week repeated denials that he had fabricated
the data.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Williams by telephone were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Editors say co-authors must check each other's original data,
not just the compilations, before publishing a report. But such
checking is impractical, particularly for large multicenter
studies, Bowie said.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as naive for not checking Williams' data,
Bowie said he now believed that ``when research findings are
important, a co-author must be more suspicious than you otherwise
might be'' and must scrutinize the raw data.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also need to store original records systemically so
that years later any qualified scientist could study them for any
of a number of reasons beyond checking their validity, Bowie said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No one has systematically reviewed Williams' other publications
to determine if they were flawed, said Dr. Richard Smith, editor of
The British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Misconduct in research, if it is detected, is usually lethal to
a scientist's career. Yet, an unknown number of scientists
plagiarize, fabricate and falsify evidence, apparently believing
they will not get caught.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said: ``Editors have decided that we can no longer ignore
misconduct,'' and recent experience shows ``that once editors begin
to pay serious attention to misconduct, it is there before their
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because taxpayers often finance medical care and because
fraudulent research can put lives at risk, protecting the public
from misconduct in research is a public health measure similar to
protecting the water supply or safety of foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely public concern about the entry of erroneous material in
biomedical publication on health and disease is at least of equal
importance'' as such standard health protection measures, Dr.
Michael J. Farthing, a leading gastroenterologist, wrote in The
British Medical Journal. Farthing is editor of Gut, a British
medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the journal focused on scientific misconduct in
England, the message holds elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Drummond Rennie, a deputy editor of The Journal of the
American Medical Association, advised British officials in an
article in The British Medical Journal to learn from experience in
the United States. In the 1980s, when congressional committees
looked into research misconduct, responses from institutions were
often ``slow, bungled, idiosyncratic, and unfair to almost
everyone,'' Rennie said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his experience as deputy editor of The New England
Journal of Medicine 20 years ago when it published a fraudulent
research report, Rennie cited an editorial written by Dr. Arnold S.
Relman, then the journal's editor. ``A request from an editor for
primary data to support the honesty of an author's findings in a
manuscript under review would probably poison the air and make
civil discourse between authors and editors even more difficult
than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the British journal, Farthing wrote: ``From an editor's point
of view, doing one's duty is simplified if fraudulent material is
actually published. In this case, retraction of explanation is
required, the matter is in the public domain, and the offenders
face public disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   To aid in dealing with a more difficult problem _ what to do
with an unpublished suspect manuscript on an editor's desk _ Smith
led the creation of a self-help group for editors. Formation of the
group grew out of an informal meeting in 1997 when a group of
editors, mostly in England, discussed the lack of clear guidelines
on scientific misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   At a second meeting last fall, a larger group of participants
``confirmed our worst suspicions: misconduct continues to thrive in
all its various forms,'' Farthing wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said they were frustrated at having only limited
powers to deal with questions of research dishonesty that were
raised in editing manuscripts. Editors contend they have neither
the mandate nor the money to investigate. Most said they usually
rejected suspect papers without informing responsible officials at
the medical centers where the authors worked. And no one tracks how
often the manuscripts suspected of being dishonest were published
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that in its first year the group reviewed 25 cases
without knowing the names of the authors. The problems included
plagiarism and conducting trials without receiving permission from
an ethics committee. When the group referred a case to the British
licensing council involving a doctor who said he had tested an
unusual combination of drugs in many patients, Smith said, they
learned that the author had already lost his license.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals have been made for journals to randomly audit papers
as a quality control measure. But editors have repeatedly rejected
them.

TEXAS PRISONERS BUILD ON FAITH TO HELP ON HABITAT PROJECT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Art available on NYT photo service) 
 
By ERIC BERGER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Thugs, rapists and even murderers _ it will take them
all to ensure that Jimmy Carter Work Project volunteers achieve
their goal of building 100 homes next week.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the weeklong project, 25 Texas inmates from Jester
Unit II in nearby Huntsville will build one of the homes. Many of
the prisoners have already assisted with pre-building activities at
the Habitat for Humanity's warehouse for months.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates' involvement stems from their participation in a new
faith-based program in Texas prisons called the Innerchange Freedom
Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blessed,'' said 37-year-old Gilbert Garcia who has
been in prison since 1989 for using crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-month-old initiative, started in the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice's Jester Unit II , builds upon a program pioneered
in Brazil and Ecuador more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in the program does not shorten an inmate's
sentence, said Frederick Becker, senior warden of Jester Units I,
II and III in Huntsville, about an hour north of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The ecumenical and ethical underpinning of Habitat's efforts
fits neatly within Innerchange's goal of fostering a sense of faith
and community service in the inmates, who can only join the program
during the last 18 months of their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1976, Habitat for Humanity has built
65,000 homes for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates say they have found God during their incarceration
and that participating in Habitat helps them do their part for a
society they have plundered.
</P>
<P>
   Take John Goree, a 38-year-old inmate serving a five-year
sentence. A week ago, he helped dedicate a house for a new family.
Goree said he's happy to be bringing people together, not tearing
them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great because I could feel a sense of accomplishment, a
feeling of self worth because I was part of something,'' Goree said
of the dedication. ``I was real happy that we could share in
building that home and really blessing someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular volunteers who built the Houston-area home in Missouri
City _ the prisoners' first _ said what the inmates have done in
the past does not matter at a Habitat site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very hard workers,'' said Sharon D. Heldt, president
of the Fort Bend Habitat for Humanity. ``All our volunteers
understood the program, and it wasn't like these guys were coming
here to get out of the jailhouse for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the program, the inmates rise at 5:30 a.m. for prayers.
Shortly thereafter they work at various community service
activities, including the Habitat warehouse. Later, after more
prayers, the participants have night classes before a 10:30 p.m.
bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, Goree and prisoner Walter Kasper have all been with
Innerchange since its inception in early 1997. At first, they said,
there were some difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the program's beginning a lot of people laughed at
us,'' Kasper said. ``Guys would say `I wouldn't be in that for
anything,' but now they're breaking down the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasper, a clean-shaven 44-year-old with a chiseled face topped
by a buzz-cut, says he was a ``lowly'' robber and crook before he
ended up in jail 54 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this has been a godsend,'' said Kasper, referring to
his participation in Innerchange. ``I turned 40 in prison and came
to the realization that I wasn't a nice man. This is an outlet to
assuage your own guilt to some point, to give back to the community
that we had taken from.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent hot June day, 13 inmates were at the Habitat
warehouse in north Houston and were busily piling wall sections and
loading lumber onto trucks. Nearby, some temporary help Habitat had
hired was taking a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look over there, at those guys, and they're loafing,''
said Sgt. Kevin Cooksey, one of two guards assigned to the inmates.
``But not over here. These guys are working hard and enjoying it.''

RECKLESS DRIVING CARRIES LESS RISK IN SIBERIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYUKHTET, Russia _ Slava Cherkasov gunned the engine of his
Toyota and blindly shot out into the oncoming lane, blissfully
oblivious to the fact that he could not see what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   For this was Siberia, a land of huge expanses, harsh climate,
and stoic people, a place where amazing events seem commonplace,
but a seemingly normal task can become a big deal in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   No one here blinks an eye at a snap May blizzard or the grizzly
bears that occasionally wander across the two-lane highway that
links Tyukhtet with the rest of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   And no one seems to mind that half the cars have their steering
wheels on the right-hand side rather than the left, even though in
Russia, as in the United States, cars drive on the right-hand side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   But a normal task like passing a truck on a highway becomes a
death-defying trick when you try to do it from the wrong side of
the car in a blizzard, with extra Siberian degrees of difficulty
posed by the risk of ramming some unseen bear in the oncoming lane.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Siberians can be unflappable, and Slava Cherkasov is
no exception. Consider what Cherkasov had to go through just to get
his car to Tyukhtet so that he could risk his (and my) life in it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Honest Ivan Motors in Tyukhtet, a Siberian hamlet
with one grocery store and one gas station, a small collection of
weathered wooden huts inhabited by a few thousand weathered folks.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the industrial city of Krasnoyarsk, 130 miles to the
west, it's hard to get a good deal on a car. So Cherkasov, who has
been making his living as a private taxi driver ever since
Tyukhtet's moribund lumber factory laid him off, went auto-shopping
in Nakhodka, some 2,000 miles away on Russia's Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   There, he got a great deal on a 1980 Corolla: $2,000, just off
the boat from Japan, where, as in England, steering wheels are on
the right-hand side. After taking a couple of days to get used to
driving from the wrong side of the car, Cherkasov faced the problem
of getting his car back to Tyukhtet. For Siberia's vast taiga is
not connected to the Pacific Far East by any paved road.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it helps to know a Russian word, ``zimniki.'' These are
unpaved, uncharted roads that are passable only in winter, when the
swamps and rivers freeze and the mud turns to permafrost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimniki'' are the unsung heroes of transportation in a country
whose paved roads have been rapped by everyone from Gogol to
Gorbachev. ``Zimniki'' bailed out the Red Army in Stalingrad.
``Zimniki'' remain the best way to get around Siberia today. And it
was a network of ``zimniki,'' plus a good set of radials, that got
Cherkasov and his Toyota out of the Far East and back to Tyukhtet.
</P>
<P>
   Tyukhtet got its paved highway only eight years ago, and all the
villages to the north along the Chulym River are reachable only by
water and ``zimniki.'' This semi-isolation has magnified the
hardships of rural Russian life _ high prices, rising unemployment,
rampant alcoholism, and chronically late paychecks for those who do

   Cherkasov, who lives with his wife and 8-year-old daughter,
pumps water from a well and keeps a wood stove burning to heat his
two-room hut. The low standard of living in Tyukhtet is one of the
few amazing things that locals have not stopped noticing. The bleak
steppe that stretches from Krasnoyarsk to Tyukhtet is dotted with
the smoke billowing from aluminum smelters. They must be making
money. Where does all that money go?
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasov doesn't have an answer to that one. But as he blindly
gunned his right-hand-wheel Toyota into the oncoming lane, he had
the answer to the only question that mattered at that moment: This
being Siberia, chances are you and that truck up ahead are the only
ones on the road.

TEXAS PROSECUTOR CHALLENGES CONFISCATION OF FILES BY FEDERAL
AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER and CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Federal agents who raided the Webb County
district attorney's office appear to be searching for a link
between the way certain criminal cases were handled and the
personal finances of key people in that office.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page search warrant that FBI agents used to cart away
thousands of case files and documents beginning the evening of May
29 hints broadly that such a link is at the heart of the
investigation that has caused an uproar in this south Texas border
city.
</P>
<P>
   That warrant, a copy of which was obtained Friday by the San
Antonio Express-News, authorized FBI agents to seize not only
thousands of criminal case files, but computer disks, phone
records, and foreign and domestic bank account information for
District Attorney Joe Rubio, members of his staff and his father.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant says agents were hunting for documentation showing
not only how criminal cases were tried, but decisions in which
charges were dropped and where defendants entered into a plea
bargain or were placed on pretrial diversion by Rubio's office.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant, signed by U.S. District Judge John Rainey, further
authorized FBI agents to seize memorandums and ethics policies
regarding interaction between the district attorney's office and
bail bond companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned all that stuff over,'' Rubio said. ``Certainly
pretrial agreements are a matter of public record.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubio declined to comment specifically on what federal agents
were investigating. No charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The way Rubio's office handled 128 cases referred to it for
prosecution is at the center of the federal investigation, which
has brought many FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents to this
border city.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, agents have gone after the personal financial
records of 14 people including Rubio, his father, eight workers in
the district attorney's office, a former state district judge, a
bail bondsman, a justice of the peace and a former Webb County
jailer.
</P>
<P>
   The search of Rubio's office, other offices and homes triggered
several legal motions after federal officials refused to make
public the search warrants or return the seized files.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Express-News filed a motion Thursday with
Rainey's court in Victoria, Texas, asking him to unseal the search
warrants and all supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Donato Ramos, an attorney hired to represent the
district attorney's office, filed an emergency motion here Friday
to get the federal judge to order the return of as many as 5,000
criminal case files which were seized from Rubio's office.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings on those motions are scheduled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rubio said that although some files have been returned, his
office is paralyzed without the remaining documents.
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed to indicate the district attorney's office is
through cooperating with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shifting gears in the sense that we need the return of
these files,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to asking that the records and files be returned,
Ramos asked that the affidavit supporting the request for the
search warrants be unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   And the motion challenged the validity of the search warrant on
technical grounds, since it authorized the FBI to seize records in
Rubio's office on the east side of the fourth floor of the county
courthouse. Rubio's office is on the west side, the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly 5,000 files and other documents were seized from
the district attorney's office, the government will be hard-pressed
to explain why it needs all those records, said attorneys familiar
with federal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ramos' motion was accompanied by a three-page affidavit signed
by Webb County First Assistant District Attorney Monica Zapata
Notzon.
</P>
<P>
   Notzon, who has been with Rubio's office nearly eight years,
said FBI agents seized information unrelated to any of the 128
names whose cases were listed on the search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, Notzon said in her affidavit, took more than 4,000
closed files and 1,374 active files or pending investigations,
including nearly 300 domestic violence protective orders, during
the three-day raid.
</P>
<P>
   Had the agents restricted the search to the 128 names on the
search warrant, they would have seized no more than 300 files, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Documents taken included files for drug cases, at least one
attempted murder, misdemeanor theft and bond forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said she questioned why agents were taking a
domestic violence manual from a prosecutor not named in the
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Agents agreed to leave the manual but still took other items
from his office, she said.

NEW METHODS EMPLOYED TO FIGHT INVASIVE PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN.: Fla., Texas, Ore., Calif., Mont. ) 
(ja) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   They could easily make tabloid headlines:
</P>
<P>
   ``Killer Smothers Hawaiian Host''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eurasian Beauty Stalks Wetlands''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stream-Side Slayer Strikes Again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aussie Strangler Sweeps Through Florida''
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse Poisoning Horror!''
</P>
<P>
   Committing these acts of violence are a rogues' gallery growing
out of control in fields, forests, marshes, stream sides and
waterways throughout the country: invasive plants.
</P>
<P>
   Even backyard gardens are likely to harbor one or more of the
rascals waiting for an opportunity to mount a horticultural coup
d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous invaders with roots, leaves, shoots and seeds are
running roughshod over native plants, changing the quality of the
soil, water and landscape and wiping out countless creatures _ from
microorganisms to mammals _ that cannot withstand the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Randall, an invasive plant specialist with the Nature
Conservancy and the University of California at Davis, said,
``Invasive plants are the second most serious threat, after habitat
loss, to native species of plants and animals and to maintaining
biologically diverse ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Not counting those in Hawaii, with nearly as many imported
invaders as native plants, at least 300 species of invasive plants
threaten native ecosystems in the United States and the Canadian
provinces, said Janet Marinelli, director of publishing at the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden and co-editor with Randall of its
publication, ``Invasive Plants: Weeds of the Global Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marinelli noted that half the invaders were brought to the
United States and Canada to beautify streets and gardens, among
them purple loosestrife, foxglove, Japanese barberry, Norway maple
and Scotch broom. But many of the imports arrived without their
natural enemies _ the insects, microorganisms and competing plants
that keep them in check back home.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the imports spread uncontrolled and drove out
native species of plants and animals, killed off cattle and
irrevocably altered environments. But now, scientists are launching
biological counterattacks that show promise of holding at least
some of the invasive plants in check. Their weapons include an
injectable contraceptive, imported insects that dine exclusively on
the invaders and old-fashioned weed-pulling by hordes of human
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   To date, they can claim few victories. But among most successful
has been the conquest of the dreaded alligator weed, large mats of
which had been choking the Everglades waterways. By introducing a
flea beetle and moth that dine on it, biologists reduced the plant,
originally from South America, to scattered strands.
</P>
<P>
   In their search for effective control measures that cause no
harm to desirable species or to the general environment, scientists
scour a plant's native turf searching for insects and pathogens
that attack them and only them. Before such pests can be released
in test plots, however, they must pass stringent laboratory tests
to be sure the control agents will not become pests themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Isaacson, an entomologist who is special projects
coordinator at the Oregon Department of Agriculture in Salem, said
one was an ``eat it or die'' test in which the insect is given
nothing but the target plant to eat. The second is a choice test
that allows the insect to choose between the target plant and a
related one. Isaacson explained that most plant pests are very
fussy about what they feed on, generally restricting themselves to
a single plant or group of closely related plants.
</P>
<P>
   But even with effective biological control measures in hand, the
effort can be stymied by unexpected complications, like finding
that an endangered species of bird is nesting preferentially in the
very tree designated to die.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the most offensive of the invaders:
</P>
<P>
   Purple Loosestrife. This Eurasian native of uncommon beauty with
tall showy spikes of purple flowers that bloom profusely in
midsummer has colonized countless wetlands nationwide, replacing
native vegetation in marshes, meadows, riverbanks and lake shores.
In the process, it has threatened the survival of rare plants and
reduced food and shelter for wildlife. Having failed to control it
by flooding, burning, mowing and dousing it with herbicides,
scientists at Cornell University are now making progress using
insects that attack the plant in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernd Blossey of the New York State College of Agriculture
and Life Sciences at Cornell said that a root-feeding weevil, two
leaf-feeding beetles and a weevil that attacks the flowers had been
put to work in more than 1,000 wetland sites in 32 states. Although
so-called infertile cultivars of purple loosestrife are now sold in
nurseries, Blossey said they could produce viable seeds and should
not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Melaleuca. This tree may be as serious a threat to the survival
of the Florida Everglades as humans who drain its water supply. A
native of northern Australia and New Guinea with bottle-brush
spikes of white flowers, the melaleuca was imported in 1900 as an
ornamental that needed little or no care. Randall said it was also
used to dry up the Everglades when people thought the marsh was
bad. It now infests more than 1.5 million acres of Florida's
natural land and is spreading rapidly, with each mature tree
producing 60 million seeds a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Center, research entomologist with the Agricultural
Research Service in Fort Lauderdale, said that a half-inch-long
gray weevil that helped to keep the melaleuca under control in its
native Australia was the first hope for slowing the Florida
invasion. This weevil has a healthy appetite for the growing tips
where the flower clusters form and seeds are produced. The first
groups of weevils released last year at 10 sites seem to be
thriving, Center said, adding that it was too soon to see any
effect on the tree itself.
</P>
<P>
   Eight or 10 other insects that can launch different attacks on
melaleuca are also being studied, Center said. The current plan, he
added, calls for integrating various biological controls with more
traditional methods, like injecting them with herbicides and
cutting them down.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tamarisk. Also known as salt cedar, this native of Asia was
introduced in 1837 as an ornamental and later to stabilize stream
sides in the West. But the population exploded some 60 years ago,
leading to its current dubious distinction as ``the No. 1 weed pest
in the West,'' said Dr. C. Jack DeLoach, a research entomologist
for the Agricultural Research Service in Temple, Texas. He listed
its detractions: ``It has no value to native animals, it lowers the
ground-water table so that other plants can't reach it, it deposits
layers of salt on the soil so that other plants can't grow there,
it's extremely flammable and, after a fire, nothing but salt cedar
can come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Field tests of two biological control agents _ an Asian beetle
that eats the foliage and an Israeli mealy bug that sucks sap from
the twigs and kills them _ are being held up by a need to assess
the effects of salt cedar control on an endangered bird, the
southwestern willow flycatcher, which has taken to nesting in the
tree in some parts of Arizona, DeLoach said. He and others believe
that the salt cedar's downfall will allow a return of the willows
that were this bird's original home.
</P>
<P>
   Leafy Spurge. About 5 million acres in 26 states, including New
York, have been invaded by leafy spurge, an herbaceous plant from
Eurasia with milky sap that gives mouth sores to cattle and
displaces grasses and other cattle food, rendering range land
worthless. Ranchers tried putting sheep on spurge-infested range.
Although they eat the plant, they do not kill it and there is not
enough of a market for sheep wool and meat. So about 13 insects
have been imported to help control it. Dr. Neal Spencer, an
entomologist at a Department of Agriculture research laboratory in
Sidney, Mont., said flea beetles had so far been most effective.
The adult beetles feed on the leaves and their larvae mine the
roots, damaging them and opening them to attack by pathogenic
fungi.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Star Thistle. This lovely looking weed from the
Mediterranean basin is strong enough to kill a horse outright, said
Dr. Juozaf Balciunas, a federal entomologist in Albany, Calif. In
most of the 20 million acres it now invades, it is the No. 1 range
plant pest, he said. It also invades vineyards. Control efforts are
so costly that farmers often just abandon the land to the prolific
plant. Five insects that attack it by dining on the flowers and
fruits have become ``pretty well established'' and are beginning to
make a dent on the number of plants in test areas, Balciunas said.
But the plant fights back; when there are fewer of them, each one
grows bigger, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Norway Maple. The majestic look of this popular Eurasian import
(it is the most planted street tree in the country) belies its
aggressiveness. Its seeds spread readily into open lots and forest
preserves, and a single tree can produce ``thousands of babies each
year,'' said Dr. Edward Toth, director of landscape management for
Prospect Park in Brooklyn. It is highly tolerant of shade, expert
at extracting nutrients and water from the soil and little, if
anything, can grow under its dense canopy. Native trees like the
sugar maple and beeches do not stand much of a chance around it.
</P>
<P>
   Toth is awaiting a permit to practice Norway maple birth
control, using a product called Florel, which is already sold as a
spray for trees to keep them from setting fruit. Since spraying a
60-foot tree is neither practical nor safe, Toth expects to inject
it directly into the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Scotch Broom. This highly prolific leguminous shrub with a
profusion of yellow pea-like flowers spreads through its long-lived
seeds and roots. Native to Europe and North Africa, it can thrive
on nitrogen-poor soil, since it makes its own fertilizer. It is
highly flammable, capable of carrying fire into the canopy of
neighboring trees. Isaacson in Salem, Ore., said a seed weevil
intentionally introduced in the West has reduced seed production by
75 percent over half the plant's range so far. However, for better
control, a 95 percent reduction in seed production is needed, which
may be provided by an accidentally imported beetle. Use of the
beetle is pending government approval.
</P>
<P>
   The list of nonnative plants that are able to escape natural
controls and invade areas where they are not wanted includes many
species that are still being purposely planted in gardens. They
include foxglove, vinca, periwinkle, myrtle, jasmine and bachelor
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marinelli of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden said that before
planting an import, home gardeners should check on the conditions
under which it has become invasive and avoid planting it in a
similar environment. ``If, for example, a plant from Italy became
invasive in Australia, you wouldn't want to plant it in Southern
California,'' Ms. Marinelli said. But, she added, no source of
information on the invasiveness potential of various plants is
widely available. Ms. Marinelli believes it should become a common
category in gardening guides, similar to the listing of planting
zones.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities caution that not all non-native species are harmful.
Those that assimilate well and coexist peacefully with the native
stock are of little concern. And, every invasive import is not
necessarily a problem everywhere in its range. A species may be
highly invasive in one area but lack takeover muscle elsewhere.  &QL;

KEN STARR MAY BE DEMOCRATS' TOP ASSET IN NOVEMBER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT F. JORDAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is one person who can persuade the nation's voters to
return control of the US House to the Democrats, it's independent
counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr, a Republican, personally would prefer a
GOP-controlled House, his relentless pursuit of President Clinton
is making voters tire not only of him, but of the Republicans and
their efforts to exploit, in Starr's words, this ``serious criminal
investigation'' into Clinton's sex life for their own partisan
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now even the US Supreme Court has said, in essence, that he went
too far when he asked the nation's highest court for a quick ruling
over whether Secret Service agents and a senior White House aide
can be forced to testify before a grand jury. The court in just two
paragraphs told Starr Thursday that his bid for a quick ruling was
rejected and that Clinton's appeal will have to go through the
traditional appellate process, which could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr had won a string of legal victories in lower
courts, it is clear that the latest ruling has trumped, in terms of
public opinion in this high-stakes duel, Starr's earlier court
wins.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the decision gives Clinton and his White House
support team the advantage of appearing to have the court side with
him against Starr. And this view is not only helping Clinton, it is
helping the Democrats in their quest to regain control of the House
in the November election. Despite GOP claims that Clinton's appeal
is simply another strategic effort to stall Starr's investigation,
the court's ruling does far more damage to Starr than it does to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling pushes back the clock as to when Starr will
submit his case to Congress, it is possible that most Republicans
in the GOP-controlled Congress are breathing a sigh of relief over
the court's rejection of Starr's bid to expedite the investigation.
They will not have to act on an investigation being conducted by an
unpopular independent counsel against a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats know they have at least a chance this year to
recapture the House _ thanks to Starr, Clinton's popularity, a
generally do-nothing GOP-dominated Congress, and the attempts of
the GOP right to push through its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton taking much of the credit for the good things
happening in this country, including a still-vibrant economy, the
Democrats are increasingly optimistic that they can topple the
11-seat margin that the GOP has over the number of Democrats in the
House. The GOP is aware that while it has the most seats and the
most money, the Democrats have a growing number of voters
gravitating toward them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are going to get a lot of help from organized
labor, which won a major victory in California last week when
voters rejected a referendum that would have severely hampered
unions from raising funds to support political efforts such as
helping Democrats regain the House.
</P>
<P>
   After an intensive education campaign by the AFL-CIO and other
unions, voters realized that the so-called ``paycheck protection
act'' was not written to protect union workers' paychecks, since
such protections are already in place, but rather was a disguised
GOP effort to cripple organized labor's fiscal ability to help
Democrats defeat Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, despite the problems swirling around his presidency, is
also helping other Democrats by remaining high in opinion polls,
which suggests that voters are more interested in what Clinton is
doing for them than what Starr is doing against Clinton. Clinton
and the Democrats hope that Starr and his investigation continue to
wear thin on voters and that no new scandal erupts that could
breathe life back into Starr's quest, and the GOP's haste, to get
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats' best weapon as nemesis these days, as House
Speaker Newt Gingrich was two years ago, is Starr. Without him, the
public might be less sympathetic toward Clinton if the
investigation had been about more than whether he tried to cover up
alleged sex with a White House intern. Without Starr, the Supreme
Court would not have delivered the victory for Clinton and the
defeat for the independent counsel. And without Starr, the
Democrats might not have had a remote possibility of recapturing
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The November election, of course is still five months away, and
anything can happen in that length of time. However, if the economy
continues to perform well, and Starr continues to perform poorly,
the Democrats may pull an upset in the House. And a Democratic
House, of course, would be much more to Clinton's liking during the
last two years of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   If this happens, Clinton and the Democrats might consider a
toast to the one Republican who helped to make it possible: Starr.

INTERNATIONAL MILITARY FORCE FOR KOSOVO URGED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called on
President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to join in
preventing an all-out war in Kosovo, as the use of international
troops appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute phone conversation Sunday, Blair and Clinton
discussed the possibility of using force to halt Serbian attacks on
ethnic Albanians. Blair, trying to forge a united response from
several nations, called Yeltsin and urged him not to oppose efforts
to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest language of recent days, Blair told Yeltsin
that the international community, including Russia, must stop the
``barbarism'' in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. During the
half-hour conversation, Blair asked Yeltsin to summon ``whatever
influence he has'' to persuade Slobodan Milosevic, president of the
Yugoslav Federation, to stop the killings. Serbia and Montenegro
are the two remaining republics of the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Blair, Clinton, and other Western leaders are
expected to authorize the use of troops to stop the bloodshed. At
the United Nations, the United States and Britain reportedly have
decided to seek an agreement authorizing ``all necessary measures''
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That is strong diplomatic language that would give NATO the
legal grounds to enter the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton decides to use force, he may initially have support
from Capitol Hill. Senate majority leader Trent Lott suggested that
he would support dispatching troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow this slaughter to occur,'' the Mississippi
Republican said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``Once again the
Serbians are out of control. ... I'm not saying we should not
consider troops if it continues the way it is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst Hannum, a professor of international relations at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, cautioned
that American and European leaders still have not agreed on clear
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The West has not endorsed independence for Kosovo, he said, yet
it is close to sending troops to the Kosovo-Serbian border _ a
maneuver that would seem to signal support for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to have troops poised, but I still wonder what
their purpose will be once they get in there,'' Hannum said.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-ups of violence in Kosovo and the flight of thousands
of refugees have rekindled old arguments about the obligations of
the United States and Western Europe in the ethnic and political
battles that rage in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton
administration's peace negotiator for Bosnia, said the West needs
to talk tough and back up its threats with troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're engaged in is classic preventative diplomacy,''
said Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton peace accord of 1995 and
has been predicting violence in Kosovo for several months. ``There
is a mutual European-American mistake, and that is not realizing
the core lesson from Bosnia: The end of the Cold War did not mean
the end of America's obligations around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and Robert Gelbard, US envoy to the area, have warned
that violence in Kosovo could spread to nearby areas with ethnic
tensions, including Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Albanians are the overwhelming majority in Kosovo, where
several hundred people have been killed since fighting broke out in
February. Last week, thousands of Albanian refugees poured out of
villages destroyed by Serbian police fighting the rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA. The rebels, who are becoming more
aggressive, on Sunday called on their ethnic brethren in Albania to
take up arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA calls on all men from 18 to 55 years to join in the
struggle for the liberation of the country,'' the guerrillas said
in a statement published in an Albanian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Serb forces reportedly continued shelling suspected
militant positions in western Kosovo. Albanian television reported
that rebels had blown up the police headquarters in Ratkoc.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, a crowd of 1,000
ethnic Albanians demonstrating for independence was dispersed by
club-wielding Serbian police, who beat and injured at least six of
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton's top foreign affairs advisers will
discuss Kosovo today, a spokesman said. At least three
international forums will deal with Kosovo this week: the UN, NATO,
and the so-called Contact Group, where the West and Russia
coordinate Balkan mediation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials spent eight hours Sunday in Albania interviewing
Kosovar refugees and aid workers, according to an official of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
peacekeeping body.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will allow diplomatic observers to enter Kosovo, The
New York Times reported today. The first observer missions could
take place as early as today, the newspaper said, quoting senior
Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters saw some 50 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas slipping
across the border from Albania into Kosovo with 10 mules loaded
with ammunition. The guerrillas wore camouflaged fatigues and
carried Kalashnikov assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   , British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday that
Milosevic had ``crossed the threshold'' in the last week. ``The use
of tanks, of artillery, of the might of the military army against
civilian centers of population is wholly unacceptable within the
modern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, attempting to raise London's diplomatic profile, has held
the rotating presidency of the European Union since January. He has
tried to coordinate US discussions with Russia, which tends to side
with its fellow Slavs in Serbia. Several diplomats said they expect
Russia to use its veto power in the UN Security Council to prevent
international troops from getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   Even US officials who want to take a more active role in Kosovo
are aware that the presence of troops could irritate Serbian
nationalists, who might try to orchestrate an attack in order to
humiliate the Pentagon and force a retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly address, Pope John Paul II said the international
community ``could not stay inert before the violence, repression,
and fleeing of the population.''

RON RIDENHOUR WAS A HERO AND A BRAVE JOURNALIST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Ron Ridenhour would have appreciated the irony of
his death.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a helicopter gunner in Vietnam, he reported of
an evil that existed in the ranks, ``something rather dark and
bloody'' that took place at My Lai when Charlie Company massacred
the villagers. A year later, he returned to Vietnam as a
journalist, exposing himself to the possibility of friendly fire
from GIs resentful of his revelations that helped turn American
sentiment against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his career as a muckraking writer, Ridenhour
made other powerful enemies, inside corporate boardrooms and within
a corrupt New Orleans police force. Yet when he had a fatal heart
attack here last month at age 52, he was playing handball with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tributes have flowed since then, and a national convention of
Investigative Reporters and Editors paused here Friday to
memorialize Ridenhour for his work as a dogged, independent
journalist who never made much money but made a profound difference
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   He once won a coveted George Polk Award in connection with his
articles in CityBusiness, a local tabloid, describing scandal in
the New Orleans Finance Department. He butted heads with the
nuclear industry for Gambit, another New Orleans weekly. He
received numerous awards and was published in Time, The New York
Times Magazine, and Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   But he is best remembered for his role as a good soldier.
</P>
<P>
   As he was winding up his tour of duty in 1968, he heard from
buddies of a US Army operation that wiped out ``Pinkville,'' the
name military mapmakers gave to My Lai. ``A lot of people went
pretty crazy that day,'' one member of Charlie Company told
Ridenhour.
</P>
<P>
   Horrified, Ridenhour began to gather information from other
sources. He learned that several hundred Vietnamese civilians _
men, women and children _ were systematically executed by the Army
raiding party.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home to write a detailed three-page letter in 1969
that he sent to President Nixon, Defense Department officials, and
many members of Congress. It was an agonized account of an American
atrocity. ``Somehow I just couldn't believe that not only had so
many young American men participated in such an act of barbarism,
but that their officers had ordered it,'' Ridenhour wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person responded, Representative Morris K. Udall of
Arizona. Udall pressured the House Armed Services Committee, on
which he served, to begin an investigation that led to formal
charges against several members of Charlie Company. More
importantly, news of the massacre eventually burst on the American
consciousness, creating national revulsion against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ridenhour was always laconic in describing his brush with My
Lai, but it was an obsession that followed him all his life. He
felt My Lai was a reflection of twisted military policy, ``an
operation,'' he contended, ``rather than an aberration.'' Ridenhour
minimized his role in exposing the affair, but he eagerly accepted
invitations to talk with students on the folly of Vietnam and what
he called ``the tenuous nature of military heroism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John F. Smith, chaplain at the Groton School, once a
staging area for ``the best and the brightest'' who managed the
war, recalled that ``Ron had barely spoken a sentence to his
audience of Groton School students, the oldest of whom was born
five years after the war ended, before there was complete,
enthralled silence in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Author and former Vietnam reporter David Halberstam said
Ridenhour belonged in his ``small pantheon of heroes'' as ``an
American original, an absolutely authenic man in an age which is
increasingly inauthenic.''
</P>
<P>
   Others whose lives were changed forever in Vietnam remember
Ridenhour affectionately. ``Ron was courageous, it seemed to me, in
an old-fashioned, even ancient sort of way, brave of body and mind
and spirit,'' said Tim O'Brien, the novelist. Kevin Buckley, now an
editor at Playboy, said Ridenhour ``wanted people to know _ without
any doubt _ some of the most important truths of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after his death, dozens of Ridenhour's friends
crowded into a Lower Garden District cafe to laugh and cry and to
tell stories about his lovable gruffness and his erratic work
habits.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ridenhour produced an impressive number of magazine
articles, he never wrote a book. He was working on one when he
died. Characteristically, he was trying to document reports of
violence committed, within the US armed forces, against a unit of
black soldiers during World War II. David Corn, a writer for The
Nation, called it ``one of the best book ideas I had heard of in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Thompson, the Louisiana chopper pilot finally decorated
this year with a Soldier's Medal for his attempt 30 years ago to
stop the My Lai massacre, came to the cafe wake. Though Ridenhour
was awarded no medals, Thompson and others hailed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron would have been embarrassed to hear himself called a
hero,'' said Mary Howell, his companion for many years. ``But he
would have loved that his friends were sitting in the air
conditioning and drinking beer and talking about him for an hour
longer than was scheduled.''

GOLDWATER KNEW HOW TO SALUTE THE UNIFORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Goldwater understood partisanship, and its limits. He also
knew the meaning of patriotism. Nobody had to tell him where one
left off and the other took over. An outspoken political
conservative and a Cold War hawk, Goldwater could have taught
useful lessons to the current breed of Democrats and Republicans
who are so full of themselves and so committed to the triumph of
their own causes that they scorn both moderation and manners.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those lessons is an old military dictum about
saluting the uniform. It goes like this: If you don't respect your
commanding officer enough to salute him sincerely, then salute the
uniform he's wearing. Extend to him the courtesy and consideration
that is owed to the office he holds. This goes for presidents,
obviously _ our commanders in chief _ and for certain other people
in life. How the current breed of congressmen, most without
military service of any sort, need to master that simple rule!
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, like most members of Congress in that earlier
generation, was a veteran of World War II. We had shared, as
citizen soldiers, a common mortal endeavor on which our national
survival depended. We wished our leaders' plans well. Our lives
depended upon their success. We could grouse about those leaders,
but deliberately sabotaging them was never an option. The habit
grooves of that experience remain, carved deeply into our psyches.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after that titanic experience that altered the
course of so many lives, many legislators of both parties kept
their commissions in the reserve forces against the possibility of
being needed again for military service. We would go on active duty
three weeks each year.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill, members of the 9999th
Air Force reserve squadron met for briefings on the world situation
and military readiness. The commander of our unit was Brig. Gen.
Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats among us saw nothing amiss in this relationship. We
knew the metes and bounds of our respective military and civilian
duties. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara thought otherwise,
however, and in 1961 he disbanded the reserve military units
involving members of the legislative branch of our government.
Goldwater, along with the rest of us, accepted that verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona conservative was, in some ways, like Harry Truman.
Plain-spoken to a fault, he never hesitated to disagree with
presidents of either party when he thought one of them wrong on
public policy. He publicly faulted Richard Nixon over Watergate and
Ronald Reagan over Iran-contra, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of domestic political disagreements, he rallied to
Lyndon B. Johnson's side in August 1964 when North Vietnamese PT
boats fired repeatedly on the USS Maddox in the Tonkin Gulf and the
president ordered them and their supply base destroyed. Goldwater,
Johnson's opponent in that year's presidential election, was the
first person Johnson called, and the old soldier rallied to the
embattled president's side. Whatever their differences, he wanted
no partisan sniping to distract an American president from his
duties at a moment of international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, although trailing Johnson in the polls and
desperately needing a political break, Goldwater steadfastly
refused to pounce on the personal tragedy of one of Johnson's aides
caught in a highly publicized homosexual liaison. The GOP candidate
harshly chastized one adviser who was goading him to take partisan
advantage of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And years later, with Jerry Falwell tastelessly trying to equate
right-wing political policy with the Christian religion, Goldwater
said that Falwell deserved a ``kick in the ass.'' In the senator's
old-fashioned scale of interpersonal values, now ignored by so
many, some things were simply off-base. One was perverting religion
to political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Another was attacking an opponent's patriotism or personal
character. Among the worst, we might infer, would be to let
partisan considerations interfere with the loyalty that each of us
owes the institutions of our government and the sometimes flawed
human beings charged with protecting those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   When it became belatedly clear in April 1984 that the CIA had
illegally invaded international waters, mined Nicaraguan harbors
and covered the deed with a fabric of lies, Goldwater was incensed.
He made no secret of his anger. Governments, ours included, had to
play by the rules. The administration, then headed by a member of
Goldwater's party, was derelict in tolerating so flagrant an abuse
of international law, he said forcefully to those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Iran-contra scheme emerged, revealing a blatant
disregard for at least six laws and setting up ``impeachment''
whispers and a clamor for Reagan's scalp, calm heads prevailed. The
last thing America needed, I felt, was a frontal assault on the
president's personal character.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1987, I had been installed as speaker of the House.
Reagan had begun the last two years of his presidency. I knew his
dislike of detail, his occasional forgetfulness, his habit of
delegating broad responsibilities to others. I deliberately chose
to believe Reagan's vow that he hadn't condoned the flouting of
laws and couldn't remember ever being told of the elaborate scheme.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, I disagreed with Reagan on many issues. But I took
him at his word. He was president. I never wanted him personally
embarrassed. Then the country would be embarrassed, focus and
energy drained from great national goals. Reagan needed all his
credibility to negotiate effectively with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Some don't understand that. Maybe they've never saluted a
uniform.

MANY MALE CENTRAL AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS LEAD LONELY LIVES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHELSEA, Mass. _ The tangy aroma of beef stew wafted out a
window of a faded brick apartment building, where a flag of
Honduras rustled in the breeze. Two men sauntered in and rapped on
a door. It swung open, and a middle-aged lady wearing a
floral-print apron exclaimed, ``Ay, mis hijos, vengan.'' (Oh, my
sons, come inside.)
</P>
<P>
   Ramon and Julio stepped into a familiar world, an apartment
crowded with Central American men looking for a taste of home. In
the living room, four men at a card table leaned over bowls of
carne de res, a stew of beef, corn, cabbage, and potatoes. A
Spanish sports program blared from a TV in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, the lady placed plates full of stew, tortillas,
and white rice in front of Ramon and his friend. Ramon squeezed a
wedge of lime into the stew, stared at it, and saw the faces of his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I look, I see them,'' said Ramon, who left his five
children and wife in Honduras three years ago. ``I'm so lonely
without them. Here, at least I know I'm not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, this apartment of a Honduran grandmother _ like
a second mom to these men _ is one of dozens of places in Chelsea
where streams of lonely Central Americans congregate, to talk about
their homeland, their children, their wives, and the lives they
wish they could return to.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, they say they can't.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, where the unemployment rate ranges from 25 to 40
percent, their wives and children depend on the money they wire
weekly via Western Union, after a week of washing dishes,
assembling mattresses, loading trucks. The minimum-wage jobs make
their muscles sore and offer no benefits, but pay enough to help
their families survive. Most of them say they plan to return _
someday.
</P>
<P>
   Married men from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, almost
always illegal immigrants, are changing the face of northeastern
American cities like Chelsea, where they blend into predominantly
poor, but established, Latino communities. They live six or seven
to an apartment, scrimping to send every extra dollar home.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three weeks ago, a fire swept through four apartment
buildings on Essex Street in Chelsea, killing Roberto Lopez, an
illegal immigrant from El Salvador who shared an apartment with
seven other Central American men. He died trying to find money he
stashed under a mattress, as a roommate leaped from a third-story
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' said Oscar Chacon, executive director of Centro
Presente, a Cambridge-based agency whose mission is to help Central
Americans living in Massachusetts. ``They come here and live with
seven, eight, even 10 people in tiny apartments. They endure that
hardship for their families back home.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 85,000 illegal immigrants lived in Massachusetts in
1996, according to the most recent estimate by the US Immigration
and Naturalization Service. INS doesn't keep more specific
information on undocumented workers, but Chacon's agency estimates
there are about 20,000 undocumented Central Americans in the state.
They arrive in a steady flow each year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, INS has expelled illegal immigrants at record
pace. Men like Ramon say they break the law because they have few
alternatives. Their only work opportunity at home is often in sweat
shops of American companies, they say; the jobs pay less than their
own countries' minimum wage, or about $140 a month.

business corridor, signs in Spanish outnumber English ones.
</P>
<P>
   The melodic sounds of rancheros, Cumbias, and boleros favored in
Central America compete with the pulsating rhythms of Puerto Rican
salsas and Dominican merengues. Music is a constant, blaring from
cars and through patios, where men sit and read Spanish-language
newspapers on a hot -evening.
</P>
<P>
   It's a neighborhood largely of men.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, men fill two neighborhood laundromats, washing
clothes that, back home, their wives would scrub by hand. Nearby
fields and playgrounds are filled with men playing their beloved
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of coming here to live,'' Ramon said. ``I
don't want to be here. Every day, I think about going home, but if
I do, what will my children eat? They wouldn't be able to continue
in school.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ramon, 50, is tall and thin. He wears a silver Levi's belt
buckle with his jeans and boots, and always wears long-sleeved
shirts, even on the hottest days _ a tradition of a genteel culture
he brought with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when he wakes, he forgets where he is. His feet
planted on the low-grade carpet in his room, his dark brown eyes
focus, and he sees the sum of his American existence: a rickety
twin-sized bed, a dresser missing a drawer, five changes of clothes
hanging in the closet, a jug of Mazola corn oil, a roll of toilet
paper.
</P>
<P>
   He shares that room with Julio, a 39-year-old man from El
Salvador who sneaked into the United States 17 years ago and now
has a green card that allows him to legally live and work in the
United States. Nonetheless, Julio wants to keep his identity
hidden, so INS won't be able to track Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   They each pay $100 in rent to the main renters, a Guatemalan
couple who are also here illegally. Another man from El Salvador
rents another room. The five met in Chelsea and moved in together,
cutting down on expenses so they would have more money to send back
home.

take a two-hour bus ride to Ramon's brother's home in Honduras,
because he has a phone. Ramon anxiously calls, and the conversation
is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me to come back home. I want to ...,'' he said, his
voice wavering. He takes a breath, as tears fill his eyes. ``It's
lonely. But I don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said most of the men from his village don't live at home;
most live in cities across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole generation of Central Americans here in
America,'' said Julio, Ramon's roommate and best friend. ``Our
children are being raised without fathers. It's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Several forces created the climate that caused this influx:
political unrest, human-rights abuses, poverty. In the 1980s, when
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala were facing
rebellions, young men fled because government and rebel forces were
putting high-powered guns in their hands, forcing them to a
showdown they wanted no part of.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the case of El Salvador and Nicaragua, the US
government poured millions of dollars in military aid to squash
rebellion, and the civil wars raged on.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration patterns have changed since peace returned to those
countries. Now, many are driven by poverty, following relatives who
discovered they can make a living wage in the United States. A new
wave of immigrants _ older, married fathers _ have taken the place
of single young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population of Central Americans in the US has become a
beacon of hope for the ones left behind,'' Chacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Salvadorans in the United States sent $1.2 billion
back home, according to the Salvadoran Central Reserve Bank, which
tallies figures from banking institutions. That's a lot considering
the country, which is about the same size as Massachusetts, sells
just under $2 billion a year in coffee exports, its largest cash
crop.

when he arrived three years ago. But the money vanishes.
</P>

   He plans to save $3,000, buy two buses, and start a
transportation business. But almost every extra dollar is wired to
his family, making his dream distant and unsure.

MY PERSONAL YOSSARIAN'S LIVER? THE CROSSWORD PUZZLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a scene in Joseph Heller's classic book, ``Catch-22,''
where Yossarian is in the hospital and the doctors are trying to
figure out what's wrong with him.
</P>
<P>
   (Want to challenge whether ``Catch-22'' is a classic? A spot
check of our electronic database shows 345 hits on that phrase,
used, interestingly enough, mostly in sports and political copy.
That's a fair number, even after you exclude the references to
catching passes of 22 yards and fish of 22 pounds.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the doctor finally reaches a diagnosis: It's Yossarian's
liver.
</P>
<P>
   How, Yossarian wants to know, did he decide that?
</P>
<P>
   Because, says the doctor, he only missed one day in medical
school and it was the day they talked about livers and Yossarian
doesn't have anything he recognizes, so it must be the liver.
</P>
<P>
   There are days in this job when I feel like Yossarian and
there's a Catch-22 in everything the newspaper tries to do. A
Catch-22, by the way, is the hidden qualification that makes it
impossible to win. In the book, airmen don't have to fly combat
missions if they are crazy. But not wanting to fly combat is proof
that you are sane.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I feel like Yossarian's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: I didn't miss many days in journalism school,
but I must have been absent the day they talked about crossword
puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram managed to print the
wrong comics page, which is where we run The New York Times'
crossword.
</P>
<P>
   There's a way you can tell whether it is the right page: For one
thing, the crossword puzzle is numbered sequentially. For another,
there's generally a date somewhere in the cartoon panels.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, we used to assemble the comics pages by hand.
Now we job that out, and the page arrives as an electronic package
well in advance of the publication date. It is captured and
eventually placed on the page electronically as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   We work far in advance on some sections, so there are a lot of
comics pages floating around in the computer system. And when you
combine humans and computers, occasionally mistakes happen. In this
instance, the computer file was misnamed when it was downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   So even though we ought to be able to figure out what comics
page prints when, sometimes we don't figure it out. And when that
happens, it's the crossword puzzle fans who are the first to
notice, and they notice not so much because of the current puzzle
but because we print yesterday's answers as well.
</P>
<P>
   I don't work crossword puzzles. But judging from the reaction,
having the wrong answers in the paper is very disappointing. Having
the answers to a future puzzle is a little _ or maybe a lot _ like
rummaging through a closet and finding all your Christmas presents.
It sort of spoils the main event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I folded the answers under so I wouldn't see them,'' one
caller told me.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things you'd rather not be experienced in, and
messing up the crossword puzzle is one of them. But since we do
have some experience here, we did the only logical thing we could
do: We just reprinted the page.
</P>
<P>
   We shuddered at the expense, and we hated to give up valuable
news space to do it, but we did it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And even though I remember talking about freedom of information
and the First Amendment and ethics and the laws of libel and
headline writing and story structure and all of that in college, I
can't remember a single lecture about the importance of the comics
pages and the crossword puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame.
</P>
<P>
   You think I'm going to make fun of crossword puzzle fanatics
here, but I'm not. I'm going to make another point: A newspaper is
a collection of many things, each of them supremely important to
someone and not very important to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The day may come when we are able to print newspapers designed
specifically for one person, containing only the subject matter he
or she is interested in and delivered to the doorstep as though it
were a mass-produced product.
</P>
<P>
   You sort of already have that available through online services
such as star-telegram.com, but you have to do some of the searching
and selecting yourself rather than have a bunch of people do it for
you and assemble it into precisely the package you want.
</P>
<P>
   And even if we ever are able to completely customize a
newspaper, I'm not so sure that's a good thing. I learn a great
deal about subjects I didn't know I was interested in by stumbling
across stories about them in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, there may have been two lectures that did
deal with crossword puzzles obliquely. Both were delivered by David
McHam, who will soon begin teaching journalism at the University of
Texas at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   In one, McHam said that a newspaper is like a lumberyard. A
lumberyard that sells only two-by-fours isn't going to be in
business long, because sometimes people want doors and sometimes
they want panes of glass and sometimes they want sheets of plywood,
and you'd better have them in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspaper readers want ads and some want sports and some
want international news and some want comics and some want
crossword puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   In the other lecture, McHam asked us who the final judges were
on whether a newspaper was doing its job. The question prompted
much discussion, which ended when McHam waved toward the windows.
</P>
<P>
   The experts, he said, are out there. They are the people who buy
and read the newspaper. They are the only ones who really know.

TURKEY KEEPS THE POSTAL SERVICE AT BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Along Loughlin Street, residents may soon have to
invest in a sign that reads: Beware of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Several times over the last six months, a troublesome tom has
attacked postal trucks, pecking at their tires and preventing
carriers from delivering mail to nine homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't interfere every day,'' said Mary Madonna, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Service in Albany. ``But when it
does, the carriers can't get through without damaging the truck or
the turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the turkey and several hens have been living
peacefully in the woods surrounding the dead-end street in New
York's state capital for several years. For some reason, the bird
began attacking mail trucks over the winter, said Lloyd Hebert, 68,
a resident.
</P>
<P>
   The turkey seems to have a vendetta against mail trucks, said
Hebert, who scatters cracked corn and sunflower seeds in his yard
for the bird. No one has ever seen it attack a person or a vehicle
other than the mail truck.
</P>
<P>
   James Palmer, 76, theorized that the bird might have been
offended when a mail carrier leaned out the truck window and
gobbled at it a few months back. Hebert wondered whether the turkey
considers the eagle emblazoned on the mail truck a rival.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting Loughlin Street Friday, Karl Parker, a senior
wildlife biologist with the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, concurred with Hebert's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not inconceivable that the turkey might be in breeding
mode and perceive the eagle on the truck to be another male,''
Parker said. ``Nobody ever said turkeys had a whole lot of brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker estimated that the turkey is between 2 and 3 years old
and weighs about 17 pounds. He said the conservation department has
not yet decided whether trapping and removing the bird would be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker did suggest Hebert install a conventional bird feeder
that turkeys can't reach to discourage them from sticking around.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebert said he would rather go a few days without mail than
lose the bird, which has become the unofficial neighborhood mascot.
Neighbors pick up their mail at the post office when the truck
can't get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd miss it,'' he explained. ``We really like seeing that
turkey. In fact, we watch for him.''

PANELS OF SPECIALISTS OFFER PRESCRIPTIONS FOR A LONG, HEALTHY LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With nearly 10,000 Americans turning 50 every day, prescriptions
for long life are tumbling forth in bewildering array. Take your
vitamins. Don't bother, just eat your vegetables. Swallow a daily
dose of DHEA. No, it's dangerous. Limit your fat calories. It's the
type of fat that matters, not the amount. Work up a serious sweat.
No, brisk walks are enough. Had your selenium today? Trivalent
chromium?
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cacophany, whom should you believe?
</P>
<P>
   Two credible new prescriptions come from expert panels that
sifted through the data to glean the best up-to-date evidence on
what aging adults can do to increase their chances of a long and
healthy life.
</P>
<P>
   One collection of 14 leading gerontologists, nutritionists, and
exercise researchers, convened by a private foundation called the
International Longevity Center, last week released a report called
``Prescription for Longevity: Fads and Reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center's starting point was the fountain-of-youth claims
made for such things as DHEA (dihydropepiandosterone), a
testosterone precursor that many experts fear could spur the growth
of incipient cancer. ``We saw the need for more rational discussion
of what we really know.'' says Dr. Robert N. Butler, a New York
geriatrician who heads the Longevity Center and formerly led the
National Institute on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   The other blue-ribbon group, which met in Boston in late May,
represents the World Health Organization's first attempt to define
optimal aging guidelines for the whole planet. Its report will not
be issued for some months, but participants discussed their
findings in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guidelines represent a landmark. They will be very, very
important because the WHO is so respected,'' says Patrick R. Kenya,
chief of epidemiology and preventive medicine at Kenya's Moi
University, who adds that developing nations have barely begun to
address issues of aging.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO's goal is nothing less than to boost the quality of
elders' lives in rich and poor nations everywhere so their
burgeoning numbers will be more of a boon than a bane.
</P>
<P>
   Every month, the number of elders worldwide (defined as
individuals over age 55) jumps by 1.2 million people, notes Dr.
Vijay Chandra, director of India's Centre for Aging Research and a
member of the WHO panel. Four out of five are in developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in human history'' prepares societies for the
longevity revolution, says Jeffrey B. Blumberg of Tufts
University's Jean Mayer/US Department of Agriculture Center on
Human Nutrition and Aging, which organized the WHO panel. ``Better
nutrition can help us avert a guaranteed catastrophe if we start
now. It's doable, and the impact would be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sets of advice, summarized in the accompanying article,
overlap but not completely. Much is standard dogma, although there
is value in having two groups of experts put their stamps on what
they consider the best current thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these recommendations will not come as a surprise'' to
someone who ``exercises regularly, eats a balanced diet, watches
his or her weight, and keeps abreast of current developments in
health research,'' the Longevity Center report admits. ``Sadly,
however, this is not a description of the average American.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Americans eat the recommended five servings
of vegetables and fruits daily, the panel notes, and only 10
percent exercise religiously.
</P>
<P>
   On some points, the prescriptions are provocative _ such as the
WHO panel's conclusion that people over age 65 or 70 don't have to
worry as much about their weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do say you can safely gain some weight at older ages,''
said Irwin H. Rosenberg, director of the Jean Mayer/USDA Center,
who chaired the WHO panel.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centers on National Institute on Aging data showing
that mortality rates actually go up among older people who maintain
a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less _ the lean profile advocated
by US health officials for all adults.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers argue that this reflects the effect of older
cigarette smokers, who tend to be leaner but die more often of
smoking-related diseases. But the WHO panel disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our consensus was that among people over age 70, heavier
people tend to be more functional and thinner people tend to be
frail,'' said Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff of Tufts. ``The median BMI among
Framingham Heart Study participants is 28 for people with an
average age of 78. These are healthy, sucessfully aging people,
although many do have age-associated diseases. How do you argue
with success?''
</P>
<P>
   The other standout advice is the rigorous exercise standard set
by the Longevity Center. Few people (even among the 14 panel
members, one suspects) walk or run four miles a day, five days a
week. Even fewer lift weights, advice that should pay off in fewer
falls, better functioning, and healthier metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Butler acknowledges not everyone will reach the goal. But if the
question is ``What does the best evidence suggest?'' that was the
panel's answer. ``We thought we'd be courageous enough to try it
out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Longevity Center officials say they don't have copies of
``Prescription for Longevity'' available for the general public.
They plan to make it available at some point on a website.

 &HT;    Tiger woods' success and a growing black middle class draw
african-americans to the sport like never before.
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Memorial Day, the three men met at Atlanta International Golf
&AMP; Country Club in Decatur. Despite a midmorning tee time, they sat
in their carts for nearly an hour as group upon group of varying
abilities turned the No. 1 tee into golf gridlock. Unlike the
morning itself, however, the threesome wasn't steaming. One of them
fairly rejoiced, gazing around and thinking, ``This is
unbelievable. This is wonderful. This would've never happened 20
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This was vivid evidence of golf's enormously increased
popularity among African-Americans in the Atlanta area, especially
among the burgeoning black middle class. Like most of the golfers
at Atlanta International that morning, the three men are black and
hooked on golf.
</P>
<P>
   So is Gregory Adams, 39, the chief presiding judge of the DeKalb
County Juvenile Court, who took up golf three years ago. ``And I
haven't stopped since. I love it. I look at the game as a form of
stress reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Jatika Telfair of Clarkston, who founded Sisters Who Golf,
an organization that encourages African-American women and their
families to learn the mysteries of the flop wedge shot, or at least
how to grip the club properly.
</P>
<P>
   So is Patrick Desamours, 32, an investment broker who lives at
Hidden Hills Country Club in Stone Mountain and who, until 14
months ago, had considered golf ``a nonathletic sport that wasn't
worth the time.'' But since moving from his native New York to
Atlanta's warmer weather and taking up golf last year, Desamours
not only appreciates the game's complexities and recuperative
qualities but also the chance to do a little business outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things that's attracting people now is this
whole thing of balancing business with pleasure,'' Desamours said.
``Every financial broker you've ever talked to said that's the way
to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also the dramatic impact of Tiger Woods, whose historic
1997 Masters triumph, transcontinental drives and exuberance have
attracted millions _ particularly black women and junior golfers of
all races _ to the sport. Dave Ayers, the head pro at Mystery
Valley in Lithonia, estimates that minorities now constitute 25
percent of his business. ``Whereas three, four years ago, it was
negligible,'' he said. ``I'm sure it's because of Tiger's impact on
the game. I put him on my Christmas card list this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Batey understands. ``It's the Tiger thing,'' said Batey,
an assistant pro at Sugar Creek in DeKalb County. ``A lot of women,
their husbands played, but the Tiger thing has tweaked their
interest. My wife played because of me. But now her friends come to
me for lessons because of Tiger. They want to know what is it this
young brother is doing that mesmerizes people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a matter of accessibility. While most of Atlanta's
exclusive private clubs are still overwhelmingly white, blacks have
access to some private country clubs and all public courses. That
wasn't so for Thomas Smith, who grew up in the shadow of the city's
nine-hole Candler Park course, was prohibited from playing there
before Atlanta's public golf courses were integrated and was cursed
at _ and sometimes pelted with rocks _ when he'd try to sneak on
and play, or even walk through the course on his way to caddie at
Druid Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Smith later helped integrate the city's public courses, was one
of Atlanta's first black club pros at Adams Park (now Tup Holmes)
and Candler Park, and staged Georgia's first integrated golf
tournament in the early '70s. He now runs a golf shop on Cleveland
Avenue, just down the road from Browns Mill Golf Course, which has
a rich tradition of supporting minority golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Blacks today) don't have any of the problems we had,'' Smith
said. ``All they have to do now to play is pay the money.''
</P>
<P>
   And they do. People like Tamika Hrobowski, 29, of Austell, a
lawyer with the Social Security Administration who had worked in
the Arkansas state prosecutor's office in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday afternoons, everybody finished with court and the
guys would get together and go play golf,'' Hrobowski said. ``And
I'd be left behind to cover: `Sure, I'll cover for you.' I thought,
`One day, I'll play golf, too.' Just to go out with them and not
have to stay in the office and take complaints would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid growing up in Chicago, Hrobowski had played several
sports. Golf was never a consideration. She'd change TV channels,
see golf and watch a little before moving on. ``All you ever saw,''
she said, ``were older guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Older white guys, with plaid pants and big bank accounts. But in
Little Rock, Hrobowski was intrigued when her colleagues left early
on Friday to play golf. ``Something was drawing them out there,''
she said, ``and I wanted to know what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out last year after moving to Atlanta. In October,
Hrobowski heard about Sisters Who Golf and picked up a golf club
for the first time. ``It's so encouraging to see somebody out there
who looks like you,'' she said. ``It was like, `OK, it's open to
us.' ''

 &HT;    For Cox writer Michelle Hiskey and her family, golf has been the
tie that binds.
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my grandfather died, our family gathered in the small Idaho
town where he spent most of his 85 years. We grieved, greeted old
friends and laid Pete Hiskey to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Then we played golf.
</P>
<P>
   On the tee that day, only a few hours after the funeral, stood
my uncle, Babe, a regular on the Senior Tour who won two PGA
tournaments during a 25-year career. Next to him was my father,
Jim, who played the tour for five years and whose Christian
ministry serves golfers. Those two and another brother, Sonny,
played on nine NCAA championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   My brother Paul, soon to play the international pro circuit, was
there, along with our cousin Don, a club pro. Six of us attended
college on golf scholarships. Those of us who weren't playing for a
living were, for the most part, selling golf equipment.
</P>
<P>
   We had played some of the toughest courses in the world, but on
the day we buried Gramps, all of us teed off on a humble 18 holes
nestled in the western foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Riverside
Golf Course is pretty flat, and for $15 anyone can play all day
long.
</P>
<P>
   But it was sacred because it was the last of 18 golf courses our
grandfather built. A game so often viewed as a rich man's sport,
one that would shape all of our lives and frame moments of great
joy and heartbreak, for him started as a way to feed a hungry
family.
</P>
<P>
   Carving out courses
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather's grandfather came west on a Mormon ox-train in
1862, a harrowing journey to a promised land of bitter winters and
scorching summers. Soon the railroads simplified that crossing, and
his son _ my great-grandfather _ signed on as a railroad foreman.
His family lived in a boxcar set by the tracks in a remote corner
of southeast Utah. The youngest of his 10 kids was born in 1902 and
named Peter Marion.
</P>
<P>
   In the cemeteries of his hometown of Torrey, tiny tombstones
recall the children who could not survive the harsh conditions.
Those who made it learned to work at a young age and, when one job
ended, to find another. Gramps quit school in the eighth grade to
work on his brother's sheep ranch. As a shepherd, he spent weeks on
the range tending the herds, sleeping under the stars and, he would
later tell us, dodging rattlesnakes. He wore a big Stetson hat over
a face that seemed like all nose and ears.
</P>
<P>
   He once rode 100 miles to court the young woman he would marry,
and even after they settled down, he would leave home for weeks at
a time to find work. For a while, he labored in the mines and
routinely saw men die in dynamite accidents.
</P>
<P>
   When the Depression hit, the family had settled in Burley, a
small town in southern Idaho. Gramps' previous two jobs were as a
short-order cook and a nurseryman, but he was out of work. The
family relied on friends to bring them food.
</P>
<P>
   Gramps heard that the Works Progress Administration put men to
work building the city's first golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `There's no use kidding you guys,''' he related
to me years later. ``I don't know the first damn thing about
building a golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   He had never played the game, either. But the WPA, eager to give
work to the unemployed, put him on the crew. Gramps soon found
himself in charge.
</P>
<P>
   They used wheelbarrows to move the rocks and planted cottonwood
trees in the dusty soil. The first greens weren't even green _ they
were made out of sand. When the course was done, he played. That's
how he learned the game. The town asked him to stay on as the
course's caretaker, and when the economy improved, other towns
hired him to build courses and maintain them.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1930s, the family had grown to four kids and moved
to Twin Falls, a place later made famous by motorcyclist Evel
Knievel's attempt to soar across the Snake River Canyon. In that
steep gorge lies Blue Lakes Golf Club, where Gramps carved one of
the state's most beautiful courses out of boulders and brush.
</P>
<P>
   Learning the game
</P>
<P>
   The Hiskeys lived in a stone house on the city's municipal
course. The putting green was 10 feet from their back door; the tee
box 30 feet from their front steps. It might sound like they were
living in the clubhouse, but there wasn't one. The only other
structure around was the outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   My father played three holes each morning on his way to school,
and entered tournaments with money earned selling golf balls found
in ditches. It was the heyday of Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan, but
his big hero was his older brother, Sonny.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, gentle and handsome, Sonny mastered the game first and
showed his little brothers how to swing. ``He hit it so far that I
thought it'd never come down,'' my dad recalled. ``I just couldn't
believe he could hit the ball so far and so straight. ... He was
like a god to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Sonny did, the younger boys copied. After he won the
Idaho state amateur in the 1940s, the family defended the title
seven times in a row. Sonny won tournaments all over the Western
states, and caught the attention of college coaches. He went to
North Texas State on scholarship, and his team, which included Don
January, won the NCAA title 1949-52. The Korean War was going on,
so he postponed his plans to try the PGA Tour and served as a
reserve officer in the Air Force. The University of Houston,
meanwhile, recruited my father and his brother, Babe.
</P>
<P>
   Dad was on the ninth hole of a college tournament when his coach
approached. A terrible west Texas storm had come up. Sonny's plane
had gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Dad finished the round in a daze, shooting a 69 he barely
remembers. He finished the next day because Sonny would have wanted
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his team won the NCAA title that year, my dad was
filled with rage. One night he shook his fist at the sky and
screamed, ``Why did you take my brother and leave me? Why couldn't
you take me?''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a buddy invited him to hear some noted athletes
talk about their Christian faith. That night, Dad found peace. He
began to see his athletic skills and Sonny's death as part of God's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   He played the PGA circuit for five years when the leaderboards
carried names like Snead, Palmer and a kid named Nicklaus. The
thrills of the tour, though, were eclipsed by a spiritual fervor.
With his brother Babe, he helped start the tour's weekly Bible
study, and later, his golf ministry based in Washington, D.C., took
him around the world for various tournaments and speaking
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stronger force was pulling me away from golf,'' Dad said.
But without golf, he might never have discovered his calling.
</P>
<P>
   Legacy lives on
</P>
<P>
   My first memory, at age 3, is of snow-capped peaks in a summer
when my father played the Canadian tour. My two brothers and I
watched the first man walk on the moon in an Ohio hotel room while
Dad played the Akron Open. Many of our trips ended in Idaho, and
Dad compared that trek to a blood cell winding through many
arteries before it reaches the heart.
</P>
<P>
   At home in suburban Washington, we dug up our back yard for
greens and sand traps that we hit to with chopped-down clubs. We
played with a dog found at one tournament who later died at
another.
</P>
<P>
   These Hiskeys ``all know how to play golf. And play it well,'' a
local sportswriter wrote in the Washington Star. ``It has been
planned that way. Ever since the crib.''
</P>
<P>
   Like my dad's generation, my brothers and I won a bunch of
junior tournaments and played golf in college. I knew from watching
my dad and uncle play that the pro life was not for me. I loved to
write. As I looked for a job, a byline in The Atlanta Constitution
caught my eye: Thomas Stinson, the former Washington Star reporter
who had written about my family and now covers the Atlanta Braves.
He helped me land an internship.
</P>
<P>
   I don't play that much anymore, except for last year, even
though _ or maybe because _ I was expecting my first child. On a
cold December afternoon, five days before Johanna was born, I
played two holes. We went par-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   She met the rest of the family when they gathered for the PGA
Merchandise Show in Florida. Since then, she's attended two pro
golf tournaments, and we often stroll around our neighborhood
course, occasionally picking up a stray Titleist.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I feel sad, knowing that she will never meet her
great-grandfather and great-uncle. I realize how badly I want to
pass down the game to her, for it to mean as much to her as it does
to me. But as I wrote this story, I realized that golf had already
touched her life, long before she was born.

 &HT;    Golfers must take care to be physically up to par
 &HT;    By Amanda Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because recreational golfers aren't always the fittest of
athletes, many people assume that the sport isn't hard on the body.
But physicians who treat sports injuries see a fair number of
people injured on the golf course. Dr. Joanne B. ``Anne'' Allen, a
physi-atrist who specializes in sports and spine injuries and
occupational medicine with Peachtree Orthopedic Clinic in Atlanta,
talked about common problems for golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kinds of injuries afflict golfers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most common injuries for golfers are in the upper
extremities and the spine _ shoulder, elbow, wrist and lower-back
injuries. One reason is the biomechanical strain put on muscles by
the unnatural movement of swinging a club. Proper technique and
mechanics can help prevent strains and other injuries. And
performing specific exercises to strengthen the upper extremities
and the spine, and even basic stretches before you play, can be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are golfers at risk for heat exhaustion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Golf is not as athletic as track and field, for instance, but
golfers are outside in the same heat, and they often aren't in as
good physical condition. It's very important for golfers to remain
hydrated and avoid excess sun. They should drink at least eight
fluid ounces of water every 15 to 30 minutes on a hot, sunny day. A
golfer who drinks any alcohol during a round will be at higher risk
for dehydration and that may contribute to development of heat
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the symptoms of heat exhaustion?
</P>
<P>
   A: A feeling of light-headedness, sweating and fatigue,
accompanied by changes in skin color and blood pressure, may be
indicators of heat exhaustion. If you experience any of these
symptoms, sit or lie in the shade and drink fluids immediately,
then get to a cool environment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about skin cancer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Obviously, the risks increase for anyone who spends a lot of
time in the sun, whether it's playing golf or tennis or some other
activity. Sunscreen is essential, and wearing a hat is important;
choosing loose-fitting clothing will help avoid heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference in walking vs. riding a cart, as far as
exercise?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a significant difference in the amount of calories
burned in walking and riding in a cart, so walking is much better
for the average golfer from that standpoint. But it also depends on
how good a golfer you are _ if you're hitting the ball all over the
course, you may do a lot of walking. If you're walking and not
riding, you'll also keep your back muscles limber and warmed up,
which may lower your risk of injury. But anyone who already has
back pain or injuries may be better off riding to avoid aggravating
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you get injured, should you stop playing for a while?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's specific to the individual case, and depends on how
severe the injury is. If there is concern about continuing to play,
check with your doctor.

 &HT;    Improving strength, flexibility and endurance can improve your
golf game.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike tossing the caber or performing the clean and jerk, golf
does not involve displays of physical prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The incorrect corollary that often follows is that golf does not
require physical prowess. It does. To play golf, and to play it
well, a person needs strength, flexibility and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can work muscles that actually help the golf swing,'' said
Gary King, a teaching professional at RiverPines Golf Club in
Alpharetta, Ga.. ``You can increase your own stamina and
flexibility when you just thought you were going to have to use
graphite clubs for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 42, does strength training and cardiovascular exercise
twice a week, in addition to his daily stretching exercises. He
developed his workout program with trainer Kelly Blackburn of
Alpharetta-based Elite Personal Fitness Trainers.
</P>
<P>
   In the several months since King started working with Blackburn,
his clubhead speed has increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds strange, but being able to relax your muscles
through the swing helps you hit the ball farther,'' King said. ``My
muscles are stronger and can relax better, which helps the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Calf raises have strengthened a previously torn Achilles' tendon
that used to give him trouble, and the general aches and pains that
plagued him after a day of countless golf swings have eased. He
said he doesn't need Advil as much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn, who works with the PGA Tour and often travels to
tournaments to help players, emphasizes that golfers can benefit
from overall physical conditioning as much as athletes in other
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, flexibility is key in golf,'' Blackburn said.
``A golfer has got to have the flexibility in the trunk for a full
shoulder turn.''
</P>
<P>
   On the PGA Web site (at http://www.pga.com), Blackburn
demonstrates various exercises that contribute to better
flexibility, strength and endurance. For midsection flexibility,
she recommends a trunk-rotation stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've also got to have overall strength, a strong base for
stability and power generated out of the hips,'' Blackburn said.
``That's what generates power behind the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Biceps curls, triceps kickbacks and lateral raises using hand
weights will improve arm and shoulder strength and help prevent
injury. Using hand weights also can increase forearm and wrist
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Larry Nelson, another of Blackburn's loyal clients,
has greatly increased his strength and driving ability, she said.
Using the same clubs and balls, Nelson added 20 yards to his
driving distance after starting an exercise program.
</P>
<P>
   ``His results caught the eye of the PGA,'' Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common injury among golfers is back strain. Strong
abdominal muscles are vital to improving posture and strengthening
the back. Blackburn suggests abdominal crunches and neck stretches.
Flexible, limber muscles are less likely to tear or be strained.
</P>
<P>
   The third prong of Blackburn's fitness program for golfers is
cardiovascular exercise, to boost endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Many golfers consider 18 holes a relaxing way to spend a
Saturday afternoon, but finishing the course is a chore for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to me and say, `I start losing steam at about hole
13,' '' Blackburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and other health experts recommend at least 20 minutes
of aerobic exercise per day, three times a week, for overall
health. Aerobic exercise is anything that elevates the heart rate,
such as brisk walking, running, bicycling or aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about specific exercises that can benefit golfers,
look up the PGA Tour Web site. Elite Personal Fitness Trainers also
has a site (http://www.elite-fitness.com).

 &HT;    COLUMN: A visit to the swing doctor
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If men would analyze themselves as much as they did their golf
swings, imagine how the world might be bettered. Think of the
marriages strengthened, the children uplifted, the careers
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah. Yadda, yadda. Listen, one must keep these things in
perspective. What's the point of a happy home if it can't help you
break 100?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we would delve more into the intimate aspects of our lives
if they were anywhere near as fascinating as the search for the
perfect tee shot. If you could tape the marriage and break it down
to geometric components, then counselors would make as much as golf
pros.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Norcross laboratory of George Kelnhofer, and be
prepared to be dazzled by the many facets and complexities of golf.
From his Georgia Golf Center headquarters, Kelnhofer would face one
of his greatest challenges: Dissecting the cadaver that is my
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Is there really anything that can be done to correct a
self-taught hacker who has spent a lifetime unmatching his set of
clubs and ingraining every fault until it has become habit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't take any longer to fix a 20-year player than it does a
20-minute one,'' Kelnhofer said with confidence. At $60 per
half-hour, here's hoping for a quick cure.
</P>
<P>
   But how much can just a few lessons really help the seemingly
hopeless player? If such a mope had a handicap, it easily could be
cut in half, Kelnhofer said. ``Most golfers' short games are very
bad; that's one area where you can make some rapid improvement,''
he promised.
</P>
<P>
   This lesson, however, was to center on the tee shot. Of my many
crimes I commit on a golf course, none is more heinous than those
done with driver in hand. I'm a big guy who hits a small ball.
While the rest of the world is gripping it and ripping it, I'm
chopping it and flopping it.
</P>
<P>
   On the tee is where Kelnhofer brings the full force of
technology to bear. Using a series of cameras and, of course, a
computer, he can break any swing all the way down to the smell.
Clearly, the science involved in launching golf ball and smart bomb
are almost equal.
</P>
<P>
   We proceed to his practice area, where even the process of
teeing up the ball is automated. Here, I take a couple of my usual
hacks for analysis back on the computer screen. Just let loose the
swing that says to the world, ``Lizzie Borden was my swing
doctor.'' It's one thing to have to witness the result of a bad
swing, and then go chasing it in the gorse. It's even worse to
actually step outside yourself and watch the swing in progress. You
see this horrible accident in progress and are helpless to do
anything about it. You knew it was that bad; you just didn't know
it was that obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Kelnhofer accentuates the flaws by splitting the screen and
calling up any number of smooth-swinging professionals as points of
comparison. Standing me up next to David Duval is as abhorrent as
displaying Dogs Playing Poker and the Mona Lisa on the same museum
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Three different cameras detail the atrocities. Rear view, side
view and even a shot from on high to remind this player he could
use some Rogaine as well as a little more shoulder turn.
</P>
<P>
   Then superimposed over Mr. Slice are nine different lines that
make up the blueprint of the proper swing.
</P>
<P>
   My set-up, I'm happy and proud to announce, was right in line.
The stance was pretty good. Nobody can stand better. But when
things start moving, it all falls apart like a Russian car.
</P>
<P>
   My pivot was stiff and awkward, Tin Man-like. And on the
downswing, the club was so far above the proper line that it
appeared I was trying to drive a tent stake instead of a golf ball.
At the point of contact, trying to make up for all the wrong that
went before, I was all up on my toes and out of balance. Those are
the swings that buy chiropractors beach homes.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to take a moment here to praise Kelnhofer's upstanding
professionalism. At no time did he fall to the floor in laughter or
run away in defeat. He stayed hard at it for the full hour, earning
total trust. By the end, I was ready to confess all my sins to him.
</P>
<P>
   He just went to work showing little tips and gimmicks to help
bring the swing more in line. More tilt, more shoulder turn,
tighten up on the hip movement. Sure enough, by the end, I was
coloring more inside those computer lines. The ball still wasn't
going anywhere, but that wasn't important at the moment. ``The golf
ball lies to you,'' Kelnhofer said. Over the last two decades, it
has been telling me some particularly vicious ones.
</P>
<P>
   With a tape of my lesson in hand, I could go boldly forth and
try to practice the techniques he crammed into the hour. He
attempts to keep it remedial, but there still seems an awful lot of
thought to take to the practice range. ``It's no different than
dance lessons. You've got to know where your feet go before you can
do it,'' he said. Well, I've tried dance lessons, and those didn't
take, either.
</P>
<P>
   What one golf lesson showed was the possibilities, and just how
much more I must invest in the game if I ever want to do it
competently. I know now I can improve, as long as I don't allow my
personal life to get in the way.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Polly Matzinger, 50, a tenured medical researcher at the
National Institutes of Health, is turning the world of immunology
upside down with her radical theory suggesting that the human
immune system is activated not by alien substances in the body, but
by dangerous ones _ the Danger Theory of immunology. She sat in her
Bethesda, Md., garden recently, explaining the evolution of her
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Q. As a child, what kind of work did you think you'd be doing
when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   DR. MATZINGER. A jockey, a seeing-eye dog trainer, a composer. I
grew up in a very creative original family. My mother, a French
ex-nun, is a potter. My father, a Dutch World War II resistance
fighter who was imprisoned in Dachau, is a painter and carpenter.
My sister is an artist and my brother is a mechanic and rock
musician.
</P>
<P>
   I sing, play piano and bass and compose music. But I don't sing
or play very well, and the music I write is dead-boring. The only
thing I've found that I'm really creative in ... is science. It
wasn't an art form I expected to find, but then, my family has
always blazed their own trails.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you find science?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was a cocktail waitress in Davis, Calif. in 1972. I'd been
in and out of school and done all kinds of jobs _ jazz musician,
lab technician, problem-dog trainer and Playboy bunny, which was,
incidentally, a great job. But everything seemed to get boring
after a while, so I decided to make a career of waitressing and
save the days for reading, composing and working with animals.
</P>
<P>
   One day, two professors from the University of California at
Davis who regularly came in for beer, started talking about animal
mimicry, and I asked them, ``Why has no animal ever mimicked a
skunk?'' Professor Robert Swampy Schwab, who was chair of Wildlife
and Fisheries, was floored. He decided that this question-asking
waitress should become a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, he came to the bar and brought me all kinds of
scientific articles. And he convinced me that science never gets
boring. At his urging, I applied to graduate school. I started in
1974, got a belated bachelor's degree in '76 and a Ph.D. in '79. I
owe that man my life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When did you begin questioning the ideas that are the bedrock
of immunological theory?
</P>
<P>
   A. In graduate school, we learned that the immune system fights
anything that isn't part of our bodies. But that didn't make sense
to me. I wondered why mothers didn't reject their fetuses, why we
didn't reject the food we eat, or the stuff in the air we breathe.
But my professors all said, ``Don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So I stopped worrying. This is a cowardly habit that we
scientists can fall into. If we really can't answer a question, we
sometimes stop asking it. Ten years later, I came to the National
Institutes of Health and met a brilliant young oncologist, Ephraim
Fuchs. He wondered about these questions, too. And we began
thrashing them out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does your Danger Model differ from the standard
Self/Nonself Model of the immune system?
</P>
<P>
   A. It isn't really insurrectionary _ it's just a different way
of looking at things. Let me use an analogy to explain it. Imagine
a community in which the police accept anyone they met during
elementary school and kill any new migrant. That's the Self/Nonself
Model.
</P>
<P>
   In the Danger Model, tourists and immigrants are accepted, until
they start breaking windows. Only then do the police move to
eliminate them. In fact, it doesn't matter if the window breaker is
a foreigner or a member of the community. That kind of mutant
behavior is considered unacceptable, and the destructive individual
is removed.
</P>
<P>
   The community police are the white blood cells of the immune
system. The Self/Nonself Model says that they kill anything that
enters the body after an early training period in which ``self'' is
learned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Danger Model, the police wander around, waiting for an
alarm signaling that something is doing damage. If an immigrant
enters without doing damage, the white cells simply continue to
wander, and after a while, the harmless immigrant becomes part of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you arrive at your alternate model for the immune
system?
</P>
<P>
   A. It didn't happen in a day. There were two difficult parts.
First Ephraim and I took a year to realize that a truly useful
immune system would fight dangerous things and ignore harmless
ones. But we couldn't figure out how to tell the difference. One
day, while I was in the bath, the answer just popped out! It was:
``Things that are dangerous do damage. No damage, no danger.'' It
seems really simple, doesn't it? But it took us a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Next we had to figure out how the white blood cells learn about
the damage. That thought also arrived oddly. Annie, my Border
collie, and I were watching over some sheep grazing in a field.
Suddenly something moved in the woods, startling the sheep, and
Annie jumped up to protect them. It hit me that something was
amiss. Well, almost every organ of the body has a few sentinels _
called dendritic cells _ that are like sleeping sheep dogs. Alarm
signals from injured cells could wake them up and alert the immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the value of your theory of the immune system?
</P>
<P>
   A. Besides the beauty of it? Well, first, it explains many
things the old model couldn't _ like why mothers don't reject their
fetuses. They don't do damage. Second, there are some important
practical implications. For example, the old model assumed that
very young babies would be really hard to vaccinate because their
immune systems were busy learning who the ``self'' was. Then we
published a paper showing how to vaccinate 1-day-old baby mice. Now
there's a lot more hope about early vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   Another hopeful area is cancer treatment. I really believe we
can use vaccination to cure perhaps 80 percent of all cancers.
Though there's a lot of research in this area, it isn't working
very well. The Danger Model predicts that some simple changes could
make anti-cancer vaccinations very effective.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. But there is a lot of resistance to making those simple
changes, based on your theory, isn't there?
</P>
<P>
   A. The resistance isn't really to the changes. It's to the
Danger Model itself. People grew up with a particular view of how
immunity works. When I say, ``That's not how it works _ please
accept that for a moment and you'll see we could do something
effective against tumors,'' they are unable to try. It's partly
fair. The Danger Model is new, and to experiment on people, you
need to have a sound basis for the treatment. Still, I don't
understand why they won't try it on cancer in animals.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the next big question in immunity?
</P>
<P>
   A. Once we know what activates it, we next have to learn how to
make the right kind of response. Viruses aren't cleared the same
way as worms, and right now nobody has a clue how the immune system
knows the difference. There's not even a theory. My lab is just
starting to move in that direction, and I'm thinking hard about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm told you dislike the way science and technology have
become hyphenated terms _ why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because they are very different. Science is more like art and
true scientists are more like artists. Except that we don't have to
starve in garrets because governments and foundations pay us.
Technology is about vaccines and plastics and drugs and things that
work in the world. Science is about describing nature, and so is
art: We're painting nature.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think the scientific world is too solemn?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, no. Not true science. It's art. Actually, it's a sandbox
and scientists get to play all of our lives.

 &HT;    Web's awash in golf sites of every stripe
 &HT;    By David Davidson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf, an outdoor sport, and the Internet, an indoor medium,
might seem like polar opposites, but they do have something in
common: One is just as unlikely to keep you in shape as the other.
</P>
<P>
   However, golfers who address a keyboard and monitor before they
address a Titleist on the first tee might discover great benefit.
Even those who aren't into wearing pastel and would rather watch
golf on TV than actually play the game will find the Internet most
helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Golf sites are among the most prolific on the Web. There are
literally thousands to choose from _ from the very general to the
exquisitely specific, from those international in scope to sites
dedicated to the course just down the street.
</P>
<P>
   The four major tournaments hold a special fascination for
golfers, beginning with the Masters, played annually the first full
week of April. Next up is the U.S. Open, June 18-21, at the Olympic
Club near San Francisco, followed by the British Open, July 16-19,
at Southport, England, and finally the PGA Aug., 13-16, at Redmond,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Golf Association and the PGA Tour both have excellent
sites. Even the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, which
has produced ``the Open'' championship since 1860, has waded into
cyberspace. If surfing all those sites involves too much mouse-age,
there's one site that gives in-depth scrutiny to all four major
tournaments: Golf Majors.

   The LPGA also has a thorough site for those interested in the
women's pro tour.
</P>
<P>
   http://www. lpga.com
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of mega-sites of interest to both players and
observers of golf, which provide everything from PGA, Seniors and
LPGA stats to worldwide guides to courses to travel packages to
weather. Infobeat will even e-mail news and information on golf _
free _ to subscribers. Golfonline, an electronic product of Golf
Magazine, is a superb site.

   Most of the best players have their own Web sites. Jack
Nicklaus' site not only details his playing career but his
corporate side _ particularly course architecture _ as well. It's
no surprise that Tiger Woods has a site, but he's so popular
there's an unofficial site that allows surfers to jump to a variety
of other sites devoted to Woods. Chi Chi Rodriguez, one of the most
colorful players ever to play the game, uses his Web site to
forward his Youth Foundation, which seeks to help at-risk kids.

   Regardless of a trend toward boorish gallery behavior over the

the game.

   One dilemma golfers always face is which ball to play. There are
dozens of brands, compressions, etc., on the market. The Golf Ball
Place might help. Golfers can purchase online high-spin balls,
distance balls, a blend of those two traits, specialty balls.
There's even a history of the evolution of the golf ball, beginning
in 1550, when balls were solid wood.
</P>
<P>
   http://www. thegolfballplace.com
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State Golf Association has a useful site that
provides players with rules, course ratings, handicaps, a junior
golf program and a hall of history.
</P>
<P>
   http://www. gsga.org
</P>
<P>
   Two other solid sources of in-state information are Georgia Golf
News and Atlanta Golfer. Both have information on everything from
public and private courses to driving ranges to playing tips, to
lessons to real estate to classifieds _ all aimed at the local
golfer.

various courses around the state.

   Even local clubs are going into cyberspace. Stone Mountain and

 &HT;    Making golf fun for kids is part of teaching them to love the
game for life and to get on the right course.
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So your child saw Tiger Woods on television and wants to swing
into action. Before you buy an expensive set of clubs, spikes and
collared shirts, experts advise giving children the lay of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   With school out, many area golf courses, public and private, are
offering clinics or beginner programs for youngsters. Club pros
teach rules and etiquette, along with the correct grip, stance and
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for children to learn is swing and
control,'' said Craig Forney, head golf professional at RiverPines
in Alpharetta, Georgia. ``Most of the kids are into trying to hit
it onto the back of the range, like Happy Gilmore. They all want to
hit for power.''
</P>
<P>
   Forney stresses balance and a smooth swing to Wood-be players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn the fundamentals first before you can be
Tiger Woods,'' Forney said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe children should be introduced to the game when
they show interest and enthusiasm. Of course, some parents bring
their 3- or 4-year-old to a pro for lessons, despite the child's
two-minute attention span. A more common starting age is 7 or 8,
although the bulk are in the 10-12 age group. Teenagers also are
choosing to pick up the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about a child is they are so willing to
learn,'' said Sam Puryear, executive director of the East Lake
Junior Golf Academy.
</P>
<P>
   To keep their interest, Puryear said he believes in instilling
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't want to do something that's monotonous,'' he said.
``Don't spend all the time worrying about 'Do they have the proper
grip? Are they taking it back straight?' After a couple of years
ensuring the kids have a great time and letting them whack at it a
little bit, they develop a proficiency and then can fine-tune
certain skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Because children can outgrow their interest or their equipment,
experts suggest a modest investment in clubs, sometimes as little
as $40 for a set. Adult clubs can be cut down, but they are not
properly balanced and weighted for youth players. Some companies
make child-sized clubs, including Duluth-based U.S. Kids Golf,
which sells a driver, 7-iron, wedge and putter.
</P>
<P>
   Beginner programs allow tennis shoes and shorts and some don't
require collared shirts. However, Forney has had kids go the whole
nine yards and play in knickers.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the larger programs are offered by the Georgia State Golf
Foundation and the Atlanta Junior Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   The GSGF will sponsor the Hook A Kid on Golf Tee Level Clinics
this summer at four Atlanta courses and one in Macon. The clinics
are for children 8-14 who never have played golf, do not own a set
of clubs and whose parents do not belong to a private golf club.
The kids receive donated clubs, a shirt and balls. For information,
contact Kim Doge, manager of foundation services, at 770-612-1788.
</P>
<P>
   The AJGA will expand its clinic program to five courses next
year and is taking names for the 1999 mailing list (call
770-850-9040 or check out the Internet at http://www.atljrga.org).
</P>
<P>
   The $115 program, with some scholarships available, includes a
get-acquainted event, six golf lessons and five play dates on a par
3 course. There are no cart fees because juniors carry their clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The AJGA prefers kids who know a bit about the game, ``whose
grandparent or parent has taken them to a driving range,'' said Pam
Shankland, director of the beginner program.
</P>
<P>
   The par 3 courses build self-confidence and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make a 10 on a hole, it's not fun to play,'' said
Shankland. ``They need to see some encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   If kids join adults on a par 72 course, they should play from
where the older player has hit the ball to avoid a six-hour ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Puryear will let his 9-year-old son Antonio run in front of him,
``put his ball down and whack it. He knows when I catch up with him
to pick his ball up, it's time to go to the next hole.''

 &HT;    Erv Cherry defends against the worst enemy known to a busy
public golf course _ slow play.
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Erv Cherry chases drunk drivers, unravels traffic jams
and tries to keep the peace. He's got his walkie-talkie, a special
vehicle and a regular beat to patrol _ everything but the
doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   But don't call him a cop. He's a marshal, a member of the thin
green line at North Fulton Golf Course. He wears a teal polo shirt
like his 21 fellow ``ambassadors,'' identifying them as defenders
against golf's most common enemy: slow play.
</P>
<P>
   Every Thursday, he cruises the course in his electric cart,
looking for trouble. At 69, a retired salesman with a Johnny Carson
twinkle in his eye, Cherry can persuade a beginner to pick up after
seven shots, cajole an executive to put away the cell phone and
shoo a big, barking stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   A widower who lives in Roswell, Cherry's life philosophy carries
over to his golf duties. ``Take the bitter with the sweet,'' he
says, ``and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 15th hole, Jeff Scott of Memphis and his three sons are
poking around a creek, looking for the ball of one of the boys.
Scott reminisced about growing up nearby and playing in this same
stream.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry interrupts the history lesson. ``Copperheads down
there,'' he tells them.
</P>
<P>
   The family scrambles out of the gully, abandoning the ball.
Never mind that Cherry's never seen snakes down there. The
suggestion of danger works _ most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Cherry evacuated the course during a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' one golfer told him. ``I've never been
struck by lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think you had,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Cherry's been in a line of fire that sometimes
defies geometry. Once, he parked under an old oak tree to watch a
hacker hit over a creek, and the ball spurted off at a right angle,
striking Cherry in the neck. That's one reason he always drives the
holes from green to tee, so he can see who's hitting. ``Keeps you
from getting killed out here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he had seen everything until the legendary Hooters
tournament a few years ago when some of the women from the
restaurant decided to play topless. No marshal intervened that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything destructive,'' Cherry said, ``but they
sure screwed up traffic on Powers Ferry Road,'' which borders the
final two holes.
</P>
<P>
   And golfers hate gridlock. On a busy day, a foursome tees off
every 10 minutes at North Fulton, where 70,000 rounds are played
each year. Like driving in rush hour, it takes only one wreck _ a
lost ball, for instance _ to slow everyone else down.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry keeps the pack moving, from the beginners who whiff to
the sharks betting $50 a hole. The golfers who cop an attitude
usually have enjoyed a few too many cold beverages, and that's when
Cherry uses his walkie-talkie to call for backup from the pro shop.
The hassles are worth the payoff. In return for volunteering,
Cherry gets to play free golf. He tries to whittle down his 12
handicap by playing three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   During a round a couple of years ago, a ball flew onto a green
as he putted _ the equivalent of speeding in front of an off-duty
cop. The offender: David Justice, the former Braves outfielder.
``Do it again,'' Erv growled, ``and I'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a threat, just a bit of marshal humor. Guys like
Cherry seek to preserve the integrity of the sport because they
love it so much.
</P>
<P>
   He paused on the par-3 14th hole to remember Don Hipp, a fellow
marshal whose cremated ashes were scattered over this hole. ``The
next day it rained, but he's still there,'' Erv said, puffing on a
cigarette. ``I wouldn't mind that myself.''

 &HT;    The grass ceiling: Women feel uncomfortable in a game that is
dominated by men.
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A guy is playing golf with his wife and slices his tee shot into
the rough behind the barn. His wife says, ``Why don't I open the
door and you hit the ball through the barn toward the green?''
</P>
<P>
   The guy tries it, but the ball hits something inside the barn,
caroms off and hits his wife in the head, killing her.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the same guy is playing with a friend, and he
slices the ball behind the same barn. His friend says, ``Why don't
I open the door and you hit the ball through the barn toward the
green?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' the guy says. ``Last time I tried that here I made a
seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Grizzard got plenty of laughs from jokes about female
golfers who, he believed, got in the way of the good ol' boys.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes are only one of many barriers to women feeling
comfortable on the golf course. They often encounter discrimination
in club membership and tee times and a no-girls-allowed atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such obstacles, women are picking up the game in record
numbers, with the tenacity that they have shown in breaking into
the corporate world. They've banded together to find other female
players and tee up at courses that want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf has been a male sport for so long ... and that trickles
down to the way we feel on the course,'' said Cindy Bettis, vice
president of the Amateur Golfers Association Tour of Atlanta. ``It
takes a while for us to realize that we can get out and be
competitive and feel comfortable. As long as women know the rules,
etiquette and pace of play, there's no reason they shouldn't be out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5.7 million women playing golf in this country represent
about 20 percent of all players but about 40 percent of all
beginners. Among the new golfers is Lois Thomas of Decatur, who
used to sum up golf with one word: dull. But after her husband and
co-workers got more involved in it, she started feeling left out.
As a computer analyst at BellSouth, she'd miss out on networking at
many corporate outings because she didn't know how to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In golf, you're meeting a lot of people, and if you are an
executive or manager, it does make a difference,'' said Thomas, who
took her first lesson at a recent Golf for Women Day at Browns Mill
Golf Course. At home later, she practiced her swing with a broom.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family looked at me like I was crazy,'' she said, ``but I'm
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that women spend $3 billion on golf equipment and
greens fees each year, public golf courses are seeking their
business. Last month, Golf for Women Day drew 12,000 women to
courses operated nationwide by American Golf Corp. for free lessons
and rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Many private clubs, though, are not as welcoming. Georgia's best
female amateur players hold their championship during the week
because the best private courses usually reserve their prime
weekend tee times for members. As spouses of members, women have
lesser privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more elite the club, typically, the more discriminatory
against the women it is,'' said Lee Burton of Newnan, the two-time
Georgia Player of the Year. One of the best players at Atlanta
Athletic Club and a Furman University golf recruit, Leigh Turner
says she ``would like to go out before 12 (noon) on the weekends,
but I can't. On Saturday mornings, only members can play, and there
are only a few women members.''
</P>
<P>
   While law prohibits public courses from discriminating against
anyone who wants to play, the men can create a sometimes hostile
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intimidating to be on the tee, know I'm not hitting well
and, oh, no, I've got three guys looking at me, and I've got to hit
this tee shot,'' said Anita Denney of Marietta. ``You just pray you
do.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet others like herself, Denney joined the Atlanta chapter
of the Executive Women's Golf Association. Its 360 women compete in
leagues almost daily. The group helps nurture beginners struggling
to master not only the intricacies of the swing but also the myriad
rules and etiquette points that can intimidate a player, regardless
of gender.
</P>
<P>
   Even if her skills need improvement, a woman will feel more
welcome on the course if she understands how the game is played and
is courteous to others, said Betsy Clark, director of education for
the Ladies Professional Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women entering golf mirrors what society allows them to do,''
Clark said. ``Many people are recognizing that women can play this
game, and the myths are tumbling down.''
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   -- 5.7 million women play golf, representing 22 percent of all
golfers. Women make up 39 percent of the 3 million beginning
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Since 1986, the number of women playing golf has increased 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- The average age of women golfers is 43; for men, it's 39.
</P>
<P>
   -- The average household income for women golfers is $61,000;
it's $59,000 for men.
</P>
<P>
   -- Women golfers spend an average of $649 per year on golf; men
spend an average of $718.
</P>
<P>
   -- Women play, on average, 16 rounds per year; men play about 20
times.

<P>
   QUICK TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Tips for women who want to start or improve at golf, and feel
comfortable on the course:
</P>
<P>
   -- Find other women golfers. Try the Executive Women's Golf
Association (770-984-7617) or Sisters Who Golf, a group for
African-American women (404-794-7000). Women with handicaps below
the mid-20s can compete in the Amateur Golfers Association Tour of
Atlanta (770-343-9969). Some public courses offer women's leagues.
</P>
<P>
   -- Look for women-friendly instructors and courses. Chateau Elan
in Braselton and Eagle's Landing Country Club were the only two
Georgia courses listed in Golf for Women magazine's top 175 courses
for women. They are judged on factors such as unrestricted tee
times, special women's programs, multiple women's tee markers,
child care, on-course restrooms, women's pro shop merchandise,
adequate locker rooms, practice areas and ``women-friendly'' male
staff and players.
</P>
<P>
   -- Take lessons _ but not from your husband or significant
other. ``The best piece of advice I give men is: Don't teach your
wife,'' said Bob Fritsche, regional manager for American Golf Corp.
``The game is too hard to understand, and the last thing a woman
wants is her husband yelling at her.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Relax. ``Women don't have to prove themselves; they're just a
regular person out there,'' said Cindy Bettis of the Amateur
Golfers Association Tour of Atlanta. ``If they don't make a big
deal of it, the guys won't, either.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Fifty years of love
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's a story Dad loves to tell. He's the gangly
country boy, just back from serving a short spell overseas at the
tail end of World War II. She's the city girl, a majorette for the
high school band in the small town where they both grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one look at her sashaying across that football field
and fell instantly in love,'' Dad recalls with a smile. Then he
regales us with how he had to win her away from a gaggle of
admirers, but with perseverance and no small amount of charm, was
able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history. Fifty years of it, actually, a milestone we
will soon celebrate with an open house at their church in the same
small town where they grew up and lived all their lives. My
brother, sister and I, and our families, will return to our
hometown, slice up the three-tiered cake, pour the gold punch, try
desperately to remember the names of our parents' friends we
haven't seen in 20 years, and videotape it all for posterity. We
will do it up as right as we know how, because it's an occasion
worthy of celebration and honor. As the children of this union, we
are exceedingly grateful for it, and for what it has taken to
maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was one month shy of 18 when they married; my father
was four years older. Nine months later they had their first child.
They lived in a small, wood-frame house with no indoor plumbing and
a coal-oil stove in the kitchen that provided the only heat during
cold Midwestern winters. They hauled water in from town once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, raised in town, learned how to slop the hogs, feed the
chickens, can food from the garden and heat goose eggs under a lamp
in the kitchen until the goslings hatched. She also learned how to
drive cattle from one pasture to another, roust errant hogs from
the cornfield and separate squealing newborn pigs from their irate,
charging mothers.
</P>
<P>
   None of this could have been easy. At the same time, Dad learned
how to be a man _ in the shadow of his own parents who lived up the
hill and still ran the farm on which the two families now jointly
worked. It was a large shadow Papa cast. They agreed and disagreed,
fumed and fought, but still planted and plowed and harvested crop
after crop, side by side, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the hard work, screaming kids and hovering
parents, my folks also had fun. They went dancing on Saturday
nights and to this day can glide around a dance floor with more
grace than my husband and I ever managed. They had card parties
with friends, staying up late into the night, laughing and telling
stories as they played hand after hand. They had barbecues and pig
roasts, inviting the whole neighborhood over, farm folks just like
themselves who came laden with potato salad and cole slaw, creamed
new potatoes and peas, cobblers, pies and homemade ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   They went to church every Sunday and made sure we went with
them. No argument, no discussion. Every Memorial Day, we filled
huge baskets with peonies and irises from our gardens and solemnly
went around to the cemeteries to remember our deceased ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   And my parents loved each other. Every morning began with a
kiss. Dad would slip up behind Mom, who was standing at the stove
before a pan of sizzling bacon, to nuzzle her neck. Waiting in the
car together for Mom to run into a store, Dad would watch her come
toward us and ask for the hundredth time, ``Don't you have a

 &HT;    Commentary: Fifty years of love
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's a story Dad loves to tell. He's the gangly
country boy, just back from serving a short spell overseas at the
tail end of World War II. She's the city girl, a majorette for the
high school band in the small town where they both grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took one look at her sashaying across that football field
and fell instantly in love,'' Dad recalls with a smile. Then he
regales us with how he had to win her away from a gaggle of
admirers, but with perseverance and no small amount of charm, was
able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history. Fifty years of it, actually, a milestone we
will soon celebrate with an open house at their church in the same
small town where they grew up and lived all their lives. My
brother, sister and I, and our families, will return to our
hometown, slice up the three-tiered cake, pour the gold punch, try
desperately to remember the names of our parents' friends we
haven't seen in 20 years, and videotape it all for posterity. We
will do it up as right as we know how, because it's an occasion
worthy of celebration and honor. As the children of this union, we
are exceedingly grateful for it, and for what it has taken to
maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was one month shy of 18 when they married; my father
was four years older. Nine months later they had their first child.
They lived in a small, wood-frame house with no indoor plumbing and
a coal-oil stove in the kitchen that provided the only heat during
cold Midwestern winters. They hauled water in from town once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, raised in town, learned how to slop the hogs, feed the
chickens, can food from the garden and heat goose eggs under a lamp
in the kitchen until the goslings hatched. She also learned how to
drive cattle from one pasture to another, roust errant hogs from
the cornfield and separate squealing newborn pigs from their irate,
charging mothers.
</P>
<P>
   None of this could have been easy. At the same time, Dad learned
how to be a man _ in the shadow of his own parents who lived up the
hill and still ran the farm on which the two families now jointly
worked. It was a large shadow Papa cast. They agreed and disagreed,
fumed and fought, but still planted and plowed and harvested crop
after crop, side by side, year after year.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the hard work, screaming kids and hovering
parents, my folks also had fun. They went dancing on Saturday
nights and to this day can glide around a dance floor with more
grace than my husband and I ever managed. They had card parties
with friends, staying up late into the night, laughing and telling
stories as they played hand after hand. They had barbecues and pig
roasts, inviting the whole neighborhood over, farm folks just like
themselves who came laden with potato salad and cole slaw, creamed
new potatoes and peas, cobblers, pies and homemade ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   They went to church every Sunday and made sure we went with
them. No argument, no discussion. Every Memorial Day, we filled
huge baskets with peonies and irises from our gardens and solemnly
went around to the cemeteries to remember our deceased ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   And my parents loved each other. Every morning began with a
kiss. Dad would slip up behind Mom, who was standing at the stove
before a pan of sizzling bacon, to nuzzle her neck. Waiting in the
car together for Mom to run into a store, Dad would watch her come
toward us and ask for the hundredth time, ``Don't you have a
beautiful mama?'' Yep, I sure do.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years of watching kids grow up, get in trouble, helping
them out of trouble, seeing them wed and helping out with
grandbabies' births. Fifty years of illnesses, both mild and
frightening. Fifty years of stoking the same home's oil furnace,
washing the same windows every spring, putting up the same storm
windows every fall. Fifty years of planting petunias and
snapdragons in the backyard flower bed and watching for the
hummingbirds each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dad loves to tell the story of how he met and fell in love
with Mom. And, 50 years later, we still love to hear it.

DESPITE BEST EFFORTS, RAINFORESTS FACE UPHILL BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the two decades since saving the world's rain forests became
an environmental cause celebre, there has been plenty of
consciousness raising, some successful corporate boycotting, and a
new flavor of ice cream _ Rainforest Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   There have been modest victories. Children have been putting
coins in parking meters at zoos and aquariums around the country
which has raised $1.5 million to purchase conservation land. Costa
Rica, which witnessed massive deforestation, has managed to
preserve about 20 percent of its wilderness and is in the vanguard
for creating new, benign uses for the land. And there is hope for
more: In April, Brazil promised to set aside 62 million acres of
Amazon jungle for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the amount of time it takes you to read this sentence,
more than two acres of rain forest will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 through 1995, 450 million acres of forest _ almost all
of it tropical _ were lost around the world. In roughly that same
time, a comparatively small 18.3 million acres were conserved,
according to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge,
England.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the high profile of the rain forest issue, the rate
of destruction is increasing. A congressional commission this year
estimated that 22,393 square miles, or 145 million acres, are being
destroyed in the Amazon every year. As a result, the rain forests
aren't only being threatened, they are disappearing. If the current
rates continue, all that may be left in 20 years is boutique
forests and jungle museums _ protected areas that give a glimpse of
what the past was like, but that are so small they cannot support
all the life that once thrived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to leapfrog destruction or jump start some new
conservation processes so that something meaningful is left,'' says
Bruce Cabarle, director of the global forest program for the World
Wildlife Fund. ``When we whittle forests down to such a small size,
we begin to lose the things inside them that make them unique. And
one of the things you usually lose are the large vertebrates that
require a lot of space. We could end up where we will have
boutiques or museums, but they will be empty museums.''
</P>
<P>
   And the dry season is about to settle on an Amazon basin that
some scientists say is dangerously parched. That condition could
permit fires to burn out of control. The Amazon is the largest of
the world's three remaining great tropical rain forests _ the
others are in Central Africa and Papua, New Guinea _ and the home
to much of the world's flora and fauna, and a fifth of the world's
fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a very critical situation,'' says Daniel C.
Nepstad, a scientist at the Amazon Institute and the Woods Hole
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an interaction between  &UR; gfspanish &LR; El Nino events
increasing in severity and frequency, selective timber harvesting,
which leaves the forest more vulnerable, and the expansion of the
agricultural frontier. It means that 1998 could be a severe burning
season. The area that is vulnerable is some 400,000 square
kilometers, or eight Costa Ricas, or 20 Massachusettses.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent fires in Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia indicate how
fragile the rain forests are on a global scale. The fires are set,
in some cases by poor indigenous people clearing land to farm, in
others by multinational companies clearing land for plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of subsistence farming, the resultant ash provides
rich fertilizer for only two or three years, then the process is
repeated. The Amazon forest is also facing threats from
international timber companies that previously clear-cut their way
across the Southeast Asian archipelago and are now moving into
Latin America with a vengeance, buying up the logging rights to
millions of acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we are tilting at windmills,'' acknowledges
Christopher Hatch, campaigns director for Rainforest Action
Network, a California-based environmental action group that
organizes product boycotts and demonstrations in an effort to raise
awareness and protect the remaining forests.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the pace of deforestation, the World Bank and World
Wildlife Fund estimate that one of every eight plant species on
earth is threatened with extinction. Some have great medicinal and
pharmaceutical value _ for example, a plant that grows only on
Madagascar is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease _ while
the value of others remains undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   The rain forests also have helped to protect the world's climate
by cleansing the air.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide _ a gas mostly caused by industrial uses and
burning forests _ exacerbates the greenhouse effect by permitting
the sun's heat to reach the earth, but then blocking the heat from
radiating back out to space. As a result, the globe's temperature
is rising. Last year was the warmest in the last 600 years,
according to researchers at the University of Massachusetts. In
1995, scientists reported direct evidence that the tropical rain
forests soak up large amounts of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Even selective logging, mining, or oil exploitation the forests,
each of which leaves a much smaller area of destruction than
slash-and-burn agriculture or clear-cut logging, can also create a
threat because the access roads left behind are used by settlers to
clear more land, says Ian Bowles, vice president of Conservation
International.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a generalized awareness that it is important to
preserve the rain forest, that does not seem to be translating into
significant consumer action. Imports of the tropical wood mahogany
to the United States, for example, rose 14 percent from 1991 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the daunting odds, conservationists insist there is
still some hope for the future of the rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic because I have seen significant successes and I
have seen corporate leaders from Intel and Ford Motor play an
active role in our organization,'' says Bowles. ``Ten years ago,
major corporate leaders in the US were not paying as much attention
to conservation on a global scale as they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hatch, of the Rainforest Action Network, predicts that
mahogany imports should start to drop as public awareness is
increased.
</P>
<P>
   What is doomed, however, is the idea of a wilderness area set
aside simply for preservation's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Land purchases are good solutions for areas that are highly
threatened and might not otherwise be saved, says Nigel Sizer, a
senior associate with the World Resources Institute. But buying the
land, which can be had for as little as $1 an acre, is the cheap
part. Protecting it from poachers and illegal logging is more
difficult, and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 80 percent of logging in Brazil is illegal.
And many of the country's national parks are known as ``paper
parks'' because there is nothing to prevent them from being
overrun. Even Brazil's announcement with the World Bank and World
Wildlife Fund that 62 million acres will be set aside has been met
with some skepticism since preserving the land may be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every effort made today, no matter how small, can make a
difference many years from now,'' Sizer says. ``The environmental
movement has won huge victories protecting wilderness. ... That
said, each year more forest is lost, less is left, and time is
running out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simply buying land and fencing it off, says Daniel
Janzen, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has spent
the last three decades working in Costa Rica, the rain forests must
be viewed as gardens _ with all the attendant requirements: care
and management and harvesting. ``We do not need more planning
conferences, more studies, more analysis,'' he says. ``We need
honestly spent cash to buy the land and put it into a different
kind of production, in direct competition with the agro-scape and
urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop thinking of there being `productive lands' and
set-asides, conserved. All three land uses are highly productive,
but each produces a different crop and each requires a different
set of rules, laws and traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Costa Rica, there are plenty of examples of how to protect
rain forests while producing income. Tourism now accounts for about
$700 million annually and has supplanted bananas and coffee as the
top foreign-exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioprospecting'' is another potential money-maker that
requires rain forests to be kept intact. The largest such contract,
partially brokered by Janzen, was the $1.3 million that drug giant
Merck paid to Costa Rica's National Biodiversity Institute for
chemical extracts from flora and fauna in protected areas. If drugs
are made, Costa Rica gets a royalty. Other companies, seeking
everything from fragrances to natural pesticides, followed suit.
Conservationists are also hopeful that demand for potable water
will help to keep forests intact because they protect water sources
from agricultural pollution and obviate the need for expensive
treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising international effort is the purchase of carbon
storage rights by polluters who emit large amounts of carbon
dioxide. A Nebraska-based power company spent $500,000 and raised
that much again for 5,777 acres of Costa Rican forest to give to
the national park system this year, in order to offset carbon
dioxide emissions from a power plant under construction in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   If such sales are approved under the Kyoto global protocols
hammered out last year, they could generate hundreds of millions of
dollars a year for forest preservation. Diplomats will gather in
November in Buenos Aires to grapple with the issue of carbon
set-asides and the role that forests can play. But the time for
action is growing short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goods and services that come out of the forest that require us
to keep it in a fairly pristine state will be the key to the
future,'' says Cabarle. ``And what happens in Buenos Aires will be
a key event to watch. It will fundamentally determine if and when
we have a market for trading greenhouse gas emissions and what
role, if any, forests will play in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the greatest boon for forest preservation, or the
biggest fatalistic missed opportunity we stumbled over in the
dark.''

WHY ICE CREAM GIVES SOME PEOPLE HEADACHES

<P>
   Q. What causes hot flashes?
</P>
<P>
   M.M. Watertown
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The root of the hot flash can be traced to a part of the
brain called the hypothalamus. This portion of the brain is
responsible for many basic life functions: respiration,
circulation, and for keeping the body temperature stable.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the hypothalamus as a thermostat, says Dr. Brian Walsh,
director of the Menopause Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-menopausal women, the thermostat is steady because of the
relatively high levels of estrogen circulating through the body.
But during menopause, when estrogen levels dip, the thermostat
becomes unstable. A man's thermostat will also become unstable,
notes Walsh, when estrogen given him as a medical treatment is
later withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   When estrogen is withdrawn, says Walsh, ``basically you have a
faulty thermostat that's going haywire.''
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat messages the body to cool off. The blood vessels
in the face and chest dilate as the body attempts to give off heat.
Body temperature then falls, and the person who's had the hot flash
feels a chill, says Walsh, an assistant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   The thermostat generally stabilizes after a few years, but some
women endure a decade or more of hot flashes. On average, says
Walsh, a woman's last menstrual period occurs at about age 52. Hot
flashes actually begin earlier _ around age of 48 or 49.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests, says Walsh, that if a woman is going to use
estrogen replacement therapy, it should be started while she is
still menstruating.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. Why do people sometimes get headaches when they eat ice
cream?
</P>
<P>
   R.B. Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Though it's popularly known as an ice cream headache, the
sudden searing pain can be brought on when you eat or drink
anything that's cold.
</P>
<P>
   The headache occurs when a cold substance hits the soft palate
in the back of the roof of the mouth, says Dr. Robert Smith, a
founder of the Cincinnati Headache Center. ``The effects are not
injurious,'' he says, ``but they cause a nasty pain and can
slightly reduce the pleasures of eating ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain is generally felt around the temples and sometimes
behind the ears or in the esophagus. It usually lasts only 10 to 15
seconds. People who suffer from migraines often report temporary
migraine pain during ice cream headaches, and tension headache
sufferers report their ice cream headaches feel more like ordinary
tension headaches. Headaches of all types _ including the ice cream
one _ are most common among people aged 20 to 40, Smith adds.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream headaches were first described by Dr. Daniel Drake,
the founder of the University of Cincinnati medical school, in
1850. Nearly 150 years later, their cause is still not precisely
known. But Smith has an educated guess. The nerve receptors in the
palate are sensitive to cold, as well as heat and taste. Those same
nerves are also involved in the constriction and expansion of blood
vessels in the mouth, head, and brain. The cold stimuli in the
mouth may cause blood vessels in the brain to expand _ and that
could be what causes the pain.
</P>
<P>
   A cure? ``Of course, you could avoid ice cream, but who wants to
do that?'' says Smith. Instead, he says, don't eat ice cream in
``big gobs.'' If you do get a sudden sharp pain while munching a
cone, press your tongue against the roof of your mouth to help
reheat the sensitive area.

STUDIES EXPLORE LOVE AND THE SWEATY T-SHIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

<P>
   When it comes to love, sex and friendship, do birds of a feather
flock together? Or do opposites attract? The argument is so old
that even Aristotle mentioned evidence for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a new chapter has been opened by researchers who say
that people find difference, at least in one type of gene, sexy and
sameness boring _ and that they use their noses to tell which is
which.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recent studies are those of a Swiss group that used
sweaty T-shirts to establish that people can sniff out genetic
difference, a Chicago team that concluded from its study of a
religious community that genetically similar people tend to avoid
marrying one another, and a New Mexico study, again using T-shirts,
that claims women at their most fertile time of month will prefer
the odor of the fittest-looking men.
</P>
<P>
   Some other scientists regard these claims as spurious, but more
research in this vein is in the works, the believers say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The genes in question instruct cells to make the proteins of the
Major Histocompatability Complex, one of the immune system's key
markers of identity. MHC proteins attach to foreign bodies and
present them to the immune system for a verdict of self or not
self. The system attacks anything that does not pass the test. That
includes foreign MHC proteins, which is why skin grafts and
transplanted organs are rejected unless the donor's MHC is very
similar to the recipient's.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 MHC genes on human Chromosome Six and so
many versions of each gene, that in a typical population of 100,000
people, only two or three people are likely to match very closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about how hard it is to find organ donors, that's
what we're talking about,'' said Carole Ober of the University of
Chicago's Department of Human Genetics, who is running the Chicago
studies. ``It's virtually impossible to find a match if you go
outside your own family.''
</P>
<P>
   That unusual variety makes the MHC genes useful to population
geneticists, who track ancestries by tracing particular
combinations of versions of genes, which are passed from parents to
offspring in sets called haplotypes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Lewis Thomas, a writer and medical researcher, suggested
that different MHC genes might be linked to different odors. He was
considering training dogs to sniff out compatible people for skin
grafts and organ donations.
</P>
<P>
   That led to work on laboratory mice and rats that established
that the animals preferred mates that were different in their MHC
genes. Scientists speculated that this was either a mechanism to
prevent inbreeding or an efficient way for animals to ensure that
their offspring would have immune systems diverse enough to fight
as many diseases as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, several researchers, each on a distinct
path, began to wonder whether the MHC effect in rodents might be
found in people.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claus Wedekind, of the Zoological Institute at Bern University
in Switzerland, believed that body odor might signal that its owner
had desirable immune genes that would help offspring fight off
diseases. He devised an experiment to see if human body odor
correlated with MHC genes and if people could tell.
</P>
<P>
   He and his team collected DNA samples from 49 female students
from the university, mostly in biology and psychology, and 44 male
students, mostly from chemistry, physics and geography. He asked
the men to wear cotton T-shirts on a Sunday and a Monday night, to
keep the shirt in an open plastic bag in between, to use
perfume-free detergents and soaps, and to avoid smelly rooms,
smell-producing foods and activities, like smoking and sex, that
create odors. Meanwhile, the women were given a nasal spray to use
for two weeks before the test to protect their nasal membranes from
infection. They also each got a copy of the Patrick Suskind novel
``Perfume'' to make them more conscious of odors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the T-shirts were collected, each woman was asked to give
ratings, for intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness, to three
T-shirts from men with similar MHC genes and three from men whose
MHC genes were less similar. They did not know which shirts were
which.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who are not taking oral contraceptives and who are
dissimilar to a particular male's MHC perceive his odor as more
pleasant than women whose MHC is more similar to that of the test
man,'' Wedekind and his colleagues wrote in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society of London, where the results were published in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Odors of men with dissimilar MHC reminded the women of their own
mates or former mates twice as often as did the odors of men with
similar MHC. However, if a woman was taking oral contraceptives,
which partly mimic pregnancy, this predilection was reversed, and
they gave higher ratings to men with similar MHC. ``The Pill effect
really surprised me,'' Wedekind said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up study, Wedekind was surprised to find that no
particular combination of MHC genes seemed more desirable than any
other. Rather than being impelled to seek ``good'' combinations of
MHC genes that were unusually resistant to disease strains, as he
had expected, he found that his subjects seemed simply to find
difference appealing.

INTERNATIONAL MILITARY FORCE FOR KOSOVO URGED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called on
President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin to join in
preventing an all-out war in Kosovo, as the use of international
troops appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-minute phone conversation Sunday, Blair and Clinton
discussed the possibility of using force to halt Serbian attacks on
ethnic Albanians. Blair, trying to forge a united response from
several nations, called Yeltsin and urged him not to oppose efforts
to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest language of recent days, Blair told Yeltsin
that the international community, including Russia, must stop the
``barbarism'' in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. During the
half-hour conversation, Blair asked Yeltsin to summon ``whatever
influence he has'' to persuade Slobodan Milosevic, president of the
Yugoslav Federation, to stop the killings. Serbia and Montenegro
are the two remaining republics of the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Blair, Clinton, and other Western leaders are
expected to authorize the use of troops to stop the bloodshed. At
the United Nations, the United States and Britain reportedly have
decided to seek an agreement authorizing ``all necessary measures''
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   That is strong diplomatic language that would give NATO the
legal grounds to enter the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton decides to use force, he may initially have support
from Capitol Hill. Senate majority leader Trent Lott suggested that
he would support dispatching troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow this slaughter to occur,'' the Mississippi
Republican said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``Once again the
Serbians are out of control. ... I'm not saying we should not
consider troops if it continues the way it is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst Hannum, a professor of international relations at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, cautioned
that American and European leaders still have not agreed on clear
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The West has not endorsed independence for Kosovo, he said, yet
it is close to sending troops to the Kosovo-Serbian border _ a
maneuver that would seem to signal support for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to have troops poised, but I still wonder what
their purpose will be once they get in there,'' Hannum said.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-ups of violence in Kosovo and the flight of thousands
of refugees have rekindled old arguments about the obligations of
the United States and Western Europe in the ethnic and political
battles that rage in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton
administration's peace negotiator for Bosnia, said the West needs
to talk tough and back up its threats with troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're engaged in is classic preventative diplomacy,''
said Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton peace accord of 1995 and
has been predicting violence in Kosovo for several months. ``There
is a mutual European-American mistake, and that is not realizing
the core lesson from Bosnia: The end of the Cold War did not mean
the end of America's obligations around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and Robert Gelbard, US envoy to the area, have warned
that violence in Kosovo could spread to nearby areas with ethnic
tensions, including Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Albanians are the overwhelming majority in Kosovo, where
several hundred people have been killed since fighting broke out in
February. Last week, thousands of Albanian refugees poured out of
villages destroyed by Serbian police fighting the rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA. The rebels, who are becoming more
aggressive, on Sunday called on their ethnic brethren in Albania to
take up arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA calls on all men from 18 to 55 years to join in the
struggle for the liberation of the country,'' the guerrillas said
in a statement published in an Albanian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Serb forces reportedly continued shelling suspected
militant positions in western Kosovo. Albanian television reported
that rebels had blown up the police headquarters in Ratkoc.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, a crowd of 1,000
ethnic Albanians demonstrating for independence was dispersed by
club-wielding Serbian police, who beat and injured at least six of
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton's top foreign affairs advisers will
discuss Kosovo today, a spokesman said. At least three
international forums will deal with Kosovo this week: the UN, NATO,
and the so-called Contact Group, where the West and Russia
coordinate Balkan mediation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials spent eight hours Sunday in Albania interviewing
Kosovar refugees and aid workers, according to an official of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
peacekeeping body.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will allow diplomatic observers to enter Kosovo, The
New York Times reported today. The first observer missions could
take place as early as today, the newspaper said, quoting senior
Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters saw some 50 Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas slipping
across the border from Albania into Kosovo with 10 mules loaded
with ammunition. The guerrillas wore camouflaged fatigues and
carried Kalashnikov assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   , British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Sunday that
Milosevic had ``crossed the threshold'' in the last week. ``The use
of tanks, of artillery, of the might of the military army against
civilian centers of population is wholly unacceptable within the
modern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair, attempting to raise London's diplomatic profile, has held
the rotating presidency of the European Union since January. He has
tried to coordinate US discussions with Russia, which tends to side
with its fellow Slavs in Serbia. Several diplomats said they expect
Russia to use its veto power in the UN Security Council to prevent
international troops from getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   Even US officials who want to take a more active role in Kosovo
are aware that the presence of troops could irritate Serbian
nationalists, who might try to orchestrate an attack in order to
humiliate the Pentagon and force a retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly address, Pope John Paul II said the international
community ``could not stay inert before the violence, repression,
and fleeing of the population.''

 UNDATED: difference appealing.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a different research track, Dr. Ober and her Chicago
colleagues studied 411 married couples in 31 Hutterite colonies in
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   A tight-knit religious group who marry among their own and
believe in large families, the Hutterites in her sample are
unusually closely related to one another because they are all
descended from only 64 people who emigrated from the sect's
original home in Europe in the 1870s. That means couples do not
have the astronomical odds against sharing MHC genes that they do
in secular American society.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ober's team sampled the DNA of all 411 couples, identifying
haplotypes on the MHC region of Chromosome Six. She then entered
the known genealogy of the Hutterites into a computer simulation,
which predicted significantly more haplotype-matched couples than
actually exist. That suggests, Dr. Ober said, that Hutterites
somehow avoid marriage to partners with whom they share too many
MHC genes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Gangestad, a psychologist, and Dr. Randy Thornhill, a
biologist, both at the University of New Mexico, have proposed that
symmetry between right side and left, which in many animals is a
sign of health, fertility and longevity, is also important in human
mating.
</P>
<P>
   Gangestad and Thornhill measured their male volunteers for ear
length, ear width, elbow width, wrist width, foot breadth, and
lengths of fingers and thumbs. In a paper to be published this year
in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, they wrote that
female volunteers who were not taking oral contraceptives, given
T-shirts that had been worn by the male volunteers, showed a
preference for the smell of the most symmetrical men only if the
women were at that stage of their monthly cycle in which they were
more likely to become pregnant. In fact, the doctors wrote, the
preference was stronger as the likelihood of pregnancy increased.
</P>
<P>
   Many other biologists are not convinced by these studies. ``I'm
basically skeptical until I see some really strong evidence,'' said
Philip W. Hedrick, a biologist at Arizona State University, and a
critic of the idea that smell affects human sex and marriage. ``I
think mate choice is probably a lot more complicated, particularly
in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the issue of the American Journal of Human
Genetics that published Dr. Ober's paper on Hutterite mate choice,
Hedrick and Francis L. Black of Yale reported that their analysis
of couples in 11 Amazon tribes had not found the same effect. The
paper looked at two MHC genes, while Dr. Ober used haplotypes, so
the studies are not strictly comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Hedrick has also clashed with Wedekind. The Swiss team
``basically trained his subjects to make odor significant,'' with
their nasal sprays and novels, Hedrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific debate will continue as biologists plan further
studies and the technology for precisely measuring odor improves,
Wedekind said. In the meantime, he and fellow believers must also
contend with part of the lay public that is uncomfortable with
research that suggests that profound decisions about sex, marriage
and parenthood could be affected by body odor.
</P>
<P>
   ``One politician called and told us she would be doing
everything she could to see I was expelled from the university,''
Wedekind said. ``Some people really fight this kind of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Wedekind said he was unsympathetic to those fears. The
``keywords'' used to describe the research for reference, he said,
are ``words like humans, mate choice,' `genes.' That makes some
people want to fight it, and I understand their concerns. Some
people may be remembering what happened 60 years ago in Germany.

MAGNETIC TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION HAS ADVANTAGES OVER SHOCK
THERAPY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, severely depressed people have had one last resort if
antidepressant drugs and talking therapy failed: ECT or
electroconvulsive therapy _ better known as ``shock'' therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In ECT, electrodes placed on the scalp send electrical pulses to
the brain, which, to be effective, must be strong enough to trigger
a seizure. To prevent pain and injury from convulsions during the
therapy, the patient is given general anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 80 to 90 percent of the time, ECT works well, better, in
fact, than drugs, which help in 60 to 70 percent of cases. Because
of its effectiveness, 50,000 people a year turn to ECT &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the downside, and it's a big one, is that ECT causes
confusion after treatments (three times weekly for several weeks),
and memory loss, some of which may be irreversible. And mood may
improve for only three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, brain researchers say they may have found another
way to jolt the brain out of depression _ TMS, or transcranial
magnetic stimulation _ that has many potential advantages over ECT.
It's still not clear whether TMS will be as potent as ECT, but it
does appear to have fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
   With ECT, for instance, much of the electric current from
electrodes is stopped by the scalp and skull. The current that does
get through spreads through the entire brain, causing a generalized
seizure _ a kind of electrical storm.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if there's no seizure, there's no improvement in
depression, perhaps because seizures trigger an increase in the
brain chemical serotonin, just as many antidepressant drugs do,
says Dr. Richard Weiner of Duke University, who heads the American
Psychiatric Association task force on ECT.
</P>
<P>
   With TMS, it's not an electric current but a magnetic field that
passes through the brain, generated by a coil of wire that's placed
on the head and turned rapidly on and off. The magnetic field then
excites nerve cells in the brain _ only where it is aimed, usually
the left prefrontal cortex (behind the forehead), where electrical
activity is often abnormal in depressed people.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can TMS be precisely targeted, it does not cause
seizures or memory problems &UR; , &LR;  and anesthesia is not necessary.
``Those are huge plusses,'' says Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, a
neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   TMS is still experimental, which means that if you want to try
it, you have to participate in one of the clinical trials now
under &UR;  &LR; way around the country. Worldwide, it has been tried in only
about 1,000 people, says Dr. David Avery, associate professor of
psychiatry and behavior science at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, published data exist on only 200 patients, says Dr.
Mark George, a psychiatrist, neurologist and radiologist &UR; , &LR;  at the
Medical University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And only two of the published studies _ involving a total of 29
patients _ were double blind, that is, designed so that neither
patients nor researchers knew who was getting real TMS and who was
getting a sham procedure in which the brain was not stimulated.
Even in these studies, the technicians knew which patient was
getting what.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these caveats, the early findings have set brain
researchers buzzing, most recently at a Society of Biological
Psychiatry meeting 10 days ago in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 17 patients published in 1996 in the British
medical journal Lancet, for instance, Pascual-Leone said patients
given TMS showed a 50 percent improvement on a commonly-used
depression rating scale. ``That's better than any antidepressant
ever, better than ECT. It's a remarkable efficacy in any time
frame, and these were psychotically depressed people,'' said
George.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger study presented at the meeting, Pascual-Leone got a
60 percent response when he treated people with TMS for 10 days
(not five, as in his earlier study) and the benefits lasted several
months.
</P>
<P>
   George's double blind study of 12 people, published in the
December 1997 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, was a
bit less dazzling. After two weeks of TMS, patients scored about 20
percent better on depression tests.
</P>
<P>
   But his new results on 30 patients, also presented in Toronto,
were more encouraging: a nearly 50 percent improvement in
depression for patients given low frequency TMS. (Those given high
frequency TMS fared less well, showing only a 30 percent decrease
in depression, which was similar to those who got sham treatment.)
</P>
<P>
   The emerging data on TMS is exciting to researchers and doctors
in part because depression is so common. Over a lifetime, 7.4
percent of women and 2.8 percent of men suffer a bout of major,
incapacitating depression. When less serious forms of depression
are included, one quarter of women have an episode at some point in
life, as do 15 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Also encouraging, researchers say, is the suggestion that TMS
may be also useful for other illnesses that affect the brain,
including post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, and perhaps Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But TMS is of intense academic interest as well because of the
light it could shed on the brain disruptions believed to be present
_ as the cause or the effect _ in depression.
</P>
<P>
   PET scans of depressed individuals have shown a decreased blood
flow to the left prefrontal cortex, along with decreased metabolism
of glucose, says Dr. Holly Lisanby, a Columbia University
psychiatrist who is starting a study of combined TMS and drug
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind magnetic stimulation, says Dr. Eric
Wassermann, a neurologist at the National Institute of Neurologic
Disorders and Stroke, is that it boosts the excitability of these
prefrontal nerves, that is, it kind of jolts them out of their
sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
   But depression is so complex that other areas of the brain are
undoubtedly involved, too, including the cingulate gyrus, which
lies deep in the limbic system (which controls emotion).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, much as they'd like one, scientists still have
no grand theory to explain how vastly different treatments for
depression _ drugs, ECT and TMS _ may act on different regions of
the brain but all produce an improvement in mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can figure out what TMS is doing,'' says George, ``we
are almost there in terms of understanding depression. That is the
driving hope I have, an addition to finding what might help a lot
of people.''

   ALBUQUERQUE _ He's convinced there's gold in them thar hills _
and platinum and a host of other precious metals as well. Never
mind that the ``hills'' are mountains of rock and metal hurtling
through space. James Benson, a successful entrepreneur from
Colorado, is determined to stake his claim.
</P>
<P>
   Benson intends to be the first person to claim ownership of a
celestial object, in this case an asteroid, and eventually to mine
whatever kind of precious nuggets it holds.
</P>
<P>
   He says any asteroid a mile or more in diameter _ and there are
hundreds of them _ ``contains natural resources that, if found on
Earth, would have a value of more than a trillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a big ``if.'' Right now nobody has the faintest idea
how to go about mining an asteroid or bringing the minerals to
Earth in an economically feasible way. Benson looked into it
seriously, hoping to do just that, but decided that would have to
wait for later. For now, he's got a different plan.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who was trained as a geologist but ended up making a
small fortune in the computer business, has studied the possibility
of mining asteroids, the moon, or Mars, or of establishing other
businesses (such as lunar tourist hotels) far from Earth. He
concluded that while all of these ideas will someday be feasible,
none is yet within reach of a start-up business. Instead, he
decided to focus first on gathering and selling scientific data _ a
market he says is worth $1 billion a year _ and staking his claim
to an asteroid that he could mine when the time is right.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the world of science react to all this? With
curiosity, excitement, disbelief, and occasionally anger, as
evidenced by an unusually heated panel discussion during a recent
space conference, ``Space '98,'' in Albuquerque. Some can't wait to
sign up &UR; . &LR;  Others are aghast at the audacity of his high-flying
claim-jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``My visceral reaction was `heavens forbid, not on your life',''
said Eleanor Helin, a NASA astronomer who has discovered literally
hundreds of asteroids _ including one that Benson is considering as
a target.
</P>
<P>
   Helin, who in the Albuquerque discussion bristled at Benson's
plans to declare ownership of an asteroid, said ``there would be
some hesitation if somebody was not only going out and landing on
your asteroidal body, but exploiting it _ bringing it around
(closer to Earth) or munching it up on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no law that says Benson can't stake a claim to a
potential gold mine in space. Under an international treaty,
nations forego the right to lay claim to any celestial body, but
the treaty says nothing about individuals or corporations _
probably because at the time the treaty was drafted, in the 1970s,
private space ventures weren't considered a serious possibility.
</P>
<P>
   One international lawyers' group hopes to clear up the issue by
filing a class-action lawsuit. Declan O'Donnell, a leader of the
lawyers' group, said the questions on ownership rights in space
``could keep a fleet of lawyers going forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, however, has no intention of waiting for the legal
process to run its course. He will make the claim and see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Benson is not the only businessman hoping to turn a profit from
deep space. (Near-Earth space, on the other hand, is already a
thriving business location; communications and observation
satellites have been making billions for years). At least two
companies plan to send privately-financed missions to collect moon
rocks and sell them at auction; others have ideas for tourist
hotels in space, or lunar rovers that could be remote-controlled
from Earth for a fee in a kind of real-life videogame.
</P>
<P>
   But Benson, who says his publicly-traded company has already
attracted all but about $6 to $8 million of the less-than-$50
million estimated cost of the first mission (not counting the
launch itself), appears to be furthest along.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  NASA has given the mission its nod of approval: It qualifies
as part of the agency's ``Discovery'' program, which could provide
funding to scientists who propose experiments for the mission, if
they pass a scientific peer-review process. And Benson says
customers are lining up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private sector can do things less expensively than
government,'' says Benson, who made enough money to retire in
comfort after founding and selling three computer services
businesses. He says he currently owns more than half of SpaceDev's
stock.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it looks like he may be right about the potential for
cost savings in privately-financed science missions. Seven
scientists have already notified NASA of their interest in placing
their experiments onboard the spacecraft SpaceDev plans to launch
late in 2000. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``We're flying a bus, selling rides to scientists,'' Benson
said &UR;  &LR; in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will charge scientists $15 million for the privilege
of using space on the craft _ ``one third of what the government is
charging'' for similar missions. The mission, called the Near-Earth
Asteroid Prospector, would go into orbit around an asteroid and
also send four small penetrating probes to gather data from on,
near, or even inside it.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, his company is asking a panel of scientists, led
by former Mars Pathfinder project manager Tony Spear, to evaluate
an alternative candidate: Nereus, an asteroid discovered by Helin,
that is about a half-mile across. It is thought to be made mostly
of carbon-containing compounds and water.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While much attention has focused on precious metals, Benson
says, plain old water may turn out to be the most valuable material
for space miners. Anything sent into orbit from Earth costs at
least $5,000 a pound, and water could be a crucial resource for
future space ventures, not only to supply the needs of astronauts
and space tourists, but also to split into hydrogen and oxygen to
make rocket fuel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Only three asteroids have ever been photographed from close
range &UR;  &LR; in space, and those pictures were made during quick flyby
missions. So scientists are eager to get their hands on the kind of
data that Benson's mission would provide. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Only one other current mission is targeted to spend time close
to an asteroid, collecting pictures and data over a long period:
NASA's NEAR mission (for Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous) will meet
up with the large asteroid Eros next Jan. 10. But because asteroids
are so varied _ some made of pure metal, some of rock, and some
mixed _ scientists would like to sample several.
</P>
<P>
   If and when Benson's mission flies, ``I want to send a camera
along,'' said Peter Smith, an astronomer at the University of
Arizona who designed the camera for last year's Mars Pathfinder
mission. ``What's gotten me excited is that ``50 years from now,
there will be a tremendous commercialization of space _ tourism,
trips to other planets, and so on. But here's a group that wants to
start now.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is one of the scientists who have notified NASA that they
intend to propose experiments for Benson's NEAP mission. Under
rules passed last year by Congress, the agency is required to make
use of commercial opportunities in space transportation whenever
they are available, as long as it can be done for less cost than a
government-financed mission.
</P>
<P>
   As Benson sees it, it's a potential win-win situation: NASA gets
data for the scientists it supports, for far less money than if it
ran the mission itself. And Benson gets to turn a profit and launch
his new business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he adds, it's a low-risk venture. NASA would pay for
the data with grants to the scientists whose proposals are
accepted, but only after the mission succeeds. If it doesn't
succeed, SpaceDev's investment would be recovered, because the
mission will be fully insured.
</P>
<P>
   Even Helin, despite her reservations about the prospect of
seeing one of the asteroids she discovered get ``munched up,'' is
cautiously supportive of the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I step back,'' she said last week, ``I say, `what will
this gain us; is there science to be gained?'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Benson's initial plan, which calls for nothing more than the
gathering of data, ``doesn't bother me,'' she said. ``I wish him
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith finds the whole process not only exciting, but a
refreshing change of pace from the NASA bureacracy, with its
internal politics and infighting, that he has spent so much time
dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of clever ideas,'' Smith said about Benson in
an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   While there are still many hurdles for this kind of venture to
overcome, Smith said, if Benson can rack up ``one or two successes,
it could really snowball. It could always fail, but if it succeeds,
it could be a really terrific thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if it doesn't work for Benson, Smith suggested,
privately financed space ventures are inevitable. ``If he doesn't
do it, somebody else will &UR; . &LR; ''

NEW DATA COMPLICATE THEORIES OF NEUTRINOS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   One of the biggest embarrassments of 20th-century science _ the
sun's refusal to emit nearly as many neutrinos as physicists say it
should _ inched closer to a possible solution last week when
experimenters reported strong new evidence that these weird
elementary particles, long thought to be perfectly massless, may
have a small amount of heft after all.
</P>
<P>
   If neutrinos indeed have mass, the story goes, they can change
``flavor'' on their flight from the center of the sun, eluding the
electronic snares earthlings have been setting. The neutrinos
wouldn't be missing, but traveling in disguise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the ``solar neutrino deficit,'' as it's politely called,
still isn't ready to give up its secrets. Just as the news,
reported at the Neutrino '98 conference in Takayama, Japan, seemed
to clear up one mystery, it raised another: The same team claiming
the existence of neutrino mass may have also cast doubt on the most
elegant version of the changing-flavor hypothesis, in favor of an
alternative that many theorists find ugly and contrived.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is far from resolved. Gathering and interpreting
data about these rarefied particles _ inevitably described as
``ghostly'' and ``elusive'' _ is among the most delicate and
frustrating challenges of physics. For all the excitement over last
week's breakthrough, it may still be years before anyone knows
what's going on with the sun. ``The solar neutrino issue is far
from settled,'' said Dr. John Learned of the University of Hawaii,
a member of the international team whose experiments at the
Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory in Japan found the evidence
of neutrino mass. ``It drives you nuts because this is such a slow
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding another twist to the seemingly endless saga, results from
Super-Kamiokande and other recent experiments suggest the jarring
possibility that the three kinds of neutrinos now believed to exist
might have to be joined by a fourth, and even a fifth and sixth.
Even stranger than their more familiar cousins, which barely
interact with other matter, these exotic new ``sterile'' neutrinos
would be even more reclusive: sealed off in their own phantom zone,
apparent only by their gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sterile neutrinos are a very ugly concept,'' lamented
Dr. John N. Bahcall, a theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study
in Princeton, N.J., who has spent most of his career trying to
solve the solar neutrino mess. ``I hope that they will not be
needed when all of the experiments now going on are complete. If
they are present, they will greatly complicate the efforts to get a
unique solution.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he and other theorists long for a mathematically elegant
explanation of the sun's obstinacy, the experimenters almost seem
to delight in finding more loose ends to be tied together. This
kind of rivalry is the driving force behind physics. Without a
theoretical framework in which they can be arranged, the data are
meaningless. And without the data, the theories are just
mathematical bric-a-brac. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much neater physics seemed in the early 1930s, when there
were just neutrons, protons, and electrons to worry about. Then
physicists found that a process called beta decay, in which a
neutron, which is unstable outside an atomic nucleus, turns into a
proton, spitting out an electron, defied the law of conservation of
energy. The amount of energy coming out of the reaction was less
than the amount going in. The solution: to invent an invisible
particle called the neutrino, tailored to carry away just the right
amount of missing energy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chargeless and thought to be massless, neutrinos were dismissed
for decades as mathematical figments, something to make the
equations balance, until they were detected in 1956 coming out of a
nuclear reactor. In the meantime, scientists realized that if stars
are powered by nuclear fusion (and it is hard to see how else they
could be), neutrinos must be constantly streaming from the sun. By
their very nature, they would speed through the Earth almost
entirely unimpeded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only way to detect neutrinos is through their exceedingly
rare collisions with ordinary matter. Hoping to snag just a few of
the particles, experimenters have placed swimming-pool sized vats
of various substances deep inside mines all over the world, where
they are shielded from just about everything but the penetrating
neutrinos. But after 30 years of measurements, the sun has been
found to be emitting only a third to a half of the neutrinos the
theorists predicted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the detectors have become more refined, and the results
harder to dismiss, physicists have been forced to conclude that
something is seriously wrong _ with either their understanding of
neutrinos or their understanding of how the sun shines. Many
physicists believe they have pretty much ruled out the possibility
that their model of the sun is seriously askew. No reasonable
amount of tweaking seems able to get the model to allow for such a
feeble breeze of solar neutrinos.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barring some stupendous discovery _ that the sun is powered not
by nuclear fusion but some unimaginable new phenomenon _ most
physicists wager that the fault lies instead with the reigning
theory of particles _ called simply the Standard Model. According
to this cornerstone of physics, neutrinos, along with electrons and
quarks, are the fundamental constituents of all matter.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ``flavors'' of neutrinos: the plain vanilla
``electron neutrino'' (the one involved in beta decay) and the more
exotic muon and tau neutrinos. The latter get their names from
their association with muons and tau particles, which are sort of
like heavy electrons. All three types of neutrinos have long been
held, mostly for reasons of esthetics or mathematical elegance, to
be massless.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists realized by the late 1960s that if the Standard Model
is wrong on this point and neutrinos have even the slightest mass,
they could conceivably change identity in mid-flight. Common
electron neutrinos could turn into the other, undetected kinds like
the muon and tau neutrinos. The deficit would be accounted for.

UNDATED: accounted for.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, theorists have rallied around an elegant
version of the hidden neutrino hypothesis called the MSW effect,
after its inventors, S.P. Mikheyev, Alexei Smirnov and Lincoln
Wolfenstein. According to MSW, the electron neutrinos are
constantly changing (``oscillating'' is the preferred term) into
other varieties as they interact with the gaseous matter inside the
sun. ``The MSW effect is a beautiful idea,'' Bahcall said. ``It
would seem like a cosmic mistake if nature did not use this
solution.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the theory to work, neutrinos must be shown to have mass _
otherwise they can't oscillate. This may have finally been shown,
in a backhanded way, by the Super-Kamiokande team.
</P>
<P>
   Here the immediate issue was not solar neutrinos but the
neutrinos created when cosmic rays strike the Earth's atmosphere.
The result is a cascade of reactions that is supposed to end in a
shower of the muon type of neutrinos. But detectors tuned to find
these ``atmospheric'' neutrinos also registered many fewer than
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   According to the results announced last week, the muon neutrinos
are disappearing somewhere along the way, presumably oscillating
into another flavor _ not electron neutrinos (that would be too
easy) but either tau neutrinos or one of the hypothetical sterile
neutrinos. If physics' theoretical infrastructure is sound, then
neutrino oscillation implies, ipso facto, that the particles have
mass. There has to be a difference of mass between the two neutrino
types for oscillation to occur, according to the rules of quantum
mechanics. And that means at least one type of neutrino has to have
a mass greater than zero.
</P>
<P>
   An experiment at a particle accelerator at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in 1995 has also been interpreted as showing neutrino
oscillation. But the Super-Kamiokande results are considered much
more definitive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that two birds have been killed with one stone: If
the atmospheric neutrino deficit can be solved with massive,
oscillating neutrinos, then surely the solar neutrino deficit can
be too. That's the hope, but other observations at Super-Kamiokande
have added new complications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MSW effect, the favored explanation for the solar deficit,
comes in two versions. The first predicts that the solar deficit
should be smaller at night when the neutrinos have to shine all the
way through the Earth to get to the detectors. By interacting with
the geological layers, electron neutrinos that had changed flavor
inside the sun would be converted back again. So far the
Super-Kamiokande team has not been able to find this day-night
variation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fallback version of MSW doesn't demand a day-night effect
perceptible enough to be measured with current technology. But it
does require that there be a certain shape to something called the
neutrino energy spectrum: the curve that results when the number of
neutrinos of different energies is plotted on a graph.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenters at Super-Kamiokande are finding a possible
``kink'' in the spectrum: more high-energy neutrinos are being
produced than predicted by MSW. ``We don't know if the kink will go
away as we collect more data, or if it will get bigger,'' said Dr.
Robert Svoboda, a physicist at Louisiana State University and a
member of the American Super-Kamiokande team. ``So far it seems
persistent. Both versions of MSW may be close to being ruled out.
Unless something changes dramatically, it's not what's going on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexei Smirnov of the International Centre for Theoretical
Physics in Trieste, Italy, (he's the ``S'' in MSW) said the data
are far too fragile and premature to overturn his theory yet. To
judge definitively whether the effect is real, he said,
experimenters will have to train their sights on solar neutrinos
with lower and lower energies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may take many years,'' Svoboda conceded. ``Patience is a
virtue for this type of observation.'' And it's still possible that
the kink is a statistical fluke, or caused by some exotic new
physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can only compensate for things one knows about,'' Learned
said. ``The sea of things one does not know about is infinite.''
</P>
<P>
   If MSW does not survive, physicists may find refuge in another
theory in which the solar neutrinos change identity not while
traveling through the mass of the sun and Earth, but within the
vacuum of space. Some kind of ``vacuum oscillations'' are already
needed to explain the atmospheric deficit _ there is not enough
matter in the air to cause a significant MSW effect. But getting
vacuum oscillations to account for the solar deficit is much
trickier. The theory only works if the masses of the various
neutrinos just happen to have certain values, and because the Earth
just happens to be the right distance from the sun. Many theorists
find these coincidences a little hard to swallow, and the theory is
called the Just-So effect, after Rudyard Kipling's tall tales.
</P>
<P>
   Even more repellent to some is the possibility that new
neutrinos will have to be invented. Three flavors aren't enough to
build a theory so expansive that it can accommodate the solar and
atmospheric results as well as the data from the earlier Los Alamos
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe all three of them, you are forced to invent a
fourth neutrino,'' said Dr. Sandip Pakvasa, a phenomenologist at
the University of Hawaii (one who has a leg in both the
experimental and the theoretical sides of physics). And if there is
one of these extra neutrinos, he said, there is probably no reason
why there cannot be more.
</P>
<P>
   Just nine years ago, scientists excitedly announced that they
had determined once and forever that there are three and only three
flavors of neutrinos. But the deciding experiment didn't address
the possibility of ``flavorless,'' sterile neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   Regular neutrinos are immune to electromagnetism and the strong
nuclear force, feeling only the weak nuclear force and gravity. The
hypothetical sterile neutrinos would ignore the weak force too.
Once an ordinary neutrino changed into a sterile neutrino, it would
essentially disappear from the universe, except for its minuscule
gravitational field. And a sterile neutrino oscillating into a
flavorful neutrino would seem to pop out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this desperate theoretical dodge is really necessary
should become clearer in the next few years as more neutrino
experiments come on line. Experimenters working at the Borexino
neutrino detector at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy
plan to test the Just-So theory by seeing if the number of solar
neutrinos, sensitive to the distance between Earth and sun, varies
with the seasons. In the MINOS experiment (Main Injector Neutrino
Oscillation Search), physicists will shoot a beam of neutrinos from
a particle accelerator at Fermilab in Illinois through the Earth to
a detector in the Soudan iron mine in northern Minnesota, looking
for oscillations. And the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, deep inside
a nickel mine in southern Ontario, will be the first tuned to
register all three flavors of neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   In half a decade, Pakvasa predicted, all the data will be in.
``We'll have the facts in front of us,'' he said. ``Then it's time
to start speculating. That might take longer. The theorists are
behind in the game.''

   SALT LAKE CITY _ Call it a confrontation between the confident
and the convinced.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, Southern Baptists have been gathering here in
the capital of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
observing, listening to seminars on Mormon beliefs, and
evangelizing a people who say they are already Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Southern Baptist Convention gets under way Tuesday at
the Salt Palace, far from the familiar flatlands and Appalachian
hills of the steamy South. As many as 9,000 representatives of
local churches will be present. Their willingness to come so far is
a perfect example, say their leaders, of renewed Southern Baptist
desire to carry the gospel into every corner of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptists have more than Mormons on their minds. They likely
will elect as their new president Paige Patterson, one of the
architects of the conservative movement that now dominates the
convention and its agencies. They will add an article to their
statement of belief that enshrines what they say is a biblical _
but others say anachronistic _ view of the family. And they will
give rapt attention to one of the most powerful evangelical, and
political, figures around, Dr. James Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days that led up to the convention, the dispute
between Baptists and Mormons was carried out in homes and on the
streets, as a series of events carefully planned by the
convention's Interfaith Witness Team brought the two sides face to
face. Up to 3,000 pastors, seminarians and lay people participated
Saturday in Crossover, a blitz of door-to-door visits, block
parties and sports-related rallies.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 10th year that Crossover has been conducted in
conjunction with the Southern Baptist's annual meeting. This year's
effort in Salt Lake City, however, has attracted more attention
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, it is a dispute as old as Christianity itself,
over questions of authority and freedom, of scripture and
revelation, of heresy and orthodoxy. And the Mormon church has done
this before, facing Christians who are critical and even hostile to
their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, as a mob of Baptists come storming their gates,
it is not to beat them or throw them in prison, as was done by
distrustful citizens in the Midwest more than 150 years ago. It is
to make the case that it is their version of Christianity, not the
Latter-day Saints', that is the true one.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, Mormons are not running away, but welcoming their
accosters with what they say will be Christian charity. That may be
because the dispute is taking place in their own stronghold. But in
any case, the descendants of Mormons who walked 1,500 miles across
some of the most forbidding terrain in the world, pulling their
possessions in handcarts, are not likely to be intimidated by a few
well-dressed Baptists who want to hand them a brochure.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Mormon teacher says it is the Baptists who may come
away with a different point of view. ``The local church authorities
are anxious for the evangelicals to come and see what Mormons are
like in their own environment,'' said Stephen Robinson, professor
of ancient scriptures at Brigham Young University. ``I think it
will do more good for dispelling false information on both sides.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders have not been shy about using the word
``cult'' when speaking of the Latter-day Saints. Phil Roberts,
director of Interfaith Witness for the convention's North American
Mission Board, said it's a term people understand. ``It means
they're not a Christian movement. From a sociological perspective,
they're very much mainstream. But theologically, we would say they
are a cult because they do claim exclusive truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson says he finds the word ``cult'' unfair. ``Any statement
about Christ in the Bible, I believe,'' he said. ``My own
understanding is that salvation comes only through Christ and
repentance of sins. We are saved by grace through faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict turns on what an authentic revelation from God is _
and who makes that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists, along with most Christians, Catholic and
Protestant, hold that the Bible is the complete revelation of God's
truth and that no other is needed or permitted. Mormons say that
there's nothing in the Bible that forbids further revelations.
``Latter-day Saints are saying, not only do we believe the Bible,
but the pattern of communication revealed there continues,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The belief in ongoing revelation goes back to the origins of the
Latter-day Saints in 1830, when 24-year-old Joseph Smith convinced
six others that he had translated a book of lost scripture given to
him on golden plates by the angel Moroni. The Book of Mormon has
been regarded by Smith's followers ever since as an authentic
revelation from God, a book of scripture equal to the Bible. Smith
assumed the mantle of a prophet, like Moses, and each of his
successors, including current President Gordon B. Hinckley, is said
to be a prophet also, capable of giving authoritative guidance to
the faithful on behalf of God.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Mormon doctrines have come under fire:
</P>
<P>
   _ God the Father was once a man who became immortal and still
has a physical nature. ``As man now is, God once was. As God now
is, man may be,'' said an early president, Lorenzo Snow.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Godhead consists of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, but they
are distinct persons, thus rejecting the traditional doctrine of
the Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good works are required to maintain (though not to earn)
salvation. ``The LDS would say works are necessary to stay in the
covenant. We have an obligation to do what the savior asks us to
do. If we repudiate it, we can fall from grace,'' said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some illegal or unsavory practices have been abandoned. By
prophetic declaration, polygamy was given up in 1890 and in 1978
black men were allowed into the priesthood, which was previously
reserved for whites and still is given to all males over age 11 who
demonstrate worthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was denounced as a lunatic in his day, but it is more
difficult to apply the term to 10 million followers today who
uphold the virtues of God, country and family. In judging whether
the Latter-day Saints' claim of ongoing revelation is valid,
scholars and denominational leaders point to the church's origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in objective analysis of their truth claims,''
Roberts said. ``Is there any evidence these things existed? Joseph
Smith said he was given gold plates. Where are they? He said
ancient American civilizations were Hebrew. Historians say they
were animistic and polytheistic. It seems to be a fabricated
document.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also says Smith is an unreliable figure who made
conflicting claims and was frequently wrong in his prophetic
declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Blomberg, a professor of New Testament at Denver Seminary,
a Conservative Baptist school, says one of the ways Jews and
Christians judged scripture as authentic is by its widespread use
by communities of faith over a period of time. Even if a lost
letter of St. Paul were unearthed today, Blomberg contends, it
wouldn't be added to the Bible because it wouldn't have been widely
used by Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that definition, anything not available to 19 centuries of
church use is not valid. If God wanted us to have had it all along,
he would have made sure we did,'' Blomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In rejoinder, Robinson appeals to personal conviction. ``The
best way to get any religious information is to ask God,'' he said.
``If he lets you know the information given is true, it is. We feel
the spirit has confirmed to us what Joseph Smith said is true.
Other Christians feel it has not.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also protests that some doctrines held by Southern
Baptists are not found in the Bible, like the Trinity. ``That's a
product of the fourth and fifth centuries. That's the very thing
Southern Baptists get upset with Latter-day Saints for _ adding
things to the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   So convinced are Latter-day Saints of the truth of Smith's
teachings, they view all other religions as less than perfect. ``We
like to think of religions as different light bulbs. It's better to
be a 40-watt than a 20-watt,'' Robinson said. Asked if Mormons are
a 100-watt bulb, Robinson said, laughing, ``I guess that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mormons claim to be neither Protestant nor Catholic but a
restoration of the true church, lost since the days of Jesus.
Blomberg, who collaborated with Robinson on a book, ``How Wide the
Divide? A Mormon and Evangelical in Conversation,'' said Mormonism
should be seen as part of a restorationist movement in 19th-century
American religion that produced such mainstream Protestant churches
as the Disciples of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a religious phenomenon that had the idea the Protestant
Reformation didn't go far enough. They wanted to go back to the
apostolic era and restore the Christianity of the New Testament,''
he said. ``Mormonism went a step further and said, `Not only are we
restoring it, it hasn't been there since the first century.'''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Smith and his followers dismissed 19 centuries of
Christian teaching.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it is not only Southern Baptists who consider
Mormons non-Christian. Catholics and moderate Protestants have made
similar judgments. A recent article in the United Methodist Review,
reporting on a meeting between Methodist and Mormon leaders at
First United Methodist Church in Salt Lake City, said, ``Latter-day
Saints hold beliefs about God and Scripture that are so radically
different from traditional Christianity that some Protestants
question whether it is the same God who is being worshiped or in
whose name the baptism occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Mormons are considered heretics by the rest of the
Christian world, why not leave them to their beliefs and let God be
the final judge? Why do Southern Baptists feel compelled to try to
convert them?
</P>
<P>
   The answer lies in the conviction of conservative leaders of the
denomination that everyone in the world _ including Baptists
themselves and their children _ must hear the gospel. This week's
effort in the Salt Lake valley is only part of a concerted
worldwide evangelistic program. Patterson has said if he is elected
president, he will set a goal of 500,000 baptisms worldwide in the
year 2000 alone.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists have drawn fire for their recent
evangelization of Jews, but less widely known is that Roman
Catholics are targets of the Interfaith Witness Team as well. ``We
do not believe salvation is brokered and Roman Catholicism
traditionally says it is,'' Roberts said. ``Our basic assignment is
to reach all non-evangelical denominations and movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Both churches emphasize missionary work, but thanks in part to
their tradition of volunteer missionaries, Mormons have been
growing at a much faster rate than Baptists in recent years,
especially in countries outside the United States. By some
estimates, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is
growing by 40,000 members a year. It is already the seventh-largest
church in the United States and at current rates, it would come
close to the Southern Baptists' No. 2 ranking sometime in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson says that growth may lie behind Southern Baptists'
labeling of Mormons as a cult. ``Basically, conservative
evangelicals have been interested in demonizing Latter-day Saints
to pre-empt the possibility that people will listen to what we have
to say,'' he said. ``It's an attempt to forestall conversions. The
wilder they can make us, the less likely people are to listen.''

WHEN FLYING ISN'T AN OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 14)  
 (JT)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend who was recently transferred to New York asked how she
can bring her parents from Louisville, Ky., to the city for a visit
when they will not fly and she does not want them to drive. To
paraphrase an old saw: Can they get here from there?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is yes, but not easily. Louisville, like many
cities in the United States, including a number of university
towns, now has no train service, and while it has long-distance bus
service, the schedules sometimes involve weird arrival or departure
hours: no one wants to arrive in a bus station in a strange city at
3 a.m. Since the creation of Amtrak and the demise of independent
rail passenger service, an increasing number of places have found
themselves linked to the outside world only by rubber tires, mainly
private automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   To get a glimpse of the travel choices available to nondriving,
nonflying travelers, I examined the options for travel to New York
from Louisville; Iowa City, home of the University of Iowa, and
Phoenix, a major retirement center.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville, population 269,000, had rail service until 1979 when
Amtrak dropped the stop under congressional budget pressure;
Phoenix, population 983,000, had service until June 1, 1996. Iowa
City, population 60,000, lost its Rock Island service in 1970,
before Amtrak came into existence in 1971. These cities are all on
now-aging Interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   The map in the Amtrak national timetable does not show Iowa
City, which is in the apparent void of eastern Iowa. Louisville and
Phoenix are linked to the Amtrak system by purple lines; these
represent ``Amtrak thruway services,'' which is to say a bus
connection. Marc Magliari, a spokesman for Amtrak, says that the
purple line indicates that Amtrak can sell a ticket for the
combined bus and rail trip, will transfer baggage and guarantee
that the passenger makes the connection. By ``guarantee,'' the line
means that if the bus misses the train, Amtrak will put passengers
up in a local hotel until the next train. This may sometimes be two
days off.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville to N.Y.: 3 Ways
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Louisville represents a hard choice. The bus-train
combination is slow, 30 hours and 45 minutes, and expensive if
sleeper accommodations are purchased, and they are an important
argument for the train. On June 2, the round-trip sleeper fare was
quoted at $940 for two senior citizens traveling together on July
14 and Aug. 1. Two train meals would be included each way. And
trains do permit a little walking around at will. The Greyhound bus
is faster and cheaper, but requires sitting up all night and an
early morning change of buses.
</P>
<P>
   Using Amtrak and its bus link, on a schedule chosen to reduce
the layover, a ``thruway'' bus leaves the Greyhound Station in
Louisville at 9 a.m. Eastern time and is due at Union Station in
Chicago at 3:25 p.m. Central time, a journey of 306 miles in seven
and a half hours. Then the Lake Shore Limited leaves Chicago at
8:15 p.m., which means a layover of almost five hours. (The Lake
Shore dining car does not serve dinner on leaving Chicago.) The
Lake Shore is due in New York's Penn Station at 3:41 p.m., a
journey of 959 miles in 18{ hours, although the clock shows 19{
because of the shift to Eastern time. The total number of miles for
this route is 1,265.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a price range for sleepers is impossible because Amtrak
uses the airline-created yield-management system, raising prices in
periods of demand and setting aside only a small number of tickets
at the lowest rates. Joyce Cosek, a long-time reservationist at
Amtrak, using the computer system, said that the minimum one-way
coach fare for Louisville-New York, with the bus leg included, was
$114, and the highest $181. If you break down the quoted sleeper
fare of $940 round trip for travel by two seniors July 14 and Aug.
1, this represents $470 each way, or $235 for each person. This is
a little higher than a rule of thumb Magliari quoted: an overnight
trip in a standard bedroom on Amtrak should be in the $150 to $200
range for one of two people.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to take the whole trip by Greyhound,
across Ohio and Pennsylvania rather than through Chicago. Jim
Austin, who is responsible for the computer system that serves the
bus line's reservationists, said the bus company had six buses a
day from Louisville to New York, none of them ``direct,'' meaning a
transfer is required. The fastest time is 17 hours 15 minutes for a
trip of 805 miles. For this example, a bus leaves Louisville at
11:10 p.m. and arrives in Cleveland at 6:40 a.m., where a change is
required. The departure is at 7 a.m., with arrival at the New York
Port Authority Bus Terminal set for 4:25 p.m. The fare for a
passenger who walks up at the last minute is $108 one way, $175
round trip; tickets purchased 30 days in advance cost $118 round
trip. Greyhound has blackout dates around holidays when
advance-purchase prices are not available.
</P>
<P>
   The buses have toilets aboard, Austin said, but some people do
not like to use them, so there are rest stops every two to three
hours. Snacks may be available along the way, but the night is
spent sitting up, as it is on many long plane flights.
</P>
<P>
   A railroad buff in my family looked up Louisville in the
Official Railway Guide for 1940, when dozens of trains came into
the city every day. The Cincinnati Limited left Louisville at 12:53
p.m. and arrived in Penn Station at 8:15 the next morning, a total
of a little over 19 hours with no changes.

 UNDATED: no changes.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another possible option today, if a costly one: Use a livery
service. P. Paul Powell Jr., executive vice president of Louisville
Transportation, a taxi and livery company, said a driver could be
found to make the trip straight through, which he estimated at 14
hours for the 800 miles, for $1,200. The price includes the
driver's trip back with no passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said that his company gets regular requests for service
to Orlando, and occasionally Las Vegas. Why Las Vegas? ``Well,
frankly, they get drunk,'' he said, ``and they have more money than
sense, so they go to Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   From Iowa City: 2 Ways
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa City-New York train trip covers a greater distance than
the Louisville-New York bus-train combination, but it is almost all
train travel, in a straighter line, and thus takes about the same
time, with a similar layover before catching the sleeper into New
York. The bus trip _ 23 hours _ takes longer than Louisville-New
York, but it is less demanding because it requires no change en
route. It would not require a lot of thought except that the fare
differential is greater.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa City Amtrak trip involves getting a lift or a cab to
cover 56 miles to Mount Pleasant, Iowa, a stop on the California
Zephyr's route between Emeryville, Calif., and Chicago. There is no
Amtrak bus service here. The eastbound Zephyr goes through daily at
11:20 a.m. Central time and covers the 233 miles to Chicago in five
hours, arriving at 4:10 p.m. This too connects with the Lake Shore
Limited, departing at 8:15 p.m. and arriving in New York at 3:41
p.m. the next day. Factoring in the change of time, the trip of
1,248 miles will consume 29{ hours, including the layover and just
an hour for the drive to Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest one-way Mount Pleasant-New York coach ticket is
$112, and the most expensive, $205. For a round trip for two
seniors using the sleeper on the Chicago-New York leg, leaving July
14 and returning Aug. 1, the fare was quoted on June 2 at $1,020.
</P>
<P>
   There are five Greyhound buses a day from Iowa City to New York,
a trip of 1,110 miles. The fastest trip takes 23 hours, according
to Austin, with the best schedule a departure at 11:05 a.m. Central
time, arriving at 11 a.m. Eastern time. The walkup fare is $119 one
way, $238 round trip; again, the advance purchase round-trip is
$118.
</P>
<P>
   From Phoenix: 2 Options
</P>
<P>
   The land trip from Phoenix to New York is 60 or 70 hours long,
no matter how you do it. The bus requires two changes, and you
would certainly be stiff after all that sitting. The train would
provide three nights in a sleeper and most meals, at a cost about
five times higher.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak provides a bus link north into Flagstaff, to pick up the
daily Southwest Chief, or south into Tucson, to pick up the Sunset
Limited on a Monday, Wednesday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To take the southern route, a bus leaves the former railroad
station in Phoenix at 5 a.m., covering the 119 miles to Tucson by
7:05 a.m. Using Monday as an example, the train bound east to
Florida arrives at 7:40 a.m. and is due in Jacksonville 49 hours
later, at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday. This leg is 2,101 miles. From
there, one of several choices into New York is the Silver Meteor,
leaving at 4:26 p.m. daily and arriving more than 17 hours later,
at 9:45 a.m. the next day, which would be Thursday. This leg is 978
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive coach ticket for Amtrak's 3,198-mile
Phoenix-Tucson-Jacksonville-New York trip would be $157; the most
expensive, $285. The sleeper trip was priced on June 2 at $2,005
for a round trip by two senior citizens traveling on July 15 and
returning Aug. 1. The per-night per-person cost for this fare works
out to $167, right in Magliari's ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   With Greyhound, there are several ways to get to New York, with
the fastest route for the 2,750 miles taking virtually 59 hours and
requiring two changes. The bus leaves Phoenix at 9:30 p.m. and
arrives in New York at 11:20 a.m. two days later. The walkup fare
for this is $122 one way, $215 round trip. The advance fare again
is $118 round trip.
</P>
<P>
   Where Trains and Buses Are
</P>
<P>
   The differences in bus or bus-train service from these three
locations are considerable; but some areas are even worse off.
Amtrak's skeletal structure does not touch four states at all:
Maine, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming, and almost skips
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Austin said that Greyhound service, although his map shows every
state is touched, was poorest where the population was most sparse:
South Dakota and the mountains of West Virginia. Compared with the
elaborate bus and train systems in Europe, these two maps look
skimpy in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents sell Amtrak tickets; a national timetable, with
the map, is available at railroad stations. Other information, or
reservations, is available at (800) 872-7245.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound sells a national route map for $1.50 at its agencies,
but not a national timetable. For this, the traveler needs an
old-time wish book, the fat monthly bus guide for all lines, of
which Greyhound, with its subsidiaries, is by far the biggest. For
the current month's guide, send a check (no credit cards) for $15,
requesting the Official National Motor Coach Guide: Russell's
Guides, 834 Third Avenue S.E., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52403; (319)
364-6138. The priceless advantage of this guide is the index in the
back: if a place name is there, there is a bus.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly bus guide solved a longtime mystery for me. When I
tried once to get to Bangor, Maine, Greyhound told me on the phone
it had no service north of Boston. Then a friend swore he had taken
Greyhound to Bangor and back. Russell's Guide shows Vermont Transit
connecting Boston and Bangor five times daily. Vermont Transit,
Austin explained, is owned by Greyhound, which makes connections
with its routes in Boston and sells its tickets. Confusingly, as it
happens with code-sharing by the airlines, sometimes a bus labeled
Greyhound runs to Boston and on through to Maine. Austin said that
the Vermont Transit name was retained because people in New England
liked it. But this does not explain why a caller was told that
Maine is not served by Greyhound.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flora Roberts is one of the last of the red-hot play
agents, a fiercely independent woman who has gone her own way in a
world dominated by corporate agencies. In a career of almost 50
years, she has been a formidable talent spotter. She is artful in
her choice of clients _ mostly writers, like Stephen Sondheim, Tina
Howe and Alfred Uhry _ and sharp-sighted in her assessments of
their strengths. She is a kind of dramaturge in the guise of an
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts has never hesitated to speak her mind. ``I'm very
rough on clients,'' she said recently. ``I was once reprimanded
very strongly by a playwright because I spent an hour telling him
what was wrong with his play. He got sadder and sadder and finally
said, `Would you mind telling me one good thing about the play?' I
said: `I'm terribly sorry, I just assumed that if I was spending so
much time talking to you, it would be obvious the play was worth a
rewrite. Otherwise, I would have simply said forget it.'''
</P>
<P>
   For her, ``writers are causes.'' Ms. Howe, the author of
``Pride's Crossing,'' said, ``She's a woman of enormous style,
heart, experience, courage, intelligence _ a real original.''
</P>
<P>
   With other agents, that might be considered an overstatement.
With Ms. Roberts, the description fits her like one of her large
red hats or her first name.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of style, her flamboyance approaches the folkloric. She
speaks in a gravelly basso, somewhere between Tallulah Bankhead and
Harvey Fierstein. She is short and roly-poly. In stunning contrast,
Ms. Howe is 6 feet tall, as thin as a birch tree. The agent and
client are often seen together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a preposterous duo,'' said Ms. Howe. ``I'm like the
stern duenna in New England black, and she's like the chorus
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim is Ms. Roberts' longest-running client. She met him in
the early 1950s when he was writing his first show, ``Saturday
Night.'' Many musicals and a Pulitzer Prize later, they are still
working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguishes her from other agents,'' said Sondheim,
``is that she cares more about the work than about the contract.
She's interested in nurturing the careers of her clients.'' Her
comments are diffuse, he said, and he makes her write them all
down: ``If you mine the gold from the dross, there is real gold.''
She is, he said, ``a protector and an idealist.''
</P>
<P>
   Her role varies from client to client. With Sondheim, she is
more of a sounding board than a catalyst. She would never suggest
that he rewrite a lyric, but she might suggest the placement of a
song. With ``Company,'' she proposed that ``Side by Side by Side''
be moved from the second act to the end of the first, to give the
leading character more definition. It made a major difference in
the musical.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that she made a creative contribution to ``West
Side Story.'' She denied it, except to say that she gave Arthur
Laurents, author of the show's book, a list of 16 suggestions: ``He
said 12 of them were idiotic, but four of them might save the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of her clients are writers, she also represents a
few directors (like Susan Stroman) and designers (like Jennifer
Tipton). ``To Tipton, I said, `The only thing I can do is make you
more money.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love most of my clients,'' she said. ``That's a
privilege when you're on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   With an almost equal passion, she loves horses. She frequently
goes to Belmont Park, and she owns a racehorse, Allaway, now
retired, and its progeny Beloved B and Flora's Personal Boy. At the
track, she plays her favorites, betting on a horse named ``Comedy
Tonight'' because Sondheim wrote a song by that title. Naturally,
she bet on it to show, and it did. She also took a flier on horses
named Fred Astaire and Curtain Going Up.
</P>
<P>
   When betting on plays and playwrights, she also relies on
instinct and on her assessment of form and potential. She said, ``I
gamble on the theater every day.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembered the time Frank Loesser asked her to speak to a
composer friend of his who had written, in Loesser's words, a
musical that was historical and very uncommercial: ``This little
man came into my apartment. He banged the piano and sang `Sit Down,
John,' and I got goose bumps.'' The composer was Sherman Edwards,
and the show was ``1776.'' She signed him up immediately but told
him his book lacked humor and would have to be rewritten. She led
him to Peter Stone (who was not her client), because he shared an
interest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, someone sent her ``The Gin Game.'' She was not
overwhelmed: ``I said, `Who's going to do a two-character play
about old people?' I came into the office, and on the wall was a
picture of the Cronyns in their nightshirts from `The Fourposter.'
I thought: `They're much older now. They could do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I called Hume. It was the quickest maneuver. He read it on
a plane. Two minutes later he bought it, and 3 minutes later he
gave it to Mike Nichols, and 10 minutes later the production was
all set.'' The play won a Pulitzer Prize for its author, D.L.
Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time that Alfred Uhry told her he was tired
of writing books for mildly successful musicals and thought he
would do a television miniseries. She said: ``You've never even
seen a miniseries. Write a play about the fact you didn't know you
were Jewish when you were growing up in the South.'' Responding to
her suggestion, he remembered his grandmother's chauffeur. The
result was ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' adding another Pulitzer Prize
for Ms. Roberts' playwriting stable. Is there a horse named Miss
Daisy or Ballyhoo?
</P>
<P>
   In one eventful day, Joseph Papp gave her both Ms. Howe and
Miguel Pinero, telling her, ``I want you to take care of my
poets.'' Pinero, who was a prison inmate before he became a
prize-winning playwright, called her Big Lady and told her, as he
told others to whom he felt indebted, that if she ever needed
protection, ``you call me, I break their legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had made any mistakes, Ms. Roberts remembered that
many years ago Mary Rodgers wanted to write a musical based on
Thornton Wilder's ``Merchant of Yonkers.'' Ms. Roberts said that
was ridiculous, that Wilder was a wonderful playwright and Ms.
Rodgers should leave his plays alone. Years later, of course, Jerry
Herman transformed the play into ``Hello, Dolly!''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before she became an agent, Ms. Roberts wanted to be a diva. As
a young woman, she studied at the Manhattan School of Music and
sang with Schola Cantorum. Arturo Toscanini heard her sing, and he
said, she recalled, ``Molta musica, but a small voice.'' In a loud,
hoarse whisper, she said, ``I thought I had a very large voice.''
She switched to torch songs, which she still sings at parties and
for friends.
</P>
<P>
   As a music student at Hunter College in the early 1940s, she did
volunteer work for the Stage Door Canteen and had an office in a
dressing room at the Paramount Theater. In the dressing room next
door was Frank Sinatra, at the height of popularity, with bobby
soxers swooning in Times Square. Almost every day, Ms. Roberts
brought back lunch for the two of them, and they became good
friends. After Sinatra finished his engagement, he went to
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   It was many years before they saw each other again. Representing
Sondheim, she went to see Sinatra about singing ``Send in the
Clowns'' on a new album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinatra threw open the door,'' she said. ``He looked at me and
said, `Hello, kid, are you still on 44th Street?''' Then they
listened to a record of the song, and at the words, ``Don't bother,
they're here,'' they both cried. In a moment of shared nostalgia,
he said, ``The kid understands, right?''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she went to work for Kermit Bloomgarden, who
was beginning his career as a Broadway producer. She was a
secretary, switchboard operator and receptionist. One day,
Bloomgarden asked her to read a new play by Lillian Hellman,
``Another Part of the Forest.'' The playwright asked her what she
thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about 20,'' she said, ``and I thought: `What's the worst
thing that can happen? I'll get another job.''' So she told Hellman
in detail what was wrong with the play. Hellman said to
Bloomgarden: ``How much are you paying this girl? Give her a raise.
She's right, and I don't think I can fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a raise,'' said Ms. Roberts, ``and she tried to fix
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, a new young playwright submitted a play called
``Sign of the Archer.'' She read it and advised Bloomgarden to do
it. But as a fledgling producer, he felt he could do only one play
at a time. He chose the one by Hellman and passed on the other one,
its title changed to ``All My Sons,'' to Elia Kazan. Later,
Bloomgarden produced ``Death of a Salesman,'' with Kazan directing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts found that she liked working with writers and
decided to become an agent. To open her office, she raised $200
each from five people in the theater, including the famously
thrifty producer Morton Gottlieb: ``I ran into Mort on the street.
He was walking to his union to pay his dues, and he gave the money
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her first clients was Ira Levin, who was then writing for
television. She got him a job dramatizing the novel ``No Time for
Sergeants'' for television and then for Broadway, and she found
Andy Griffith, who played the leading role. The play was a major
hit in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many other agents, Ms. Roberts is not known for
her power as a negotiator. Instead, she is a close reader of
manuscripts and an astute observer of a play in production.
</P>
<P>
   As the producer Andre Bishop says: ``Flora has a lovely way of
steering between all the people involved. She supports her clients
without taking sides against the others. Part of her aura is that
she worked for a producer. When she sees a show, you go out with
her afterward and discuss it, and sometimes she will make one
blazingly brilliant observation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most important play agents have been women, like
Audrey Wood in New York and Peggy Ramsay in London. Ms. Roberts
said she thought the reason was deep in the female psyche: ``Plays
need nurturing and rewriting. And in the theater, emotions are
right out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Roberts, this has been an especially busy season, with
``Pride's Crossing,'' Broadway revivals of ``1776'' and ``The Diary
of Anne Frank,'' and two Tony winners, ``The Last Night of
Ballyhoo'' and ``Titanic,'' carried over from last season. In each
case, she represents at least one of the creative principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible year,'' she said. For Ms. Roberts,
perhaps it was not so incredible.

`LOVES THAT BIND': AN ALPHABET OF LOVERS AND LITERARY STYLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Publication notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The premise of this new novel by the Spanish writer Julian Rios
is an ingenious one: a man who has been abandoned by his girlfriend
writes her a series of 26 letters about the ``other women'' in his
life as he wanders about the city of London, looking for his lost
love. Each of these women bears more than a passing resemblance to
a famous literary heroine, from Proust's Albertine to Raymond
Queneau's Zazie, and each is memorialized by Rios's narrator in a
manner meant to recall the style of the original author. It's a
premise that promises the reader a post-modern sendup of the gaps
and overlaps of literature and life, as well as some entertaining
literary high jinks: what you might get if you commissioned Queneau
and Donald Barthelme to rewrite ``Don Quixote'' and ``A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Rios does not deliver on the enormous potential
of his idea. Though ``Loves That Bind'' has moments of real
cleverness and sleight of hand, it is largely a paint-by-numbers
performance, lacking the sort of sustained literary ardor that
might have turned it from an experimental curiosity into a tour de
force. As a result, the reader is left to focus on the more
puzzlelike aspects of the novel _ trying to figure out the identity
of each of the 26 unnamed women, and trying to piece together the
story behind the narrator's breakup with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the literary heroines the narrator claims to have loved
or bedded are immediately recognizable. ``D,'' for instance, is
obviously Daisy from Fitzgerald's ``Great Gatsby'': a pretty
Southern belle with the sound of money in her voice, an East Egg
beauty married to an athletic hulk and courted by a lovelorn
millionaire. ``L'' is clearly Lolita, an ``apprentice starlette,''
``Lovely!'' in her pink miniskirt, preserved ``as she was and
forever will be'' in the narrator's memory. And ``S'' must be Sally
Bowles from Isherwood's ``Berlin Stories'' _ the English chanteuse
with bright green nails and a string of lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Others are somewhat harder to identify. ``B'' is Bonadea from
Robert Musil's ``Man Without Qualities,'' an unhappily married
woman whose nymphomania encourages her to lead a double life. ``F''
is Florence Dowell from Ford Madox Ford's ``Good Soldier,'' an
expatriate American who tells her husband she is suffering from a
heart condition, even as she embarks on a lengthy affair with a
handsome Englishman. And H is Hermine from Hermann Hesse's
``Steppenwolf,'' a strange young woman who wants to make the hero
love her so much that he will agree to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   As this selection of literary heroines indicates, Rios's
narrator fixates on women who are manipulative, disturbed or simply
incapable of being faithful to a single man. Although the
narrator's feelings will undergo a gradual shift as the book nears
its close _ by the letter ``Y,'' he has begun to recognize his own
shortcomings, identifying with the ``stupid goatish pride'' of the
alcoholic consul in ``Under the Volcano'' _ he tends to focus on
the same unsavory aspects of womankind in letter after letter. A
rich gallery of literary heroines, consequently, is reduced to a
surprisingly narrow spectrum of stereotypes: women as faithless
sluts, women as scheming man-killers, women as self-pitying
doormats.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits are clearly meant to reflect the narrator's
state of mind as he pines for his lost girlfriend, but they make
for a predictable and monochromatic story. Rios does little to use
his narrative setup to explore the disparity between his
book-obsessed hero's experience of life through art and his actual
experiences in the real world, and he does even less to make us
care about his hero's efforts to recapture his errant girlfriend.
The few bits of information we are given about the pair (that she
might have had an abortion, that he is taking care of a friend's
cat, that the two of them used to listen to Mama Cass records) are
not enough to loft them out of that limbo of generic ill-fated
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the narrator's worries about his ex's safety _ he worries
that she will be killed by a bomb, a terrorist, a freak accident _
they are supposedly meant to reflect his gloomy state of mind, if
not articulate his subconscious desire for revenge. They are
reiterated so many times, however, and reiterated in such a
plodding fashion that they ultimately undermine the story's already
pallid suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Matters are not helped by the dubious quality of many of Rios's
literary impersonations. Some of his chapters read like little more
than flat-footed pastiches of the original author's work. Others
read like misconceived _ or very poorly executed _ parodies. Rios's
Faulkner sounds like a run-of-the mill Gothic writer from the
South: ``There is no old Southern family without tares blighting
its Tara and its bloodline.'' His Joyce sounds an awful lot like
Henry Miller on speed: ``her fervent lover from Playboylandia
baptized Hugh in the holy land of Hibernia though never did he let
her hibernate but had to fornicate when it was almost time for the
bullfight.'' And his Proust sounds like a long-winded writer of
potboilers: ``I was the burning straw she clutched at to keep from
falling into the flames of her passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some subtleties may have been lost in translation from
the Spanish, Rios quite plainly has a tin ear for language and
locution _ a fatal flaw, it turns out, for a book constructed
around the idea of literary mimicry and improvisation.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ To stand in the scarred old forecourt of Grauman's
Egyptian Theater is to sense for a moment how it was when Hollywood
began. This is where flashbulbs first popped and fans first turned
out for that quintessential Hollywood invention, the
celebrity-studded gala premiere.
</P>
<P>
   And from 1922, when it opened with ``Robin Hood,'' starring
Douglas Fairbanks at $1.50 a ticket, to 1968, when Barbra Streisand
burst onto the screen in ``Funny Girl,'' the Egyptian, like its
better-known neighbor down Hollywood Boulevard, the Chinese, was
host to the biggest and the best in the business, from ``Ben Hur''
to ``My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1992, the once-bustling boulevard had devolved into a
dank and undesirable strip of tourist traps, troublemakers and
transients, and the Egyptian, by then badly faded, closed its
doors. Its cavernous auditorium became an encampment of homeless
squatters, who were evicted by the city just before the 1994
Northridge earthquake knocked 20-by-40-foot holes in its hollow
clay walls. The wrecking ball threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Hollywood Boulevard, just the way Times Square
did, is staggering toward a comeback, ready for another close-up as
hot new restaurants dot the area and the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences makes plans for a 3,300-seat theater and retail
complex from which the Oscars ceremony will be broadcast. And the
Egyptian, with the phoenix motifs sprinkled throughout its still
grand skeleton, is rising from the ashes as well.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is to be the new home of the American Cinematheque,
a local film preservation group that plans to use it for screenings
of classic movies, beginning in December with a grand
``re-premiere'' of Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 silent version of ``The
Ten Commandments,'' which opened at the Egyptian 75 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And preservationists here hope that the Egyptian's rise can be a
catalyst for renewed attention to other forgotten movie palaces
from the film industry and a city ``that's really famous for the
disregard of its own past,'' as Curtis Hanson, the director of
``L.A. Confidential'' puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Though downtown Los Angeles is home to a baker's dozen of
surviving movie palaces of the 1920s, all but three are shuttered
or being used as churches, flea markets and in one case a
nightclub. In Hollywood, more of the glitter has been preserved.
The well-worn Chinese remains not only a huge tourist attraction,
with its forecourt of stars' footprints in concrete, but also a
real first-run theater, packing in crowds for blockbusters like
``Titanic.'' Just across the street, the venerable El Capitan was
lovingly renovated by the Walt Disney Co. as a showcase for its
animated spectaculars.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, this fertile crescent of world filmdom has been
strikingly oblivious to the jewels in its midst as the city's elite
moved steadily west toward the beach and left the downtown theaters
to Spanish-dubbed movies and Hollywood to teen-age gangs. That is
partly because Hollywood itself has always been about the latest
trends, and except for perpetual remakes of its old standbys, its
idea of history amounts to last year's grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very interesting to me that overall, the entertainment
industry is very unaware that these great treasures exist in the
city that they live in,'' said Linda Dishman, executive director of
the Los Angeles Conservancy, a preservation group that sponsors an
annual monthlong series of vintage films in downtown theaters
called ``The Last Remaining Seats.'' This year's series began on
June 3 at the Orpheum Theater, still a functioning first-run movie
house downtown, with a live stage show and a screening of Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers in ``Top Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttered downtown theaters include the 2,220-seat Los
Angeles, in some ways the grandest of all, a French Baroque
masterpiece that opened in 1931 with Charlie Chaplin's ``City
Lights.'' A grand central staircase leads to a fountain made of
hanging crystals. Mothers with crying children could use either of
two soundproof crying rooms, while older children had a staffed
playroom in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies room had 16 private compartments, each finished in a
different marble, while the men had a walnut paneled lounge where a
periscopic series of prisms relayed the movie to a secondary
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The one way in which current-day Hollywood pays its respects to
its architectural past, Ms. Dishman said, is with location shooting
in the old theaters when scripts demand the feel of a Broadway
house, as in Bette Midler's recent television version of ``Gypsy,''
which was filmed at the Orpheum. But most of the palaces, which had
pioneering features for their time, lack adequate air-conditioning,
and even the conservancy felt compelled to move its summer series
from August to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But with vintage Spanish houses again in demand among stars like
Madonna and Ellen DeGeneres and retro Los Angeles recaptured in
Hansen's widely acclaimed film, Ms. Dishman and others see the
Egyptian's revival as an icon of what is possible, although only a
first step, and the Cinematheque as a fitting sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cinematheque is our industry's Getty Museum,'' said Steve
Tisch, the producer of ``Forrest Gump'' and a co-chairman of
cinematheque's capital campaign for the Egyptian, during a recent
look at the progress of the construction.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization, founded in 1984, has never had a permanent
home, and it obtained the Egyptian for $1 from the city's Community
Redevelopment Agency, which had acquired it from its last
commercial owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were negotiating and were close to a deal when the
earthquake hit in January of 1994, and so that, of course, threw a
monkey wrench in everything,'' said Barbara Smith, director of the
cinematheque. ``An empty theater couldn't be first on anybody's
list of priorities, and we spent a long time figuring out whether
it could even be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   As designed 76 years ago by the firm of Meyer &AMP; Holler, the
theater was originally planned in Moorish style, as the red tile
roof attests. But during construction, archeologists discovered
Tutankhamen's tomb in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Grauman, who had already made a splash with his ornate Million
Dollar Theater in downtown Los Angeles and would open his namesake
exotic Chinese in 1927, promptly switched courses to accommodate
the latest cultural fad. An actor dressed as a bearded Bedouin and
carrying a spear marched back and forth across the parapet,
announcing the next show.
</P>
<P>
   Seed money for the restoration came from $3 million in
earthquake insurance and a $2 million interest-free loan from the
Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the
cinematheque has been raising the rest of roughly $10 million in
costs through a private campaign.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the 150-foot forecourt, with its ocher walls painted
to look like giant stone blocks, is littered not only with the
rubble of bygone days but also with construction debris. Newly
painted profiles of Isis and Osiris and painted reliefs of the
pharaohs echo the original exterior decoration, and a restaurant
with a sidewalk cafe is planned. Inside, an elaborate gilded
sunburst design on the ceiling is being painstakingly restored.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation has been complicated by earlier remodelings that
destroyed much of the Egyptian's original splendor. In the 1940s
and '50s, under the management of the showman Michael Todd, the
theater entrance was moved forward into the grand forecourt,
creating a glassed-in lobby but destroying a row of four giant
stucco columns that supported a portico with the feel of a Theban
temple.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the ``Funny Girl'' premiere in 1968, the
massive proscenium arch, with ornate columns and hieroglyphs, was
destroyed to install a huge curved screen.
</P>
<P>
   The building ``had been so contaminated there was hardly
anything here,'' said Craig Hodgetts, a partner in the Los Angeles
architectural firm of Hodgetts &AMP; Fung, who is overseeing the
restoration. ``And it was very clear that the way the theater was
set up was inappropriate and inhospitable to modern acoustics and
surround sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution: build a jewel box within the shell of the
original. After entering the theater's husk, with its massive
fake-stone walls, moviegoers will be surrounded by 100-by-40-foot
acoustic plywood panels that will slide into place, enclosing a
650-seat auditorium when the lights go down. A 75-seat screening
room will be sunken into the back of the house, covered with a
gilded shell like a sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, studio artisans have been recruited to do the
decoration, people like Glenda Mullins, a scenic artist who has
worked on nearly 50 feature films but who now spends her days
making hand-cut stencils to reproduce the soft red, gold and green
patterns in the auditorium ceiling. For years, much of the building
had been open to the sky, so moisture is a problem, and the same
colors read differently on each patch of old plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bit of a job,'' Ms. Mullins said. ``Until a couple
of months ago, it was Niagara Falls in here.''
</P>
<P>
   But as new steel girders jut up inside the shell and scaffolding
rises to the ceiling, it is easy to imagine the splendors to come.
</P>
<P>
   Workers discovered, for example, the original box office
windows, which had been covered over in the lobby at one point, and
a beautiful original painted ceiling in the men's room that had
been hidden by a false ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   As Christy McAvoy, a principal in the Historic Resources Group,
the project's history architect, said, ``Every day now brings the
building more back to life.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, as is often its wont, seemed
inclined toward a middle course as it listened Monday to oral
arguments over Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's demand to see
notes taken by a lawyer giving confidential advice to White House
aide Vincent Foster shortly before Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The justices hinted they intend to balance the competing legal
interests involved rather than establish a sweeping new precedent.
</P>
<P>
   If that is indeed what they do, they will have justified their
keep this year, putting the brakes on an excessive overreach of
Starr's runaway probe without preventing legitimate inquiries. The
Supremes also refused recently to grant Starr an expedited hearing
on whether a top White House lawyer and three Secret Service agents
could be forced to testify about former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Monday's line of questioning indicated that a
majority of the high bench may not be prepared to let Starr invent
a new legal excuse in order to get his hands on the lawyer's notes.
The prosecutor argued that the lawyer-client privilege expires with
the death of the client, creating a new exception to that basic
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the justices seemed wary of setting a broad
precedent that could prohibit future prosecutors in criminal cases
from interrogating lawyers about conversations with clients who had
died. Murder, for instance, might create a more compelling reason
for an exception than Starr produced.
</P>
<P>
   Both Starr's associate, Brett Kavanaugh, and Foster's lawyer,
James Hamilton, asked the court to establish a new legal doctrine.
Starr wanted the right not only to read the three pages of notes
but to compel testimony under oath from the lawyer himself about
the confidential exchange. Hamilton wanted the court to create an
absolute protection for lawyers and their clients that extended to
the grave no matter the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers at the oral argument came away believing the court
would divide, perhaps 5-4, seeing no compelling reason to give
Starr a brand-new legal weapon but leaving open the possibility
that other circumstances might justify overcoming the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 White House firings of seven travel office employees,
the specific subject of Foster's conversation, were barely
mentioned. That particular controversy, in fact, is a marginal
issue in Starr's probe. The White House handled the situation
crudely but had the authority to fire the staffers. Starr's
interest seems to be mostly in whether First Lady Hillary Clinton
ordered the firings and then ducked responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The justices mostly suggested hypothetical situations that might
be affected by ruling one way or the other. Both Kavanaugh and
Hamilton were peppered with penetrating and sometimes unfriendly
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The potential consequences of a broad ruling in favor of Starr
have horrified the legal profession. The American Bar Association
sided with Hamilton, arguing that clients may not be candid if they
know their secrets can be spilled after they die.
</P>
<P>
   And what is recorded in Hamilton's notes would not be the end of
the matter. Hamilton may have jotted down ``Hillary did it'' or
written illegibly or simply observed that the depressed Foster
didn't know what to do. But if Starr wins, Hamilton could be hauled
into court to disclose everything Foster said, whether in the notes
or not.
</P>
<P>
   If that precedent were set, the next lawyer in the witness box
might well be Sam Heuer, who defended President Clinton's former
business partner James McDougal in the Arkansas trial in which
McDougal was convicted of fraud. Now that McDougal is dead, Heuer
might have very interesting things to say about his client's
honesty and knowledge of Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater
land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy pondered: What if five defendants are
accused of some criminal offense and one dies in mid-trial? Would
it be legitimate to force the lawyer of the dead dependent to spill
everything his client said in confidence about his compatriots?
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers everywhere would have to pray that their clients
stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Starr contended that people are not concerned about their
reputations after they die and the only ones who would mind are
those who plan to commit perjury or have something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   But people do care about their historical legacy, and so do
their families and friends. And the candor essential to good legal
representation may involve only embarrassment if made public, not
criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is way off base here, and the Supreme Court ought to
recognize it.

 &HT;    Short Takes: Goldwater's epitaph
 &HT;    (Corrects date of Eisenhower's statement.)
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even liberals are elbowing each other out of the way to say nice
things about Barry Goldwater. Sen. Goldwater was the trusted
friend, straight-shooter, gallant warrior, true blue conservative _
the kind of conservative liberals want back. Yet, in one moment of
Goldwater's life he irrevocably splintered the terms of the
national debate.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1964 GOP convention, Goldwater, accepting his party's
presidential nomination, declared, ``Extremism in defense of
liberty is no vice. Moderation in pursuit of justice is no
virtue.'' It brought down the house the way Dwight Eisenhower's
petulant poke at ``sensation-seeking columnists'' _ pronounced
``col-yum-nists'' _ did at the same convention. The cheering
startled Ike more than the Ardennes.
</P>
<P>
   If Goldwater meant what he said, one can only wonder what he
thought he meant. Containing Communism? The Bomb? The crowd knew,
or thought so. It was a stunning statement in a country whose
genius had been moderation, all of a sudden on its way to becoming
a semi-dirty word. The genie was out of the bottle, later to be
clothed in more respectable togs: Silent Majority, Southern
Strategy, Reagan Democrat, New Right. The incivility of your choice
could be noble pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater went on to other things, most notably talking Richard
Nixon out of office; Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig also claim
credit. Goldwater never took what he said back. Someone repeated it
at his funeral.

     ANTITRUST WARS HEAT UP AS FTC SUES INTEL
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of computer
chips, became the latest target of government trust-busters Monday
when the Federal Trade Commission voted to charge the company with
illegally failing to share key data with its customers.
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, the FTC chief's litigator, accused Intel of
selectively using its paramount position in the chip market as a
``club'' against three computer makers after relations with the
firms had soured in separate licensing, patent and royalty
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   These quarrels caused Intel to unfairly deny these customers
access to its coveted ``how-to manual,'' the FTC said. In doing so,
Intel has ``cut off customers and competitors in order to impede
innovation and stifle competition,'' Baer said at a news conference
after the commissioners voted 3-1 to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clara, Calif., the $25 billion microprocessor firm said
the FTC action is based upon a mistaken interpretation of the law
and the facts. It vowed to fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 10 years, Intel has taken unprecedented steps to
ensure that all of our activities and policies are in full
compliance with existing law,'' Intel said in a statement. ``The
commission's decision today signals that they want to change the
very laws upon which we've based our policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts noted that if the government prevails in
the Intel case, a dominant firm would be forced for the first time
to share its intellectual property with its customers _ even after
a falling-out.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC move follows a landmark Justice Department antitrust
suit against Microsoft Corp., which holds a virtual monopoly on the
Windows software that drives Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the world's twin leaders in chips and software
for personal computer _ known as ``Wintel'' _ now face parallel
assaults from the government in Washington courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the two cases and their future legal tracks differ,
however. While the anti-competitive charges against Microsoft are
due to be tried before a federal judge in early September, Intel
must respond to the regulatory agency's complaint before an FTC
administrative law judge.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, by freezing out Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp.
and Compaq Computer Corp. from advance information, ``repeatedly
used its monopoly power as a club'' against them, according to the
11-page complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The case was spawned after the chip giant denied Intergraph
samples of new microprocessors in advance of their general
availability. It did so in retaliation for a patent infringement
lawsuit that Intergraph _ the developer of a rival chip to Intel's
Pentium, called the Clipper _ had brought against Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The suit sought an injunction to halt Intel's microprocessor
sales, which control 90 percent of the market. In April, a federal
judge in Alabama ruled in Intergraph's favor in the patent case,
without issuing the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high stakes involved, the issue is likely to be
finally resolved by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The basic issue in the suit is whether Intel is within its
rights to refuse to provide Intergraph and other firms with advance
inside information. As the FTC sees it, those denials violate the
antitrust laws because, as an monopolist, Intel has an
``affirmative duty'' not to ``harm competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) is not an attack on Intel's success, which we applaud,
but only on unjustifiable conduct by Intel that keeps other firms
from being able to compete with it in the future,'' Baer said.
</P>
<P>
   If, he added, ``Intel can use its monopoly position in the
market for microprocessors to prevent other firms from enforcing
their own patents, other firms will have little incentive to invent
new features to challenge Intel's dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal under the antitrust laws for a monopolist to
wield its monopoly power to lock others out of the market, and by
doing so preventing future competition, and cementing the
monopolists' dominance in its market. Over the long run that means
less competition, higher prices, reduced choice for consumers,'' he
said.

   NEW YORK _ The producers of ``Honour,'' a four-character drama
about infidelity in the pundit class that marked Jane Alexander's
return to Broadway after four years as chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, announced Monday that it would close after
its Sunday matinee, becoming the first casualty of the Tony Awards
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The play had 57 regular performances and 28 previews. Producers
for several other shows that had hoped in vain for a Tony award on
Sunday to bolster sagging ticket sales met Monday to crunch numbers
and decide whether to close as well.
</P>
<P>
   Shows tend to close on a Sunday, squeezing in one last weekend
before going dark, and labor rules require producers to post a
closing notice by Tuesday evening if they intend to close on the
following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The story was more upbeat for shows that did well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King,'' which has been selling tickets as fast they
are printed, won six prizes, including one for best new musical of
the season. A new block of tickets to the show, covering dates
until Oct. 31, 1999, went on sale on Friday and business was strong
Monday, a spokesman for the show said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime,'' which had been the chief competition for the
best-musical award, drew Tonys for its score, book, orchestrations
and Audra McDonald's featured performance. Garth Drabinsky, the
creative director of Livent, the corporation that produced the
musical, said that ticket sales for the show, which had already
been strong, had more than doubled over the last week and were
being offered for performances through May 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art,'' the three-character comedy about longtime friends
bickering over a Minimalist painting, was a surprise winner for
best new play. Producers for ``Art'' said they expected to sell
nearly $100,000 in tickets Monday, nearly three times the average
daily figure.
</P>
<P>
   And the Roundabout Theater Company, which won awards for best
play revival (``A View From the Bridge'') and best musical revival
(``Cabaret''), said it sold three times as many tickets for ``A
View From the Bridge'' Monday as it had been selling before the
Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The show that many had expected to win best play, ``The Beauty
Queen of Leenane,'' did win awards for its director, Garry Hynes,
and for three cast members. A spokesman for the show said that
tickets were selling Monday at about triple the rate of previous
Mondays and predicted that the dark comedy, which opened on
Broadway in April after a successful Off Broadway run, would recoup
its investment this week.
</P>
<P>
   One striking element about the 52nd annual Tony ceremony was how
much the awards for excellence on Broadway, which for decades had
been dominated by New York writers and artists, have taken on a
less New York-centric flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lion King'' was based on an animated film from Hollywood, and
``Ragtime'' originated in Canada. ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane''
is by a South London playwright and was first produced in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best actress in a play went to an Irishwoman,
Marie Mullen, of ``Beauty Queen.'' The award for best actor went to
Anthony LaPaglia, an Australian, for ``A View From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Best actor in a musical went to a Scot, Alan Cumming of
``Cabaret,'' and best actress went to that show's Natasha
Richardson, who is English. The author of ``Art'' is Yasmina Reza,
a French citizen of Iranian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ceremony was the second for which that Rosie O'Donnell,
the talk show host, served as emcee from Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in her maiden voyage, she spurred a 35 percent jump
in television viewership, with an 11.2 rating and a 17 share. (Each
rating point represents 980,000 homes.) Despite a brisk season and
strong contests in numerous categories, this year's ratings were a
bit lower, a 10.3 rating and a 16 share for CBS. A network
spokesman said one reason for the drop was an NBA championship game
between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz on NBC.

     ANTITRUST WARS HEAT UP AS FTC SUES INTEL
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of computer
chips, became the latest target of government trust-busters Monday
when the Federal Trade Commission voted to charge the company with
illegally failing to share key data with its customers.
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, the FTC chief's litigator, accused Intel of
selectively using its paramount position in the chip market as a
``club'' against three computer makers after relations with the
firms had soured in separate licensing, patent and royalty
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   These quarrels caused Intel to unfairly deny these customers
access to its coveted ``how-to manual,'' the FTC said. In doing so,
Intel has ``cut off customers and competitors in order to impede
innovation and stifle competition,'' Baer said at a news conference
after the commissioners voted 3-1 to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clara, Calif., the $25 billion microprocessor firm said
the FTC action is based upon a mistaken interpretation of the law
and the facts. It vowed to fight the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 10 years, Intel has taken unprecedented steps to
ensure that all of our activities and policies are in full
compliance with existing law,'' Intel said in a statement. ``The
commission's decision today signals that they want to change the
very laws upon which we've based our policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts noted that if the government prevails in
the Intel case, a dominant firm would be forced for the first time
to share its intellectual property with its customers _ even after
a falling-out.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC move follows a landmark Justice Department antitrust
suit against Microsoft Corp., which holds a virtual monopoly on the
Windows software that drives Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the world's twin leaders in chips and software
for personal computer _ known as ``Wintel'' _ now face parallel
assaults from the government in Washington courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the two cases and their future legal tracks differ,
however. While the anti-competitive charges against Microsoft are
due to be tried before a federal judge in early September, Intel
must respond to the regulatory agency's complaint before an FTC
administrative law judge.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, by freezing out Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp.
and Compaq Computer Corp. from advance information, ``repeatedly
used its monopoly power as a club'' against them, according to the
11-page complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The case was spawned after the chip giant denied Intergraph
samples of new microprocessors in advance of their general
availability. It did so in retaliation for a patent infringement
lawsuit that Intergraph _ the developer of a rival chip to Intel's
Pentium, called the Clipper _ had brought against Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The suit sought an injunction to halt Intel's microprocessor
sales, which control 90 percent of the market. In April, a federal
judge in Alabama ruled in Intergraph's favor in the patent case,
without issuing the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high stakes involved, the issue is likely to be
finally resolved by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The basic issue in the suit is whether Intel is within its
rights to refuse to provide Intergraph and other firms with advance
inside information. As the FTC sees it, those denials violate the
antitrust laws because, as an monopolist, Intel has an
``affirmative duty'' not to ``harm competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) is not an attack on Intel's success, which we applaud,
but only on unjustifiable conduct by Intel that keeps other firms
from being able to compete with it in the future,'' Baer said.
</P>
<P>
   If, he added, ``Intel can use its monopoly position in the
market for microprocessors to prevent other firms from enforcing
their own patents, other firms will have little incentive to invent
new features to challenge Intel's dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal under the antitrust laws for a monopolist to
wield its monopoly power to lock others out of the market, and by
doing so preventing future competition, and cementing the
monopolists' dominance in its market. Over the long run that means
less competition, higher prices, reduced choice for consumers,'' he
said.

SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS TO STOP CHIP PRODUCTION FOR 1 WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea, one of the
largest semiconductor manufacturers, said Monday that it would
suspend all production of memory chips and much of the production
of nonmemory chips for a week to reduce inventory and strengthen
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lee, a spokeswoman for Samsung Electronics, said the
company would all but shutter its operations at Kiheung in South
Korea, though its other manufacturing sites, which produce home
appliances and telecommunications components, would continue
running.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung is following Hyundai Electronics, another large South
Korean semiconductor manufacturer, which announced last week that
it would stop production of dynamic random access memory chips, or
D-RAMs, for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts could hurt South Korea because semiconductors are one
of the country's largest exports and one of the biggest sources of
badly needed hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   LG Semicon, a third South Korean manufacturer, is expected to
follow its competitors. Together, the three companies produce 30
percent of the world's basic semiconductor chips.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts expressed skepticism about the impact of the cuts.
Twice before, the South Korean manufacturers have announced similar
cutbacks only to continue production, stockpiling their output
until prices rose on news of reduced production.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Warburg Dillon Read estimates that this year semiconductor
manufacturers will have 18 percent more inventory than needed to
meet demand; prices have fallen almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for semiconductor chips is slow partly because of
slower-than-expected sales of personal computers. Analysts do not
expect demand to rise markedly for another couple of years.

OUT THERE IN RADIOLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14)  
 (Eds: Items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What were the most memorable lines spoken on old-time radio?
</P>
<P>
   I can hear it now: Edward R. Murrow, not just saying, ``This ...
is London,'' but describing what he saw in a sortie over Berlin
with the RAF: ``The small incendiaries were going down like a
fistful of rice thrown on a piece of black velvet. The `cookies,'
the 4,000-pound high explosives, were bursting below like great
sunflowers gone mad.''
</P>
<P>
   And two years later, the equally familiar voice of his CBS
colleague Bob Trout, announcing on V-J day in 1945: ``This, ladies
and gentlemen, is the end of the Second World War.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen now to the opening line of the NBC science-fiction story
``Knock'' on the 1950 series ``Dimension X'': ``The last man on
Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   A modern editor would have to make changes in all those lines.
By ``the last man on Earth,'' the writer meant ``the last person'';
now, because the male no longer embraces the female, he would have
to write ``the last person on Earth'' because the listener would
immediately assume that the source of the knocking was a woman, and
not some subhuman or superhuman species.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a newly spawned Trout would be less likely to say
``ladies and gentlemen,'' nomenclature so dated as to seem quaint,
and not even used on the doors of lavatories anymore. And the
dramatic  &UR; this &LR; , which used to be in fashion on radio to begin a
sentence, has fallen into an innocuous desuetude.
</P>
<P>
   Malapropisms, however, need no updating. ``I don't object to
President Roosevelt using the radio to inform the country on the
state of the nation,'' said a man in the audience on the Blue
Network's ``Town Meeting of the Air,'' ``but I do object to his
using it to propagate.'' And a character eagerly awaiting the
arrival of the Lone Ranger shouts, ``I hear a white horse on the
way!''
</P>
<P>
   These and other great moments in the broadcast word are taken
from John Dunning's ``On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time
Radio'' (Oxford University Press, $55).
</P>
<P>
   Comedy was based on carefully established character traits, a
technique that carried over into television sitcoms. Jack Benny was
the tightwad who, when held up by a thief demanding ``Your money or
your life!'' answered with a long silence, interrupting the
laughter only with ``I'm thinking.'' The bandleader Phil Harris
played his role with swaggering stupidity: ``Phil is spelled with a
 &UR; P &LR; ?''
</P>
<P>
   The classic word-picture was Fred Allen's trope about NBC
censors: ``They are a bit of executive fungus that grows on a desk
that's been exposed to conference.'' Groucho Marx's standard
question for politicians who appeared as contestants on his quiz
show _ ``How many times have you been indicted?'' _ would not be so
funny today, but his regular query to baseball umpires _ ``Do you
have any little thieves at home?'' _ is still apt.
</P>
<P>
   But the humor most missed today is the flash of wit. When a
young woman told Groucho, ``I go to a college for girls,'' he
riposted, ``That's the reason I'd want to go, too.'' And when the
Shakespearean expert and sportswriter John Kieran was stumped on
``Information, Please'' by a question that was sent in by his son,
he said, ``How sharper than a thankless tooth it is to have a
serpent child.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people today think ``Information, Please'' is the name of
an almanac. It was once a literate radio program, moderated by
Clifton Fadiman, that was broadcast from 1938 to 1951. The title
was based on what telephone users would say to smilingly live
operators when an unknown listing was desired. Of time and the
river of language: Now we pay for the information from a robot that
dials it for us for an additional 35 cents, and nobody has to say
``please.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW OID WOID
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; syllogism &LR; , from the Greek for ``summing up,'' means ``the
drawing of a logical conclusion from two premises.'' In current
use, the deduction may be deceptive: ``All politicians and pundits
are venal; Safire is a political pundit; therefore, Safire is
doubly venal.'' The reasoning is seemingly logical but may be
false.
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote to his recent dissent from the Supreme Court
decision on Steel &AMP; Pickling Co. vs. Citizens for a Better
Environment, Justice John Paul Stevens used a syllogistic
construction: ``If A ... can be decided before B, and if B ... can
be decided before C ... then logic dictates that A ... can be
decided before C.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, pickling Stevens for the majority,
observed that his brother justice's argument was ``replete with
extensive case discussions, case citations, rationalizations and
 &UR; syllogoids &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of  &UR; factoid &LR; ,'' writes Stephen L. Wasby, professor
of political science at the State University of New York at Albany,
``but where did  &UR; syllogoid &LR;  come from?''
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; -oid &LR;  suffix, rooted in the Greek for ``shape,'' creates a
noun or adjective meaning ``similar but not the same; having the
characteristics of.'' A  &UR; factoid &LR; , coined in 1973 by Norman Mailer,
is an imagined or simulated fact.
</P>
<P>
   The noun  &UR; syllogoid &LR; , therefore, means ``an argument having the
form but not the logical force of a  &UR; syllogism &LR; .'' To Wasby's
point: Whence  &UR; syllogoid &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive search of databases and legal tomes reveals that
we have here what the Greeks called a  &UR; hapax legomenon &LR;  _ a word of
which only one use is recorded in all literature. (Happens a few
times in the Book of Job, making that text so hard to translate.)
In other words: (A, major premise) the word didn't exist; (B, minor
premise) Scalia used it; (C, logical conclusion) Scalia must have
coined it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only three possible responses to your note,'' Scalia
responds to my written query, ``none of which is satisfactory. The
first displays illiteracy (`You mean  &UR; syllogoid &LR;  is not a word?'),
the second confesses incompetence (since a coinage that has to be
explained is a failure) and the third risks giving offense. I pick
the last, and shall not respond at all, which I hereby do. Best
regards.''

 &HT;    The Milkman: last of a generation
 &HT;    Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--He is is a dying breed. Yet Rick Lee will not go gentle
into that good night. His job won't let him. Nor, for that matter,
will his truck.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, three hours before sunup, somewhere deep in the
sprawl of Cobb County, Lee's milk truck has started to sputter. And
so has Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to that,'' he says, cocking an ear at the dashboard of
his 11-year-old Chevy C-130 with 252,000 miles on the odometer. The
engine sounds like it's coughing on a tough piece of steak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like I'm going to have to get her some new sparkers and
maybe a new rotary button for the distributor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days it seems that the world's set against you. When you're
one of the last milkmen in metro Atlanta, those days start around
2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 27 years, Lee has been rising at that hour to thank
his luck, curse his luck and deliver milk, eggs, butter, cottage
cheese and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   From childhood it's a job he felt fated to do. He grew up in
DeKalb County,Ga., near Mathis Dairy. ``I learned to swim in the
pond there,'' he says. ``Splashing around next to all them cows.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for the dairy in 1971, a veteran home from
Vietnam, newly married and expecting a child.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, milkman was a job with a future. There were eight
Atlanta dairies with home delivery. On his first route in East
Point and College Park, Lee had 230 customers.
</P>
<P>
   He soon found that, with customers defecting to grocery stores
for cheaper milk, competition for the delivery business was
cutthroat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys from other dairies would do things like break your
bottles after you'd delivered them and leave a big mess on the
porch,'' Lee says. ``Or they would inject lemon juice through the
cap and spoil the milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they'd call the customer the next day and ask: `Are you
happy with your service?'''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, home-delivery operations folded until only Mathis
survived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 _ its fleet having shrunk in two decades from 80 trucks
to 25 _ Mathis, too, quit delivering milk and farmed out its
remaining routes to drivers with their own trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lee is one of only eight milkmen still working in
Atlanta. Seven deliver Mathis products, one Parmalat. All of them
depend on long-time customers. ``I'm probably a last-generation
milkman,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   He can't beat grocery prices _ he delivers a half-gallon of 2
percent for $2 _ although his milk probably beats grocery
freshness. Still, he says, his survival depends on selling
something without an expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   ``My customers don't buy milk,'' he says. ``They're buying me.''
</P>
<P>
   Slender, with shoulder-length brown hair streaked gray, Lee
looks his 50 years. His voice is nasal and high-pitched. He strikes
you as an odd, twangy, small-town character. A guy who stood still
so long the city sprouted around him.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over his Cobb County route in 1980, that's pretty
much what's happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``That used to be a farm,'' he says, driving up Johnson Ferry
Road hours before daybreak, pointing out retail tracts north of the
infamous Riverside Drive intersection where, last year, somebody _
probably an irate commuter _ shot the stoplight with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe how much this place has grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee has 200 regular customers. Friday is his shortest route of
the week. This morning he'll drive 50 miles to deliver 78 gallons
of milk, a dozen eggs, a pint of cottage cheese and 4 gallons of
orange juice to 38 homes.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't wear a watch. He keeps track of time listening to the
radio (``When Randy and Spiff come on Fox 97, I know it's 6
o'clock''). He runs stop signs and occasionally red lights (``I
just don't see the point when there ain't anybody out here but me
and some jackrabbits'').
</P>
<P>
   Most mornings, he says, the testiest part of the job is dodging
``health nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people out here jogging and walking their dogs on
800-foot leashes, and I come over the top of a hill and they're in
the middle of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   One morning he almost ran over a guy who was barefoot, wearing
nothing but a pair of green underwear and trotting down the center
line. ``He was into some serious squirrel,'' Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   Another time he happened upon the daughter of one of his
customers in a compromising position with her boyfriend on the hood
of the family sedan parked in the carport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `If you tell my parents, I'll get them to cancel
their milk delivery,''' says Lee. ``I said I wouldn't. I mean,
whatever floats your boat.''
</P>
<P>
   He switches off his headlights at most stops to avoid waking
customers, bounds out of the truck and grabs the plastic jugs of
milk from the cooler. (Mathis quit bottling in glass four years
ago.) He half-jogs, half-skitters to the door and back.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he leaves the milk, chilled to 35 degrees, in one
of the metal milk coolers some of his customers still have from the
old days. Most of the time he leaves it by the front door or
garage.
</P>
<P>
   A stop takes about 45 seconds. Then it's sometimes two miles to
the next customer.
</P>
<P>
   He knows each by name and has a bit of biographical information
on every one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan Sikorski does something with computers,'' he says. ``His
wife, Karen, bears a striking resemblance to Brooke Shields. Her
hobby is music. She plays piano. They don't have children. They
have cats.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sikorskis have been customers for 12 years. They could buy
milk maybe 40 cents a half-gallon cheaper at the grocery. But it
wouldn't be the same, Stan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just die-hard lovers of home delivery,'' he says. ``And,
beyond that, we feel we have a relationship with Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a relationship Lee goes out of his way to cultivate. Apart
from his twice-a-week deliveries, he's become, over the past three
years, an everyman poet and philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yearly, he writes a Christmas story for his customers. And every
month he appends a story or bit of homespun wisdom at the bottom of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aphorisms _ ``If you don't stand for something you'll fall for
anything'' _ spice his conversation. Most of them concern the
importance of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Lee himself is divorced with two children. But the sting of the
split, 16 years ago, still hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ex-wife is a good woman,'' he says. ``But as it turned out,
she didn't love me. And she just didn't like me being a milkman _
and neither did her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes the stories and proverbs in his head, thinking about
them while he drives his route. Then it's a matter of condensing
them into a cohesive paragraph or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This month, since it's Father's Day, the story I have is
called `A Light at the Top of the Stairs,' '' says Lee. ``Some of
the best conversations I ever had with my dad were late at night
when he was waiting up for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how Dad is always there, waiting for you, to give
you guidance in your darkest hour.''
</P>
<P>
   It's near sunup and the streets are crawling alive with what
soon will be a headlong crush of commuters. Lee makes his last stop
and heads south on Johnson Ferry trying to beat gridlock before it
beats him.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a new customer this morning. But he's fretting
about his old truck. Two days ago he dropped $175 on a new water
pump. The cooler leaks Freon. He piles ice on the milk to keep it
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Although he sells $8,000 worth of milk a month, after expenses
he takes home $1,600 to $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he thinks about another career. Then he looks around
and figures there's something to be said for being an anachronism
on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little scary being in business for yourself,'' he says.
``But the good thing about is, you know exactly what you're doing,
exactly where you're going and exactly what you're delivering _ and
there ain't a whole lot of paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people you know can say that about their jobs?''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Learning right way to lose just as important as homers
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For us, the baseball season at Morgan Falls Park ended last week
in 90-degree heat, throat-parching dust and a thrashing at the
hands of the White Sox. The playoffs are double elimination, and
the Yankees are out of it.
</P>
<P>
   No one on our side of the field felt especially good afterward.
It was only a few weeks ago that we played the season opener,
winning, and the pennants flapping in the breeze on that spring day
seemed to augur a long run in the playoffs. Now we were packing up
the gear, leaving the field not as losers but as a bunch that had
lost. There's a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys,'' Coach Rob Windsor told his team of mostly
10-year-olds, ``we had a good year. I'm proud of all of you, and
you can be proud of how we played together as a team.'' Everyone
enjoys winning, he said, but sometimes you learn more by losing.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking of this as I read letters responding to
free-lance writer Stan Moris' recent op-ed article in the Atlanta
Constitution. I don't know Moris, but I admired the honesty of his
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Moris and his 7-year-old son had had the experience of many
parents and kids who participate in organized baseball: Winning and
fun don't always mix, and you soon learn which of the two the
coaches _ and many parents _ care about more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is neighborhood baseball kid-driven or adult-driven?'' he
asked. ``I wonder. Too many parents and coaches have ... lost
perspective about what this is about. Sure, we all like to win. But
when winning is all that matters _ and 7-year-olds become the pawns
in the game _ something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Three letters responding to Moris' article were all from men,
and none of them quite got the point. One letter writer, Jay Levy,
came close. Another, from Atlanta, cobbled together a few ex-jock
cliches and delivered a patronizing homily on hard work.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the letter writer from Sharpsburg, Ga. who made me
smile. This was the American male at his chest-thumping, clubhouse
best. ``The person who has had little success in winning and tries
to soothe his wounded ego by declaring winning to be unimportant,''
he wrote, ``is fooling himself and taking away any incentive he
might otherwise have had to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but ``there is no closer bond than that shared by
friends who fight the same fight together.''
</P>
<P>
   You would have thought it was the Battle of the Bulge, not a
baseball game played by boys who don't even shave.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like winners, not losers. Winning is ingrained in our
national mythology. We won the West, we won two World Wars and for
a long time we cleaned up in every Olympics. We measure our worth
in the won-lost column and take losing very personally.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that all of us, sooner or later, lose. Forget
the baseball game, which is of no consequence anyway. We lose loved
ones, whether by death or divorce. Some of us lose a career and our
identity with it. Many of us will lose our health, if we only live
long enough, and others will lose hope.
</P>
<P>
   It seems reasonable to think the competitive spirit would work
to preserve the last, but it's hard to find any correlation. If the
sports pages are any index, the number of athletes with emotional
and psychological problems is disproportionate to the general
population. Many have been winners all their lives _ on the field,
at least. Somehow they never learned to win off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Men cling to the notion of sports as a metaphor for life. But
when the going gets tough, the tough don't always come through.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just athletes. Many studies have shown a higher
incidence of alcoholism and other problems among certain
high-achieving professional classes _ physicians, specifically _
than among the population at large. You don't get into medical
school _ or through it _ without discipline and an incentive to
excel. But they are not always assurances of much beyond the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the letter writer from Sharspburg was very young, without
much experience in life. Or maybe he just knew more about sports
than he did life. It's easy to confuse the two.
</P>
<P>
   In five years at Morgan Falls, we've been lucky. We always seem
to get the best coaches, even if we haven't always had the best
teams. This year, Rob Windsor, an orthopedic surgeon, and D.K.
White, a contractor, let the kids play aggressively, take chances
and have a good time whatever the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   And they let the kids take their lumps, too. They're small
lumps, after all. But when a kid struck out or fumbled a grounder,
the coaches weren't full of frowns and recrimination (as a couple
of the parents were). They gave him a supportive pat on the rear
and told him he'd do better next time.
</P>
<P>
   They were coaches interested in developing young people, not
just players. As it turned out, the team won some and lost some,
like all of us. The kids enjoyed the winning _ that came naturally.
It was the losing that was hard to accept. No one wanted to, but
that's life.

 &HT;    Some of Web's best stories may turn out to be myths
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do not believe everything you read.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like obvious advice, but when it comes to the
Internet, it's worth repeating, or maybe scrawling in indelible ink
across the top of your computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most skeptical news junkie who checks at least five TV
networks and the newspaper before giving it any credibility will
believe anything e-mailed to them by a friend of a friend of a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   So before you hit the ``forward'' button to send any words of
wisdom on to your friends and co-workers, think about the following
Internet ruses.
</P>
<P>
   The Neiman-Marcus cookie story must have circled the globe more
times than all the NASA astronauts put together and is still going
strong. For a while, the official Nieman Marcus Web site had an
entire section devoted to debunking the story of the woman who
supposedly paid $250 for the recipe for Neiman's chocolate chip
cookies. The woman's alleged revenge was to post the recipe on the
Internet in the hopes that it would get as much attention as it is
getting. If nobody has sent you this recipe yet, you can check it
out at http://www.circ.uab
</P>
<P>
   .edu/cookies.html. And if you do have the ingredients on hand,
it won't cost you anything to whip up a batch.
</P>
<P>
   Another e-mail hoax sent round the world, was the alleged 1997
commencement speech given by noted American author Kurt Vonnegut at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The speech was a
collection of homespun wisdom that began with the sentence ``Ladies
and Gentlemen of the class of '97: Wear sunscreen. If I could offer
you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   You can read the rest of the speech at
http://www.cyberlink2000.com/9vonnegu.htm, but you should know
Vonnegut neither wrote nor delivered this speech. What's more
Vonnegut was not MIT's 1997 commencement speaker. Secretary General
of the United Nations Kofi Annan was. The pearls of wisdom were
actually from a column written by Chicago Tribune staff writer Mary
Schmich. Schmich offers her own take on being mistaken (at least in
cyberspace) for Vonnegut in one of her columns, which can be read
at http://www.recoil.com/mqarianstuff/wb/vonnegut.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   Stories such as these quickly pass into legend among cyberspace
veterans. They have become what is known as ``urban legends.''
There is an entire Web site devoted to the cataloguing and
debunking of these tall tales at http://www.urbanlegends.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how these rumors get started. But be warned that
once something appears on the Internet it can circle the world at
an astonishing speed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of the erroneous Associated Press report last
week. In error, the AP posted an obituary for comic Bob Hope on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) believed the report
was real and asked that Hope's passing be announced on the floor of
the House of Representatives.

 &HT;    Duchovny marking his time with `X-Files'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Hills, Calif. _ David Duchovny is pretty much Foxed out.
``There are days when I'm sick of Mulder,'' he says. ``I'd love to
leave it behind. Sometimes it seems like all I do is play Mulder or
prepare to play Mulder or talk about playing Mulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, of course, what he's being forced to do over and over
these days as the publicity machine cranks up for the June 19
opening of ``The X-Files: Fight the Future,'' the big-screen film
in which Duchovny stars as Fox Mulder, paranoid investigator of the
paranormal.
</P>
<P>
   Considering he'd rather be about anywhere besides cooped up in a
hotel room talking about ``The X-Files'' with a string of
journalists, he's pretty cool. He kicks off his shoes and leans
back on a couch, more relaxed than TV viewers have ever seen
Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny says he has two more years on his contract with Fox's
TV series and then that's it: It will be over. Other players have
three-year contracts (such as co-star and Emmy winner Gillian
Anderson, who plays Scully) but it seems unlikely that Duchovny
will extend his contract, and the show would almost certainly close
up if he left.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' is the highest-rated show on the Fox network,
and if its ratings remain high, the corporate controllers would do
virtually anything to keep it on the air.
</P>
<P>
   But even Chris Carter, the show's producer and guiding light,
seems resigned to Duchovny's two-year deadline. He says he supports
Duchovny's honesty about being tired of playing Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie debuts, fans of the TV show are likely to be
buzzing more about what's not in the film than what's there.
Carter's reasoning for how many questions the film doesn't answer:
``You'd be more irritated if I made it simplistic than if I made it
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   While the film does reveal some of the show's out-there truth,
it doesn't tell all. Among the gleanings:
</P>
<P>
   -- The alien factor: Some key elements of the TV show come to
light with explanations of how aliens are trying to colonize the
Earth and how a mysterious powerful group known as the Syndicate is
collaborating with them.
</P>
<P>
   -- The sister and daddy factor: An explanation for the abduction
of Mulder's sister, Samantha, was filmed, but cut because it was
considered too confusing for nonfans. And if you want to learn more
about Mulder's true father, forget it. It's not even mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   -- The buzz factor: In what may become the most talked-about
scene in the film, millions of bumblebees swarm Mulder and Scully.
</P>
<P>
   -- The love factor: What's been a slow evolution on TV toward
more emotional closeness between Mulder and Scully picks up steam
in the film. But they're not yet to the mutual back rub stage.
</P>
<P>
   -- The end factor: Another thing that wound up on the
cutting-room floor was a shot of Duchovny's naked behind, peeking
through a hospital gown. Duchovny jokingly says he liked it because
``it was completely gratuitous, and the only way to do nudity in a
movie is to be gratuitous.''

DON'T LET BUG SPRAY BUG YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday June 10)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many Manatee County residents, I am worried about this
malathion thing.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials are considering spraying the insecticide
over parts of west Bradenton to kill the few remaining
Mediterranean fruit flies that have not already succumbed to media
hype.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the spray is perfectly safe, as if it were
planning to spray our neighborhoods with a fine mist of Diet Coke.
The trouble is, many of us _ myself included _ know malathion as an
evil-smelling chemical that is sold in lawn and garden stores in
brown plastic bottles with the word WARNING! repeated over and over
in the directions.
</P>
<P>
   It requires homeowners to suit up in goggles, a breathing mask
and a long-sleeved shirt so as to avoid having this perfectly safe
substance come in contact with our skin or any other parts of our
body that we wish to remain functional.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, malathion has a huge image problem that the government
needs to correct if it is to win public support for its spraying
program. First off, the government should probably stop advertising
malathion as the insecticide equivalent of Diet Coke. Some people
don't like Coke, diet or otherwise, and the thought of a cloud of
the stuff swirling through their doors and windows is not likely to
change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers might appreciate malathion more if it were compared
to Mountain Dew, while the baby boomers might be swayed by a
comparison to bottled water or herbal tea.
</P>
<P>
   The government might want to take this one step further and hint
that malathion is not only safe, it has many therapeutic side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Who would not support an aerial spraying program that promised
whiter teeth and clearer skin, not to mention dissolving those
unsightly hand warts? Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of
malathion can help you lose lots of weight fast and also halts the
aging process in the sense that you cease to get any older.
</P>
<P>
   People with breathing disorders may find that their condition
improves with deep inhalation of malathion mist. Clogged or
constricted airways are reamed cleaner than if you had snorted a
handful of Drano.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Drano, how many people know that malathion makes an
excellent dessert topping? Not many, I bet.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficial qualities of malathion need not be limited to
humans. Since it works so well at killing Medflies, who's to say
that malathion would not be equally effective at eroding those
baked-on wads of love-bug carcasses cemented to the grill and
windshield of your car? Residents of West Bradenton could also be
advised to take their good silverware outside on spraying days as
malathion makes an excellent tarnish remover.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seems to be suffering from stress nowadays, so it
might be a good idea to promote the tension-relieving qualities of
malathion. A mere five minutes a day of good, deep inhalation
relaxes the back and neck muscles as if you were being kneaded and
pounded by a gorgeous Swedish massage therapist, gender of your
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of gorgeous Swedish massage therapists, the government
might want to start the rumor that the malathion spray they plan to
use contains 20 percent Viagra that can be absorbed directly
through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the claim is false, the sight of thousands of West
Bradentonites running naked around their back yards might be enough
to scare the Medflies to death.
</P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Across the river and into the pool
hall
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACROSS THE RIVER _ For you who don't know, that's a local
euphemism for the next county over where influential beverages are
legally sold.
</P>
<P>
   But there comes a time when a man has to consider his conduct,
as judged by community mores.
</P>
<P>
   So it is for me, now that I have a young grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I'm across the river, shooting pool with my Cousin
Bubba. I want to be ready and able to teach my grandson what a
man's gotta know to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   Yessir, I can just see the little tyke there by his
grandfather's side as I rack up the balls.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that I'm still in the learning stage.
</P>
<P>
   Drat it that I never learned to shoot pool. All those years I
frittered away working hard and trying to get ahead _ I could
instead have been devoting myself to the pool halls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a pool stick I chose to be a stick in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm trying to right all of that in all of the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   The particular place we stopped is sort of a backwoods version
of Cheers, where everybody knows your alias.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever says, ``Here's looking at you.'' East Texas
honky-tonks being what they are, best that you don't make eye
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bubba knows his way around such local joints. And the
locals know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubba!'' the lady bartender called out as we walked through
the doors. ``Where you been so long?''
</P>
<P>
   You'd almost think they'd been keeping his stool warm for him.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good thing about being a good ol' boy. Everybody's
glad to see you coming.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I'm more of a doog 'ld yob, or whatever the opposite
is. Nobody's glad to see me. It's as if they don't even see me.
</P>
<P>
   If they ever look my way it's out of the corner of their eye.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the way I shoot pool. If the stick were a six-gun,
I'd shoot myself in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put a little English on it,'' Cousin Bubba instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right-o,'' I responded, stiff upper lip and all that.
</P>
<P>
   The game is called 8-ball. The idea is to sink your balls,
either solids or stripes, before your opponent sinks his, all the
while saving the 8-ball until last.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba let me go first. I did my best with the break. The ol'
boys at the bar did their best not to break out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot,'' I muttered.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Bubba did.
</P>
<P>
   He won the first game.
</P>
<P>
   He won the second game.
</P>
<P>
   He won the third game.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he was apologizing for being so rusty.
</P>
<P>
   About the time he was getting warmed up, I was giving up.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I waited too late in life. Man's gotta be what a man's
gotta be. And I'll never be in the pool hall Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   More's the pity for my grandson. I've nothing to pass on to him.
</P>
<P>
   Then again ...
</P>
<P>
   There's always the domino hall.
</P>
<P>
   Yessir, I can just see the little tyke there by his
grandfather's side as I shuffle those bones.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that I can see that Bubba's there, too, leaning over
my shoulder and trying to explain the game to me.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The widespread chill east of the Rockies will continue to
moderate as high pressure moves off the Atlantic Seaboard. A broad
air flow from the South will draw very warm and more humid air into
the southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley. Cool air across
the northern tier states will be stubborn in its retreat and the
result will be abundant clouds and showers from the Middle Atlantic
Coast to the upper Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and seasonably cool air will dominate the Northeast, though
sunshine will be hidden by clouds at times. An area of high
pressure over the northern Great Lakes will hold firm, and this
will stymie the advance of sultry weather into New England. Winds
at 5,000 feet will blow from the Southwest toward the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys. This surge of summery weather will trigger
clusters of showers and thunderstorms, particularly near the
western and central Appalachians. Some of the rain will progress
into the Carolinas and Virginia where onshore breezes will direct
ocean-cooled air inland.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Gulf Coast will see some sun, and it will be sultry
with isolated afternoon thunderstorms. More storms will develop
farther inland over the South as a warm front pushes slowly
northeastward. A few locally severe storms are possible in the
eastern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance over the Rockies should sponsor afternoon
thundershowers from the Wyoming mountains to the southern Sierra.
Considerable clouds will keep temperatures below season levels in
all but the interior Northwest. The deserts of the Southwest will
turn bright and a bit warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies are expected in sections of the Florida panhandle
and the northern parts of Michigan due to nearby high-pressure
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sunny Night
</P>
<P>
   Mostly sunny was the forecast issued Sunday evening by the
National Weather Service at Barrow, Alaska. Around this time of
year, the sun never sets at Barrow, a town located near latitude 71
degrees. Earlier, temperatures had soared to 51 degrees, one degree
shy of the record high for the date. Given that prevailing winds
from the northeast blow off icy waters of the Arctic Ocean and
import cold air into Barrow, the average high on June 7 is 35
degrees. But winds blew from the southeast on Sunday, allowing
temperatures to rise to levels more harmonious with 24 hours of
sunshine.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Economically, politically and strategically, the United States
and Korea enjoy a very special relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The United States liberated Korea from Japanese imperialism and
defended it from North Korean Communist aggression. U.S. assistance
played a central role in rebuilding our economy from the ruins of
the Korean War. U.S. help has also been crucial in overcoming the
economic crisis that began late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Republic of Korea has also done its best as
friend of the United States. Economically, it has not hesitated to
help the United States in its times of need.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s when the United States was suffering enormous trade
deficits, Korea dispatched several purchase missions to the United
States and bought billions of dollars' worth of American goods. In
1996, Korea imported American goods actively, to the extent that it
incurred a deficit of $11.6 billion with the United States out of a
total trade deficit of $20.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several Korean companies have invested more than $1
billion each in the United States. Currently, Korean Air plans to
purchase $2 billion worth of aircraft, despite our foreign exchange
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Korea is neither a superpower nor a rich country. However, Korea
has worked more closely with the United States than virtually any
nation in the world in many areas, including political, military
and economic issues. This is, of course, in our own national
interests; likewise, a friendly relationship with the Republic of
Korea is in America's national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Korea is suffering economic difficulties, I hope
America will continue to actively provide us with assistance and
investment. Not if only is Northeast Asia very important to the
national interests of the United States, but it also needs the
United States to maintain peace and stability and promote
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the continued presence of the U.S. troops
currently stationed in Northeast Asia is absolutely necessary, just
as U.S. troops are necessary for stability and peace in Europe,
even in these post-Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Northeast Asian peace and prosperity at this
particular stage is settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.
Unfortunately, the Korean Peninsula, the last hot spot of the Cold
War era, still faces the potential threat of armed conflict. In
order to deter any provocation and nurture enduring peace, a solid
military alliance between Korea and the United States should be
maintained and further reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   Close cooperation between our two countries for peace is more
important now than ever before for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, broader understanding and cooperation are needed
between the Republic and the United States in the project of
building light-water nuclear reactors in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we should be careful not to isolate North Korea from
the international community. In principle, I do not oppose U.S.
efforts to expand the scope of its relations with North Korea. But
I believe we need to exercise caution so as to avoid the
possibility of North Korea perceiving a gap in the positions
between the Republic and the United States and using it to its
advantage. Only if close coordination is maintained between our two
countries, will smooth dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, issues involving economic and other forms of
interaction between the South and the North should be initiated and
duly observed by the two parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot emphasize enough the need to embrace North Korea as a
member of the international community while maintaining a solid
security agreement between the Republic and the United States. The
three fundamental principles of my administration's policies toward
North Korea remain:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, we will not tolerate any military threat or armed
provocation. This principle is based on my belief that any
provocative action is certain to have extremely serious
consequences for both the South and the North, and would threaten
the stability and security of Northeast Asia at large.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we will not seek to undermine North Korea _ or unify
the divided land by absorbing it. We all know the political,
economic and psychological difficulties that both West and East
Germans suffered after West Germany absorbed the East. One cannot
even imagine what kind of difficulties might be experienced, if we
tried to undermine North Korea and annex it. I declare, once and
for all, we have no intention of absorbing North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we will pursue genuine interaction and reconciliation
with the North. Our economic interaction and cooperation will be
based on the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and
Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North adopted
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with this new guideline, the new Korean government
is now pursuing a policy of separating politics from private
business activities. We will also encourage exchanges of people and
promote cooperation in cultural, social and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
   As a case in point, the founder of Hyundai Corp. is planning to
make a road journey back to North Korea very soon. He will be
taking 500 cows with him all the way to his birth place, and will
donate the animals to the people there. Koreans have had a special
attachment to cows since ancient times. The giver and receivers of
the cows are sure to share feelings of genuine love that have been
suppressed for the past 50 years of separation. This trip will be a
good start toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the exchanges and cooperative efforts between the South
and the North, my government directives are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, we will continue to provide emergency humanitarian
assistance _ whether by the government or private resources _ with
no strings attached. We have already donated 50,000 tons of food
through the Red Cross, and recently announced provision of another
50,000 tons through the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we will promote economic exchanges and cooperation
between the South and the North. To facilitate such exchanges, my
government has recently lifted some restrictions on business trips
to North Korea and abolished ceilings on investment in the North.
It is clear that both sides will benefit if capital and technology
from the South are combined with labor in the North.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, our non-emergency governmental aid will be provided
under the principle of reciprocity. In April, we did not commit
fertilizer provisions requested by North Korea because they
declined our humanitarian request to arrange reunions of family
members who have been separated for half a century. We are ready to
provide fertilizer to the North Koreans as soon as we receive a
positive response on our proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Korea is unique in that it has never in its history waged a war
against any nation in the West and has never been colonized by a
Western country.
</P>
<P>
   I understand my administration's position is firmly supported by
the United States, Japan, China, and Russia, as well as the Korean
people. All of this is positive in support of our efforts to secure
peace on the Korean Peninsula.

   NIGERIA-ABACHA (Lagos) _ From wires: Gen. Sani Abacha, the

   NJ-ENVIRON (Trenton) _ In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman is

   AUTO-POLLUTE (Washington) _ Honda and Ford used devices on

   KOSOVO-REBELS (In the Shkelzen Mountains, Serbia) _ The

training that rarely goes beyond showing them how to clean,
assemble, and fire AK-47 assault rifles. The rebels also appear to

states that have settled lawsuits against cigarette makers as well
as in Congress, which is considering federal tobacco legislation.
At stake is the richest pot of fees in the legal history. By Barry

GUERRILLA POET LIONIZED AT LAST BUT STILL ELUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ It would surely have amused Roque
Dalton, inveterate bohemian and revolutionary that he was, to know
that the right-wing government in power here recently added his
poetry to the school curriculum. A fierce critic of organized
religion, he no doubt would also have chuckled at the notion that a
Jesuit-run university was sponsoring a project to publish his
complete works.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter-century after he was killed by leftist
guerrillas who thought his vagabond ways a threat to their
clandestine struggle, Roque Dalton has finally become respectable.
Persecuted and scorned in his Central American homeland throughout
his turbulent life, Dalton has become both a symbol and a
beneficiary of the new, more liberal intellectual climate that has
emerged since a long and bloody civil war ended six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roque was one of the most important writers of his time, but
he died young, and because the war went on for so long, his works
were always prohibited and it was forbidden to talk of him,'' said
Aida de Dalton, the writer's widow and the caretaker of his estate.
``Now we are living in a time in which there is space to do all of
that, and a new generation is at last able to investigate his life
and work.''
</P>
<P>
   What Salvadoran readers are finding in collections like ``The
Offended Party's Turn'' and ``A Slightly Repellent Book'' is a
plain-spoken and mordantly humorous writer whose work seems as
timely as ever. Dalton grappled eloquently not only with the
universal themes of love and death and beauty, but also with such
specifically Central American concerns as what it means to be the
citizen of ``a Tom Thumb country'' on the margins of history and
burdened with huge social injustices.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many, Roque Dalton is the best Salvadoran poet who ever
lived,'' said the Rev. Rodolfo Cardenal, a Jesuit priest and vice
rector of the University of Central America who is overseeing the
publication project. ``He understood the reality of this country
and its struggle, and knew how to express the most genuine
aspirations of our people, which makes him an obligatory reference
point in defining Salvadoran nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In ``Small Hours of the Night,'' now the title poem of an
English-language anthology of his verse (Curbstone Press: 1996),
Dalton wrote:
</P>
<P>
   When you know I'm dead, don't say my name
</P>
<P>
   Because then death and peace would have to wait
</P>
<P>
   Your voice, the bell of your five senses, would form
</P>
<P>
   The thin beam of light my mist would be looking for
</P>
<P>
   When you know I'm dead, say other words
</P>
<P>
   Say flower, bee, teardrop, bread, storm
</P>
<P>
   Don't let your lips find my eleven letters
</P>
<P>
   I'm sleepy, I've loved, I've earned silence
</P>
<P>
   Don't say my name when you know I'm dead
</P>
<P>
   I would come out of the dark ground for your voice
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with a fecund imagination and a prolific pen, Dalton
wrote not only hundreds of poems, but also several novels, a play,
a history of El Salvador, the biography of a Communist Party
leader, countless letters and numerous essays on literature and
politics, like ``Poetry and Militancy in Latin America.'' The
University of Central America aims to make it all available in the
Spanish-speaking world eventually, and perhaps even to publish a
biography of the writer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither task, however, promises to be easy, in large part
because Dalton, who was executed on May 10, 1975, just a few days
before his 40th birthday, apparently wanted it that way. At various
times, he lived in Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Czechoslovakia and Vietnam,
moving in and out of romantic relationships, constantly revising
his poems and leaving behind correspondence and unfinished
manuscripts each time he went underground or had to go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roque was not a very organized person,'' said Rafael Lara
Martinez, who teaches Latin-American literature at the New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology and is preparing an anthology of
Dalton's poems for use in public schools here. ``He wrote poetry
almost like Mozart wrote music. If he walked into a bar, he'd write
a poem on a napkin while he was having a drink, and as you can
imagine, that does not make it easy to compile a definitive
edition.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dalton's own origins are even more difficult to pin down. Dr.
Lara Martinez described him as ``a surrealist figure who was his
own invention.'' Friends and fellow writers remember him claiming
that his father was one of the notorious Dalton Brothers gang of
bank robbers, an American who, after eluding the police in Kansas,
fled here around the turn of the century with ill-gotten gains that
became the basis of the family fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Dalton family recall hearing that they are
descended from an American arms dealer who bolted to El Salvador
after defrauding Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution.
Whatever the truth, Roque Dalton himself grew up as the alienated,
illegitimate son of a prominent landowner, imbued with a hatred of
the elite from whom he was excluded and the military governments it
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complex facts of Roque Dalton's life have been overlaid _
or in many cases clarified and defined _ by myth,'' Salvadoran
writer Claribel Alegria writes in her introduction to ``Small Hours
of the Night.'' ``Even among his closest friends it is nearly
impossible to talk about Roque without falling into verbal
chiaroscuro effects: superlative and anecdotal exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Dalton soon got into political trouble, was twice
jailed by right-wing military governments and, according to his own
writings, was sentenced to death. He was saved first in 1960 when a
coup d'etat occurred a day before he was scheduled to be executed
by a firing squad, and on a second occasion a few years later when,
at least according to legend, he managed to escape after a
devastating earthquake destroyed the prison in which he was being
held.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it was his own colleagues in the guerrilla
band he had joined who killed him, after a show trial in which he
was charged with being both an American and a Cuban spy. For years
his fate was a dirty little secret that admirers in the
Latin-American left did their best to conceal. But as the civil war
was ending, the faction responsible, the Revolutionary People's
Army, acknowledged its ``tremendous error'' in ordering the murder.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear in retrospect that Dalton's crime, aside from his
lack of discipline, was to have advocated reaching out to form
alliances with student, labor and peasant organizations rather than
looking to a nucleus of determined fighters to spark a revolution.
That very strategy, of course, would eventually be adopted by
Dalton's guerrilla colleagues during the 12-year civil war, in
which more than 75,000 people died before it ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem ridiculous now, but in those days, anyone could be
accused of anything,'' Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a leader of the
group, which has evolved into the Democratic Party, said in an
interview here. ``Within the confined environment of a small group,
we were so fearful of being infiltrated that everyone suspected
everyone else. We would have been afraid of our shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Salvadoran lawmakers unanimously approved a
resolution declaring Dalton the country's only ``poet of great
merit'' of the modern era, adding him to the pantheon of national
heroes. Responding to that change in climate, his family has begun
an effort to organize a museum in his honor here and to hunt down
those original manuscripts that are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our task now to create the conditions in which people
can study him and really get to know him and value him in all of
his magnitude,'' said Juan Jose Dalton, the writer's son and a
well-known journalist here. ``We recognize that he is part of the
national patrimony now, as strange as that may sound.''

`TOBACCO BLUES': A VISIT WITH FOUR TOBACCO FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Tobacco Blues'' is a fresh, humanizing approach to a subject
that has been thoroughly demonized in recent years. In answer to
the question, ``Can good people grow tobacco?,'' the producers,
Christine Fugate and Eren McGinnis, visit with four Kentucky
families who bear no resemblance to the cigarette executives who
have come to personify the ills of smoking: it's innocence by
dissociation.
</P>
<P>
   In case you were really wondering, yes, of course good people
grow tobacco. These hands-on farmers represent family values,
parents and offspring working hard to make a living from their
state's main cash crop. They differ over the virtuousness of
growing tobacco (most seem to find smoking distasteful), and any of
them could stand in as wholesome images of down-home Americana.
</P>
<P>
   What comes through in these friendly and revealing interviews is
the farmers' sense of being a beleaguered culture. None have gotten
rich on tobacco, but all have raised their children on its
proceeds, only to find their legacy threatened by conditions far
beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good life, a hard life,'' says a woman whose family
scratches its living out of 3{ acres. Her husband says, ``In a good
year, you break even.'' That includes food, shelter and health
insurance and doesn't take into account the satisfactions of being
part of a community, with family and friends laboring together to
deliver what they proudly call ``a hand-made crop.'' Even the
annual auction, entertainingly pictured here, has a communal
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of tobacco-inspired folk songs and soft-focus
atmospherics, this ``P.O.V.'' offering presents an attractive way
of life. These Kentuckians _ their slogan, ``Keep the FDA off the
Farms!'' _ make up a struggling little army. They foresee U.S.
growers being beaten down by the government and losing out to
overseas producers.
</P>
<P>
   The program ends with a plug for organic farming, to which one
farmer, who grants that cigarettes are ``a pretty toxic product,''
has converted with some success. But few of these folks are going
organic. A man, seen on his tractor with a cigarette between his
lips, says simply that in Kentucky you can't raise anything that
brings in as much money as tobacco. Another takes refuge behind
slogans: ``If someone has a reason to smoke it, then I have a
reason to grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Economics and conscience, a community's values and a nation's
crusade are in conflict here. The program leaves the viewer with
one of the more prosperous farmers (and one of the few heavy
smokers encountered) wondering how to distinguish the cigarette
from the grower (at least the small-scale family grower) in the
public mind. ``Tobacco Blues,'' sympathetic without being sappy,
should help.

   It's been 38 years since I moved from Greenwich Village to
Washington, but I still return regularly to Manhattan for, among
other pleasures, an eavesdropping fix. Here's what I overheard on
the fourth floor of Barney's recently:
</P>
<P>
   One salesperson to another: ``Every morning when I wake up I
thank God that I know how to accessorize.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Five minutes before the start of a recent Broadway performance,
a theatergoer suddenly realized that his tiny cell phone had
somehow slipped out of his pocket and was lost somewhere beneath
the seats in his row.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors were frantically helping him search the dimly
lighted theater when, several rows back, a smartly dressed Wall
Street type waved his own cell phone in the air and shouted:
``Quick, what's your number? I'll call you from mine.'' Within 30
seconds, a steady and distinct ring led the owner to the precise
spot where his phone had fallen, just as the curtain was rising on
the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Libby Jane Thall still gets a laugh when she thinks about the
conversation she overheard on Marathon Sunday on the Upper East
Side. She stopped and asked a woman in a silver aluminum apres-race
cape how she had done. The woman replied that her time had been
great and, as Ms. Thall was congratulating her, a father with a
daughter about 5 years old walked by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy, why is that lady dressed as a baked potato?'' the girl
asked.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent flight from Columbus, Ohio, to La Guardia Airport,
my wife and I were seated behind a woman with a girl of about 4 or
5. It was obviously the girl's first flight because the woman was
narrating every detail, about the plane, the clouds, etc.
</P>
<P>
   We approached New York from the south and were treated to a
spectacular view of the skyline, beginning with the Statue of
Liberty and proceeding along Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, there's New York City,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So where's the big apple?'' the little girl replied.

<P>
   The classic children's song ``The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and
Round'' is keeping up with the times in some milieus. True, the
wheels are still going round and round, the wipers are swishing and
the doors are opening and closing. But forget those coins going
clink, clink, clink.
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Kandel was at the Children's Museum with her two sons
recently when the sing-along leader led mothers and children in
updating the verse. Pretending to slide their cards, they sang,
``The Metrocard on the bus goes `transfer OK, transfer OK, transfer
OK,' all over town.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the red light to change on Madison Avenue in the
50s, I looked down and saw a poignant message scratched in a small
repaved area off the curb. In block letters the message said:
``MILLY PLEASE COME HOME I LOVE YOU.''
</P>
<P>
   That opened a stream of questions. I assume that Milly is a
female and the writer a male. Who is Milly: a wife, friend, sister,
child, dog? Why did Milly leave? Where did she go? Did she love
him? Has she returned? If she has returned, are they happy
together?
</P>
<P>
   Did he know that Milly often frequented that corner so that she
would one day read the pleading message?
</P>
<P>
   REVA FOX wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   A friend writes that the movers were still going in and out of
his new apartment when a woman walked through the open door into
the living room and announced that she lived in one of the
prestigious buildings on the block. Her daughter was returning from
London, she said, and she wanted her to live in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She had looked at the kitchen on her way in and the apartment
was perfect, she continued. As for the view, her daughter would
love it.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat stupefied new tenant informed her that the
apartment wasn't available _ he had taken it. She ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll look around and see if my daughter will be comfortable,''
she said blithely as she took off to look at the bedrooms. She
emerged from her inspection to query: ``Where are the other
bedrooms?'' She was told there was only the one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will never do,'' the woman proclaimed and stalked off.
</P>
<P>
   And if there had been two or three bedrooms, what then?
</P>
<P>
   Strolling along Second Avenue in the 60s, Charles Potter passed
a rather frazzled young woman wearing a T-shirt that advised: MAKE
LOVE NOT LAW REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A red light on the Bowery.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Martin Zelkind and a panhandler.
</P>
<P>
   Action: The panhandler approaches Zelkind who, trying to
forestall the inevitable request, says: ``Please don't annoy me; I
have a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Instantaneous response from the panhandler: ``Take two aspirins
and call me in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the panhandler accomplish his mission and get a handout? Of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Schiff was walking through Central Park when she
encountered a small dog, barking wildly, tugging at his leash and
jumping in the air. The object of his excitement was a much larger
dog, also on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the small dog shook her head and addressed the
other owner. ``He just has no common sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Ring reports that merger mania apparently isn't confined
to the financial industry. She spotted this handwritten sign in the
window of a recently closed Chinese restaurant on the Upper East
Side. ``China Inn had merger with Ming Garden,'' it said, and
listed the new location.
</P>
<P>
   My son, Graham, a high school senior, and I often commute
together. We had just squeezed onto a crowded D train when I
glanced down and saw that my shoelace was untied. There were no
seats, nor even a place to lean against. I knew that bending down
to tie it meant, at best, getting my long coat and briefcase dirty
and, at worst, losing my balance when the train inevitably lurched.
</P>
<P>
   I was mumbling that I'd wait until I got off when Graham dropped
to a crouch and tied it for me. My beaming at him stopped abruptly
when he pulled himself up to full height, looked down at me and
announced, very loudly, ``You know, you're going to have to learn
how to do this yourself.''

   A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who
immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The farmer had
genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother-in-law, hoping
that it could be a friendly, non- antagonistic relationship. All to
no avail though, as she kept nagging them at every opportunity,
demanding changes, offering unwanted advice, and generally making
life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride.
</P>
<P>
   While they were walking through the barn, during the forced
inspection, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the
mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly. It was a shock to
all no matter their feelings toward her demanding ways...
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near
the casket andgreeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed
that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he
would nod his head yes and say something.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however,
he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply. Very curious as to
this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that
was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer replied, `The women would say, 'What a terrible
tragedy' and I would nod my head and say 'Yes, it was.' The men
would then ask, 'Can I borrow that mule?' and I would shake my head
and say, 'Can't, it's all booked up for a year.'`

   It's been 38 years since I moved from Greenwich Village to
Washington, but I still return regularly to Manhattan for, among
other pleasures, an eavesdropping fix. Here's what I overheard on
the fourth floor of Barney's recently:
</P>
<P>
   One salesperson to another: ``Every morning when I wake up I
thank God that I know how to accessorize.''

   Five minutes before the start of a recent Broadway performance,
a theatergoer suddenly realized that his tiny cell phone had
somehow slipped out of his pocket and was lost somewhere beneath
the seats in his row.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors were frantically helping him search the dimly
lighted theater when, several rows back, a smartly dressed Wall
Street type waved his own cell phone in the air and shouted:
``Quick, what's your number? I'll call you from mine.'' Within 30
seconds, a steady and distinct ring led the owner to the precise
spot where his phone had fallen, just as the curtain was rising on
the first act.

   Libby Jane Thall still gets a laugh when she thinks about the

daughter about 5 years old walked by.

   We approached New York from the south and were treated to a

   Waiting for the red light to change on Madison Avenue in the

repaved area off the curb. In block letters the message said:
``MILLY PLEASE COME HOME I LOVE YOU.''
</P>
<P>
   That opened a stream of questions. I assume that Milly is a
female and the writer a male. Who is Milly: a wife, friend, sister,
child, dog? Why did Milly leave? Where did she go? Did she love
him? Has she returned? If she has returned, are they happy
together?

she said blithely as she took off to look at the bedrooms. She

   A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who
immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The farmer had
genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother-in-law, hoping
that it could be a friendly, non- antagonistic relationship. All to
no avail though, as she kept nagging them at every opportunity,
demanding changes, offering unwanted advice, and generally making
life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride.
</P>
<P>
   While they were walking through the barn, during the forced
inspection, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the
mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly. It was a shock to
all no matter their feelings toward her demanding ways...
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near
the casket andgreeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed
that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he
would nod his head yes and say something.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however,
he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply. Very curious as to
this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that
was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer replied, `The women would say, 'What a terrible
tragedy' and I would nod my head and say 'Yes, it was.' The men
would then ask, 'Can I borrow that mule?' and I would shake my head
and say, 'Can't, it's all booked up for a year.'`

THE LIVING ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE DEAD'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a band that's defunct, the Grateful Dead have been mighty
busy lately. In San Francisco on Thursday night, the surviving core
of the Dead introduced their new band, the Other Ones, reclaiming
three decades' worth of Dead songs including, pointedly, songs by
Jerry Garcia, whose death in 1995 put an end to the band. On Friday
night, members of the Dead's sound crew were on the QVC
cable-television shopping channel, hawking live recordings of the
Dead and taking in a quick $70,000. And on Saturday night, the San
Jose Stage Company in California gave the premiere of ``Cumberland
Blues,'' a musical built around early-1970s songs by Garcia and
Robert Hunter, the band's best lyricist.
</P>
<P>
   It's rock as repertory: a recognition that songs are now assets
as well as anthems. They can outlast their original moment by years
and decades. As musicians grow long in the tooth, their best songs
stay vivid and mobile, still ready to reach far-flung audiences.
The tricky part, for musicians who care about the songs as well as
the profits, is to keep an eye on the context.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead have been careful. None of the material they recorded
has been made available for commercials. Of course, they're not
hurting for cash; Grateful Dead Merchandising, selling everything
from concert recordings to logo-embroidered denim shirts, took in
$14 million last year. And the group has accepted its status as an
institution: A $50 million Grateful Dead museum, to be called
Terrapin Station, will probably settle on a site this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an institution, history can outweigh the present. While
nearly every touring band keeps favorite songs in the set list,
some bands have turned into repertory groups playing not just
oldies but full-length albums. The Who has toured with a concert
version of its 1973 album ``Quadrophenia''; Cheap Trick, harking
back to its 1970s heyday, performed all the songs from its 1979
album ``Live at Budokan'' last month and plans to return Oct. 29
through 31 with three shows at Tramps devoted to its first three
albums.
</P>
<P>
   The message is that longtime fans are connoisseurs whose
appreciation extends beyond mere hits. It's also a grudging
recognition that for most rock songwriters, experience and
craftsmanship pale next to the inspirations of youth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then there's the theater option; as rock fans age, they don't
mind sitting down for decorous entertainment. Rock songwriters are
no strangers to theater productions, from revues like the Lieber
and Stoller anthology ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' to full-scale rock
operas like ``Tommy.'' ``Cumberland Blues'' was authorized but not
initiated by the Dead (unlike ``Tommy,'' which had Pete Townshend's
full involvement). In the early 1970s, the Dead put psychedelia on
hold and returned to songs steeped in country, bluegrass and blues;
the San Jose company got the idea that the tales of backwoods and
frontier life that Hunter's lyrics conjured could be turned into a
coherent story.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Michael Norman Mann listened hard to the songs, and
like someone working out a narrative crossword puzzle, he connected
characters' names and recurring images of hard work, gambling,
drinking, death and redemption. He came up with a backwoods family
story: a gambler, a miner, a preacher (for the redemption angle)
and good and bad women. It's ingenious and good-natured but thick
with cliches: ``You just want what you can't have, and you always
did.'' Yet the tunes are sure-fire. There are in-jokes for Dead
Heads, and the staging of songs like ``Deal'' and ``Bertha'' brings
out their theatricality. If Cole Porter songs can be strung
together for the stage, so can Garcia-Hunter songs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dead's members aren't all ready to sit back and savor
the royalties. Although Bill Kreutzmann, the original drummer, has
retired, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Mickey Hart are heading back on
the road as the Other Ones, headlining this summer's Furthur
Festival with two guitarists and a saxophonist in Garcia's place,
as well as Bruce Hornsby on keyboards and a new drummer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead became an institution by touring constantly,
reinventing (and sometimes mangling) the repertory every night.
Durable as the songs are, they need to be played and played with.
The Other Ones may be looking back at a proud legacy, and the
guitarists in particular are working in a style that has been
handed down to them. But their job is to keep the songs alive and
wayward in the present, and their first show promised that they
won't spend too much time looking back.

   A newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who
immediately demanded an inspection of the place. The farmer had
genuinely tried to be friendly to his new mother-in-law, hoping
that it could be a friendly, non- antagonistic relationship. All to
no avail though, as she kept nagging them at every opportunity,
demanding changes, offering unwanted advice, and generally making
life unbearable to the farmer and his new bride.
</P>
<P>
   While they were walking through the barn, during the forced
inspection, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the
mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly. It was a shock to
all no matter their feelings toward her demanding ways...
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near
the casket andgreeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed
that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he
would nod his head yes and say something.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however,
he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply. Very curious as to
this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that
was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer replied, `The women would say, 'What a terrible
tragedy' and I would nod my head and say 'Yes, it was.' The men
would then ask, 'Can I borrow that mule?' and I would shake my head
and say, 'Can't, it's all booked up for a year.'`

TREASURIES ARE LITTLE CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities ended little changed
Monday, as some investors took profits after Friday's gains. Few
investors were willing to make large bets ahead of Wednesday's
scheduled congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32, to
104 29/32, leaving its yield unchanged at 5.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at J.W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca
Raton, Fla., said that Treasury securities were trading in a range
that was defined on Friday after the market rebounded from a strong
employment report.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 5.75 percent yield on the long bond is going to be a tough
psychological barrier to break below, and support seems to be good
in the 5.80 percent to 5.85 percent yield range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Carver, chief technical analyst with Technical Data in
Boston, noted: ``The lack of movement following an
unemployment-data release is quite common, and actually friendly.
Bonds demonstrated that their higher close on Friday was not a
fluke, having accepted those gains on Monday and never moving
appreciably lower.''
</P>
<P>
   While few market participants expect Greenspan to signal any
change in monetary policy on Wednesday, many investors remained on
the sidelines Monday, knowing that his remarks have the potential
to prompt big swings in prices. Some analysts say the market will
be closely watching whether Greenspan focuses on domestic economic
strength or on Asian weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month
Treasury bills was uneventful, analysts said. The three-month issue
was sold at an average rate of 4.995 percent, up from 4.945 percent
last week, while the six-month issue was sold at an average rate of
5.155 percent, up from 5.110 percent.

   WELLS-FUTURE (Los Angeles) _ The banking supermarket is coming,
and not over by the bakery section of your grocery store, either.
Banks are scrambling to broaden the range of financial products
they offer, led by such fast-moving players as Norwest Corp., which
agreed Monday to merge with Wells Fargo in a $31 billion deal. By
Dave McNary. (Will also move in the ``n'' national and ``a''

   WELLS-MERGER (Los Angeles) _ What kind of services can area
customers expect from a combined Wells-Norwest? In California, at
least, Wells Fargo has a strong network of retail operations,
albeit mostly ATMs, while Norwest is one of the area's largest
mortgage lenders. Will this be a marriage in which two companies
are strengthened because of their complimentary services? Or is it
ridiculous to think that Wells Fargo can manage a smooth merger
with Norwest after all the problems it had swallowing First
Interstate. By Deborah Adamson.

SUPREME COURT WEIGHS BOND OF SECRECY BETWEEN LAWYER AND CLIENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court grappled Monday with the question
of whether the long-established attorney-client privilege survives
the client's death, asking whether any erosion of the privilege
would affect the way people talk to their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the court should preserve the tradition, James
Hamilton, lawyer for the late White House Deputy Counsel Vincent
Foster Jr., urged the justices to rule that the notes of his
conversation with Foster shortly before the aide's suicide should
remain secret.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1993, Foster had become embroiled in a controversy
involving the firings of seven career employees of the White House
Travel Office and their replacement with political appointees, one
of whom was a distant cousin of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, worried that administration officials, particularly
Hillary Rodham Clinton, would face a congressional inquiry and
possibly a criminal probe of the firings, sought Hamilton's advice
on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vincent came to talk to me on July 11, (1993), he asked
me if our conversation was confidential, and I told him that it
was,'' Hamilton said. Foster killed himself nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said a decision by the court to erode the
attorney-client privilege, the idea that a lawyer cannot be
compelled to divulge anything a client says, ``would have a strong,
chilling effect on client candor.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``People do care about their reputations and family
and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brett Kavanaugh, representing Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr, contended that Hamilton's notes could prove vital to the
investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or any presidential aides
lied about the first lady's role in the firings.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh said that letting the privilege continue after the
death of a client would ``wall off critical evidence'' from
prosecutors seeking the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean that innocent people would be wrongly convicted
and guilty people would be wrongly exonerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last August that after a
client's death, the attorney-client privilege is no longer
automatic in criminal cases. The panel said that in some cases,
such as Starr's, a prosecutor's search for truth outweighed a dead
client's interest in confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   But Kavanaugh urged the justices to go further than the appeals
court and rule that the attorney-client privilege should not extend
beyond the grave in all criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked Kavanaugh, a prosecutor in
Starr's office, whether investigators' interests could extend
beyond the notes to actually questioning Hamilton about what he
learned from his client. Kavanaugh replied, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the outcome of this bitter legal dispute could affect
how thousands of Americans consult with lawyers, especially in
their final years, the justices intensely quizzed Hamilton and
Kavanaugh on their positions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked Hamilton if he
would waive the privilege to provide information that would prevent
an innocent person from being convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would.
</P>
<P>
   Then Justice Antonin Scalia asked if he would waive the
privilege to provide information that would give prosecutors the
information needed to convict a person who was guilty. Hamilton
said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you would provide evidence to exonerate someone but not to
prove someone guilty,'' Scalia said. ``That seems
disproportionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia continued to hammer away at Hamilton's argument later,
questioning him on how prosecutors can get at the truth when a key
witness dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your opinion, there is nobody, no matter how important the
issue is to the public, who can say enough is enough and let out
the information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton repeated his view that the privilege should remain
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg asked Kavanaugh why he should be given information _
Hamilton's notes of his conversation with Foster _ that he would
not be entitled to if Foster were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Foster) was still alive, we could compel him to
testify,'' Kavanaugh replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we see examples every day of people refusing to answer
questions from prosecutors,'' Ginsburg shot back.
</P>
<P>
   During Kavanaugh's argument, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
asked about an aging father seeking advice from his lawyer on how
he could help his drug-addicted son. Then, a few years later, after
the father's death, the son is on trial for a crime. Could that
lawyer be forced to testify against the son, Rehnquist asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh said that the lawyer would have to testify and, in
essence, use a father's own words against his son.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist said that a client ``must feel free to tell a
lawyer the truth and the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked what would happen in a case
that involved more than one defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Would the death of one of them mean that his or her lawyer would
be compelled to testify on what the dead man said about the crime
and the guilt or innocence of the other defendants, Kennedy asked.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh said the lawyer would have to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to rule on the case by early July.

AUSTRALIA SHOWS OFF ITS DESIGNERS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, it has been the rule in Paris and Milan: if you
build it, on a shoulder pad or on the bias, they will come.
</P>
<P>
   But the Australian fashion industry has never enjoyed such
assurances. Although dozens of designers have been creating fashion
there for several years, they have toiled in relative obscurity,
far from the watchful and promotional eyes of magazine editors and
U.S. and European retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Now appears to be Australia's moment, with lowered trade
barriers, the lower cost of clothing from Down Under, and an
international retail industry starving for fresh talent.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nothing has done more for the Australian fashion
industry than its members themselves, who in the last three years
have worked _ and spent _ with diligence to elevate their
visibility among buyers and editors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is happening in Australia is a very big deal,''
said April Hughes, the fashion editor of Elle magazine, who
attended this year's shows in Sydney. ``A lot of people are ready
for fresh talent, and we found it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Australian Fashion Innovators, the country's fashion
trade group, held its third and by far most sophisticated fashion
week, which showcased 45 designers on the runway, up from 25 three
years ago, to promote the country's $8 billion industry. The
organization, which is run by Simon Lock, Australia's own Howard
Rubensteinesque promoter, has aggressively courted the media and
retailers since its inception, and this year got significant
response.
</P>
<P>
   With deep pockets filled by the show's main sponsor, Mercedes,
as well as by others like Moet &AMP; Chandon and Diet Coke, the
organization underwrote the trip for editors and retailers and
provided them with drivers and guides to shuttle them to shows,
stores and fine restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   And if all this courting were not enough, all the shows were
held in one location, and started on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other designers attract media and retailers from the U.S. and
Europe,'' said Lock, the founder and managing director of
Australian Fashion Innovators. ``We have had no such luck. So, we
have had to aggressively market this event. The strategy is to
support people with tight budgets for the first few years, with the
idea that they will eventually foot their own bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the horde were Bonnie Pressman, the fashion director of
Barneys New York, and buyers from Henri Bendel, Fred Segal and
Browns of London, as well as several American and European fashion
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the perks, fashion hunters were also impressed with the
depth and variety of Australian fashion. Many Australian designers
are clearly influenced by the deep blues and bright colors of the
surrounding sea and rain forest, and the fabrics and patterns of
neighboring Asia, refreshing rejoinders to most of fashion's dark
palette. And Australia's runways are hosts to talent from New
Zealand and Southeast Asia as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population of Australia is so culturally mixed, it is
difficult to say we are influenced by any one thing,'' said Pamela
Easton, a partner in Easton Pearson, a Brisbane-based company that
makes ethereal dresses with fabrics found in India. ``It is a huge
melting pot.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultural devotion to leisure and the warm climate have a
strong impact as well, evident in airy fabrics and
close-to-the-body cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of designers are also taking dribs and drabs from the
American and European designers who set the fashion agenda, one
that Australians approach with ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they want to make clear that they are
technically savvy, have their own Vogue magazine and furiously
consume fashion news, making them as hip to the scene as their
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the designers also like to use their distance
from the rest of the world as a badge of honor, representing
immunity from derivation. ``When you live this far away, you live
with blinkers on,'' said Marion Hume, a highly regarded English
fashion journalist who is now the editor in chief of Australian
Vogue. ``They have no interest in what the rest of the world is
doing.''

</P>
<P>
   Either way, there are certainly designers with unique imprints.
The most famous Australian designer these days _ save Richard
Tyler, who has all but lost his passport _ is doubtless Collette
Dinnigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dinnigan traces her roots a decade back to a silk and
chiffon lingerie collection that was picked up by Saks Fifth
Avenue. Lace, silks, rose prints and other feminine accents were
later turned into a clothing line anchored by evening looks.
</P>
<P>
   Saks and Barneys have both carried the collection for a few
years. ``She started at a time with all this femininity, and sheer
was very important,'' said Nicole Fischelis, the fashion director
of Saks. ``She has established name recognition.'' Indeed, Ms.
Dinnigan was invited last spring to show in Paris by the Chambre
Syndicale.
</P>
<P>
   A newer but no less exciting face is Akira Isogawa, who moved to
Australia from Kyoto, Japan, in 1987 and has been creating fashion
in his new home since the early 1990s. His signature look is a
combination of antique kimono fabrics mixed with modern fabrics in
extremely sophisticated shapes. Among his designs were a natural
cotton dress padded with red cotton and embroidered with silver,
white silk Jacquard skirts with wrap tops, and simple silk dresses
with antique Japanese fabrics sewn in asymmetrical swaths.
</P>
<P>
   The normally subdued Ms. Pressman of Barneys becomes almost
animated when discussing Isogawa. ``He is amazing,'' she said. ``He
didn't remind me of anyone at all. It is Asian inspired, but at the
same time very modern and directional.'' The store has an exclusive
arrangement with him for New York, Beverly Hills and Chicago, where
he will be featured alongside labels like Comme des Garcons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pressman, who has been at the forefront of finding young,
less expensive designers and nurturing them, also picked up several
lines for the store's lower-priced Co-op floor. Among her finds
were Wayne Cooper, who specializes in fun, sexy separates like
cowl-neck tank tops in stretch fabrics and silk capri pants;
stretch gauze pieces from a company called Pigs in Space, and
stretch nylon tops and skirts from Metalicus, whose pieces will
sell for about $50. Most of the young designers Ms. Pressman picked
up barely hit the $300 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Getting international exposure makes important business sense
for the Australians. For years, they were protected by heavy
tariffs. But in recent years those tariffs have come down, and the
local talent is now fighting for space with the Calvins and Guccis
of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Further, while the weak Australian dollar (roughly 63 cents to
the U.S. dollar) does not help sales at home, it does mean that
U.S. retailers can get more bang for their buck. And as the Asian
financial crisis drags on, the country's closest neighbors are not
its best customers.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Australian fashion is simply the next esthetic
product to make its way onto the map, along with the country's
films and wines. ``Australia used to be a place for backpackers in
their 20s or retired people on holiday,'' Ms. Hume said. ``But now
when you read Wallpaper and count how many mentions there are of
fashion or furniture designers, suddenly it has become groovy.''

JUSTICES HEAR WHETHER ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE DIES WITH CLIENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An attorney told a skeptical Supreme Court on
Monday that notes of a conversation he had with former White House
counsel Vincent Foster Jr. must remain confidential despite
Foster's death and independent counsel Kenneth Starr's efforts to
gain access to them.
</P>
<P>
   However, the justices were also critical of Starr's contention
that the confidentiality of attorney-client discussions dies with
the client when the conversations pertain to a criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, as part of his wide-ranging investigation of President
Clinton, is examining whether presidential aides, and perhaps first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, lied under oath about firings at the
White House travel office in May 1993. As part of his
investigation, Starr subpoenaed three pages of notes Foster
attorney James Hamilton took during his two-hour conversation with
Foster July 11, 1993. Foster, deputy White House counsel and former
law partner of Hillary Clinton's in Little Rock, Ark., shot himself
to death nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton refused to surrender the notes, saying the
attorney-client privilege of confidentiality survives the client's
death. A U.S. district court agreed with Hamilton, but the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled the importance of the
notes to Starr's criminal investigation trumped the assertion of
confidentiality. Hamilton then appealed to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong Supreme Court argument, the justices fired
questions at Hamilton that indicated their belief the
attorney-client privilege might not be absolute after death. The
high court also grilled Starr aide Brett Kavanaugh, revealing the
court's potential disagreement with Starr's contention that the
privilege died with Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton argued the clients' right to have their attorneys keep
conversations private is ``transcendent,'' surviving even the
clients' death. Permitting prosecutors to compel an attorney to
violate this confidentiality would have a ``significant chilling
effect on candor'' between lawyers and clients who never want
illicit details made public, Hamilton said. ``People do care about
their reputations ... after death,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, noting ``conspiracy theorists'' continue
to believe Foster was murdered, asked whether an attorney could be
compelled to disclose a client's statements that would prove the
innocence of a person on trial for murder. ``Courts like to get to
the truth,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton responded that ``the court might find an exception'' to
the privilege if it meant preventing a gross injustice. But Starr,
in seeking the lawyer's notes, is not trying to exonerate anybody
but ``to see if prosecution is a possibility,'' Hamilton argued.
</P>
<P>
   If the court rules against him, Hamilton said, lawyers will have
to give their clients a warning: ``Don't tell me what's really bad
because if you do I may have to disclose it to a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering Hamilton, Kavanaugh told an apparently unsympathetic
Supreme Court that ``pernicious consequences'' would result if
attorneys could refuse to divulge their clients' statements.
Innocent people will be wrongly convicted, and guilty people will
be erroneously acquitted, Kavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh conceded that Foster, if he were alive, could be
questioned on the topics he may have discussed with Hamilton. But
now the only way to find out what Foster said is to gain access to
the lawyer's notes, Kavanaugh said, noting ``the witness in
question is no longer available.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy said lawyers themselves could be placed in
``grave danger'' if they are compelled to disclose conversations in
which their clients admitted to being in a crime syndicate.
Surviving members of the organization may try to kill the lawyer to
prevent their names and activities from being made public, the
justice added.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also said the legal profession ``may be poorer'' if
clients no longer believed their private conversations would remain
secret. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist added, ``The client must
be free to tell the lawyer the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel office controversy flared when Republican critics of
the president alleged that the first lady fired seven workers and
replaced them with family friends. The controversy grew with the
discovery of a memo from White House administration director David
Watkins to then-Chief of Staff Thomas McLarty that the travel staff
had been fired under ``pressure for action from the First Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who had originally planned to hear arguments this
October at the earliest, took the unusual step of accepting in
April Starr's request that they hear the case on an accelerated
schedule to prevent delays in his ongoing investigation. The high
court is expected to render its decision in Hamilton vs. United
States this summer. &QL;

USS YORKTOWN PHOTOGRAPHS BRING BACK WARTIME MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ The last time Jerry Lemberger of Overland
Park laid eyes on the USS Yorktown, he was fighting to stay alive
without a life jacket in the cold, oil-slickened Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It was June 4, 1942, and torpedoes from Japanese airplanes had
badly damaged the aircraft carrier. The crew had been ordered to
abandon ship in the midst of the World War II Battle of Midway.
Three days later, after another hit by the Japanese, the Yorktown
finally sank to the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors didn't see the ship again until Thursday, when
photographs of the Yorktown were shown by undersea explorer Robert
Ballard at a Washington news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Memories began flowing the next day for Lemberger, who learned
about it in The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little heartbreaking. You think about the old guys
and the ones you knew who were killed,'' said Lemberger, 77, who
worked on the carrier as an electrician. ``It's nice that somebody
is remembering the war in the Pacific. We were always overshadowed,
in my opinion, by the war in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   All but 50 of the Yorktown's 2,450 crewmen were saved; no bodies
were left on the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Yorktown is the deepest shipwreck ever discovered, lying
more than three miles below the ocean surface between Hawaii and
Japan. It is a mile deeper than the Titanic's resting place in the
North Atlantic, also photographed in a Ballard expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will be left where it is, protected as a historic site.
The photographs are scheduled to be shown in a television
documentary in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lemberger, who grew up in Milwaukee and raised a family in
California, first moved to Overland Park in 1974, when he worked in
sales for Excellon Manufacturing, a company that made equipment for
drilling and routing printed circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred to Georgia in 1981, then back to California
in 1982 before returning to the Kansas City area for good in 1987.
He retired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lemberger is in good health and lives in an apartment with his
wife, Mary, a Bucyrus, Kan., native. They enjoy traveling and
Lemberger is a twice-weekly golfer.
</P>
<P>
   When the ship was hit, Lemberger was on the fifth deck down in
the fire control switchboard room. A torpedo hit one compartment
behind, and all electrical power was lost. As a result, those
working in Lemberger's compartment didn't know orders had been
given to abandon ship.
</P>
<P>
   Lemberger and the others had been given up for dead by the time
they re-established communication 15 minutes after the abandon-ship
orders. When they got on deck before getting off the ship, he said,
only about 10 men remained on board, including the ship's captain
and other top officers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the ship's life jackets were taken by the time Lemberger
jumped into the ocean. Lifeboats were over capacity, so his only
option was to tie himself to a lifeboat's tow rope and try to stay
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean was coated with the ship's leaking oil, which made it
impossible for Lemberger to recognize anyone. The ocean was chilly,
and swallowing the oily saltwater made him ill. Overhead, an air
battle raged.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're doing is looking up there and seeing our planes
engaging the Japanese,'' he said. ``You're hoping no Japanese drops
a bomb or strafes you. You never know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, near dusk, Lemberger was rescued by a
destroyer. He was so weak when he boarded the ship that he needed
help walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I was worried about sharks or anything, but I
didn't,'' Lemberger said. ``You didn't think about anything, just
keeping your head above water.''
</P>
<P>
   The first night, still coated in oil, he slept near a smokestack
on the destroyer to keep warm. He said eight of his friends from
the Yorktown were killed during the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Lemberger and his wife of 55 years, Mary, courted through the
mail for about three years, beginning in 1941. One of his shipmates
from Bucyrus who knew Mary helped their relationship begin.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Mary in November 1942, Lemberger asked if she
would wear a ring from him, but didn't make it clear he had a
wedding in mind. She received an engagement ring in January that
Lemberger had financed with his winnings from card games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd be eliminated (killed) the next trip out, so I'd
better get married,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were pen pals for three years before their first
face-to-face meeting on May 13, 1943, at Kansas City's Union
Station. A week later, Mary graduated from high school. On May 24
they were married in the home of a minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it would never last,'' Mary said, laughing at the
irony.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Yorktown, Lemberger was stationed on the USS West
Virginia, a battleship, for the majority of his time in the Navy
leading up to his 1946 discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Lemberger had several opportunities to do
business with Japanese companies. He still had bitterness toward
the Japanese before his first trip to Japan in 1969, but his
feelings quickly softened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out later _ and this is why all wars are crazy _ that
everybody is just like you and I,'' he said.

 0609 &HT;    NBA notebook: Rodman thinks NBA's 'nothing without Bulls'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago _ The momentum is on the side of the Bulls. Their Game 3
performance was unprecedented, and many wonder if the Utah Jazz can
recover from a 42-point whipping. By the looks of things, Friday
night could mark the celebration of the city's sixth NBA
championship in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking floated all around Chicago, if not the nation, on
Monday. It floated everywhere but in the world where Dennis Rodman
lives. In keeping with his different views of most situations,
Rodman talked briefly about the prospects of being the first home
team in league history to win the middle three games of the 2-3-2
format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it'll definitely be a Game 6 (in Utah),'' Rodman said.
``It's what the NBA and NBC wants. Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to say that the league and network, for financial
reasons, wanted an extended series. And they wanted the Bulls to
linger as long as possible ``because the NBA is nothing without the
Chicago Bulls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ability to forget
</P>
<P>
   For those who think the Jazz will not be able to rebound from
the 96-54 humiliation the Bulls inflicted on Sunday, consider that
Utah was pounded by 21 points in Game 3 of the Western Conference
semifinals by the San Antonio Spurs. In Game 4, the Jazz played as
strong a game as it had in the postseason and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true, we did,'' guard Jeff Hornacek said. ``We're a
veteran team, a team that's not going to just quit. So, we'll show
up Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better,'' Karl Malone said. ``If that kind of
butt-kicking doesn't make you want to come out and compete, you
shouldn't even be out there. Will we be ready? We'd better be.''
</P>
<P>
   Short on big men
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have gotten by so far with a bench that is short on
productivity up front. Last year, Chicago played with Brian
Williams and Jason Caffey, two tough big men.
</P>
<P>
   Williams signed for big bucks with the Detroit Pistons, and
Caffey was inexplicably traded in February to the Warriors for
David Vaughn, who has been cut. The Bulls signed Dickey Simpkins,
who had been released by Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Simpkins and backup center Bill Wennington seldom are used, so
Chicago is thin up front. All of that is incredible to Caffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea (why I was traded),'' Caffey said. ``It doesn't
make sense to me still. And I don't think it ever will.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman misses practice
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls forward Dennis Rodman was a no-show at today's
practice, drawing an undisclosed fine from the team, but not the
ire of his coach.
</P>
<P>
   The hair-dyed Rodman, who's known for his off-court antics,
didn't give the team a reason for his absence, Bulls coach Phil
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a difficult year for Dennis,'' Jackson said.
``With him, it's like squeezing a circle in a square.

 &HT;    Underdog Capitals to doubters: Don't count us out
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One recent morning, Washington Capitals coach Ron
Wilson told his players they were on the verge of an achievement as
momentous as when Apollo 11 landed on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   If the Capitals reaching the Stanley Cup finals didn't go down
as a red-letter date in history on the same scale as Neil Armstrong
walking on the moon, it's at least fair to say that some Washington
hockey fans consider the feat to be as improbable. Long one of the
NHL's most pathetic franchises, the Capitals, who failed to make
the playoffs their first eight seasons, open play tonight in
Detroit as a heavy underdog to the defending champion Red Wings in
the best-of-seven finals. ``Boston, Ottawa and Buffalo were
supposed to beat us in five or six games,'' Wilson said, referring
to the Captials' playoff victims. ``I guess Detroit is favored to
beat us in four or five. I don't think many people are expecting us
to win the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington failed to make the playoffs last year, finished third
in its division this year and had advanced as far as the conference
finals only once. The biggest reason it has made it this far is the
goaltending of Olag Kolzig. About Wilson's Apollo comparison, the
Caps' leader said, ``We hope to land in Washington. Four more
(wins) and mission accompished.'' But he is the furthest thing from
Neil Armstrong _ a native of Johannesburg, South Africa, who was
born to German parents and raised in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig was a backup last season, but this year he won a starting
job. He has been the hottest goalie in the playoffs, winning 12 of
Washington's 17 playoff games, with four shutouts, a 1.69
goals-against average and a saves percentage of .946. He even
outplayed Buffalo's Dominik Hasek in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He covers a lot of the net and he's consistent,'' Detroit
coach Scotty Bowman said. ``And he's got to have a lot of
confidence after beating a guy like Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which has cast Washington into the role of favorites.
Detroit is solid, although not as spectacular, in goal with Chris
Osgood, but is far deeper offensively and has more playoff
experience. The Red Wings have been boosted in the postseason by
Sergei Federov, whose contract holdout wiped out the first 59 games
of the season and who didn't break a sweat in a game until the
Winter Olympics with team Russia. Federov has nine goals and 17
points in 18 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which eliminated regular-season points champion Dallas
in the Western Conference finals, also rebounded this year from the
emotional loss of defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, who suffered
career-ending injuries in an auto wreck after last year's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of people who counted us out early
because of the circumstances of losing a couple of players,''
defenseman Bob Rouse said. ``That just made the other guys that
much more hungry to prove them wrong. Obviously, we're a better
team with (Konstantinov). But I think it gave our guys the
incentive to pick up their play and contribute.''

 Includes a color slide of Gillian Anderson with David Duchovny in a
scene from ``The X-Files.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Gillian Anderson is a goddess, television's finest actress, the
sexiest lady on the planet and bright as hell, too.
 &HT;    Or at least so believe most of the 4,000 awestruck fans
attending Expo, a gathering of ``X-Files'' aficionados in New York.
Anderson spends an hour answering questions and signing autographs
_ not to mention responding to bouquets, gifts and compliments _
with a steady stream of ``Thank you'' and ``That's so sweet.''
 &HT;    Two weeks later, speaking by telephone from the California set
of her new movie, ``Dancing About Architecture,'' the actress still
seems bemused by her Expo adulation.
 &HT;    ``You've got to be able to take in the information and put it
where it belongs in your brain,'' she says. ``Depending on who you
are and what kind of mood you're in on a certain day, you can
either believe it all or know it's not true. Either way, you say
`Thank you' and move on.''
 &HT;    Anderson pauses, then laughs, her smooth professionalism
slipping just a bit.
 &HT;    ``Come on, it's wonderful,'' she admits. ``It's amazing to hear
such compliments, and I think everyone in the world should have an
Expo every once in a while.
 &HT;    ``Wouldn't you love to have people spend an hour telling you how
wonderful you are _ just saying good things about you?'' she says.
``It's like a roast with no insults.''
 &HT;    It's been a long, strange journey to stardom for Anderson, a
29-year-old with pouty lips, soulful blue eyes and fiery red hair.
She was born in Chicago and reared in London, Puerto Rico and Grand
Rapids, Mich. She survived a punk phase _ replete with a Mohawk
legendary among X-philes _ and studied theater at DePaul
University's Goodman Theater School in Chicago.
 &HT;    Only five years ago, she was a struggling nobody with a couple
of one-shot television roles to her credit. Then came ``The
X-Files,'' a bizarro blend of sci-fi, horror, humor and the
paranormal.
 &HT;    ``I certainly didn't think `X-Files' would be a seemingly
lifelong job,'' she says, still seeming surprised. ``I didn't
realize that signing my contract would lead to all of this.
 &HT;    ``It's been a little bigger, let's say, than I ever expected.''
 &HT;    The series casts Anderson as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully,
partner of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in an ongoing investigation
into everything from murders and UFO sightings to monsters and
otherworldly black ooze. Their beat is the weird and the
inexplicable, with Scully as the severe, skeptical scientist and
Mulder as the acerbic would-be believer, haunted by the long-ago
abduction of his sister, possibly by aliens.
 &HT;    The series is a conspiracy theorist's dream, with webs of
governmental, quasigovernmental and nongovernmental organizations
all keeping secrets from each other and the public, earning
Anderson stardom among what is probably television's strangest
audience.
 &HT;    Just how large that audience is will be determined this summer,
as Scully and Mulder hit the big screen with ``The X-Files,'' a $60
million feature opening nationwide on June 19, written by series
creator Chris Carter and directed by Rob Bowman, who's helmed
numerous episodes. If it succeeds, look for more ``X-Files'' movies
to follow.
 &HT;    Anderson swears that the film will make sense to newcomers while
still rewarding longtime fans.
 &HT;    ``That was a huge concern,'' Anderson says. ``That was Chris
Carter's primary interest in writing the script and Rob Bowman's
interpretation of it.
 &HT;    ``We had to strike that balance, especially on this first
film,'' she says. ``If this works, the balance element might not be
so important later on, or as important.
 &HT;    ``I think we pulled it off. At least I hope we did.''
 &HT;    Anderson is typically cagy about what happens in the movie.
 &HT;    ``It's a lot of action, special effects and big, exciting
shots,'' she says cryptically. ``There's a lot of running. The
relationship between Mulder and Scully moves into new territory in
many different ways. It's very, very exciting.''
 &HT;    Eventually, Anderson offers a few more tidbits: She shares
scenes with guest star Blythe Danner, but not with Martin Landau
nor Armin Mueller-Stahl. She spends one sequence stuck in a vat of
goo. And the film answers a few old questions, and poses fresh ones
designed to set up the show's sixth season.
 &HT;    ``One thing I can tell you is that this is very much a movie,''
she says. ``For television, what we do is very ambitious. Doing
`X-Files' as a movie is just a natural progression, the next step.
Again, I think we've pulled it off.''
 &HT;    The film can only heighten public interest in Anderson, who has
already been the subject of magazine covers, action figures, prying
tabloid stories, CD-ROM games and those fan conventions. During her
``X-Files'' stint the actress has married, had a child _ Piper, now
2 _ divorced, won an Emmy and shot several soon-to-be-released
films.
 &HT;    ``I don't think anybody can be as prepared as they need to be to
deal with all of this,'' Anderson says. ``Sometimes I feel more
ready than other times. Sometimes I feel it's too much, that I've
got too much on my plate. Then I move past that point and start to
feel more stable again.
 &HT;    ``But I don't think anybody can prepare themselves for any kind
of public success,'' she adds. ``You can read about it and see what
happens to other people, but when it happens to you it's nothing
like you imagined.''
 &HT;    Intent on forging a post-``X-Files'' future, Anderson crams her
down time with film roles. She recently shot a cameo in an
independent drama entitled ``Chicago Cab,'' which currently has no
distributor, and played a supporting role in the family drama ``The
Mighty.''
 &HT;    ``It's a beautiful story about two outcast kids (Kieran Culkin
and Elden Henson) and their friendship,'' Anderson says of the
film, which co-stars Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands and Meat Loaf.
``The film is getting wonderful advance reviews, and it deserves
them.''
 &HT;    The currently filming ``Dancing About Architecture'' features
Anderson, Rowlands, Sean Connery, Jon Stewart, Dennis Quaid and
Anthony Edwards, among others.
 &HT;    ``It's about relationships and having the courage to change,''
Anderson says. ``It's little vignettes that flip back and forth
between different pairs of people _ mothers and sons, lovers,
partners of sorts.
 &HT;    ``When I get to spend a couple of weeks doing projects like
`Dancing' or `The Mighty,' that I care about so much,'' the actress
says, ``it feels like I'm showing what I can do, feels like I'm
keeping my feet in the water until I have more time to do bigger
roles, different roles and different kinds of films.''
 &HT;    After she wraps ``Dancing'' and completes her ``X-Files''
publicity chores, it'll be back to the ``X-Files'' set in Los
Angeles, recently relocated from British Columbia. She's reportedly
committed to the show for two more years.
 &HT;    But it isn't just the show. At times, Anderson says, it seems as
if her entire life revolves around ``The X-Files.''
 &HT;    ``I shot the movie almost a year ago, right after we did a whole
season of the series and just before we did another season,'' she
says. ``We did an `X-Files' CD-ROM somewhere in there, and now I've
got to promote the movie.
 &HT;    ```Dancing About Architecture' is something completely
different. That's a good thing for me,'' she says. ``But there's
not a day when `The X-Files' doesn't come up. I don't think there
will ever be a day when it doesn't.''
 &HT;    Is she OK with that?
 &HT;    There's a long pause. Clearly, it's something the actress has
thought a lot about.
 &HT;    ``I don't know,'' Anderson says finally. ``I don't know.''

 Includes a color slide of Jennifer Love Hewitt in a scene from
``Can't Hardly Wait.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even niceness has its problems.
 &HT;    Just ask Jennifer Love Hewitt, who ran into one while filming a
scene for ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' her new film, opening June 12. The
scene called for her to scream at another actor.
 &HT;    ``An extra didn't realize I was acting and came up and said, `I
thought you were that nice girl from ``Party of Five.'' I can't
believe you would treat your fellow actors the way you did,''' she
recalls. ``My jaw just dropped. I wanted to say, `I'm so sorry. I'm
not mean in real life!'''
 &HT;    That's life when you're a 19-year-old who's already a star,
courtesy of her popular television series and last year's feature
film, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' She was a teen idol
before she was out of high school _ which involved problems of its
own.
 &HT;    ``I would be in the middle of kissing Scott Wolf on `Party of
Five' _ and suddenly we would have to break apart because I would
be required to go home,'' she says. ``My 10-and-a-half hours of
work were over.''
 &HT;    Hewitt may be hitting the big time, but she's kept a level
enough head to joke about her own success in the $100
million-grossing ``I Know What You Did,'' a routine teen-scream
flick which relied heavily on the anatomical appeal of Hewitt and
co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I call that movie, `I Know What My Breasts Did Last
Summer,''' she says jokingly. ``I've come to realize that boobs can
be a great accessory.''
 &HT;    Hewitt's lungs also proved an asset on that film. Asked to
demonstrate her trademark ``I Know What You Did'' bloodcurdling
scream _ after all, she starts filming the sequel, ``I Still
Know,'' next week _ she looks around the elegant suite at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel dubiously.
 &HT;    ``You really want me to do it?'' she asks. ``OK, here it is.''
She winds up, taking a deep gulp of air.
 &HT;    ``Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!'' she yells, and the windows shake.
Two publicists come running, expecting the worst, only to find
their young charge taking a bow. ``Thank you, thank you very
much,'' she says.
 &HT;    Hewitt is more than heaving breasts and a resonant scream,
however. Besides her award-winning stint on ``Party of Five,'' she
recently sold her first screenplay, ``Cupid's Love,'' to New Line
Pictures for a reported $500,000.
 &HT;    ``I had a dream and woke up in the middle of the night, and I
was like, `Wow, I have a cute idea for a story,''' she recalls.
 &HT;    So she wrote an outline of the story _ about a wedding planner
who falls in love with a young hunk while planning his wedding _
and the rest is future film history.
 &HT;    First, however, Hewitt is spending the summer filming ``I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer,'' which co-stars that other teen
sensation, Brandy.
 &HT;    And, of course, there's ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' in which Hewitt
plays Amanda, a prom queen who must deal with the end of her
high-school era at a rocking graduation party.
 &HT;    ``The character for me was something I've never done before,''
Hewitt says. ``I always tend to play the very natural
girl-next-door who never gets the guy. In this film, I'm the
end-all, be-all dream girl and the center of this guy's
affection.''
 &HT;    The subject matter might seem familiar, Hewitt says, but it
wasn't.
 &HT;    ``I've never actually been to a real high-school party,'' she
admits. ``I was never interested. I had other things to do.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Hewitt has no regrets about the sacrifices she's
made for her career.
 &HT;    ``No, because if I had gone to real high school, what guarantee
do I have that I would have had the perfect high-school
existence?'' she says. ``Now with these movies, I can honestly say,
`I was the prom queen. I was the cheerleader. I did date Dexter,
the big football player.' And I'm not really lying.''
 &HT;    She's not the only reigning teen sensation, of course. Already
there have been rumors of competitiveness with her ``Party''
co-star Neve Campbell, who starred in that other teen hit,
``Scream'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``The only thing that Neve and I ever talk about as far as
career stuff goes is that she's the horror queen and I'm the horror
princess,'' Hewitt jokes. ``There is no competition.''
 &HT;    Hewitt saves her battles for the things that matter to her. For
example, she's sworn off on-screen nudity.
 &HT;    ``It's not for me,'' she says. ``Let's say I'm doing a horror
film. There is nothing about a girl running and having to show a
full boob shot that has anything to do with being murdered by a
psycho.
 &HT;    ``Plus I very rarely think that sex scenes or nude scenes in
movies are really needed to get the point across,'' she says.
``Very rarely. Two people making love does not mean they're in
love. You can show it in other ways.''
 &HT;    Hewitt was born in Killeen, Texas, where her parents divorced
when she was a baby. She made her professional debut at age 10,
singing at a March of Dimes fund-raiser. From that point on, she
was a girl possessed, with her mother, a speech pathologist, right
behind her.
 &HT;    ``My mom basically put her life on hold and pushed stop in the
middle of her career and her life and said, `OK, sure.''' she
recalls. ``And we moved to L.A., away from all of her friends, so
that I could live my dream.''
 &HT;    That dream began with a 1989 stint on the Disney variety show
``Kids Incorporated.'' A Barbie workout video followed, and then in
1995 she was cast on ``Party of Five'' as the object of Wolf's
affection.
 &HT;    ``I love the show,'' she says. ``It's probably the best job I've
ever had. I'm there for at least two more years, with a third one
being optional. I would definitely go the third year. I don't want
`PO5' to end.''
 &HT;    ``I Still Know'' is being shot in Mexico, to Hewitt's dismay.
 &HT;    ``We're way out from civilization,'' she grouses. ``There's
absolutely nothing to do. They've even given us snake kits. So
basically that sucks _ we're really roughing it.''
 &HT;    Making horror films has its drawbacks, Hewitt admits.
 &HT;    ``It's weird,'' she says. ``The entire time you're doing the
running-and-screaming scenes, you start to think, `What if that
hook actually made contact with my flesh? What would that feel
like? Run faster!' You start to book.
 &HT;    ``In fact, in the original movie, I was running a little too
fast. They said, `Love, you're not really running from somebody.
Slow down.'''
 &HT;    However, Hewitt's days as a teen scream are numbered. Next
February, she will hit the two-decade mark.
 &HT;    ``It will be kind of cool when nobody will be able to call me a
teen-ager anymore,'' she says. ``That will be kind of neat. But my
life probably won't be any different.''
 &HT;    That life has its perks, of course. Hewitt is still enough of a
teen-ager to have movie-star crushes of her own, but, unlike most
teens, she actually gets to meet her idols _ or almost.
 &HT;    Last year, her all-time favorite, Johnny Depp, actually visited
her on the ``Party'' set. Caught in sweatclothes and sans makeup,
Hewitt did what any teen-ager would do: She locked herself in her
trailer and died of embarrassment.
 &HT;    ``I was mortified,'' she recalls.
 &HT;    But the story has a happy ending: Depp was amused, and later
sent flowers when Hewitt graduated from high school.
 &HT;    ``That was the coolest,'' she says, beaming.

 Includes a color slide of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in a
scene from ``The X-Files.'' 
 By TOM FRANGICETTO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Its code name is ``Blackwood,'' it will be landing in theaters
everywhere on June 19 and the anticipation of its arrival has
aroused one of television's most loyal cults.
 &HT;    It is the ``X-Files'' movie, and it is expected to finally
reveal many of the elusive secrets that agents Fox Mulder and Dana
Scully have been pursuing for five years.
 &HT;    Whether you're a rabid X-phile or merely on the cusp of being a
``believer,'' here is a 16-question inquiry to probe your knowledge
of ... the truth. 
 -0- 
 &HT;    1. In the pilot episode, Dr. Dana Scully gives what reason for
choosing to work for the FBI rather than practice medicine?
 &HT;    a. It was an act of rebellion against her parents.
 &HT;    b. She's a type-A personality who thrives on intrigue.
 &HT;    c. She saw it as a place where she could distinguish herself.
 &HT;    d. She wanted to contribute to humanity.
 &HT;    2. Fox Mulder is a trained psychologist. What university did he

 &HT;    a. ``Old Eerie''
 &HT;    b. ``The Weirdo''
 &HT;    c. ``Flaky''
 &HT;    d. ``Spooky.''
 &HT;    4. Scully is assigned to assist Mulder with the X-Files and to

 &HT;    a. discredit Mulder.
 &HT;    b. verify the authenticity of Mulder's claims.
 &HT;    c. debunk the X-Files project.
 &HT;    d. spy on Mulder.

 &HT;    8. How does Mulder attend Deep Throat's funeral?
 &HT;    a. disguised as Mulder's alias, George B. Hale
 &HT;    b. using eight-power binoculars from 1,000 feet away

 &HT;    c. ``I like you.''

Mulder's father.
 &HT;    15. b _ The Well-Manicured Man claims to control the future.
Even if they did, the other three would be unlikely to be so
forthcoming.
 &HT;    16. a _ Mulder found the ``I WANT TO BELIEVE'' poster at a head
shop on M Street.

Lee.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people catch more flak for less cause than Regis Philbin and
Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are quick to dismiss their daily chatfest as empty
gushing and self-promotional grandstanding. Cynics gripe about the
constant on-air references to her kids. Tabloid headlines scream
about his health, her marriage and more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the naysayers, Philbin and Gifford ride a
decade-old wave of popularity that shows no sign of cresting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited three months for these tickets and drove 15 hours to
get here,'' gushed one audience member outside their Manhattan
studio on a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah's great and I like Rosie O'Donnell, but nobody can
compare to these two,'' another chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best, I mean, they're just the best,'' enthused a
third.
</P>
<P>
   And for each of the 200 or so audience members who whoop and
holler for their midmorning heroes on a given day, there are 50,000
more like them watching at home.
</P>
<P>
   Why, after 10 years, are they still so mad about Philbin and
Gifford? Here are 10 reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1. The best chemistry on daytime television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Gawd, the dreaded `C word,''' Philbin says. ``Every
interview we do, that word comes up, and I don't even know what it
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford nods in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a certain something that we have together,'' she
says, ``but I've never really been able to describe it. Can you?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. It's their shared ability to play his jaded gruffness
against her wide-eyed enthusiasm, but it's also their knack for a
common touch that speaks directly to the heartland.
</P>
<P>
   2. They take the high road.
</P>
<P>
   Long before it became fashionable _ and ratings-favorable _ for
hosts such as Oprah, Rosie and even Geraldo to take a kinder,
gentler approach, Philbin and Gifford were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in the world should we want to say something unkind about
someone else?'' Gifford says. ``I can't imagine why anyone in our
position would ever feel the need to make a guest feel
uncomfortable or unwelcome.''
</P>
<P>
   3. They make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't ``The MacNeil-Lehrer Report.'' Still, you have to
have a fair amount on the ball to fill upward of 250 hours a year
with conversation lively enough to hold the attention of 10 million
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin and Gifford know who their viewers are and what they
expect from the show, and they make sure they get it.
</P>
<P>
   4. They keep it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spontaneity is the key to the show's success,'' Philbin says.
``People think we spend all kinds of time together, but we're both
so busy with other things that it's only rarely that we see each
other outside the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the first 20 minutes of the show are so fresh,'' he
says. ``If we spent every evening socializing together, then we
would've discussed everything we had to discuss the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   5. They appreciate their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Philbin and Gifford show tremendous respect to their studio
audience. While other hosts spend commercial breaks chatting with
celebrity guests or hurrying backstage, Philbin and Gifford wander
out into the audience to answer questions, sign autographs and pose
for photos.
</P>
<P>
   They respect the viewers, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of our viewers takes an hour out of their day to
spend it with us,'' Gifford says. ``It's our job to honor that
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   6. They've got guts.
</P>
<P>
   Many stars, faced with the negative press Gifford has received,
would duck for cover. Instead, she's had the strength to face the
criticism head-on.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Philbin bounced back from a serious heart scare
and, instead of waxing sanctimonious about his survival, seized the
opportunity to gently educate viewers about the importance of diet
and exercise. As a result, he's emerged as an aging America's
poster boy for healthy living.
</P>
<P>
   7. Nothing fazes them.
</P>
<P>
   The two hosts will go to just about any lengths to please their
audience. They've wrestled wild animals, weathered tropical storms,
been spritzed with cold coffee on ``Seinfeld'' and dressed up in
everything from grass skirts to giant sumo-wrestler fat suits.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare it isn't, but it's artful foolishness all the same.
</P>
<P>
   8. They've got heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathie Lee is without question one of the most generous
individuals I have ever met,'' Philbin says. ``People don't really
appreciate how deep her commitment is. I swear this woman will go
out of her way to help anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, on the other hand, notes that the superficially gruff
Philbin has a remarkably tender side.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything I've gone through over the past couple of
years, he's never wavered in his support,'' she says. ``And it's
not just me. Though he doesn't like to admit it, he cares so much
about all of the people around him. You couldn't ask for a better
or more understanding friend.''
</P>
<P>
   9. They make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to scoff at events such as the annual ``Queen For a
Day''-style Mother's Day show, but just try to stay dry-eyed when
they provide a cancer-stricken, single mother with a brand-new home
or give an ailing bridegroom and his wife-to-be the wedding of
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's sentimental. But their unflagging altruism has helped
dozens of deserving individuals and causes, ranging from pediatric
AIDS to Special Olympics and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   10. They won't be around forever.
</P>
<P>
   They've had a tremendous decade-long run and are still going
strong.
</P>
<P>
   But ask them if ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee'' is likely to
celebrate its 20th anniversary and, without a moment's hesitation,
these two very different people respond in unison:
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not!''
 &UR; SIDEBAR: A DECADE OF MEMORIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Of the more than 5,000 guests you've had on the show, who was
your favorite?
</P>
<P>
   PHILBIN: We've had so many memorable guests, but two of the
consistently most interesting have been Diane Sawyer and Barbara
Walters.
</P>
<P>
   GIFFORD: I'd have to say Audrey Hepburn. She truly was the
personification of grace and elegance.
</P>
<P>
   When she came on the show, she already knew that she was
suffering from colon cancer, but she made an extra effort to be
here so that she could spread the word about the wonderful work she
was doing with UNICEF on behalf of children all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the single biggest surprise?
</P>
<P>
   GIFFORD: For Regis, I think it had to be the time we caught him
completely off guard with a special visit from Perry Como.
</P>
<P>
   PHILBIN: We've had lots of crazy moments, but the one that
surprised me most was the kiss that Kathie Lee greeted Tom Selleck
with. She was locked onto him so tight, I thought she'd never let
go!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your biggest gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   PHILBIN: The biggest gaffe? You mean, like, mistake? That's easy
_ I haven't made it yet.
</P>
<P>
   GIFFORD: I think the biggest mistake I've made was letting my
emotions get the best of me the day that I had to defend myself
against the accusations (regarding child labor) about my clothing
line. I was so hurt and angry, but I probably shouldn't have gotten
so emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has been the one most memorable moment?
</P>
<P>
   PHILBIN: Probably the time that we had the sumo wrestlers on the
show. That was really wild, and I think it was the longest laugh
we've ever gotten from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   GIFFORD: I think it would have to be the Halloween shows. There
was the time we dressed as Sonny and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Even better was the year that we did the entire show with me
dressed as Regis and him dressed as me _ it would be pretty hard to
top that.

 By LEAH INGRAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three of the biggest stresses in a person's life include giving
birth, taking a new job and moving. I know, because last summer,
six weeks after giving birth to my second child, I moved 600 miles
from Michigan to New Jersey for my husband's new job.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't alone. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly
1.8 million Americans moved for job reasons in 1993, the last year
for which statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   Moving is stressful for everyone, but it's especially hard on
toddlers and preschoolers. One of the best ways to help children
adjust is to get them involved in the move.
</P>
<P>
   Before they began their move from Ann Arbor, Mich., to Madison,
Wisc., last fall, Stacey and Stuart Udell let their 2-year-old
daughter Jillian draw on the boxes that would contain her clothes
and toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way,'' Stacey Udell says, ``when we got to the new house,
she'd know which boxes had her stuff in them.''
 &UR; MAKING A LIST, CHECKING IT TWICE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides planning for the actual moving day, you should create
``to do'' lists of things you need to handle before you leave. This
includes finding day care, if you need it, and new doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Your realtor, if you're working with one, may be able to help.
Sylvia Buchwald of William Raveis Real Estate in Trumbull, Conn.,
maintains a list of day-care resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just recently a couple moved from Maryland, and they needed
day care for their two little ones,'' says Buchwald, who referred
the couple to a licensed preschool on their new street. ``That's
where she ended up sending her kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Another great way to find a place to send your child is by
calling Child Care Aware at (800) 424-2246. It is a referral
service to local organizations that provide names, phone numbers,
fees and hours of operation of various child-care services in your
new community.
</P>
<P>
   Before we moved from Michigan, I called Child Care Aware and
received the name of a local child-care-referral agency in my new
town. They put me in touch with 10 different schools, one of which
Jane, my 2-year-old, now attends.
</P>
<P>
   Your current pediatrician, primary-care physician and
obstetrician/gynecologist are all great resources for new doctors.
But if they don't know whom to send you to in your new location,
there are other ways to find a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call the chair of pediatrics or obstetrics at the nearest
major medical school, and ask them to recommend three physicians,''
suggests Elise Babcock, author of ``When Life Becomes Precious''
(Bantam, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Babcock adds that organizations such as the American Academy of
Pediatrics, the American Board of Medical Specialists and the
American Board of Family Practice also provide referrals.
 &UR; THE BIG DAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether you've hired movers or are moving yourselves, make sure
any items you'll want immediately upon arrival _ some toys for the
children, perhaps _ go into the truck last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last things on the truck are the first to come off,'' says
Doreen Hankins, director of sales and marketing at Stevens
Worldwide Van Lines in Saginaw, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Plan to have someone available at the new house to watch your
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, parents will be distracted, and any time there's
less parental supervision, kids can be exposed to risk,'' says Ken
Giles, a spokesperson for the U.S. Consumer Products Safety
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It's always best to keep important items with you during the
move, whether it's your child's favorite blanket, his birth
certificate or your own medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Before you start the car or hop on a plane to your new
destination, make sure you've packed plenty of snacks and toys to
keep everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the two-day drive from Michigan to New Jersey
last summer, I took Jane to shop for new toys to take in the car
with us. She chose a variety of items, including books and musical
instruments, which we put away until the big day. That way
everything was fresh and new to her, and she wouldn't become quite
as bored as she might with an older toy.
 &UR; HOME SAFE HOME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things you'll want to do when you arrive at
your new home is a quick safety check of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Cover electrical outlets, check that banister posts aren't far
enough apart for a kid to get his head stuck in them and install
gates where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of one family that had moved from California to
Massachusetts, and had never lived in a house with a basement
before,'' says Terry Moerler, a broker with Re-Max in Thousand
Oaks, Calif. ``Their little boy opened a door and thought he was
walking into a room _ but it was the basement, and he fell down the
stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to be cleaning up the new place, ``keep all
household cleaners in their original containers, and lock them away
from children,'' Giles says.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is going to be unfamiliar with their new surroundings,
so it's a good idea to install night lights throughout the house.
This will help prevent you from going bump in the night, as well as
keeping your kids from being scared.
</P>
<P>
   In their new house in Madison, the Udells leave a light on for
Jillian ``so she doesn't wake up and be completely disoriented in
the dark,'' Stacey Udell says.
 &UR; MAKING THE NEW HOUSE A HOME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to make your new house feel like home to
your children is to unpack their things first. Because my husband
Bill drove the truck with our possessions in them and arrived a day
before we did, he unpacked all of Jane's toys and set them up in
the playroom for her.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at our new home, Jane was at first shy and
reserved _ until she walked into the playroom. She looked around,
broke out in a smile and started shouting, ``Look, mommy, my toys,
all of my toys are here!''
</P>
<P>
   I knew right then that we were all going to be very happy in our
new home.
 &UR; SIDEBAR 1: ARE WE THERE YET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While packing can be a bear, keeping your kids occupied during
the move can be a great big grizzly.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gesse, a child-life specialist at Children's Hospital of
Michigan in Detroit, offers some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   + Say it with music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find sing-along tapes with shorter songs on them, because
toddlers and preschoolers have short attention spans,'' Gesse says.
``If you're traveling with a baby, you might want to find classical
or baroque music, which babies tend to like.''
</P>
<P>
   + Bring along interactive toys.
</P>
<P>
   The new talking Barney might make the perfect back-seat
companion. If your kid would enjoy pretending to drive, check out
the VTech Little Smart Tiny Tot Driver. It has its own steering
wheel and realistic car sounds, such as an engine starting and a
horn beeping.
</P>
<P>
   + Inspire the artist in your child.
</P>
<P>
   Coloring books and crayons are great for toddlers. Preschoolers
with more finely tuned motored skills might enjoy ``drawing'' with
a Magnadoodle or an Etch-a-Sketch.
 &UR; SIDEBAR 2: FINDING FRIENDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making friends for yourselves and your kids in a new location
can be challenging. Here are five tips to try:
</P>
<P>
   + Ask your realtor to introduce you to your neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   + Visit the neighborhood playground regularly.
</P>
<P>
   + Invite your neighbors over for a ``getting to know you''
brunch.
</P>
<P>
   + Get involved in your neighborhood association.
</P>
<P>
   + Join a local house of worship.

SKY-HIGHTECH (Los Angeles) _ Sky Dayton has a lot to smile about:
The company he founded three years ago, Earthlink Network Inc. in
Pasadena, recently signed up its 500,000th customer, making it the
fourth-largest Internet service provider in America; on June 5,
Dayton's company closed a deal to take over Sprint Corp.'s Internet
services customer base. By David Bloom. 
. 
SKY-SCIENTOLOGY _ (Los Angeles) To some extent, Sky Dayton's
decision to bring in Garry Betty as his company's CEO has provided
his company useful insulation from complaints by some about
Dayton's own Scientologist beliefs. Dayton said he used Scientology
management tenets to structure the company, but his managers ``are
a very diverse group'' who bring a variety of management expertise
to the company. By David Bloom. 
. 
TITANIC-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ If you're tired of paying $7 to see
``Titanic'' _ and Leo _ for the sixth, seven, eighth times, be of
good cheer. James Cameron's ubiquitous love story will dock in
video stores and retail outlets Sept. 1 with the consumer-friendly
price tag of $19.95.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans share their homes with more than 112 million cats and
dogs, not to mention an assortment of reptiles, birds, horses and
exotic animals.
</P>
<P>
   As pet owners become more health- and environment-conscious,
they're starting to bring that consciousness to the way they
provide for their companion animals. In 1996, U.S. pet owners
supported the natural-pet-food and -supplement industry to the tune
of $65 million, and sales keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   But what is natural pet care? Holistic veterinarians say it all
begins with a nonprocessed, whole-foods diet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Animal Protection Institute, commercial pet
foods, from Friskies to Kal-Kan, contain mostly grain wastes and
meat byproducts, which can include everything from euthanized
shelter animals to cancer-ridden livestock, roadkill, downer
animals, moldy grains and rancid restaurant grease.
</P>
<P>
   P.F. McGargle, a federal meat inspector who is also a
veterinarian, notes that feeding these low-in-nutrition packaged
``scraps'' to pets increases their chances of cancer and other
degenerative diseases.
</P>
<P>
   An API investigative report found that in slaughterhouses, after
choice cuts have been removed for human food, ``whatever remains of
the carcass _ bones, blood, pus, intestines, bowels, ligaments,
fat, hooves, horns and beaks'' _ are what find their way into the
pet-food stream.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this unhealthy practice so popular? In a word, profits.
Many pet-food companies are branches of human-food conglomerates
that want to turn waste products into sales. Ralston-Purina, for
example, gets the scraps from Heinz, Nestle and Mars to produce its
pet foods.
</P>
<P>
   So what options do pet owners have?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs and cats were designed to handle raw, uncooked foods,''
says holistic veterinarian Dr. Will Winter, who recommends mixing
fresh cuts of meat _ not ground meat _ with whole grains and
vegetables for a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, such as Minnesota-based Sojourner Farms, sell
pet-food mixes containing nuts, herbs and grains, which can be
added to meat for complete nutrition. Fish can also join the
feeding dish, but should always be cooked to eliminate parasites.
</P>
<P>
   For already-prepared dry and wet foods for cats and dogs, both
Wysong and Lang's Natural have impeccable ingredients lists,
including organic and whole grains, and whole cuts of meat, while
avoiding unhealthy additives such as meat byproducts, meat meals
and grain flours to bulk up their foods.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to wholesome treats for Fido, Dandy Doggie and
Wow-Bow offer a huge assortment of organic, vegetarian dog
biscuits, gourmet grain pastries and cookies, and fresh-baked
kibble.
 &UR; WHEN NATURE CALLS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bedding and litter are other prime areas where pet caregivers
can look to go greener and healthier.
</P>
<P>
   For litter-box-trained animals, holistic vets recommend avoiding
conventional clay litters, which are laden with silica dust, a
known carcinogen. Many ``scoopable'' clay litters have also been
found to cause intestinal blockages in cats and kittens when
inadvertently consumed while grooming.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies make wheat-based litters which are scoopable,
biodegradable and flushable, including Swheat Scoop and Heartland
Wheat Litter.
</P>
<P>
   Other dust-free, biodegradable alternatives include Feline
Pine's odor-absorbing pellets, made from 100-percent-recycled
pine-lumber waste from mill yards, or ECOfresh and Yesterday's
News, both made from 100-percent-recycled newspaper. CareFRESH,
produced from recycled wood pulp, can be used for exotic pets and
birds.
 &UR; FLEA PATROL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indoors or out, furry companions seem to be magnets for fleas.
But have you ever read the warning labels on conventional flea and
tick products? From shampoos and dips to foggers and collars,
conventional flea controls caution consumers to use gloves and keep
product away from skin and mucous membranes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they're being applied all over your pet, where the toxic
emissions from a flea collar or spray, for instance, are being
constantly inhaled or licked by the wearer. The Cancer Prevention
Coalition has warned against the use of several brand-name flea
collars, including Sergeant's, Hartz, Zodiac and Longlife.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional foggers, bombs, powders and sprays are just as
problematic, and should not be used around pregnant women or
children, as they pose a risk of neurological problems and
leukemia. They may also include the nerve poisons dichlorvos,
propoxur or diazinon, as well as many ``inert'' ingredients such as
methyl bromide, benzene, asbestos and DDT.
</P>
<P>
   For safer removal of fleas, a flea comb works wonders. Sold in
any pet-supply store for $3 to $7, this metal comb collects fleas
between its narrowly spaced tines.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal shampoos, collars, sachets and sprays using citronella,
eucalyptus, pennyroyal, tea-tree oil and other aromatic oils to
repel fleas and ticks are other less-toxic options, and are
available from natural-pet-care companies such as BioChemics, which
makes Bug Out spray, and One Earth, producer of herbal collars and
Citrus Shampoo Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Goodpet's nontoxic, microscopic ``beneficial nematodes'' eat
flea larvae when sprayed outdoors, and are a good way to keep
infestations at bay _ a $25 container covers 4,800 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic and brewer's yeast are also recommended to supplement pet
diets, as they produce body odors that repel fleas _ One Earth
offers brewer's-yeast-and-garlic tablets and biscuits.
 &UR; ANIMAL ACCESSORIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With natural-pet-care companies abounding, anything your
companion may need can be bought through eco-friendly channels.
</P>
<P>
   World Wise has taken more than 25 billion soda-bottle caps, for
example, and turned them into sturdy food bowls, priced at $5.99.
It also produces an inexpensive cat scratcher from
100-percent-recycled cardboard, organic catnip and a heavy-duty
recycled-cardboard pet carrier.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for all-natural pet bedding, Creeping Jenny is
the place to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organic bedding for dogs and cats is important,'' president
Jennifer Chamberlain says. ``Skin problems are the No. 1 reason
caregivers take their pets to the vet, and cedar and foam beds are
too harsh for many animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Creeping Jenny also offers hemp collars and leashes, hemp-rope
bones, organic catnip and hemp toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemp is digestible and breaks down easily if an animal
swallows it,'' Chamberlain says _ unlike the nylon threading found
in many products, which can cause intestinal blockages in pets.
</P>
<P>
   And for pet owners frustrated with doctors who prescribe
antibiotics at every vet visit, many are looking into homeopathic
remedies _ treating animals with a little of what ails them.
</P>
<P>
   HomeoPet, Dr. Goodpet, Animals' Apawthecary and Noah's Ark have
created a wide selection of homeopathic products, including
treatments for arthritis, urinary incontinence, eczema, flea bites,
anxiety, diarrhea and ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, taking a holistic approach to pet care will have Fido
wagging his tail and Fifi purring with good health _ and you
feeling good about having helped the environment.

 &HT;    Beanie heist busted at Florida McDonald's
 &HT;    By Shannon Colavecchio
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ When the van arrived at the McDonald's at
4132 Blue Heron Blvd., word spread quickly among employees that it
carried two boxes of Zip the Cat Teenie Beanie Babies _ 600 in all.
</P>
<P>
   But when managers opened up the van, they discovered the plush
collectibles were gone, Detective Pat Galligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, an 18-year-old McDonald's employee lost her job
and landed in jail, charged with stealing the Happy Meal prizes _
street value $6,000 _ and selling 300 of the toys to a coworker.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Latasha Chappell went to the van about
10:30 a.m. Thursday, June 4, took the two boxes of stuffed animals
and that afternoon sold one box for $50 to McDonald's employee Earl
Wynds, 29, of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But Wynds, who said he felt guilty and feared losing his job,
returned the stolen stuffed goods to his managers, Galligan said.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed against Wynds, but Chappell, of 5865
Haverhill Road, was brought into the police station for questioning
and ``finally broke down and said she had the other box at her
boyfriend's house,'' Galligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 300 Beanies in that box _ returned to the Blue Heron
Boulevard McDonald's the next day _ are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell, who had worked at the restaurant since March, was
booked into the county jail on petty and grand theft charges,
police said. Grand theft is a third-degree felony. Chappell was
released Friday afternoon on $3,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   She had no prior criminal record, police said, but has now lost
her job and may face jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things will make people crazy,'' Galligan said.

THE FINE ART OF LISTENING TO CHILDREN

 By JULIA MARTIN  
 c.1998 Child magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I refused my 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter's 12th
consecutive plea for candy, she began to scream and sob.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping and threatening a time-out weren't working, so I
decided to try a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are so sad that you can't have candy, aren't you, honey?''
I said, and gave her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, her crying softened and she began nodding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want one jelly bean,'' she whimpered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' I said. ``You really love to eat candy. You'd like
to eat it all day long, wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   To my amazement, she calmed down and actually gave up on the
candy crusade, at least for the moment. My willingness simply to
listen and empathize helped her get over her troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives have become so fast-paced we often don't slow down
enough to tune in to what our kids are saying,'' says Florence
Wolff, professor emeritus of communication at the University of
Dayton in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts say this skill is one of the most important you can
have as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bedrock of communication, of your whole approach to
parenting,'' says Elaine Mazlish, co-author of ``How to Talk So
Kids Will Listen &AMP; Listen So Kids Will Talk'' (Avon Books, 1982).
``When your child feels you truly understand what he is saying and
feeling, it enhances the bond of closeness and trust between you
and gives him a tremendous feeling of self-satisfaction and
self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, good listening skills are easy to learn. Here are a
few key strategies to pursue.
 &UR; ATTENTION, PLEASE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can't really listen if you are preoccupied with other
things. If your child wants to talk _ especially if he's upset or
worried _ it's important that you stop whatever you're doing and
give him your full attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are opening mail or thinking about a meeting while your
child is talking, you'll tune out much of what he's telling you,''
Wolff says.
</P>
<P>
   You will also send the message that his concerns aren't a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to show him that you are listening and care
about what she has to say. Lean forward to let her know you are
interested. Holding hands or putting your arm around your child
also shows her how important she is to you, and will encourage her
to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physical contact is a way children feel connected to you,''
Mazlish says. ``It makes them feel cared about.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are times when you can't drop what you're
doing. But you can still let your child know you want to listen.
</P>
<P>
   If he approaches you at a bad moment, Mazlish says, say
something like ``I want to listen and give you my full attention,
sweetie. But right now I have to finish up this project. As soon as
I'm done we'll sit down and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial message is that you value what your child has to
say.
 &UR; LOOK FOR NONVERBAL CLUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another key to effective listening is to take in the whole
message your child is sending, which includes facial expressions
and body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the speaker's message comes from nonverbal
signals,'' Wolff says.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true of babies, of course, and small children
who have difficulty expressing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if your 9-year-old comes into the kitchen with a
problem and you keep chopping onions with your back to her, you'll
miss important clues. She may not sound very upset, but one look at
her would tell you otherwise: Her eyebrows are knitted, her body is
rigid and her fists are clenched.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't look at your child while she is speaking,'' Wolff
says, ``you miss most of what she is trying to get across.''
 &UR; EMPATHIZE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next, perhaps most challenging step is to identify and
affirm your child's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, parents often do the opposite, denying the
feelings _ ``There's no reason to be so upset'' _ or offering a
philosophical response _ ``That's life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these reactions show the child she's wrong to feel the
way she does,'' Mazlish says. ``Denying a child's feelings in this
way tells her she can't trust herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even supplying a solution isn't necessarily helpful _ it robs
the child of the opportunity to problem-solve on her own, and yours
may be the wrong solution for her.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are also more likely to turn up the volume when you don't
empathize, as I learned with my candy-crazy toddler. Frustrated
because they don't feel understood, they protest more loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, focus on validating your child's feelings. Your
affirmation can be a simple but attentive ``Ummm, I see,'' or a
summary or reflection of the feelings behind her words.
</P>
<P>
   This approach accomplishes several things. It shows your child
that she and her concerns are important to you, it validates her
feelings and it helps her relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can stop trying to explain,'' Mazlish says, ``and be
consoled by the fact that you understand.''
</P>
<P>
   With that knowledge, the child is now free to let the emotion
go, or to think of a solution on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that acknowledging your child's feelings doesn't
mean allowing his heated emotions free rein. You can validate his
feelings while still setting limits.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is preparing to haul off and whack his brother, for
example, say ``You are so mad at your brother you'd like to hit
him. But now use words, not actions.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach won't always calm a distraught child. Sometimes,
he will actually become more willful.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such a case, you'll have to get firmer and deal with any
unacceptable behavior,'' says Dr. Emanuel Elfenbein, a
child-and-adolescent psychiatrist in Caldwell, N.J.. ``But an
empathetic response is a good first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest moments are when your child tells you
something that makes you angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come down hard on the child, she might withdraw,''
Mazlish says. ``She may be hesitant to come to you in the future
when she has a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're too angry to respond without criticizing or being
judgmental, take a break and cool off. At a later time, follow up
and express your concerns.
 &UR; MAKE TIME TO LISTEN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It helps to have a regular time and place set aside for family
members to express their feelings. For instance, you can encourage
conversation at mealtime or before bed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Monica Goble, a pediatric cardiologist in East Lansing,
Mich., gathers her two boys for a quick 10 minutes on the couch
when she gets home from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My inclination is to walk in and put something in the
microwave for dinner first thing,'' she says. ``But it works better
to give the boys my attention right off the bat so they can tell me
anything that's on their minds. They seem calmer after that, and
the whole evening goes better.''
</P>
<P>
   Many kids find it easiest to open up in informal settings,
rather than face-to-face talks. Walking the dog or reading together
offers a relaxed intimacy that breeds conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea, when you have several children, to create
one-on-one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be especially helpful with a child who is hard to
draw out, since he'll know it is his special time to be heard,''
Mazlish says.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, of course, your best intentions may backfire, and you
won't be able to resist judging or offering a well-meant but
ill-conceived bit of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Mazlish says. ``Aim for good listening 70 percent
of the time, keeping in mind that, on some days, 10 percent will be
all you can manage.''
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that you continue to make an effort to
tune in to your child. That will pave the way for a lifetime of
better communication between you.

 &HT;    Consumer Watch: Don't get taken for a ride by `dream vacation'
scams
 &HT;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us know there's ``no such thing as a free
lunch'' _ but many people don't understand that usually there's
``no such thing as a free vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel-related fraud costs consumers about $12 billion annually,
according to the Federal Trade Commission, which reports that
complaints about such fraud rank among the top five highest it
receives annually.
</P>
<P>
   The travel tricksters prey on unwary consumers year-round, but
summer is their prime time for operation -- and the FTC recently
issued a new warning about misleading offers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to underline its warning, the FTC last week alleged
that two Pennsylvania-based firms -- Commonwealth Marketing Group
and Great Escape Vacations &AMP; Tours -- were running a telemarketing
travel scam with victims throughout the nation. A federal court has
frozen the assets of the two firms and ceased their operations
pending trial or settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called dream vacations (promised by the two firms) were
a nightmare,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau
of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of consumers who thought they had qualified for a
discount vacation paid hundreds of dollars to collect, but they
didn't get what they paid for,'' she said. ``What were advertised
as `luxury cruises' were actually ferry boat rides, and the
`world-class hotels' were not. Instead of sailing into the sunset,
consumers were taken for a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC alleged that the firms targeted consumers who had been
enticed at local fairs and other public events to ``register'' for
a vacation to Florida and the Bahamas. Most people who registered
thought they were entering a drawing to win a luxury vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But they had not. Instead, they were contacted by telemarketers
-- and sometimes by mail -- and told there would be a fee, usually
$598, to register for the vacation, which supposedly was worth much
more. They were told the vacation was a limited-time offer and were
urged to pay quickly, the FTC alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Those who paid were sent a package of information, when they
learned they would have to pay several more hundred dollars in
``port reservation processing fees'' -- and the ``luxury cruise''
was only a five-to-six-hour ferry boat ride to the Bahamas and
back.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also alleges that consumers who sought refunds were
usually denied.
</P>
<P>
   Travel fraud is on old problem, and one day you likely will be
targeted as a potential victim. But to protect yourself takes only
caution and common sense:
</P>
<P>
   -- Buy vacations from a business you know. Deal with members of
a professional association such as the American Society of Travel
Agents, the National Tour Association and the U.S. Tour Operators
Association.
</P>
<P>
   -- If contacted by phone or mail, be wary if the names of the
seller and travel provider differ. You may be dealing with a
marketer who has no further responsibility to you after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   -- Learn the language. ``You have been specially selected to
receive our spectacular luxury vacation offer'' doesn't mean you
have won a free vacation. It means you will be offered an
opportunity to pay for a vacation that probably won't fit your
definition of luxury.
</P>
<P>
   -- Get the details of your vacation in writing and a copy of the
cancellation and refund policies before paying. Determine exactly
what the price covers and what it doesn't. Don't accept such vague
terms as ``major hotels'' or ``luxury cruises.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't be pressured into buying. Scam operators often say they
need your commitment today, but a good offer by a legitimate
company today usually will be a good offer tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't give your credit card number or bank information over
the phone unless you know the company. Sometimes fraudulent
telemarketers say they need the number for verification purposes,
but don't believe them.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you have determined the offer is legitimate, it's
usually better to pay by credit card. That way, if you later
encounter problems, you may dispute the charges by writing to your
credit card issuer. You have up to 60 days after the bill's
statement date to dispute the charge.
</P>
<P>
   But look out for travel promoters who say you have to wait at
least 60 days after paying by credit card to make reservations.
They are scheming to get you past the time you may legally
challenge the charge.

 &HT;    Engineering graduates are shown the money
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wonder why those new college graduates with
engineering degrees are smiling? Because they are being offered big
bucks by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Jobtrak Corp., which operates an online job-listing site that
links employers, universities and students, said a May survey of
selected schools nationwide found that engineering graduates were
being offered an average starting salary of $58,513, the highest of
24 careers measured by the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based firm, online at www.jobtrak.com, said all
college graduates are reaping the benefits of the expanding
economy, with 21 percent more job openings posted last month than a
year ago. The average starting salary for all 24 careers was
$46,757.
</P>
<P>
   Jobtrak, which began operations in 1987, makes monthly surveys
of job postings and hiring trends to determine which college
graduates are most in demand by employers. The May survey is the
first to measure starting salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to May last year, the demand for education graduates
was up 147 percent, the most of any career, but the average
starting salary of $33,038 was well below the average.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest-paid career was ``parks and recreation'' graduates.
They may enjoy the outdoors but, with an average starting salary of
$17,000, they won't have much more to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Jobtrak's network includes more than 750 universities or other
institutions of higher learning, but it did not say how many
schools were involved in the survey.

 &HT;    Money Talk: Start young and retire comfy
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can you ever afford to retire?
</P>
<P>
   More and more people are worrying about just that question. One
out of three working people think the answer is no. Their edginess
came to mind last week, as President Clinton, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich (R-Ga.) and more than 200 other top-drawer politicians and
money managers came together in Washington to encourage Americans
to save more for their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   They grabbed headlines grappling with familiar demons: America's
low savings rate, 3.9 percent last year, and Social Security
worries, among them. All in all, the talk probably left a lot of
people feeling even more uncertain about their chances of enjoying
a comfortable retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is important to remember a couple of things:
</P>
<P>
   -- Most people can work out an estimate of how much they'll need
to save toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
   -- Most people can, without overwhelming strain, build a nest
egg for themselves. It helps if you start young, and it helps to
keep saving something from every paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   This is not rocket science. Think of it as assembling a model
airplane -- exacting, perhaps tedious. But at least the process
gives you an idea of what the picture really looks like.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring what you need
</P>
<P>
   There is no universal rule for how much to save. The old saw
about saving 10 percent of your take-home pay might be a comfort,
but it might be wrong for you. ``That's why people really should
invest a little time, doing their calculations themselves,'' said
Paul Yakoboski, a senior research associate for the Employee
Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   We have an advantage these days -- the Internet. You can find
plenty of interactive worksheets from various financial advisers.
Some of them are terribly misleading, however. I recommend the one
supplied by Vanguard (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .vanguard.com).
</P>
<P>
   Any good worksheet will walk you through a fairly detailed set
of questions, including your age, planned retirement date, income,
expected Social Security income, any pension you anticipate and
savings, both current and future.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that and other data will come from your records. Some of
it will be no more than estimates. For a projection of Social
Security income, call 800-772-1213. If you expect a pension, go to
the office that handles pensions and ask for an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Saving the bucks
</P>
<P>
   Most people can build a significant nest egg, judging by data in
the Retirement Confidence Survey, which was released last week by
Yakoboski's institute and other agencies. Among other findings, the
study showed 56 percent of Americans believe they can put aside $20
a week for retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   If you start young, invest that amount for 30 years and earn an
8 percent return, you would have more than $127,000. If you got a
bit more ambitious -- assuming you get regular pay raises and
increase your savings by $5 a week each year -- your 30-year
savings plan would grow to more than $419,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you didn't put the money into a tax-deferred account,
such as an IRA, you could still make a respectable amount. Not
$419,000 but about $282,000.
</P>
<P>
   If you took out only 5 percent of that to boost your retirement
income, you would have an extra $14,000. The rest would remain
invested, and still grow for you.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that paying for retirement is a snap? No. Are the
steps mentioned here a sure thing? No. But are they better than
giving in to frustration or despair? Yes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chowing down on a clove of garlic may not be the best thing in
the world for your romantic life, but it may just be the best thing
you can do for your body.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic, that pungent little bulb with the shriveled-onion look,
is in the process of taking a giant leap from its status as a mere
cooking ingredient to newfound glory as a top seller on health-food
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't even smell anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic's higher profile has come about as a result of a
multitude of recent scientific studies, all of which seem to
indicate that garlic may be one of the healthiest substances you
can put into your body. The research into garlic's chemistry and
specific disease-preventive actions has already made it a niche
cure-all, and is rapidly driving it into the health mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, garlic is no herb-come-lately. It has a long history
of medicinal use, dating back to the Babylonians and Egyptians, the
latter of whom sealed it in their tombs. Greek athletes at the
original Olympic games chewed it for stamina, and its curative
effects were recommended by no less an authority than Hippocrates,
the Father of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the great French scientist Louis Pasteur
recognized its anti-bacterial properties, and in the First World
War ointments made from garlic were used to treat infection in
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic belongs to a family of sulfur-containing plants that also
includes onions. Now studies at leading medical institutions
worldwide are increasingly suggesting its effectiveness against
human maladies ranging from heart disease to cancer, from
infections to toxic stress.
</P>
<P>
   The first scientific clue to garlic's beneficial effects came
from a study of the vegetarian diet of the Jain sect in India.
Members of that community, who consume liberal amounts of onions
and garlic, were shown to have cholesterol levels 25 percent lower
than the general population.
</P>
<P>
   In another controlled study, reported in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition, a group of 41 men with moderately elevated
cholesterol showed a 6-percent drop in total cholesterol levels,
including a 4.6-percent drop in LDL or ``bad'' cholesterol, when
they ate garlic regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Additional studies suggest that several compounds in garlic _
allicin, ajoene and diallyl disulfide _ inhibit the chemical
pathways by which the body manufactures its own cholesterol, the
main source of the artery-clogging plaque that brings on heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian research team discovered the effectiveness of a
garlic extract in lowering fibrinogen in the blood, which is the
substance that causes clotting. This blood-thinning quality was
also observed by another group of researchers in Hamburg, Germany,
suggesting that garlic may be at least as effective as aspirin for
keeping heart attacks at bay, without causing the stomach distress
often associated with aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-cancer properties of this odiferous herb were first
documented by a research team in China, which studied the
populations of two neighboring counties, in one of which garlic was
a staple while in the other it was rarely used, and discovered a
dramatically lower incidence of cancer in the former.
</P>
<P>
   This led investigators at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Texas to inject cancer cells into rats in two groups, one of which
had been given cells previously incubated with various garlic
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered that the cells incubated with garlic failed to
produce tumors, while the untreated ones soon killed the animals.
These findings have been duplicated in subsequent studies at Penn
State University.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of garlic's high standing in folk medicine rests on
its reputation as a natural antibiotic, able to overcome an array
of infections.
</P>
<P>
   This apparently works in two ways: In some situations the garlic
kills the microbes directly, while in others it enhances the body's
natural defenses to boost the ability of immune cells to engulf and
destroy the germ cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Lau of Loma Linda University in California has
demonstrated its effectiveness against microbes causing vaginal
yeast infections.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, studies done at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle have revealed that when garlic extract is placed
in a culture dish of H. pylori, the bacteria responsible for
stomach ulcers, it severely inhibits the bacteria's growth.
</P>
<P>
   These results have led scientists to conclude that consuming
garlic might be an easy, inexpensive way to reduce the incidence of
stomach cancer, especially in the light of the growing problem of
antibiotic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another beneficial aspect of this long-used but
often-overlooked herb is its enhancement of liver function.
</P>
<P>
   Our bodies are bombarded daily by a welter of environmental
hazards, from pollutants to pesticides. Not the least of garlic's
contribution may be its ability to shore up our detoxifying
defenses, especially in the liver. Evidence shows that garlic not
only boosts overall liver function but also enhances the production
of key detoxifying agents in the body.
</P>
<P>
   And so the litany of praise for this unpretentious herb
continues, as research teams almost daily explore new possibilities
for human benefit. Whether it's heart disease, cancer, infections
or toxic stress, chewing some garlic each day may be part of the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   A clove or two a day should do it _ but to avoid any romantic
complications, you may want to try a couple of 300-to-400-milligram
tablets or capsules, which are generally odor-free.
</P>

BUSH WARNS DROUGHT PUTTING TEXAS IN RISK OF FIRES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With Texas suffering through one of its driest
springs ever, much of the state is in ``imminent risk'' of fires,
Gov. George W. Bush warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush asked President Clinton for an emergency declaration to
transfer U.S. Forest Service firefighters and equipment into Texas
as a precaution against the tinderbox conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other state officials also asked Texans to
conserve water and urged local officials to consider outdoor
burning bans and restrictions on water use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is already dry, and we face a long hot summer,'' Bush
said. ``Already in early June we are seeing August-like conditions
with the bulk of the summer still ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Millwee, the state's emergency management coordinator, said
the spring drought was ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the month of May, it was virtually a record in terms of
dryness around the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said 80 percent of the state is in drought and
``severe'' fire danger. Agricultural producers may suffer millions
of dollars in drought-related losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's emergency proclamation for federal fire-fighting
assistance included 207 of the state's 254 counties, every area of
the state except north central and northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The federal help, he said, would ``put equipment in place to
help save lives and property.''
</P>
<P>
   Two major wildfires already have erupted in West Texas this
spring, consuming thousands of acres in Presidio and Edwards
counties before they were extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Texas officials are keeping an eye on a forest fire in
Tamaulipas, a Mexican state on the Texas border. Except for smoke
that may drift north, that fire doesn't pose an imminent threat to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Texas already has suffered on and off for several weeks
from smoke from fires in drought-plagued southern Mexico and
Central America. That smoke has prompted state officials to issue
health alerts, especially for people with respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texas counties report rain shortfalls of 78 percent or more
this spring, according to the governor's office. Bush said San
Antonio saw its driest April on record.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Rio Grande Valley received only 17 percent of its
normal rainfall for March, April and May, potentially costing an
estimated $97 million in losses to cotton, corn and sorghum crops.
Several irrigation districts in the Valley face the possibility of
extreme water shortages in the next several months, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said water supplies in most parts of the state are at
normal levels now and are in much better shape than they were
during the 1996 drought. But, he cautioned, the lack of rainfall
means reservoirs are not being replenished, with the hottest and
traditionally driest part of the summer still to come.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 counties already have banned outdoor fires, and
Bush urged local officials to be cautious in allowing fireworks
displays for the July 4 holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Texans were urged to take shorter showers, turn off water while
brushing teeth and install low-flow plumbing hardware. They also
were advised to water lawns in the early morning and use drip
irrigation for shrubs and flower beds.

SKY DAYTON PUSHES THE RIGHT BUTTONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sky Dayton bounds up to meet you with the
friendly, open face of a puppy dog. He wears a cable-knit pullover
and chinos draped over a lean frame, and a beard that just isn't
filling in the way beards are supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   He's also got a big smile on his face. He should.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company he founded three years ago, EarthLink Network Inc.
in Pasadena, recently signed up its 500,000th customer, making it
the fourth-largest Internet service provider, behind America
Online, the Microsoft Network and AT&AMP;T. That's fast company.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Friday, Dayton's company took over Sprint Corp.'s 130,000
Internet customers. The $15 billion long-distance giant gets 30
percent of EarthLink, but also gives EarthLink $24 million in cash,
a $100 million credit line and marketing muscle most young Internet
companies dream about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dayton's company reported record 1997 revenues of about $80
million, more than double 1996. And wonder of Internet wonders,
analysts say his company should end this year in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and one other thing. Dayton is 26 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea how fast his company has grown, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's personal office in its two-building headquarters takes
up more room than his entire company did when it started three
years in a Los Feliz medical building.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Dayton had to scrape together every spare dime for a
party celebrating the company's 600th customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big goal for us back then,'' Dayton said. ``Now we
sign up 600 people in four hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been amazing. It's a great feeling,'' Dayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was raised mostly in Los Angeles, though he lived for a
time in Northern California with his grandfather, a tech whiz who
served a prestigious stint as an IBM Fellow.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to his grandfather's Big Blue influence, Dayton
got into computers early, tinkering with a Timex Sinclair, one of
the earliest home PCs, at age 9. By his early 20s, Dayton decided
to try the Internet. But getting wired proved excruciating, even
for a wirehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was utter hell,'' Dayton said. ``I got no sleep, I didn't
go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending 80 hair-pulling hours trying to hook up, Dayton
decided to start his own Internet company, focused on helping
people become Netheads without Netheadaches.
</P>
<P>
   His company emphasized customer service at a time when most
competitors didn't. That emphasis continues, with more than half
the company's 1,000 employees working in tech support and customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   The company put together a software package called Total Access
that installs Netscape Navigator and other programs, then walks a
new customer through the connection process.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers can create a customized ``start page'' on their Web
browser that includes news headlines in areas of interest, local
weather forecasts, stock quotes and more.
</P>
<P>
   The company even has a ``guardian angel'' program watching for
the ``connected but confused,'' calling to see if they need help.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these programs they do are really unique,'' said David
Goodtree, director of telecom strategies at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``When's the last time the phone company called
you up and asked if everything was going all right?''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Sprint thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we linked up is we saw EarthLink being an
outstanding Internet service provider,'' said Sprint assistant vice
president Bill White. ``We saw we could grow much more rapidly by
partnering with them. They know the service well, have more scale
than we did, and there were a lot of opportunities for
cross-promotion and cross-marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal should help both sides, said Goodtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint spent a lot of money trying to launch an Internet
service and what they realized was they still didn't get it,'' said
Goodtree. ``EarthLink is known for great technical support and
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's top executive was equally admiring of Dayton, White
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman (and CEO) Bill Esrey is very impressed with him,''
White said. ``He's an entrepreneurial, energetic guy who knows what
he wants to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dayton's point of view, the Sprint deal is only the biggest
of dozens of partnerships _ ranging from movie companies to
publishers to discount stores to credit cards _ that have stretched
EarthLink's resources by piggybacking on others' money and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton vocabulary, partnering is a very big word,
encapsulated by his Dayton Theory of Internet Market Evolution.
Basically, Dayton says, smart companies focus on their business
niche, then find partners to do everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``By creating that model, I was able to figure out who the
partners and the competitors are,'' Dayton said. ``Then it was a
matter of convincing the right partners to do the right deals.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees Hollywood as a particularly fertile place for
partnering, going back to marketing deals with movies such as ``The
Net'' and ``Contact,'' part of Dayton's ``evangelizing'' of the
entertainment business the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   As Dayton looks toward the future, he believes his company, and
the Internet in general, are well positioned to become a
mass-market phenomenon, moving beyond the technically proficient to
a basic part of most American households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the Internet wasn't a consumer product,'' Dayton said.
``Now, it's a baseline communications tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications are particularly interesting for the
entertainment business, Dayton said, because increasingly, the
Internet will be the way its products _ video, music, publishing _
arrive in the American home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment business thrives on communication,'' Dayton
said. ``The Internet represents the best way to put more of their
product out there. We are the channel of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton has no plans to follow AOL and MSN into the content
creation business, however, saying EarthLink will continue do what
it does well and find more partners to do the entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we're so successful is that I'm so focused
and the company is so focused,'' Dayton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Dayton, that means his company must be able to grow as the
Internet grows. That means being able to delegate.
</P>
<P>
   As the company boomed, Dayton did something many entrepreneurs
don't. He brought in help, led by CEO Garry Betty, a veteran
telecommunications executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure I'm surrounded by good people,'' Dayton
said. ``I think we have the most talented CEO in the business. We
work great together.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty said Dayton was ``smart enough to say, `I need help.' He
said, `You're running the company,' and he never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's company still faces many challenges, including such
threats as cable companies that would provide Internet service with
cable modems, said Goodtree. But, ``there's plenty of room for
EarthLink. They're squarely focused and pretty much the cream of
the crop,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, who lives in Toluca Lake with his wife, Arwen, said he
feels confident about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a good position in the first leg of a long race,''
Dayton said. ``I think this can be a major, major communications
company.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To some extent, Sky Dayton's decision to bring in
Garry Betty as his company's CEO has provided useful insulation
from complaints about Dayton's own Scientology beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton said he used Scientology management tenets to structure
the company, but his managers ``are a very diverse group'' who
bring a variety of management skills to the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Dayton, who took management classes through Scientology's
Hubbard College of Management, also says the approaches he learned
there work well with the decentralized, nonhierarchical nature of
the Internet and successful companies in that business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tenets are pretty straightforward, and really were ahead
of their time,'' Dayton said. ``It pushes responsibility down to
the people who do the job. It's been very helpful for me and
allowed me to stay focused on my job.''

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Too few visionaries
planned for growth
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta's business leaders have long been
stereotyped as blue-blazered boosters, relentlessly bragging about
the area's growth during their Kiwanis Club meetings. In the 1980s,
one could scarcely read a national news story about Atlanta without
seeing a mocking reference to our dogged ``boosterism.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in the late 1990s, the optimists don't have to talk it up
any more. Turns out that metro Atlanta's growth has outstripped
even the rosiest predictions of the most gung-ho Rotarians. A few
years ago, business leaders here were willing to concede that after
the 1996 Olympics, the area's economy would slow a bit in 1997 and
1998. But instead of taking a breather, the economy has roared
toward hyperventilation.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on I-285 has gone from terrible to nightmarish to
suicidal. Georgia Power is struggling to churn out enough power to
keep air conditioners humming. The air is getting filthy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the North Georgia gold rush goes on. This is no
exaggeration: Metro Atlanta has the hottest housing market in the
region, which happens to be the fastest-growing region in the
country, which happens to have the strongest economy in the world.
In terms of growth, it really doesn't get any better than this.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like booster bullfeathers, take another look at
the statistics. Last week the Commerce Department reported that the
nation's sales of new homes surged to a record in April, climbing
5.2 percent to an unprecedented annual rate of 888,000, seasonally
adjusted. But that growth was extremely uneven: Sales declined in
every region except the South.
</P>
<P>
   And what an exception. The South's new-home sales shot up 18.1
percent. Within the region, metro Atlanta is even hotter. According
to statistics compiled by Property Data Systems for Northside
Realty Associates, housing starts rose 23 percent in the metro
area's northern arc during the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For many older Atlantans, this economic explosion brings a sense
of pride. After years of being labeled as bumpkins and boosters,
they are getting rich and having the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the daily hassles behind the growth statistics are getting
harder to handle. Everywhere in metro Atlanta, trees are being
turned into mulch as the bulldozers and chainsaws create room for
subdivisions and shopping centers. Red clay runs into streams and
brown haze hangs low.
</P>
<P>
   Last week brought more evidence of how good these times are in
terms of making money, and how bad they are in terms of protecting
air quality or reducing commute times. In Hall County, the planning
commission endorsed the construction of the Lake Lanier Country
Club, a 589-home gated community on the lake's far north side. The
homes will be priced from the mid-$200,000 to $2 million-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, the area north of Lake Lanier would have
regarded the opening of a live-bait shop as a step toward economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for Lake Lanier Country Club reflect the growing
wealth of metro Atlantans. You can't help but be happy to have
prosperous families moving into beautiful homes.
</P>
<P>
   But you also can't help but be horrified at the prospect of
another huge subdivision being created long before more sewers and
transportation systems are added to handle such rapid population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the 1980s, it was a lot easier to be a civic booster
than a thoughtful planner. Metro Atlanta was blessed with lots of
people willing to promote business. Unfortunately, it had too few
visionaries willing to plan the commuter rails, park systems, sewer
pipes and water lines that would have made the resulting growth
more enjoyable for everyone.

 &HT;    Town council claims ad restrictions hinder traffic
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH _ The mid-town public beach has no toilets; there's
no fishing after dark along the Intracoastal Waterway; and a
council member once suggested putting cameras on the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the town council has said its newest store, Neiman Marcus,
can't advertise off-island for a year after it opens.
</P>
<P>
   It's not snobbery, council members say, it's the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day and age died long ago,'' said Councilman Allen Wyett.
``No one has any reason to say anyone on this council is a snob.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising ban is apparently unique. First Amendment and
land use lawyers can't recall a similar condition elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   To get approval to build on Worth Avenue, the Dallas retailer
agreed not to advertise on television, radio, in The Palm Beach
Post or the Sun-Sentinel, or by mass mailing outside the Palm Beach
zip code for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The council and Neiman will consider a written agreement
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those classic `only in Palm Beach' concepts,''
said Boca Raton attorney Robert Rivas, who handles First Amendment
issues. He said it would likely be unconstitutional if the town
were to try to impose such a condition on other stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worrying about the traffic and this will help
reassure them,'' Councilman Sam McLendon said. ``The store will be
a novelty the first year and we will probably get more traffic, but
then it will quiet down.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Leslie Shaw proposed the restriction, saying he
wanted to ensure that the exclusive retailer was genuinely aiming
for the Palm Beach market. He suggested the council consider a
similar policy for stores coming to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers may not like it but ``they could live with it,''
Chamber of Commerce President Jesse Newman said. ``For most stores
on (Worth) avenue, I don't think 5 percent advertise across the
county.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said stores should be able to advertise in the
off-season, between April and October, when traffic is lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the town has required stores and restaurants larger
than 2,000 square feet to prove that more than half their customers
are town residents, work in the town or are staying in island
hotels or homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely a concern about too much traffic,'' Wyett said.

 &HT;    Netw(at)atch: She doesn't log on, but 'McBealers' are Web-savvy
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The disturbing news hit the wires late last week. The
24- to 39-year-old age group once dubbed Generation X by author
Douglas Coupland has been renamed by telecommunications company
MCI. MCI has chosen to dub them ``The Ally McBealers'' after the
lovable but neurotic TV lawyer noted for hyper-short skirts and
fantasies about her ex-boyfriend and dancing babies.
</P>
<P>
   Ally McBealers, in their viewing of the Fox show ``Ally
McBeal,'' might have noticed Ally is never shown using a computer.
She's got a laptop, but in all probability she probably spilled
cappuccino on the keyboard one day and now she gets the message
``keyboard error'' every time she tries to log on.
</P>
<P>
   But Ally aside, according to MCI, the McBealers are the most
Web-savvy of any age group. But what Web sites do they have
bookmarked? Here are some likely candidates:
</P>
<P>
   If asked, McBealers would probably say they only read Salon
(http://www .salonmagazine.com) and The New York Times
(http://www.nytimes .com). But in truth, every McBealer worth his
or her salt has surely checked out the online e-zine Swoon
(http://www.swoon.com). The online home of such Conde Nast
magazines as Details, Glamour and Mademoiselle, the site bills
itself as the magazine of ``dating, mating and relating.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, one can peruse items such as Mademoiselle's self-discovery
test called ``What's Your True Passion?'' or the Details article
``One Man. Five Ex-Girlfriends. You Do the Math.'' There's also a
personals section so McBealers can all get over their latest failed
relationship and dive headlong into another one.
</P>
<P>
   And to help McBealers on their way to another iffy relationship
is Match.com (http://www.match.com).The San Francisco-based Web
site is one of the best, least predatory, dating Web sites out
there. For two weeks, it's possible to test the service and search
for suitable mates based on a set of criteria the user selects,
including age, location, religion and even weight. Match.com
doesn't use real names, and the service employs an anonymous
remailer so if there are any psychos lurking on the service,
they'll never be able to find their way to your door.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who watches ``Ally McBeal'' knows, Ally never goes
right home after work. She goes with all her co-workers to the same
bar, night after night, week after week. Most McBealers need a
little more variety than that in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For this, there are a variety of entertainment sites this group
can visit to find out what's happening in their little chunk of the
universe. Since Ally lives in Boston, she might check out Boston
Sidewalk (http://boston.sidewalk.com), the Microsoft-run arts and
entertainment Web site with dining, drinking and entertainment
tips. Sidewalk has sites for most major cities, but some cities
have their own locally grown entertainment directories such as
Access Atlanta (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/entertaiment/index.htm), which can send
Atlanta's McBealers on their way to dining, music and movie
nirvana, with content from various partners including The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some McBealers may have absolutely no idea -- strange as it may
sound -- who in the world Ally McBeal is. If you're wondering what
exactly you've been named after, visit the official McBeal home
page at http://www.foxworld.com/ally. And for those of you who are
hooked, there is always the ultimate Ally McBeal fan page at
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/2927/faq.html.

   LOS ANGELES _ If you're tired of paying $7 to see ``Titanic'' _
and Leo _ for the sixth, seven, eighth time, be of good cheer.
James Cameron's ubiquitous love story will dock in video stores and
retail outlets Sept. 1 with the consumer-friendly price tag of
$19.95.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is nearing the $600 million mark at the box
office, will be available initially only on VHS cassette in both
pan-and-scan and wide-screen formats. A Spanish subtitled version
of the film will also be sold.
</P>
<P>
   No plans have been made for a DVD release. Likewise, the
much-rumored longer ``director's cut'' version of the film seems to
be more myth than fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the director's cut,'' Cameron said of the 194-minute
version of the film that has been playing in theaters since
December.

   One news outlet reported that Cameron is working on a five-hour
version of the film, but Cameron said that was news to him.

 &HT;    Booksellers gird for continue war with chains
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Abe Zimmerman had not been to a trade show in years,
and never to one for booksellers. But as the new president of Book
People, he flew to Chicago for a quick, total immersion at Book
Expo.
</P>
<P>
   He took along experienced guides: the Austin store's buying
director Tracey Tarlton and marketing manager David Hutts, a
veteran of the Book Expos that serve as the American Bookseller
Association's annual conventions. By Saturday night Zimmerman was
eating dinner with author Tim O'Brien, swapping golf stories and
talking about store events. But he found the atmosphere at the
convention perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that's changing dramatically right now,''
Zimmerman said, ``and I'm not so sure how many people know what's
going on and how to react.'' A businessman who helped start Katz's
Delicatessen and was part of a hi-tech start-up company called
Technology Works, he said he found the energy at Book Expo less
than dynamic. ``I felt like these were people who weren't in
control of their fate any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers face tough times. Those who have lasted
through changes in the business continue to quietly look for ways
to do better and more efficiently what they have a reputation for
doing: providing personal service. ``I did feel everyone
understands the importance of independent stores,'' Zimmerman said.
``As an independent, I felt well received (by publishers).''
</P>
<P>
   Last year several top publishing houses, including Random House,
skipped the convention because of tensions with the ABA, which had
sued them for making discount deals with chains. This year most
large publishers came back, though in reduced numbers, and used
less exhibit space. The convention attracted 1,500 exhibitors, with
400 authors promoting their books.
</P>
<P>
   In this era when a recent newsletter from the famed Tattered
Cover bookstore in Denver warned that the big chains are ringing
the independents with stores, attempting to squeeze them out, and
when books are sold at Randalls and Sam's, not to mention on the
Internet, Austin independents face a clear challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer purchasing report released by the Book Industry Study
Group shows that independent booksellers experienced a 1.4 percent
market-share decline last year, down to 17 percent of the books
purchased. Chains accounted for 25 percent. Most books are now sold
in nontraditional outlets _ everywhere from car washes to discount
stores _ or through book clubs and electronic bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for independent bookstores to have a
distinctive flavor and still cover the bases,'' said Tarlton, ``to
also carry the bestsellers people expect to see.'' She spent much
of her time gathering galleys from better smaller presses.
</P>
<P>
   At Toad Hall, children's events including author readings and
special lunches have been a priority to bring customers to the
Austin store, which is owned by Barbara Bonds Thomas, outgoing
president of the ABA. This year the store was singled out at Book
Expo and awarded the Pannell Award for innovative children's
events.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, independent booksellers appear to be facing the
reality that increased service _ the more specific the better _ is
their best chance of keeping customers at a time when sales have
been disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost
half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed. Sales
were flat last year and consumer spending on adult fiction and
non-fiction increased by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An independent bookseller manager in Missouri said that she
realized that with 55 churches in her area the residents had a deep
interest in religion. She came to the convention to check out
religious titles. ``Our customers still don't trust the Internet to
send them books,'' the bookseller said. ``They'll come into the
store with a list they've printed off Amazon.com and want us to get
the books for them.'' Now she is looking at a process introduced at
the convention by Ingram Distributors called Lightning Print. It
allows books to be stored digitally and printed one at a time on
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Although conglomerates increasingly control publishing, there is
still room for specialized service, and individual stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bookstore that's enthusiastic can make a book of poetry,''
said Michael Wiegers, managing editor of the award-winning Copper
Canyon Press in Port Townsend, Wash., though he says such a store
might be part of a chain or an independent.
</P>
<P>
   The bookseller of the year for the African American booksellers'
group, Blackboard, Michele Lewis of New Orleans started a store in
her mid-20s. She has seen her business grow in a few years to a
second store and stresses personal service to a niche market.
Accepting the award, she thanked God, her mother, and her family
and friends for allowing the business to grow. Emma Rodgers, owner
of Black Images in Dallas and a director of the ABA, said an
African American Booksellers school held in Chicago before Book
Expo was well attended.

   During the convention, the sale of Random House to the
Bertelsmann German conglomerate was confirmed and many sellers saw
that as bad news. Avin Domnitz, executor director of the ABA, said:
``Consolidation of books and publishers has never worked to the
advantage of the independent.'' Increasingly, the booksellers
association is involved in litigation as independents fight back
any way they can against changes they see as threatening their
survival in the industry. A suit by the ABA accusing Borders and
Barnes &AMP; Noble of antitrust violations is still awaiting a formal
response. ``We're still in the early stages (of litigation),'' he
said. Though they may be tired from fighting for economic survival,
the booksellers showed their trademark idealism. They rallied
around Bill Kramer, whose Washington, D.C., bookstore refused to
hand over the bookbuying records of former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky to independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Said ABA
board member Oren Teicher: ``There's no more important issue than
that information about books they have purchased is personal and
confidential.'' Booksellers have long seen themselves as involved
in a marketplace of ideas and, as such, different from the owners
of hardware and drugstores. The Kramer case gives them an
opportunity to cling to that while all around them appears to be
changing.

   BEANIE-HEIST _ RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ When the van arrived at the
McDonald's at 4132 Blue Heron Blvd., word spread quickly among
employees that it carried two boxes of Zip the Cat Teenie Beanie
Babies _ 600 in all. But when managers opened up the van, they
discovered the plush collectibles were gone, Detective Pat Galligan
said. Consequently, an 18-year-old McDonald's employee lost her job

 &HT;    COLUMN: Can fraternal piety overcome team politics?
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to wonder how today's conversation between big brother
Bryan Murray and little brother Terry Murray is going to go, don't
you?
</P>
<P>
   Bryan is the Florida Panthers' general manager and one of the
people in charge of hiring a new head coach. Terry is a candidate
for the job, and he's in Ratville _ hey, Detroit already has
Hockeytown _ for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The former head coach? That would be Bryan, who last season
fired Doug MacLean and replaced him with his own self. When that
happened, Terry called Bryan with a question: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Bryan who will have a few of his own questions for
Terry. Foremost among them is sure to be an inquiry about what
Terry thinks he'll be able to do to begin resurrection of a
moribund team only a couple of seasons removed from an appearance
in the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say there's more than a little pressure on Bryan to
get the right man behind the Panthers' bench in the wake of the
franchise's precipitous fall from excellence. And let's just say
it's not automatic that Terry will _ or will not _ be that man.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, of course, knows better than to give his brother the
position on the strength of their shared surname. He'd never do
such a thing. But he also knows it would be unfair to remove his
brother from consideration just because of that shared surname.
</P>
<P>
   So, Bryan, would it be easier to hire Terry or not hire him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can answer that,'' Bryan said. ``We
understand the situation. I'm not sure our families do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's wife, Geri, and Terry'snd of ``Alanna'' collecting
objects and solving riddles to get past gateways, boulders and
rivers. (The answers to the first puzzle are on the site now, for
example.)
</P>
<P>
   Marketing on the Web isn't easy. But Coca-Cola's clever Web
promotions make it one of the smartest Web marketers arounustomers
a reason to come back.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands this as well as Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran says the bulk of his consumers are young and spend a
lot of time on the Net and playing computer games. ``We thought,
`How can we tie in the fact that a lot of teens are playing
computer games and drinking Coke?'''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Coke promotions especially unusual is that they
are not designed to be Web staples. They are used on an ``as
needed'' basis for seasonal promotions tied into its traditional ad
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola says the Cherry Coke promotion and the ``Alanna'' game
will run at least through November, with new clues and information.
</P>
<P>
   All this interactivity is designed to leave game players and
their friends with the impression Cherry Coke is a hip, cutting
edge product.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coca-Cola is mindful of its young target audience,
``Alanna'' is not a bloody shoot-'em-up game but a lush, quiet
``Myst''-like game with an educational component designed to help
players win the game.
</P>
<P>
   To add a touch of realism, the company also enlisted the help of
an Emory University professor who created the fictional Standlake
University of Cultural Anthropology Web site. Once there, you must
read through each page of that site to find out about topics such
as cuneiform symbols and ancient Babylonia _ just a way to add an
educational component to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely put an educational slant to the game,'' Halloran
says. ``We want to educate our teen customers. A lot of the clues
on the game site are based on ancient cultures. It's kind of a
study of archaeology.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no official list of hints or clues to help users solve
the puzzle. Folks intent on winning must keep visiting the site or
checking out different bottles of Cherry Coke. They can also check
out Coke and gaming Usenet newsgroups to swap clues and information
with other game players.
</P>
<P>
   A recent check of newsgroups shows several postings to
``comp.sys.ibm.pc.games'' and ``alt.food.cocacola'' talking about
the game and swapping tips and hints. Halloran calls this
world-of-mouth buzz ``viral marketing'' since he hopes it'll spread
that way. ``We're hoping there will be online chat and posts,'' he
says. ``We're hoping people will interact with the brand and each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   The promotion appears to be an expensive proposition, but
Coca-Cola won't say just how expensive it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we really didn't want to go down the route of a
traditional soft drink promotion,'' Halloran said. ``We think the
bang for the buck using the Internet and gaming is going to be
substantial for this particular brand.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no print ads, nor are there CD-ROMs available at any
Coke point of sale. The company is relying on word of mouth and the
Web to spread the word about Cherry Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``This promotion is very different,'' Halloran said. ``It will
require consumers to think and act differently. It's a way to show
off the new version of Cherry Coke and get them engaged with the
product by playing the game. We want to be seen as something very
different from Coca-Cola.

 By ZIA JAFFREY  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Wole Soyinka, the first African to win the Nobel Prize for
Literature, has been critical of Nigeria's home-grown dictators for
decades.
 &HT;    Arrested in 1965, Soyinka spent more than two years in prison,
largely in solitary confinement. He had tried to broker a
cease-fire deal between Nigeria's federal government and Biafran
rebels who wanted to secede from the country. His vitriolic memoir,
``The Man Died,'' was written between the lines of books smuggled
to him in prison.
 &HT;    Released in 1969, he entered a period of voluntary exile. He
lectured at universities, wrote, directed and produced plays in
Europe and West Africa, and founded the leading culture and
criticism magazine, Transition, in Ghana.
 &HT;    Soyinka returned to Nigeria in 1975, but left again temporarily,
in 1983, when he learned there was a price on his head.
 &HT;    Incarnations of his Guerrilla Theatre Unit, a production company
founded in 1978, have been performing for years to mass audiences
in Nigeria. Many skits have sharply rebuked Nigeria's military
regimes and policies and have been performed not only in
auditoriums but, provocatively, in front of government buildings or
in public squares and marketplaces where authorities have cracked
down.
 &HT;    In 1986 Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature. The Swedish
Academy cited his ``prolific store of words ... in witty dialogue,
in satire and grotesquery, in quiet poetry and in essays of
sparkling vitality.''
 &HT;    Soyinka has implored African writers to become the conscience of
their nation or be forced to withdraw ``to the position of
chronicler and postmortem surgeon.''
 &HT;    In 1996 Soyinka published ``The Open Sore of a Continent,''
which accuses the Nigerian military regime of having robbed the
people of their nationhood by annulling the presidential election
of June 12, 1993. On that day 14 million Nigerians had crossed
regional, class, religious and ethnic lines to freely elect as
president a civilian Muslim, Moshood K.O. Abiola. A year later,
Abiola was imprisoned on charges of treason after he declared
himself the rightful president of Nigeria.
 &HT;    The military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha seized power and would
become Nigeria's nemesis. Among Abacha's human-rights abuses, cited
by international watchdog groups, the most infamous was the hanging
of writer and political activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995, along with
eight other pro-democracy activists.
 &HT;    Other perversions of justice have included political detention,
extrajudicial executions, restrictions of freedom of expression and
association, meddling in the judicial process and torture.
 &HT;    Soyinka himself was charged with treason by the military regime
_ a capital offense. In exile since 1994, Soyinka has been
lecturing and writing in America and Europe _ most recently in
Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Atlanta
and Champaign, Ill.
 &HT;    
 -0- 
 &HT;    ZIA JAFFREY: Where were you when you received the news that the
Abacha regime had charged you with treason?
 &HT;    WOLE SOYINKA: I was lecturing in the United States. Somebody
tracked me down and asked about my recent ``promotion'' from being
a mere ``terrorist'' to being a ``treasonable felon.'' We knew it
was coming; we knew it was building up. They aim to eliminate the
opposition. This is just one more step in that direction. So it
didn't make any impact on me. It simply meant that I had to turn up
my security one notch.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I read in a London newspaper that you said there was an
Abacha death squad?
 &HT;    A: Yes. The death squad does exist. We know where they're
trained. We know where they're located, exactly in Abuja; we know
their modus operandi. So we're even able to know when some of them
are dispatched out of the country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Because you've infiltrated?
 &HT;    A: Let's just say that the opposition has a reasonable network _
obviously, it's not comprehensive _ but we have efficient
intelligence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: And the intelligence tells you that you're on the hit list?
 &HT;    A: Absolutely.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: In ``The Open Sore of a Continent,'' you suggested that the
next move for Nigeria's people would be civil disobedience.
 &HT;    A: Yes. Even while I was in Nigeria I was organizing a peaceful
march on Aso Rock (the seat of government) from every corner of the
country. ... I gave a press conference detailing the plans and
applying for torches, rations, blankets, halls, and schools along
the way where people would rest.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: For when was this planned?
 &HT;    A: Just about three months before I left. But I was summoned by
the SSS (State Security Services).
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What did they say?
 &HT;    A: Well, it was very polite, very courteous. The officer
apologized for not coming to my house to have the chat. He asked
how on earth did I think I could mount such an (opposition). ... I
said, ``... the people working with me are disciplined, and they
understand what's at stake. ...''
 &HT;    I think this frightened the regime very much. At the end, after
we'd gone through the whole thing he said, ``OK, thank you,
professor. Now I have a responsibility to tell you the decision of
the regime ... it considers itself bound to stop (your dissent) by
every means.'' ... Then arrests began. People were pulled in for
interrogation. Finally I had to accept the decision of the group
that I must leave.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Leave the group, or the country?
 &HT;    A: Leave the country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you still have family in Nigeria?
 &HT;    A: I had to go back and get them out. As hostage-taking became a
cardinal policy of the government, the assassinations of relations
and colleagues of dissidents who are out of reach began to become
the norm. I had to get three adult members of my family out. The
surveillance had become crippling, really suffocating.
 &HT;    This regime just does not believe in innocence. ... In prison
(they incarcerate) children. ... The ages of the children-hostages
vary from four to 12 in Nigeria. They are kept in police cells.
It's something we have never experienced before. Never. Never.
They've always left civilians alone.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Tell me about the attack in which the government fired on
secondary-school students.
 &HT;    A: Many people don't know ... Not many people believe that
Abacha would fire on students. But we know this.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What were they protesting?
 &HT;    A: A 500 percent hike in school fees.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: In which city?
 &HT;    A: Benin. In Edo. I think on the first day of action close to 20
were killed, and others died later. We were monitoring the death
toll. It just kept increasing. The last figure I received was 37.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Ken Saro-Wiwa was a friend of yours?
 &HT;    A: We weren't close or anything of the sort. His orbit was quite
different from mine, but I absolutely supported his cause.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why has Shell oil, even now, not cleared out of Nigeria?
 &HT;    A: Because they're confident of the protection of Nigeria's
regime. They signed a multibillion-dollar contract for a
liquefied-gas project. It was done secretly, but it came out, and
that is when I knew the company had cast its lot, irrevocably, on
the side of power. Everybody was calling for sanctions on Nigeria
and withdrawing business from the country and so on _ for Shell to
have signed that contract, nevertheless, shows that its commercial

 By ZIA JAFFREY  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Wole Soyinka, the first African to win the Nobel Prize for
Literature, has been critical of Nigeria's home-grown dictators for
decades.
 &HT;    Arrested in 1965, Soyinka spent more than two years in prison,
largely in solitary confinement. He had tried to broker a
cease-fire deal between Nigeria's federal government and Biafran
rebels who wanted to secede from the country. His vitriolic memoir,
``The Man Died,'' was written between the lines of books smuggled
to him in prison.
 &HT;    Released in 1969, he entered a period of voluntary exile. He
lectured at universities, wrote, directed and produced plays in
Europe and West Africa, and founded the leading culture and
criticism magazine, Transition, in Ghana.
 &HT;    Soyinka returned to Nigeria in 1975, but left again temporarily,
in 1983, when he learned there was a price on his head.
 &HT;    Incarnations of his Guerrilla Theatre Unit, a production company
founded in 1978, have been performing for years to mass audiences
in Nigeria. Many skits have sharply rebuked Nigeria's military
regimes and policies and have been performed not only in
auditoriums but, provocatively, in front of government buildings or
in public squares and marketplaces where authorities have cracked
down.
 &HT;    In 1986 Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature. The Swedish
Academy cited his ``prolific store of words ... in witty dialogue,
in satire and grotesquery, in quiet poetry and in essays of
sparkling vitality.''
 &HT;    Soyinka has implored African writers to become the conscience of
their nation or be forced to withdraw ``to the position of
chronicler and postmortem surgeon.''
 &HT;    In 1996 Soyinka published ``The Open Sore of a Continent,''
which accuses the Nigerian military regime of having robbed the
people of their nationhood by annulling the presidential election
of June 12, 1993. On that day 14 million Nigerians had crossed
regional, class, religious and ethnic lines to freely elect as
president a civilian Muslim, Moshood K.O. Abiola. A year later,
Abiola was imprisoned on charges of treason after he declared
himself the rightful president of Nigeria.
 &HT;    The military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha seized power and would
become Nigeria's nemesis. Among Abacha's human-rights abuses, cited
by international watchdog groups, the most infamous was the hanging
of writer and political activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995, along with
eight other pro-democracy activists.
 &HT;    Other perversions of justice have included political detention,
extrajudicial executions, restrictions of freedom of expression and
association, meddling in the judicial process and torture.
 &HT;    Soyinka himself was charged with treason by the military regime
_ a capital offense. In exile since 1994, Soyinka has been
lecturing and writing in America and Europe _ most recently in
Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Atlanta
and Champaign, Ill.
 &HT;    
 -0- 
 &HT;    ZIA JAFFREY: Where were you when you received the news that the
Abacha regime had charged you with treason?
 &HT;    WOLE SOYINKA: I was lecturing in the United States. Somebody
tracked me down and asked about my recent ``promotion'' from being
a mere ``terrorist'' to being a ``treasonable felon.'' We knew it
was coming; we knew it was building up. They aim to eliminate the
opposition. This is just one more step in that direction. So it
didn't make any impact on me. It simply meant that I had to turn up
my security one notch.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I read in a London newspaper that you said there was an
Abacha death squad?
 &HT;    A: Yes. The death squad does exist. We know where they're
trained. We know where they're located, exactly in Abuja; we know
their modus operandi. So we're even able to know when some of them
are dispatched out of the country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Because you've infiltrated?
 &HT;    A: Let's just say that the opposition has a reasonable network _
obviously, it's not comprehensive _ but we have efficient
intelligence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: And the intelligence tells you that you're on the hit list?
 &HT;    A: Absolutely.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: In ``The Open Sore of a Continent,'' you suggested that the
next move for Nigeria's people would be civil disobedience.
 &HT;    A: Yes. Even while I was in Nigeria I was organizing a peaceful
march on Aso Rock (the seat of government) from every corner of the
country. ... I gave a press conference detailing the plans and
applying for torches, rations, blankets, halls, and schools along
the way where people would rest.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: For when was this planned?
 &HT;    A: Just about three months before I left. But I was summoned by
the SSS (State Security Services).
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What did they say?
 &HT;    A: Well, it was very polite, very courteous. The officer
apologized for not coming to my house to have the chat. He asked
how on earth did I think I could mount such an (opposition). ... I
said, ``... the people working with me are disciplined, and they
understand what's at stake. ...''
 &HT;    I think this frightened the regime very much. At the end, after
we'd gone through the whole thing he said, ``OK, thank you,
professor. Now I have a responsibility to tell you the decision of
the regime ... it considers itself bound to stop (your dissent) by
every means.'' ... Then arrests began. People were pulled in for
interrogation. Finally I had to accept the decision of the group
that I must leave.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Leave the group, or the country?
 &HT;    A: Leave the country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you still have family in Nigeria?
 &HT;    A: I had to go back and get them out. As hostage-taking became a
cardinal policy of the government, the assassinations of relations
and colleagues of dissidents who are out of reach began to become
the norm. I had to get three adult members of my family out. The
surveillance had become crippling, really suffocating.
 &HT;    This regime just does not believe in innocence. ... In prison
(they incarcerate) children. ... The ages of the children-hostages
vary from four to 12 in Nigeria. They are kept in police cells.
It's something we have never experienced before. Never. Never.
They've always left civilians alone.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Tell me about the attack in which the government fired on
secondary-school students.
 &HT;    A: Many people don't know ... Not many people believe that
Abacha would fire on students. But we know this.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What were they protesting?
 &HT;    A: A 500 percent hike in school fees.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: In which city?
 &HT;    A: Benin. In Edo. I think on the first day of action close to 20
were killed, and others died later. We were monitoring the death
toll. It just kept increasing. The last figure I received was 37.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Ken Saro-Wiwa was a friend of yours?
 &HT;    A: We weren't close or anything of the sort. His orbit was quite
different from mine, but I absolutely supported his cause.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why has Shell oil, even now, not cleared out of Nigeria?
 &HT;    A: Because they're confident of the protection of Nigeria's
regime. They signed a multibillion-dollar contract for a
liquefied-gas project. It was done secretly, but it came out, and
that is when I knew the company had cast its lot, irrevocably, on
the side of power. Everybody was calling for sanctions on Nigeria
and withdrawing business from the country and so on _ for Shell to
have signed that contract, nevertheless, shows that its commercial
interests preceded its humanism.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Where is home for you, at this point?
 &HT;    A: In my head, that's where home is _ in my head.

   IN THE SHKELZEN MOUNTAINS, Serbia _ Many of the 200 bone-weary
guerrillas had the blank, distant gaze of people who don't quite
know where they are or what they are doing. Some panted and sweated
in exhaustion and appeared unaccustomed to heavy physical exertion.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who are
fighting to set up a separate state in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, also appear to have embraced a disastrous military
strategy, holding ground against superior Serb forces for days
before retreating with heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not until the KLA begins to break into small units and
develops the hit-and-run strategy of a real guerrilla force that
they can have any success,'' said a Western military observer.
``They should be operating in small units, hitting soft targets,
constantly moving and retreating or hiding from superior Serb
forces. Instead, they seem to think they can operate as a
conventional army. They will be slaughtered if they keep this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Small rebel bands coming out of the province confirmed that
bleak assessment. They said that the territory they held at the
start of the offensive had been reduced and that the wounded and
displaced they were trying to protect had become a drain on the
rebel organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb campaign is apparently designed to empty the border
villages and towns of ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the 2 million people in Kosovo. The creation of a free-fire zone
along the border is intended to deny the rebels succor and support,
as well as give Serb soldiers a license to attack anything that
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of weapons and hundreds of rebels have crossed into Kosovo
from Albania since the fighting intensified in March, according to
Western diplomats, setting off another Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   The column of ethnic Albanian rebels, which formed in Albania
and traveled into Kosovo under the cover of darkness, did not
permit photos. The rebels also refused to say where they were
headed in Kosovo, but conceded that they were going to reinforce
other units holding villages surrounded by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were ordered to move forward, the guerrillas, in
green camouflage uniforms and each shouldering two AK-47 assault
rifles, rested in a lush, alpine valley waiting for the sun to sink
behind the towering gray peaks above them.
</P>
<P>
   Thin lines of cigarette smoke drifted upward from the small
knots of men and periodic messages crackled on the small walkie
talkie of the commander, who is in his thirties. A short,
broad-shouldered man in a green army T-shirt and fatigue pants, the
commander was equipped with a light machine gun and a new
9-milimeter Beretta pistol in a glossy black leather holster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move, move,'' he told his troops. ``It is time to go. Move
swiftly now.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels formed themselves into a long, straggly file, shifted
their army rucksacks and dropped their cigarettes into the carpet
of grass. The train of fighters and pack horses, which soon
stretched hundreds of yards, moved across the jagged gray rocks
along the ridge. Many of the cliffs plunged hundreds of feet to
scrub-covered valleys below.
</P>
<P>
   The clank of metal, the plodding of hooves on the stony trail
and the morose calls of a few songbirds mingled in a chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer and fewer towns holding out now,'' said a
23-year-old guerrilla, who like many was outfitted in a surplus
German army uniform and had a red patch, with ``UCK,'' the initials
of the Albanian words for the Kosovo Liberation Army on his forage
cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs surround the villages, shell the houses and cut off
the food supplies,'' he said. ``I walked in from Smolice today.
There is still resistance, but the shelling is terrible. There are
many wounded and dead. We are trying to get the women and children
out, but even this is not always possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smolice, a few miles east of Ponosevac, is one of the
traditional strongholds of the rebels. It was an ambush there on a
Yugoslav army convoy on March 22 that Belgrade cited as its reason
for beginning the huge counter-insurgency campaign along the border
with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebels moved forward, the crash of heavy Serb artillery
boomed out, sending echoes through the narrow canyons. Two Serb
jets roared just over the ridge line, plummeting in fury toward the
valleys where the combat is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Distraught and stunned refugees, many of whom had been moving
toward Albania through the mountains for two or three days, sat
exhausted along the mountain path. Some 20,000 people have been
driven from their homes by the Serbs, and that number, according to
aid workers, is expected to double within the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Decani ``no longer exists,'' said Jusuf Vishaj,
71, as he sat with some 60 fleeing villagers on a gentle green
slope. ``It is just a name now. The Serb soldiers shelled it, came
in and looted our homes and then burned the town to the ground. We
fled to other, smaller villages, but the soldiers are just
repeating the tactic all along the border. There is nothing to eat.
We are constantly on the run. People are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidajete Viliaj, 26, cradled her 3-day-old baby girl, who was
born on the flight out of Kosovo. A woman, wounded by shrapnel, lay
next to the new mother clutching her head in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does not have a name yet,'' Mrs. Viliaj said of the baby.
``As soon as she was born I had to begin to walk again.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of new fighters, many ethnic Albanians from Germany
and Switzerland, can at best retard the scorched-earth policy of
the tens of thousands of Serb troops and special policemen deployed
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla force, despite the hundreds of volunteers and
impressive arms supplies, remains poorly organized, led by
commanders with little experience. Recruits receive desultory
training that rarely goes beyond showing them how to clean,
assemble and fire AK-47 assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are moving closer to the Albanian border by the
day,'' said a fighter, who like all the guerrillas refused to give
his name. ``The Serb artillery positions keep getting closer. The
routes in and out of Albania that a few days ago were safe and saw
heavy traffic have become dangerous and frequently attract fire.
The helicopters and planes often seem to know where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The column of rebels, who did not permit photos and refused to
say where they were headed in Kosovo, conceded that they were going
to reinforce other units holding villages surrounded by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Two massive stone peaks, perched above the lowlands that held
Decani and neighboring Kosovo towns, merged into a narrow gorge
that dropped swiftly toward the plain. It was here that the unit,
under the cover of darkness, intended to descend to fight the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the fading daylight two men walked up to the crevice to watch
the smoke billow from burning houses and search out the hilltops
below to pinpoint the Serb artillery. As they looked through
military binoculars the sharp crack of a sniper rifle tore through
the thin mountain air. The men turned and ran, leaping over rocks,
tumbling through scrub growth, but not out of sight of the Serb
sniper above them. Two more booms rang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs,'' said one fighter laconically, ``know we are
here.''

   BEANIE-HEIST _ RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ When the van arrived at the
McDonald's at 4132 Blue Heron Blvd., word spread quickly among
employees that it carried two boxes of Zip the Cat Teenie Beanie
Babies _ 600 in all. But when managers opened up the van, they
discovered the plush collectibles were gone, Detective Pat Galligan
said. Consequently, an 18-year-old McDonald's employee lost her job

LAWYER FOR FOSTER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE, URGES NOTES REMAIN
PRIVILEGED  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer for Vincent W. Foster Jr., the late
White House aide, urged the Supreme Court Monday to allow him to
keep secret his notes of a final meeting the two men had in order
to preserve the sanctity of the lawyer-client privilege and, more
generally, to encourage clients to be candid with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But a prosecutor from the Whitewater independent counsel's
office who has sought the lawyer's notes for more than two years
replied that public policy favors a rule that the privilege dies
with the client.
</P>
<P>
   Although the high court put the case on an unusually fast track,
the justices appeared through their questions and comments to have
reached no easy consensus about what to do about an issue of
profound importance to the nation's lawyers: whether the
confidentiality of any conversation they have with a client
evaporates with the client's death.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the justices' comments conveyed a reluctance to carve
out any new exception to the privilege that could chill relations
between lawyers and their clients. But some of the justices also
greeted with skepticism the notion of a sacrosanct and eternal
privilege, one in which the dead would have a final say over the
living and which could rob investigators of evidence that they
would otherwise be able to obtain were a client alive and able to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, for instance, told Foster's lawyer,
James Hamilton, that the exceptions to the lawyer-client privilege
already ``swallow up the rule,'' and that therefore there was not
much left for his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts like to get at the truth,'' Scalia later added, echoing
a line from the independent counsel's brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts like to get to the truth,'' Hamilton replied. ``But
privileges serve a transcendent purpose. If we have a rule that
says a privilege will be broken any time a grand jury needs to
prove who may have committed a crime, the privilege will be of very
little value.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's adversary, Brett Kavanaugh, had no easier a time.
When Kavanaugh told the justices that they could presume that most
people would not object to their conversations with lawyers being
made public after death because of a civic obligation to be
truthful with grand juries, Justice David Souter did not buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a great many people who may not want to fulfill''
those obligations, Souter said. ``We're being realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster was the deputy White House counsel and a close friend of
both President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton when he committed
suicide on July 20, 1993. Nine days earlier, he had met for two
hours with Hamilton at his home for a legal consultation. At the
time, Foster was deeply concerned about the way the White House had
handled the dismissal of the staff of the travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton took three pages of notes during the session. Nearly
two and a half years later, a federal grand jury issued a subpoena
for them. The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, has been
investigating both the travel office incident and the death of
Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a divided federal appeals panel here ruled that in
criminal investigations involving a dead witness, the witness'
discussions with his lawyer are no longer absolutely protected. The
court said that the need for confidentiality must be balanced
against the needs of investigators and the general availability of
the information in other places.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, a qualified privilege that struck a middle ground
between the absolute positions of Hamilton and the independent
counsel, was the first time that a federal court had carved out an
exception to the attorney-client privilege in criminal cases after
a client's death. Although most courts around the nation have found
an exception to the privilege in cases where an estate is being
contested, there is virtually no case law on the issue before the
court in the Foster matter.
</P>
<P>
   While the American Bar Association, the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers and the American College of Trial lawyers,
among other lawyer groups, have lined up in arguing for a
continuation of the privilege after death, the majority of those
legal scholars who have addressed the issue support either no
privilege after death or a qualified one that prosecutors may
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Monday made a strategic concession that could earn him
the crucial vote he might need. Before Monday, his argument for an
airtight privilege was most vulnerable in those instances where a
client, before dying, had confessed to a lawyer about a crime for
which another person was then accused.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to a question by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
Hamilton Monday all but abandoned a privilege in such instances.
</P>
<P>
   Justice O'Connor, who formerly served as a lawyer, lawmaker and
state judge in Arizona, had raised the issue in connection with an
Arizona case in which William Macumber had faced a trial for a
double murder to which a deceased client had confessed to his
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge held that the client's conversations were
privileged and could not be introduced in trial. A deeply divided
Arizona Supreme Court upheld that ruling, but reversed the
conviction on other grounds. Macumber was convicted on retrial at
which the alleged confession was also not admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In extreme positions where a defendant's rights are infringed
upon, a court might consider an exception,'' Hamilton said. ``That
is not this case. Here we have a prosecutor and a grand jury
seeking not specific information to exonerate anyone but seeking
all relevant information to consider prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh sought to capitalize on the concession, observing that
by yielding in that instance, Hamilton was implicitly conceding
that the actual chilling effect posed by any exception would be
slight.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice William Rehnquist acknowledged that for all
the arguments about chilling effects, the court was ill-equipped to
conclude what impact a ruling might have on relations between
lawyers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is woeful dirth of any empirical research'' showing what
impact an exception might have, Rehnquist lamented.
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the case, Swidler &AMP; Berlin and James Hamilton vs.
United States, is expected before the court completes its term in
the next few weeks.

CLINTON CALLS FOR LESS FINGER-POINTING IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton said Monday that the debate
over who bears responsibility for the world's drug problems has
gone on too long and called for drug-producing and consuming
countries to cooperate in stanching the supply and demand for
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a special summit-level session of the General
Assembly convened to discuss ways to counter drug trafficking and
use, Clinton said that pointing fingers has not advanced the fight
against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not dismantle a single cartel, help a single addict,
prevent a single child from trying and perhaps dying from heroin,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the lines between countries that produce,
transit and consume drugs have blurred. ``Drugs are every nation's
problem, and every nation must act to fight them,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton heard a blunt rejoinder from President Ernesto
Zedillo of Mexico, who is still fuming over an American undercover
operation that led to the indictment of 26 Mexican bankers last
month on charges of laundering more than $110 million in drug
profits. Mexican officials were not informed of the investigation,
apparently for fear that it would jeopardize the plan and the
safety of American agents inside Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said Monday that all countries share the same rights and
obligations to fight drug trafficking. ``We all must respect the
sovereignty of each nation so that no one becomes a judge of
others, so that no one feels entitled to violate other countries'
laws for the sake of enforcing its own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a overwhelming part of the world's demand for drugs comes
from ``countries with the largest economic capacity,'' Zedillo
said, ``the human, social and institutional costs in meeting such
demands is paid for by the producing and transit countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our men and women who die first in combatting drug
trafficking,'' he said. ``It is our communities that are first to
suffer from violence, our institutions that are first to be
undermined by corruption. It is our governments that are the first
to have to shift valuable resources needed to fight poverty to
serve as the first bulwark in this war.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernandez, said
the problem was rooted in the law of supply and demand. ``The
demand is what makes the existence of the market possible,''
Fernandez said, explaining that the illegal trade it creates is
highly profitable and attractive. He cited an intelligence estimate
that 33 percent of the drugs smuggled into the United States from
South America passes through the Caribbean, and 15 percent
specifically through the island of Hispanola, which is shared by
Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent among other voices pressing to reduce demand was
Britain's deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who spoke on behalf
of the European Union. ``It is no use stopping opium cultivation in
one place just to see more grown elsewhere,'' Prescott said. ``We
gain nothing by closing one trafficking route to see another
opened.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France urged a counterattack on
every front. ``Drug elimination cannot be left to a single category
of country, whether it be producer or consumer,'' Chirac said.
``Supply and demand must be reduced simultaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton said his administration will request an
anti-drug federal budget exceeding $17 billion for next fiscal
year, of which $6 billion will be earmarked for reducing demand.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing several smaller initiatives, he said he would ask
Congress to extend a new advertising campaign to discourage
children from using drugs. The program got under way last fall with
an initial $195 million budget, but Clinton promised to expand this
to a $2 billion campaign through 2002, with part of the money
donated by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly session on reducing production, trafficking
and use of illegal drugs, the first in 10 years to be devoted
entirely to the subject, was initially proposed by Mexico, which
has become a transit route for more than half of the cocaine
smuggled into the United States.

SINN FEIN TO FIELD CANDIDATES FOR NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The campaign for the new Northern
Ireland Assembly began in earnest Monday as Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, abandoned its
traditional policy and announced formally that it would field
candidates even though the assembly is almost certain to have a
Protestant unionist majority.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, a predominantly Roman Catholic party, had said until
two months ago that it would never participate in the new assembly,
which is being set up under the Northern Ireland peace agreement
approved in referendums on May 22 here and in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The 108-member assembly, to be elected on June 25, is to return
this predominantly Protestant British province to self-government
and to set up a body in which the North and the Irish Republic will
cooperate. The British government took direct control of the
government in sectarian disorders in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The new peace agreement is intended to change Northern Ireland
politics, giving minority Catholics a fairer share of power and
giving the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic added influence
in Northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, began the campaign by
warning that the entire peace effort could be disrupted again by
violence provoked by Protestant patriotic parades through resentful
Catholic neighborhoods. In recent years the parades, celebrating a
Protestant victory over Catholic forces in 1690, have led to
clashes with the police and costly vandalism. The parade season
reaches its peak early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, at a news conference, referred to Catholic hopes, saying:
``Following the events of the last year, the expectations among
nationalists is that these parades should be banned and that
nationalists' rights should be upheld. If we are to avert a major
crisis in the coming weeks then the Irish and British governments
need to move now to resolve the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said, ``I think
if we all, after the Assembly elections, do everything we can to
make sure that the parades pass less violently this year we have a
chance in Northern Ireland that hasn't been seen for many, many
years.`
</P>
<P>
   The chance, Ms. Mowlam meant, was for an increase in foreign
investments in the North. She spoke as she met Commerce Secretary
William Daly, who is leading a group of 17 American executives on a
tour of Ulster and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that violence and support
of violence by political people or organizations would go along way
to dissuade companies from investing,'' Daly said. ``Every day the
guns are silent business confidence goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 American companies operate in Northern Ireland, and
500 in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Protestant group, the Ulster Unionist Party, also
began its election campaign Monday. Its leader, David Trimble,
alluding to one of the first volatile issues that the Assembly will
face, said it would be several months after the election before the
Assembly would form a government.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that the Assembly will wrestle with is whether
Adams will be made a Cabinet minister. He is almost sure to be
eligible under the election rules apportioning power in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect pleases most Catholics and angers many Protestants,
who still see him as the mouthpiece for the IRA. In the campaign
Sinn Fein will be competing for the Catholic vote with the Social
Democratic Labor Party of John Hume. In recent elections Sinn Fein
has become the third-strongest party in the province, behind the
Ulster Unionists and the Social Democrats, but ahead of the
hard-line Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley opposed the peace accord as a huge concession to the
IRA. But he is sure to have a seat and to use it to oppose any
Cabinet post for Sinn Fein.

NAVY SECRETARY JOHN DALTON RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Navy Secretary John Dalton, who cleaned up the
aftermath of the Tailhook sex scandal and integrated women sailers
into combat roles, announced Monday that he will resign at the end
of year.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, 56, held the post of the Navy Department's top civilian
for five years, an unusually long tenure in the job. He didn't
spell out his plans for the future but said he would return to
private life.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement accepting the resignation
and praising Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``His business acumen has helped to streamline and strengthen
operations, and he has worked ceaselessly to extend opportunity to
every sailor and Marine, helping draw strength from our rich
diversity,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen lauded Dalton for helping women
and minorities in the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expanded opportunities for women in the Navy by opening
combat aircraft and other jobs to them,'' Cohen said. ``You also
have worked hard and successfully to recruit more minorities into
the officer ranks of both the Navy and Marine Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and officer aboard nuclear
submarines, Dalton said he plans to devote his remaining months in
office to sailor recruiting issues, the creation of a Navy ethics
center and ratification of the law-of-the-sea treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been in search of a replacement since late
last year, officials said, noting that the other military service
secretaries who were appointed in Clinton's first term have since
departed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said Dalton ``will not be an easy man to
replace and the Clinton administration has lost a true asset.''
</P>
<P>
   One candidate often mentioned as a successor was Rep. Paul
McHale, D-Pa., a retiring third-term representative and a former
Marine officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's staff had contacted McHale about the position in
December and by January had indicated that the lawmaker was the
first choice to succeed Dalton. McHale's name subsequently went to
the White House for final consideration, according to an official
who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   However, McHale took himself out of the running in April after
Dalton signaled he wouldn't be leaving anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   If McHale was reconsidering, he didn't let on Monday. He said in
a statement that Dalton ``has navigated the Navy through some very
rough seas.''
</P>
<P>
   As Navy secretary, Dalton presided over the service during a
time of tumult and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first major acts as the Navy civilian chief, he
fired Adm. Frank Kelso, the chief of naval operations at the time
of the Tailhook scandal, the 1991 aviator convention in Las Vegas
in which Navy and Marine fliers sexually assaulted several women.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton was later overruled by then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin
and Kelso was allowed to finish out his term.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton also inherited fallout from a 1992 cheating scandal at
the U.S. Naval Academy, after which lawmakers and pundits began to
question whether the Navy was rife with problems.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most tragic period of his tenure occurred when
Adm. Jeremy Boorda, Kelso's successor, committed suicide in 1996
after a reporter raised questions about whether Boorda deserved
several military medals.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't specifically mention the Tailhook scandal,
Dalton made several allusions to that incident in a resignation
statement he read at the Pentagon briefing room.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton said he had worked to achieve two major goals as Navy
secretary: To raise the Navy's standards of conduct and to improve
the Navy's operational readiness as a time when it was undergoing
budget cuts in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   He said his administration has worked ``to restore the dignity
and respect with which our people treat one another.'' He said he
made it clear ``that we had no room in the Navy Department for
anyone who treated their shipmates with anything less than dignity
and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the Navy and Marines have become a team, a result
of moving the top Marine Corps officers into the Pentagon from
separate headquarters a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton said he planned to leave the job at yearend but was
making his resignation announcement now so that the Senate could
confirm his successor before he departs.
</P>
<P>
   In his resignation letter to Clinton, Dalton praised his boss
and declared that ``no president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a
former assistant secretary of the Navy, has been aboard more Navy
ships'' than Clinton has.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal note, Dalton praised his wife, Margaret, as the
``best `First Lady' of the Navy Department'' and noted that their
two sons served as officers in the Navy and the Marine Corps during
his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to assuming the post on July 22, 1993, he ran the San
Antonio office of Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark.-based
investment company. In the 1980s, he ran a Texas S&AMP;L that collapsed
during the banking crisis. He was a top Democratic fundraiser in
Texas during the 1992 presidential campaign.

SHUTTLE LEAVES MIR AFTER FINAL VISIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. shuttle astronauts and Russian Mir cosmonauts
parted company for the final time Monday amid embraces and promises
to rejoin one another aboard a new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery pushed away from Mir's docking port at
11:01 a.m., CDT, as the two spacecraft soared high over southern
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's departure brought to a close a three-year program of
nine shuttle docking missions to the Russian space station,
initiated to prepare for the assembly of a new global station.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is scheduled to begin later this year. The Russians
have pledged to scuttle the nearly 13-year-old Mir once crews
establish residency on the new station, probably before the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   As the shuttle prepared to push away, the nine astronauts and
cosmonauts gathered at the hatches of the two spacecraft for an
emotional farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way can we stop the cooperation that started with this
program,'' said Discovery commander Charles Precourt. ``We've got
to keep going together in the future. We're really happy to be
leaping off in that direction with the international space
station.''
</P>
<P>
   As a parting gift, Mir commander Talgat Musabayev presented the
shuttle crew with the massive wrench that he and cosmonaut Nikolai
Budarin employed during a series of April spacewalks to install a
new steering thruster on their orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie, take this wrench,'' said Musabayev. ``This wrench is
planned to be flown to the international space station. It's sort
of a relay (baton) from an old lady, station Mir, to the
international space station. Let's hope this wrench will be
successfully used in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew also gathered an acoustic guitar from Mir, a
gift presented by a U.S. team of astronauts in November 1995.
Musabayev strummed Beatles tunes on the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the final U.S. shuttle voyage allowed the
Discovery crew to pick up Andy Thomas, the seventh and final
American resident of Mir.
</P>
<P>
   During the program's course, shuttle and Mir crews exchanged
nearly 30 tons of food, clothing, fresh water and other supplies
that permitted Russia to maintain the aging outpost despite a
faltering economy. Dozens of scientists attempted experiments in
disciplines ranging from medicine and biotechnology to Earth
observation.
</P>
<P>
   The program was rocked last year, first by a flash fire aboard
Mir and then by a collision with an out-of-control Russian Progress
cargo capsule. NASA elected to complete its mission plans, though
some lawmakers and critics of the policy argued the program had
become too risky.
</P>
<P>
   An assortment of U.S. equipment remained aboard Mir but out of
reach in the station's Spektr science module, which was punctured
by the June 25, 1997, collision.
</P>
<P>
   The module was hastily sealed off as it decompressed. Stowed
inside are a large freezer, a small centrifuge and other equipment
for the collection, analysis and preservation of medical specimens;
an exercise bicycle; and the personal effects of U.S. astronaut
Mike Foale, who was using the module as his living quarters at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Also remaining behind is the docking module attached to Mir by a
shuttle crew in November 1995 to serve as a permanent berth for
U.S. spacecraft as well as an assortment of books, video and music
tapes ferried up by astronauts for their recreation.
</P>
<P>
   As the two spacecraft separated Monday, the astronauts and
cosmonauts joined in a final carefully choreographed experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery pilot Dominic Gorie eased the shuttle to a point 240
feet in front of Mir while the cosmonauts flooded the damaged
Spektr with a greenish tracer gas. The idea was to find the
puncture by watching for the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Precourt told mission control there was nothing visible but that
a light intensifying camera operated by astronaut Franklin
Chang-Diaz may have recorded something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to review that film,'' Precourt informed
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The first shuttle docking mission was launched in June 1995.
Discovery is scheduled to land Friday at the Kennedy Space Center
in Florida.

TENSIONS RISE AS SETTLERS MOVE INTO ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Expanding their foothold in East Jerusalem, Jewish
settlers moved into four homes in an Arab neighborhood early Monday
morning, setting off a violent confrontation and heightening
tension in an area claimed by Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Acting under cover of darkness, members of the settlement group
Elad entered homes that they said they had acquired in Silwan, a
village outside Jerusalem's walled Old City. They removed
furniture, spread coils of barbed wire and raised Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to Judaize East Jerusalem,'' declared Yigal
Kaufman, a spokesman for Elad, which has bought properties and
moved Jews into Silwan in recent years, sometimes displacing Arab
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City of David is the most ancient core of Jerusalem, and
we want it to become a Jewish neighborhood,'' Kaufman added, using
the biblical name for the Silwan area, which was the site of the
Israelite city of Jerusalem ruled by King David.
</P>
<P>
   A clash broke out at one house when a group of Palestinians
arrived with Israeli peace advocates and removed barbed wire.
Witnesses said that settlers had lashed out with sticks and that
the Palestinians had thrown stones. Two settlers were assaulted,
and Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian cabinet member responsible for
Jerusalem affairs, was slightly hurt. Israeli protesters from the
Peace Now movement were forcibly evicted by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers had moved into the homes with the advance knowledge
and protection of the Israeli police, raising charges that they
were tacitly backed by the Israeli authorities. ``The entry was
legal,'' a police spokesman said. ``The houses belong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians and Israeli peace advocates accused Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Mayor Ehud Olmert of Jerusalem of complicity
in what they described as a calculated political provocation. But
aides to Netanyahu and Olmert denied any prior knowledge of the
settlers' action, saying the Jews had simply moved into homes that
were legally theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Olmert are staunch supporters of Jewish settlement
in East Jerusalem, and assert that the area, captured from Jordan
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, will forever remain part of Israel's
undivided capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the
capital of their hoped-for state and view any Jewish settlement
there as an obstacle to a future peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister's office was not party to the organization
and planning of the entry to those houses,'' Danny Naveh, the
Israeli Cabinet secretary, told the Israeli army radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all legal requirements regarding acquisition of the houses
have indeed been met,'' Naveh added, ``I see no reason, from the
point of view of the government and the prime minister, why those
people cannot be in the City of David.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Olmert's office asserted that the entry of the
settlers was ``a private matter'' that did not require the city's
intervention, because the Jews were exercising their legal
ownership. Olmert had no idea of the settlers' intentions and
learned of their action over the radio, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians remained unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu's office and the municipality are involved, and they
encourage these people to do these things,'' said Ziyad Abu Zayyad,
a Palestinian lawmaker from East Jerusalem. ``This is a political
entry. These people are not coming to live quietly. They want to
create political facts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While three of the homes appeared to have been sold indirectly
to the settlers, a fourth building was officially transferred to
them after its Palestinian owner was declared an ``absentee'' who
had forfeited his property rights. The owner, Muhammad Karaeen, was
not in East Jerusalem during an Israeli census there after the 1967
war, and lost an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a cynical use of an unfair law,'' said Jawad Boulous,
a lawyer for Karaeen. ``The first priority should have been the
real owner of the house and his daughter, who has been living there
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Elad says it has moved 17 Jewish families into seven housing
compounds in Silwan in recent years, and has already acquired
additional properties there.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Shaaban, a Palestinian lawyer who lives near one of the
houses taken over Monday, said he feared that his own home might be
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a strategy, and they are implementing it in
stages,'' he said. ``They always say they are doing it by the law,
but what law? Law that discriminates and protects power and
violence is not a law.''

U.S.-BASED CHINESE HARASSED BY POLICE ON VISITS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ark., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio _ Ciping Huang was always known among her neighbors
in the Chinese city of Hefei as a dutiful daughter. And in the 13
years since she arrived in the United States, initially to study
science at the University of Toledo, she returned home as often as
she could. There had never been a problem with the police during
her five earlier trips to China.
</P>
<P>
   But during a long-planned vacation home this April, Ms. Huang
was allowed almost no time with her parents. Instead, the
36-year-old engineer found herself locked in a police interrogation
room for days, with plainclothed officers threatening to jail her _
and even hinting that she could face execution _ unless she
detailed her ties to dissidents in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I had done things damaging to Chinese national
security and had broken the security laws, which can carry the
death penalty,'' Ms. Huang said. ``They said they could arrest
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Police deported her from China on April 19, allowing her 20
minutes to say a final goodbye to her aged parents. Now, safely
back in Ohio, where she lives with her American husband, Ms. Huang
said she is certain why she is being threatened by her government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with Clinton,'' said Ms. Huang, vice
chairman of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and
Scholars, which represents thousands of Chinese living in the
United States. ``They want to have a good image during Clinton's
trip to China. They want to give the world a good impression of
China. So they don't want any protests anywhere, in China or
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and organizations representing students and
other Chinese citizens living in the United States say they have
received reports of at least a dozen incidents in recent weeks in
which Chinese visiting their homeland have been taken into custody,
interrogated or threatened by police.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment, they say, is clearly related to President
Clinton's trip to China this month. They say the Beijing government
is trying to send a message to Chinese living in the United States
that they must not organize protests here of Clinton's visit, the
first by an American president since the 1989 crackdown on
democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be a way of intimidating activists both in the U.S.
and in China who might try to speak out about the president's visit
_ and a way of closing down channels of communications in the
democracy movement,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director
of Human Rights Watch Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say they have no way of determining the
exact number of these incidents in China; most of the victims, they
say, are afraid to report what happened to them after their return
to the United States, for fear that publicity could bring
retalation against their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this has happened to several people, but they don't
want to talk about it openly because of their families,'' said
Jinghong Li, a software engineer in Los Angeles who is chairman of
the Independent Federation, a Washington-based group that was
founded as a result of the 1989 crackdown and organizes public
protests in the United States against the Chinese government.
''They can leave China, but their families stay behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with eight Chinese students and scholars who returned
to the United States from China over the last several months offers
evidence of a pattern: The visiting Chinese are detained, sometimes
for days, and questioned intensely about their involvement _ real
or imagined _ in the dissident movement in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Chinese do have close ties to the dissident
community here, while others do not. All insisted that their recent
visits to China were routine trips to see their families and
friends and were not intended to goad the Chinese government ahead
of Clinton's trip. Four of those interviewed agreed to be
identified by name, even though they said they feared their actions
would have repercussions to their families.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say there was a similar pattern just before
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Xiang Qian Chang, an assistant professor of mathematics at the
Massachusetts College of Pharmacy in Boston, said he was called in
for an interrogation by police during a trip home to Beijing last
August, two months before Zemin's visit, and warned against
organizing protests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that President Jiang Zemin was going to the United
States and they said, Don't you go out and demonstrate,''' he said.
``I think they were very worried about the success of President
Jiang Zemin's trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangzheng Chen, a molecular biologist who has been in the United
States since 1985 and now works for the Food and Drug
Administration at a research center in Arkansas, said that he
visited China this March to see his 85-year-old mother and to
''visit with some old friends _ that was the only purpose of my
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week after arriving in China, he received a phone call
''from some national security agents who said they knew I was back
in China,'' said Chen, who had last visited his homeland in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said they wanted to see me,'' he said. ``I was surprised.
I felt a little bit nervous, because that was the first time in my
entire life that I had been called by a secret policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They came by and picked me up immediately,'' he recalled. ''I
think there were three guys _ plainclothed, early 30s maybe, very
serious. They show me their identification. It says 'national
security bureau.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said that he was placed in an unmarked black car and driven
across town to a luxury hotel, the Jin Jiang, where the security
police had taken a room on the 32nd floor. For the next seven
hours, he said, he was interrogated about his ties to organizations
of Chinese students and scholars in the United States, most
importantly the Independent Federation, which has long been an
irritant to the Beijing government.

<P>
</P>
<P>
   ''They know a lot about almost every member in the group,'' he
said. ''They knew the names. They knew more names than I did. They
asked me what role these people played in the organizations. All
the details. You name it. I told them I wasn't so involved. I said
I didn't have a lot to offer them.''
</P>
<P>
   But police were not satisfied with his answers, he said, and so
he was picked up again several days later and interrogated for
another three hours to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to go, but I had to go,'' he said. ''They told
me that they didn't want me to do stupid things in the United
States. It was clear to me that they didn't want anything to happen
to interrupt any honeymoon between Jiang Zemin and Clinton. They
are worried that we will do something outside of China that will
embarrass them.''
</P>
<P>
   Xiaorong Li, who holds a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford
University and has been in the United States for 10 years, went
home to China to see her parents in early April _ and was allowed
to remain in the country for less than a day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Li, who became an American citizen two years ago and is
active in human-rights organizations in the United States, said
that she was picked up by police only 40 minutes after arriving at
her parent's home in the central province of Sichuan. She had
traveled to China on a tourist visa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a knock at the door and my brother opened it,'' she
said. ''There were three men. One was older, maybe 50ish, and two
younger persons. And they said, 'We need to take you over to the
public security station.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Li was put into a police car and driven more than five hours
to an interrogation center in Chengdu, the provincial capial. ''You
shouldn't be doing this,'' she recalled telling the policemen in
the car. ''I need to say goodbye to my parents. I have to call the
U.S. consolate in Chengdu, and they basically ignored me and kept
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in Chengdu shortly before dawn, she said, she
was met by 10 police officers dressed in Western-style business
suits ''and one guy started videotaping me from the moment I
stepped out of the car _ they were very vicious, as if they had
caught a big criminal, and began ordering me around and shouting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept asking me questions like who I came into China with,
what was our plan, what did I want to do,'' she said. ''They asked
me what activities did I engage in in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Li pointed out that she was an American citizen and had
the right under international law to consult with American
diplomats, ''they said that it did not matter about my nationality
because anyone who breaks the law in China will be punished under
Chinese law.''
</P>
<P>
   The questioning lasted for about an hour, and her luggage was
searched as she watched on, helpless to stop them. She said she was
then hurriedly driven to the Chengdu airport, where she was put on
a plane bound for Hong Kong, the former British colony that, while
now part of China, maintains separate borders. Ms. Li said she was
told never to return to her homeland.

 &HT;    
 &HT;      CONRAIL DEAL APPROVED
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 8 -- Conrail's fate was effectively sealed
Monday when the U.S. Surface Transportation Board voted to approve
the $10.2 billion takeover of the Philadelphia rail cargo company
by two Virginia-based competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The vote assures the end of Conrail's 21-year run as the sole
rail shipper in the Northeast, replacing it with measured
competition between CSX Inc. of Richmond and Norfolk Southern of
Norfolk, Va. The deal is also expected to eliminate 1,900 jobs in
Philadelphia, mostly administrative tasks that were either made
redundant by the merger or transferred to other CSX and Norfolk
Southern offices.
</P>
<P>
   Winning approval from the Surf Board, as the agency is called,
was the last federal hurdle for CSX and Norfolk Southern. The board
will issue a formal written opinion July 23, and one month later
the take-over will be official -- although both rail companies must
still negotiate labor agreements with Conrail employee unions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the board members were swayed by the idea of
injecting competition into the rail cargo industry. ``Shippers
throughout the East will have more options than they have had in
decades,'' said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the Surf Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do hear in the long run will achieve the greatest good
while minimizing the harm,'' said Gus Owen, vice chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Owen and Morgan, who are the only members of the board while
they await the appointment of a presidential nominee, did, however,
vote to impose some conditions to the deal and promised to keep a
watchful eye out to ensure its progress.
</P>
<P>
   At the recommendation of the board's staff, they imposed a
five-year review period of the merger and called for detailed
weekly reports, in part a response to the disastrous gridlock out
West from the last big rail merger, between Union Pacific Corp
purchased Southern Pacific Rail Corp. two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although CSX and Norfolk Southern did not approve of the
conditions set by the board, neither company said they would be
deal breakers. ``The STB has applied unprecedented conditions,''
said John W. Snow, CEO of CSX. ``Had they gone any further, we
would have been forced to question going forward with the
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to wait and be able to study (the conditions),'' said
Frank Brown, spokesman for Norfolk Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The deal had its share of critics, including Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., a member of the committee that funds the Surf Board. In
prepared testimony for last week's hearings on the deal, Specter
joined a chorus of doubters who questioned whether the $10.2
billion price for Conrail would cause CSX and Norfolk Southern to
increase rates to cover their costs.
</P>
<P>
   A bidding war erupted between CSX and Norfolk Southern last year
when Norfolk Southern tried to scuttle a friendly merger between
Conrail and CSX, driving up the cost of Conrail's stock to $115 per
share once the joint take-over was announced. Specter has favored
the friendly take-over, which would have led to fewer job losses in
Conrail's Center City headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   And the AFL-CIO has attacked board member Owen, individually,
for alleged ethical conflicts of interest with his private business
dealings in California, and the board, as a whole, for not taking
action against rail companies who break labor contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But most other state and federal lawmakers eventually lent their
support to the CSX and Norfolk Southern take-over, including Gov.
Tom Ridge, Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell and U.S. Rep. Bud Shuster,
R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Surf Board and its staff rejected the idea that costs would
soar because of the $10.2 billion price tag, instead asserting that
rates would most likely drop because of the competition between CSX
and Norfolk Southern. ``Overall, shippers will be better off than
before the merger,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   And management contends that out of 73,00 jobs currently held by
the three rail companies, the net loss of jobs will be just 1,900
when the deal is completed -- about the same rate as attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Conrail employees will not know anything different other
than the logo on their paycheck,'' Brown, of Norfolk Southern,
said.

YANKS KEEP THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like mountain climbers afraid of heights, the Yankees
don't want to look down. They don't want to look around, to check
out the view from their lofty perch in the standings. Joe Torre,
the manager, walks out of the room if others start comparing and
contrasting his team's incredible record with other standards in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte once glanced at daily notes dispensed by the team,
then quickly pushed them away when he saw a comparison of the
Yankees of 1998 and the Yankees of 1928. Tim Raines is curious, but
he would rather wait until October to discuss how good this team
really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to have some accomplishments during the
season,'' Raines said, ``but it doesn't mean anything until you get
to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, 44-13 and already 12 games ahead of second-place
Boston in the loss column, would rather keep their blinders on and
focus on their very next step. The cliche is in effect: One day at
a time, and right now that means playing the Montreal Expos in the
first game of a three-game series at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, it really is easier to play that
way,'' Torre said. ``You start thinking about the numbers and then
you begin applying expectations and you start trying to do too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   They just do what they need to do, each day. Torre says he has
never been around a group of players who better understand why they
are successful, and are determined to keep doing the things that
make them win. For Pettitte, that means 20 minutes of
cardiovascular work and heavy weight training the day after he
pitches. For Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman, that means
maintaining a strict diet and workout regimen and drinking lots of
water. Mariano Rivera does not use weights, but he runs regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is amazing, when you look around here,'' catcher Joe
Girardi said. ``It's the healthiest team I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi's example would be as good as any. About three and a
half hours before a night game, Girardi stretches, then goes to the
Yankees' indoor batting cage to hit balls off a tee. He stretches
again a half-hour later, before the team batting practice. After
hitting, he retreats to the bullpen to work on blocking balls in
the dirt, framing pitches and taking short-hopped throws at the
plate. He might catch a pitcher's bullpen session, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He stretches again before the Yankees take infield practice
about an hour before the game. More stretching, then he goes to the
batting cage with the batting coach Chris Chambliss to hit balls
tossed softly to him. At 7:10 for a 7:35 game, he goes to the
outfield for five sprints of 40 yards, then plays catch, and, on
the days he plays, he begins catching the starting pitcher in the
bullpen at exactly 7:23. Routine.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four times a week after games, Girardi will head to the
weight room and lift for about 30 minutes to strengthen his chest,
shoulders, legs, back and arms. If he is tired, he may break up his
workout and finish it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi is hardly unusual. After most every game, a platoon of
Yankees will head to the weight room, Knoblauch, Chad Curtis,
Darryl Strawberry and Paul O'Neill among them. Raines never lifts _
he is thickly built, and feels additional muscles would only reduce
his flexibility _ but is devoted to stretching, before games, after
games, during games. Just keep warm and stretch.
</P>
<P>
   They win, they work out. They lose, they work out. Routine. Just
look ahead. Never look down.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are finishing a stretch of 10 games against four
struggling teams: the Chicago White Sox, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
the Florida Marlins and the Montreal Expos. The Yankees have won
the first seven, without lapses in concentration. They have won 43
of their last 52 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte said Saturday: ``We've got a lot of guys who take pride
in doing their jobs. That's what was so frustrating for me for a
while, because I felt like I wasn't doing my job. That's what we're
concentrating on, just doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams is doing his job, driving in 30 runs in his last
26 games. Graeme Lloyd is doing his job, retiring 27 of 29 batters
over a period of 12 appearances. David Cone and David Wells, both
8-1, have not lost since the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis got hurt, and in his place, Strawberry has a
team-high nine homers and Raines is batting .297. Tino Martinez got
hurt, and the Yankees went 9-1. They are 4-0 since Derek Jeter went
on the disabled list. Cone was bitten on the finger by his mother's
dog, and Orlando Hernandez pitched in his place and won. Wells'
shoulder felt sore, and Cone pitched and won in his place. Rivera
was on the disabled list, and Mike Stanton saved five games.
</P>
<P>
   The team is on a pace to win 125 games, which would be a record
in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't worry about that right now,'' Pettitte said.
``We've been very good, but when you start talking about greatest
teams in history, that's getting a little carried away, 50 to 60
games into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule will harden, beginning Friday. Three games against
Cleveland, which leads the American League Central. Then three in
Baltimore, four in Cleveland, then four games in four days against
Atlanta _ two in Yankee Stadium June 22-23, two down south, June
24-25. And three games against the revitalized Mets, June 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   They will not look far ahead, Pettitte said. They will not look
behind. They will just focus on what is in front of them.

HONDA AND FORD TO PAY FINES FOR POLLUTION VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Japan)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Honda will pay a record environmental fine, federal
prosecutors announced Monday, for programming the pollution-control
computers in 1.6 million of its cars to ignore spark-plug failures,
allowing the cars to emit twice as much smog-causing hydrocarbons
without warning their drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. will also pay a fine, the officials said, for
selling 60,000 Econoline vans with a secret feature that makes them
emit more nitrogen oxides at highway speeds than they do on
treadmill tests, a design that was intended to improve fuel economy
but means more smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making very clear that cars are a major source of air
pollution in this country and it is important for auto
manufacturers to assure they are carefully complying with the Clean
Air Act,'' said Lois Schiffer, an assistant attorney general and
head of the Justice Department's environment and natural resources
division. ``If they don't do it, we will take strong action against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda agreed to pay a civil penalty of $12.6 million, which the
Justice Department said was a record under the Clean Air Act. The
company will perform free tune-ups on the cars, which are from the
1995, 1996 and 1997 model years.
</P>
<P>
   Honda will also extend the warranty on the pollution-control
systems to 14 years or 150,000 miles. Depending on which part was
involved and where the car was sold, the existing warranties ranged
from three years or 36,000 miles to eight years or 80,000 miles.
The Justice Department said that the remedial actions would cost
Honda $250 million, but the company said it did not know the cost,
because no one had ever guaranteed car parts for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is a stunning blow to Honda, which in
advertising and public statements has portrayed itself as an
environmental leader and has voluntarily put extra equipment on
hundreds of thousands of vehicles to make sure that they meet
California's strict emission standards, even if they are sold in
states around the country that enforce the more lax federal
standard.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a blow to Ford, which voluntarily exceeds emissions
rules on many of its models.
</P>
<P>
   The software in the Hondas is burned into the computer chips,
and to reprogram them they would have to be replaced, at a price
the government put at $500 million. The package that Honda agreed
to _ including free oil changes, to lure drivers in for their free
tune-ups _ was more effective, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the largest previous case was the $45 million in
fines and remedial actions that General Motors agreed to in 1995
for producing Cadillacs that passed emissions tests but violated
pollution standards on the road. That case was one of a very small
number of pollution-compliance cases brought against automakers by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case that is still under way, the EPA has
discovered that hundreds of thousands of heavy-duty diesel trucks
give off much more pollution in normal highway use than they do in
the tests they must pass to be certified for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In the Honda case, EPA estimated that uncorrected, the cars _
Civics, Accords, Del Sols, Integras, Preludes, NSXs and CR-Vs,
Odysseys and their Isuzu-brand twin, the Oasis _ would emit 8
million extra tons of hydrocarbons in their lifetimes. Total
emission of hydrocarbons from all transportation sources was about
10 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said that the cars can grow sluggish without
warning the driver that something is wrong, and that if a driver
takes one to a garage, the mechanic will have a harder time
diagnosing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case announced Monday, Ford has begun a recall of
the Econolines. It will pay $2.5 million in civil penalties,
purchase pollution credits from other sources for another $2.5
million, and spend $1.3 million on fixing the Econolines, with a
goal of completing the work on at least 70 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and Honda, notified of the problems early last year,
have corrected them for vehicles now in production.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Honda problem was discovered by officials of the California
Air Resources Board, which serves as the federal EPA's surrogate
for certifying that Hondas meet federal standards. The California
board tested one vehicle that had been on the road for several
months, and found that it did not diagnose engine misfires, in
which the fuel-air mixture fails to explode and is shoved out the
exhaust system, sometimes damaging the catalytic converter on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   On closer examination, California engineers found the system was
designed not to work.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers all of the Honda and Accura vehicles built
in the 1996 and '97 model years, with the exception of Passport and
SLX, and 1997 Integra R. For 1995 models, it covers the Accord V-6
and the Accura NSX, 2.5 TL.
</P>
<P>
   The computer software does not increase emissions; it simply
fails to light up the ``check engine'' light when parts fail and
emissions rise. It also allows the cars to perform sluggishly
without the ``check engine'' light coming on.
</P>
<P>
   David Alexander, an attorney with the EPA's enforcement
division, said that suppressing the dashboard warning light made
life harder for all drivers, even those who are relatively
knowledgeable about cars. ``The idiot lights are for all of us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Honda said, though, that the problem was simply one
of interpretation of the rules, and that the vehicles' diagnostic
systems would function if the problem was serious. The lawyer,
William Willen, said the problem was that his company's engineers
had gone too far in their attempts to minimize the number of times
the light came on.
</P>
<P>
   Willen said in a telephone interview that the only time the
dashboard light would fail to illuminate was in times of
intermittent failure.
</P>
<P>
   Honda said owners with questions could call its Consumer Affairs
Department at (800) 999-1009.

PROTESTERS FAIL TO DETER TEXAS CHURCH FROM HIRING WOMAN AS PASTOR 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A Sunday sidewalk protest by dozens of followers of the
ultra-conservative Rev. W.N. Otwell will not keep a Baptist church
in Waco, Texas, from hiring its first female senior pastor, church
leaders said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The protest at Calvary Baptist Church came just one week after
church members voted to become the first Southern Baptist
congregation in Texas with a woman pastor. The 300-member church
has several women in other, secondary ministerial positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Julie Pennington-Russell, now senior pastor at the 19th
Avenue Baptist Church in San Francisco, will assume her Waco duties
in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited about our new pastor,'' said search committee
chairman Tom Purdy. ``We believe we have acted in the holy
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the Calvary congregation, he said,
``believes that men and women share equally the gifts of God.'' He
said he was not aware of any members who were quitting in protest.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 members of Otwell's fundamentalist God Said
Ministries of Mount Enterprise positioned themselves outside the
church, bearing placards reading, ``Women have no authority,''
``Working women equal moral corruption; working mothers equal child
abuse,'' and ``The spirit of Jezebel; today's `liberated woman' is
under her control.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2 1/2-hour protest, led by Otwell's construction worker son,
Rocky Otwell, was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group was not invited, the younger Otwell said a
number of church members confided to protesters that the
congregation is divided over the new pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were older members,'' he said. ``They've been there all
their lives. Where are they to go? What are they supposed to do?
Maybe we encouraged them, showed them that if they don't agree
maybe things can be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Church education minister Howard Williams said all the
protesters seemed to be with Otwell's organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as no surprise that this departure from scriptural
authority has happened in Waco, since Waco's Baylor University, a
Baptist school, has, for years, been one of the main leaders
promoting liberalism of the scriptures and worldliness,'' W.N.
Otwell said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the problems in our nation's homes, schools,
political system and economy have been brought on by the feminist
movement, which has promoted women's liberation and has pressured
most of American women out of the home where God ordained them to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church and this people have sinned and must be held
responsible for their crime against God, the home, the husband, the
children and society as a whole. Women need to go home and leave
preaching, ruling, leading, providing and protecting to the men.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary Baptist, which received advance notification of the
protest, ``understands and prizes freedom of speech,'' Purdy said.
``We respect the autonomy of local churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Otwell, who has espoused white supremacist and anti-gay views,
is pastor of Heritage Baptist Church near Mount Enterprise, north
of Nacogdoches. He previously clashed with the city of Fort Worth,
which tried to keep him from distributing food to the poor that was
prepared in uninspected kitchens. He also picketed Nacogdoches City
Hall after that community replaced the Confederate battle flag with
the Confederate ``Stars and Bars'' on the police department logo.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington-Russell, 37, senior pastor at the San Francisco
church since 1993, came with high recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine a wiser choice knowing your church,'' the
Rev. George Mason, pastor of Dallas' Wilshire Baptist Church, told
the Waco congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is thoroughly Baptist,'' added Daniel Vestal, coordinator
of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington-Russell could not be reached for comment.

SOME STATES TACKLING URBAN SPRAWL WITH NEW TAXES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 (ATTN.: Ga., Conn., Pa.) 
By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey and a half dozen other states are
considering ambitious plans to preserve farmland and other open
space to help curb suburban sprawl and address mounting concern
from suburban and rural residents about new development in their
fast-growing towns.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Todd Whitman is putting her tax-cutting record at
risk with a proposal to raise the gasoline tax to help preserve
half of New Jersey's 2 million remaining acres of undeveloped land
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lawmakers recently approved a bill that would put a real
estate transfer tax increase on the ballot this November to
establish a $36 million conservation fund. In Connecticut, state
lawmakers approved last month the first piece of Gov. John
Rowland's $160 million bond program that would preserve more than
20,000 acres over five years. Minnesota state lawmakers voted in
favor of a bond measure that would allocate $140 million over two
years for parks, hiking trails, recreation and open space.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to new state spending comes on top of efforts by
more than 100 local and county governments across the country in
the last two years to win voter approval for tax increases or bond
referendums to help buy undeveloped land and curb suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, voters in Monroe County, Pa., approved a $25
million bond referendum to purchase undeveloped land over the next
10 years. And in Austin, Texas, voters agreed to increase water
rates to raise $65 million to protect 15,000 acres of
environmentally sensitive land outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the governors and the state
legislators are listening to the people,'' said Phyllis Myers,
president of State Resource Strategies in Washington, D.C., which
tracks state and local open space financing programs around the
country. ``When they see that people are willing to tax themselves
for this, they recognize that this is an issue that they need to
address with an overall state program.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buying undeveloped land, New Jersey, Maryland,
Florida and a handful of other states are also trying to improve
how they manage growth by seeking to direct new development away
from rural areas to more established towns that already have roads
and water and sewer lines.
</P>
<P>
   What is driving the anti-suburban sprawl movement in many
communities is concern about the impact of new development on
already congested roadways and overcrowded schools. What is more,
development, once seen as a way to expand the property tax base, is
now viewed as more costly, as local officials are forced to raise
property tax rates because new fire stations and elementary schools
and more police officers are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public has reached the point where they are fed
up,'' said Bill Wolfe, acting director of the Sierra Club's New
Jersey chapter. ``They don't like begin stuck in traffic. They
don't like a two-hour commute to work. They don't like overcrowded
schools and rising property taxes. All of those things can be
traced back to poor land-use decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neil Gaffney, a spokesman for the National Home Builders
Association, pointed out that home building in outlying suburbs is
driven by consumer demand for larger homes on larger lots. He said
that a recent survey, conducted by the association, showed that 82
percent of consumers said they would choose to live in a
single-family home in an outlying area over a townhouse near an
urban center and their job. ``Consumers are driving much of what is
happening out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1990, more than 19 million acres of rural lands
across the country have been developed, according to the Sierra
Club, which estimates 400,000 acres a year are vanishing under
bulldozers for subdivisions, shopping centers, office parks and
roadways. In New Jersey, state officials estimate 10,000 acres
disappear annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of significant federal spending for the
protection of farmland and open space, private organizations, like
the Nature Conservancy and the American Farmland Trust, have been
working to purchase open space and development rights, often
alongside local governments. Some of the land is being set aside
for parkland, but much of the farmland remains in the hands of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently major environmental organizations like the Sierra
Club have made suburban sprawl a top national priority. The Sierra
Club began a national campaign last year after a survey of chapters
around the country found sprawl was their members' top concern.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always worked on development issues, but there is a
rising crescendo of concern about the impact of sprawl development
on communities and the environment,'' said Larry Bohlen,
co-chairman of the Sierra Club's ``Challenge to Sprawl'' campaign.
``It is becoming increasingly a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that crosses party lines. Both Democrats and
Republicans have supported measures to protect open space in their
states.
</P>
<P>
   When Whitman began her second term in January, she seized on
concerns of many suburban and rural residents about the rapidly
disappearing landscape and their quality of life and used it to as
the major theme of inaugural address.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman administration aides said internal polls show strong
support for the proposal, which has also helped bolster Whitman's
standing among state environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman has long supported open space preservation
programs, she said that she decided to make it a major theme for
her second term because she was struck by how much of the state's
landscape had changed during her travels around New Jersey in the
last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We preserved 115,000 acres in the first four years, which was
more than any other four year-period,'' Whitman said in an
interview on June 3. ``But that's such a small amount, given the
kinds of pressures that we see. And while I am supportive of
growth, and we want to have places for people to live, we've also
got to understand that once land is gone, it's gone forever. And
that every piece of land we develop puts added pressure on our
infrastructure, on our roads, on our bridges, on our schools, on
our water systems.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, like New York and Florida, has had a long history of
supporting open space preservation. Since 1961, New Jersey voters
have approved nine bond referendums that have raised $1.39 billion
to help protect more than 400,000 acres of farmland and other land
from development. In addition, 53 towns and 13 counties in the
state have approved tax increases that range from 1 to 5 cents on
each $100 of assessed property value to protect undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman said that putting another bond referendum before the
voters would not provide a stable source of financing that the
state needs to meet an ambitious goal as preserving 1 million
acres. She also said that money should be used to buy land, not pay
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Whitman has proposed putting a gasoline tax increase
before the voters in November that would raise the state tax on
gasoline to 21.5 cents a gallon from 14.5 cents a gallon. Of the
7-cent increase, five cents would be earmarked to finance
improvements for roadways and mass transit projects, and 2 cents,
or $90 million, would be dedicated for open space preservation. She
has also called for a $3 increase in car rental fees to raise an
additional $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers, while insisting they support efforts to
preserve New Jersey's land, are balking at using the gasoline tax
for open space preservation. It remains uncertain whether the
Republican-controlled Legislature will approve her plan. But
lawmakers said they were committed to finding some way to finance
it.
</P>
<P>
   What Whitman and a handful of other states and local governments
are also beginning to recognize is that acquiring farmland and
other open space will not be enough, without some effort to manage
growth better.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the important issues here is the limitation of
conservation by purchase or donation,'' said Henry Richmond, the
founder of the organization 1000 Friends of Oregon that helped
create Portland's urban growth boundary, considered the most
aggressive growth management approach in the nation. ``Those scarce
dollars should not be used to conserve land that could be conserved
through the use of zoning. That is a fair thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Portland's success in containing sprawl, using regional
zoning powers to restrict development outside an urban growth
boundary first established in 1973, officials in most states are
looking to manage growth with less-restrictive laws. Instead, they
are trying to use incentives to direct development to urban areas
and older suburbs rather than outlying rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening won legislative approval
last year for his ``Smart Growth'' plan, which proposes to reward
counties with state money for roads and schools if they agree to
confine growth to a few designated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has also renewed her commitment to the state Development
and Redevelopment Plan, a blueprint for revitalizing cities and
older suburbs while protecting open space. She wants to offer
incentives to developers to build in parts of the state that have
not been designated under the state plan as rural or
environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a state of 8 million people, 5 million acres, 2 million
left,'' Whitman said. ``I don't think it's too much to ask to keep
one half of what remains farms and open space. We're in danger of
no longer being the Garden State if we don't start to make the
commitment now in a major way.''

MAVERICK OIL REFINER IS POISED TO STRIKE IT RICH

<P>
   NORCO, La. _ Rivals have tried to buy him off, creditors have
gotten high-powered lawyers to try to cow him, investors have
needled him about going through bankruptcy twice, his own son has
accused him of being a polluter and many in the energy industry
here shake their heads at the mention of his name.
</P>
<P>
   But John R. Stanley, known as Jack in the oil patch, is a hard
man to keep down.
</P>
<P>
   When the elevator was temporarily out of order at his sprawling
oil refinery here recently, Stanley, 59, bounded up nearly 300
stairs to show a visitor the view from the top of the new coking
unit. ``There's $2 billion worth of equipment here,'' Stanley
exulted as his guest fought to catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Stanley tell it, that $2 billion worth of equipment is
his ticket to the heights of the U.S. energy market for his
privately held TransAmerican Energy Corp. By the end of the summer,
the towering coking and cracking units are expected to be going
full blast, converting 230,000 barrels of crude oil a day into
kerosene, diesel fuel, heating oil _ and 5.5 million gallons of
gasoline. It will be the largest single addition of new capacity in
domestic refining in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   This could become the jewel in Stanley's corporate crown. But
watching the 6-foot-2 man from Massachusetts stomping around the
1,000-acre complex on the banks of the Mississippi, you'd never
guess how close he came to losing it in bankruptcy proceedings that
began in 1983 and dragged on for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that battle, the refinery sat idle _ even as Stanley
deflected his creditors' demands to sell it and talked the court
into letting him spend $100 million to keep it in operating
condition.
</P>
<P>
   And that was not his first brush with financial disaster. Ten
years earlier, he had also filed for protection from creditors when
the price of ammonia plunged _ shortly after he built an ammonia
plant.
</P>
<P>
   But far from turning Stanley into the soul of prudence,
judiciously building up a cash reserve for the next rainy day,
those setbacks only spurred him to take even bigger gambles. Almost
immediately after his first bankruptcy, he poured $800 million into
an initial modernization of his refinery here. After the second, he
spent six years paying off $1.37 billion in debt and then put
together $900 million financing _ mostly in junk bonds _ to upgrade
the plant to its current state.
</P>
<P>
   But why should he show caution? For all his faults _ and critics
say he has plenty _ Stanley is that most American of characters,
the entrepreneur. And he has doggedly pursued his vision even when
others predicted disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack has more perseverance than anyone else I know,'' said Ed
Donohue, the chief financial officer for TransAmerican who has
worked for Stanley since 1977. ``He knew the value of the assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now: Will he strike out yet a third time, seriously
damaging the fortune he has reamassed, or will his latest gamble
provide him with even greater riches?
</P>
<P>
   One thing going for him is that the refinery will be one of just
a handful in the country that can efficiently process the thick,
low-grade oil that is produced in abundance in Mexico and Venezuela
and sells for as little as half the price of lighter crudes. That
could give Stanley a big competitive advantage regardless of what
happens to oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has always been quick to spot a money-making
opportunity. In college in 1958, he took a job pumping gas in a
tough neighborhood of Springfield, Mass., and, after seeing how
much cash poured in, leased the station and managed it himself. To
save money, he did almost everything _ repairing cars, haggling
with suppliers and even delivering the fuel in a rented tanker
truck. On weekends, he used the rig to take his girlfriend Eileen,
now his wife of 39 years, to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   The business did so well that Stanley leased another gas
station, and then another, until by the late 1970s he had built up
one of the largest independent networks in the country, the
230-unit Gasland chain. And he continued driving his own delivery
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he reacted to adversity with a decisiveness that
bordered on impulsiveness. When a gasoline supplier refused to
renew a contract in 1971, he bought the old refinery here, 1,300
miles from home, for $2.1 million because owning it gave him a
sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about refining, except that I wanted to
have gasoline for my stations,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, he commuted between Massachusetts and
Louisiana before moving here in 1978. With his new acquisition, 15
miles northwest of New Orleans in the middle of alligator-infested
swampland, Stanley displayed another entrepreneurial skill:
improvisation. Whenever there was a crisis, he said, he would round
up his workers _ sometimes summoning them from a local bar _ and
keep them holed up in a conference room until they figured out a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Having bought a refinery to supply his gas stations, he decided
to go one step further and drill for oil to supply the refinery.
And he again displayed the drive that keeps some entrepreneurs
going when others would more likely throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   After his drillers reached the depth recommended by the experts
and announced they had hit a dry hole, Stanley told them ``to drill
the maximum that the rig could handle,'' he recalled. ``That's how
we hit that first well,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   What they hit was not oil, but natural gas. He quickly acquired
more rights in what turned out to be one of the richest gas fields
in the state, Lobo Trend.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue from that find _ though it would ultimately bail him
out of financial tight spots _ inspired yet another investment idea
that went awry, the construction of an ammonia plant. It seemed
like a smart idea, because the plant could use natural gas supplied
by Stanley, but it became a huge money loser after the price of
ammonia plunged.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the initial bankruptcy filing for his company, then
called Good Hope Refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley recovered quickly from that reversal. But he was not so
fortunate in 1983, when the American energy industry was hammered
by a slide in oil and natural gas prices. After a major customer,
El Paso Natural Gas, stopped buying his natural gas, Stanley again
filed for protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had $23,000 in the bank and a blue Jaguar,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His banks tried to sell off his assets and hired a high-powered
law firm to persuade him to step aside. But he refused, even
spurning an offer worth up to $50 million to accept their plan for
reorganization, according to his lawyer. Some creditors accused him
of hiding assets and using the bankruptcy process to shut them out.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he won court approval to spend $100 million to maintain
the refinery. Meantime, he found idle drilling companies willing to
work for a share of the revenue from wells they struck. And they
struck enough to more than triple his gas output and allow him to
emerge from bankruptcy in 1987. By 1993 he had paid $1.37 billion
back to creditors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all the legal turmoil, Stanley went through a
wrenching personal ordeal, a dispute with his son, William, that
led to a permanent rupture. After the son disclosed that he had
taken a part interest in companies that were doing business with
his father's company, the elder Stanley dismissed him and later
disowned him.
</P>
<P>
   The son subsequently publicly accused his father of illegally
dumping toxic waste and of bribing Louisiana state officials. The
state investigated the charges but found no evidence of wrongdoing.
In 1996, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicted
Stanley's son on charges of defrauding wholesalers out of at least
$175,000, and it is currently seeking his extradition from Spain, a
department spokesman said. His lawyer could not be reached for
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the story of his life,'' said Stanley, who has three
other children and 13 grandchildren. ``He doesn't share our
family's values.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Stanley got back on his feet, with money pouring in
from his gas operations and oil wells, the refinery remained
shuttered. After his bankruptcy reorganization was completed, he
won an out-of-court settlement of $300 million from El Paso Gas.
After putting his company on even firmer financial footing by
selling off $1.1 billion in oil and gas operations, he was able to
borrow more money to complete the refinery project, which is
scheduled to reopen this month.
</P>
<P>
   His timing could not be better. Profits in refining are
rebounding, capacity is tight and demand for gasoline is growing at
close to 3 percent a year. ``The manufacturing capacity to make
gasoline is not keeping up with demand,'' said Frederick Leuffer,
an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the industry falls on hard times again, Stanley believes
his refinery will flourish because it is so efficient. Mark
Kellstrom, who follows the refining industry for Jefferies &AMP; Co. in
Houston, agrees, saying Stanley is years ahead of some of his major
competitors in his ability to handle low-grade crude.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so sanguine. They point out that most of the
survivors of the carnage of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when
more than 100 mostly smaller and older refineries went under, are
battle scarred and battle hardened. Moreover, he is working against
two disadvantages _ his junk-bond debt interest payments and the
lack of a guaranteed market for his gasoline. (He sold his
gas-station chain in 1981.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to understand how they're going to get a good
return on capital,'' said Kirby Hedrick, an executive vice
president at the Phillips Petroleum Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley has reason to be upbeat. His net worth is estimated
at $700 million. And, he says, he has the chance to make a huge
profit if he is able to take TransAmerican Refining public early
next year. (His gas operation, the TransTexas Gas Corp., is already
publicly traded. Both companies are units of American Energy.)
</P>
<P>
   For all his wealth, Stanley sticks to the austere business style
that dates back to the days when he ran his gas station empire from
a cinder-block building in Springfield's inner city. In Houston,
while everybody else was moving into glass towers, he worked out of
cheap leased space until 1995, when he moved into an old, partly
vandalized building.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley paid $600,000 for the building, or about $10 a square
foot _ a fraction of what prime commercial real estate was selling
for. ``We only did it,'' he said, ``because it was on the way to
the airport and it had the right price.''

DOW RISES 31.89 POINTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major stock market indexes rose modestly on Monday,
extending their gains for a third day. Among the leaders were
financial services companies, propelled by merger news, and
pharmaceutical stocks, lifted by a positive outlook for new drug
products.
</P>
<P>
   After soaring more than 167 points on Friday, the Dow Jones
industrial average rose 31.89 points on Monday, to 9,069.60.
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index added 1.86 points, to close at
1,115.72. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 4.85
points, to 1,787.77. Each of the measures advanced more than 1
percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although investors' current bias seems to be to move prices
higher, analysts say, stocks are not expected to gain much ground
in the coming weeks as the second-quarter earning season nears,
said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the three days of gains, broad market indexes are lower
than they were at the beginning of May, with the Dow more than 142
points away from its May 13 closing high of 9,211.84.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, corporations offered investors mixed signals about
the outlook for the market. On the one hand, merger activity
continued at a brisk pace, improving the outlook for corporate
profits in several sectors. The Norwest Corp. and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
announced plans for a $34 billion merger that would produce the
nation's seventh largest bank. The news helped lift other financial
shares like First Union, BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Energy, a Canadian oil producer, said it planned to
purchase Pinnacle Resources for more than $720 million, and Just
For Feet, a sneaker retailer, announced plans to buy rival Sneaker
Stadium for $43 million in assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, earnings warnings from several companies and
other negative news tempered investors' enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Galey &AMP; Lord, a denim manufacturer whose customers include Levi
Strauss, the Gap retailer, designers Calvin Klein, Liz Claiborne
and Polo Ralph Lauren warned that fiscal third-quarter earnings
would not meet forecasts because of lower sales in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harmon, the company's chief financial officer, said that
earnings were hurt because denim sales did not pick up as much as
expected. In addition, the company also has excess corduroy
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the weakness in the semiconductor industry, Galileo
Technology, an Israeli maker of digital semiconductors, warned that
second-quarter revenue could fall 20 to 25 percent because of
slowing demand, price declines and product delays.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of Premiere Technologies fell more than 26 percent
after a BankAmerica Robertson Stephens research analyst reduced
second-quarter earnings estimates and questioned whether the
telecommunications concern would realize savings this quarter from
a recent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Holdings announced a sweeping revamping plan on Monday,
aimed at saving $100 million a year. But the company warned that
the measures could significantly reduce earnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What maintains the trading range is that you have earnings
estimates that are still too high and are coming down,'' Cripps
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profits are being squeezed at the margin because of higher
costs,'' he said. However, stocks will continue to move higher
because ``I don't know where else you put your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Near-term, however, investors are unlikely to place big bets on
stocks, said Andrew Brooks, vice president in charge of equity
trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. Instead, stocks
prices are likely to tread water this week as investors await the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan's testimony before
Congress on Wednesday, as well as May retail sales and producer
price reports due later this week, he said.

AOL TO PAY PREMIUM PRICE FOR CHAT SERVICE  
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all the frenzy over the Internet, entrepreneurs
have been able to create and sell companies for huge sums without
ever earning a dime. But in what may be a record of financial
weightlessness, America Online said Monday that it would pay at
least $287 million for a company that has never taken in a penny in
revenue and has no plans to start charging money.
</P>
<P>
   What the company, an Israeli firm called Mirabilis Ltd., does
have is users, 12 million of them who spend an average of more than
an hour a day on its Internet chat service.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, America Online hopes to put advertising on the chat
service and sell its members products and services. ``When you talk
about making money on the Internet, no one is doing more than
America Online,'' said Robert Pittman, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the Internet today to the early days of cable
television. MTV, which Pittman helped start, only took in $500,000
in revenue its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis is highly regarded among savvy Internet users for its
chat service, known as ICQ (shorthand for ``I seek you''), which
enables them to detect when fellow users are on line and to
communicate instantly with them. With no promotion other than word
of mouth, it has already achieved something of a cult status,
growing at more than 50,000 subscribers a day.
</P>
<P>
   ICQ is attractive to America Online because it appeals to a much
younger and technologically sophisticated audience than the
mainstream America Online brand. ``If this were 1980, think
underground album-oriented rock radio,'' Pittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ICQ users spend an average of 75 minutes a
day on the service, compared with less than 10 minutes a day for
highly touted search and directory services such as Yahoo and
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet stock analysts praised the deal as an inexpensive
way for America Online to increase its customer relationships. The
company's shares rose $1 Monday, to $84.25.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some skepticism that chat services, no matter how
popular, will turn into big money makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail, chat and instant messaging are not good advertising
platforms,'' said Bo Peabody, the chief executive of Tripod, an
online community service recently bought by Lycos. ``When you chat,
you look at what you are writing, not what other people are
writing,'' he said. Moreover, advertisers worry that their
advertisements will be associated with content that they do not
control and may be embarrassing. As a result, chat services that do
take ads receive the lowest rates of any type of Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped other companies from buying similar
services. Most notably, Microsoft paid a reported $400 million for
Hotmail, which offers free e-mail services. (Unlike ICQ, Hotmail
had started to sell advertisements and had other plans for selling
services.)
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis also helps America Online's efforts to expand
overseas. About 40 percent of ICQ's members are in the United
States, 40 percent are in Europe, and the rest are spread
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis was founded two years ago by four Israelis in their
early 20s. With a few million dollars in backing from local
investors, it has built one of the most popular services on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Vardi, Mirabilis' chairman, said the company had been in
discussions with a number of suitors since last August. But they
were initially put off by the price the company wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were quite amazed with our growth and it took them a
while to come to grips with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America Online agreed to pay $287 million in cash upfront and up
to $120 million in additional payments starting in 2001, depending
on the performance of Mirabilis, which will continue to be run as a
separate subsidiary in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's own Internet chat service, AOL Instant
Messenger, will continue to be a separate product mainly to allow
Internet users to communicate with those on America Online's
service. America Online will also provide some technical support to
Mirabilis.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody of Tripod said that since America Online now controlled
the two largest chat services it should embrace an open standard
that would allow the user of any chat service to send an instant
message to a user of a competing service, much as electronic mail
works now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that AOL has a monopoly on the instant messenger space,
I'm hopeful they will open the market to everyone,'' he said.
Tripod hopes to offer its own message service and such a standard
would help it break into the existing market.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online, said that
there were no standards for instant messages now, but that
``historically AOL supports open standards that gain critical mass
and acceptance by consumers.''

FTC FILES ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission filed antitrust
charges Monday against Intel Corp., accusing the company of
threatening and actually injuring three computer manufacturers,
including Compaq Computer Corp., in an attempt to coerce them into
turning over rights to patented technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Intel is accused of withholding information about
its chips that the computer makers _ Digital Equipment Corp.,
Intergraph Corp. and Compaq _ considered crucial to developing
their own products based on Intel microprocessors. At the same
time, Intel was sharing that information with the three companies'
competitors who were not involved in patent disputes with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the government's charges is the assertion that
Intel's pattern of withholding technical data as a weapon in patent
disputes stifles innovation in the microprocessor industry, thereby
enhancing Intel's dominant position.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, approved by a 3-1 vote of the commission Monday
afternoon, serves as a civil indictment of sorts that begins a
complex administrative and legal proceeding that could last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Intel said the suit was
``based upon a mistaken interpretation of the law and the facts,''
adding, ``The commission apparently questions whether Intel has the
legal right to assert its intellectual property rights as a defense
to an attack on its core microprocessor business.''
</P>
<P>
   While the general outline of the suit has been known for several
days, the addition of Compaq to the list of aggrieved companies
adds a new dimension to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives and lawyers, in meetings with FTC commissioners
last week, argued that the two other companies mentioned in the
suit, Intergraph Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., were not
currently major manufacturers of personal computers. As a result,
they said, Intel's withholding of proprietary information could not
have significantly harmed competition in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Compaq is the world's largest manufacturer of personal
computers. The government's suit asserts that Compaq sued Packard
Bell Electronics Corp. in 1994, charging that the company was using
patented Compaq technologies in its computers when, in fact, the
components in question had been supplied by Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to Compaq's assertion of its intellectual property
rights,'' the suit says, ``Intel cut off technical information''
about Intel microprocessors ``that Compaq needed to design systems
based on Intel's newest chips, even though that technical
information was widely available'' to other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives declined to comment Monday, but according to
the suit, Compaq quickly agreed to license the technology to Intel
to end the cut-off of information. As a result, Intel began
supplying the technical information once again, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of arm-twisting that the government is
particularly intent on stopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Intel can use its monopoly position in the market for
microprocessors to prevent other firms from enforcing their own
patents, other firms will have little incentive to invent new
features to challenge Intel's dominance,'' said William J. Baer,
director of the commission's Bureau of Competition, the office that
prepared the suit.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Monday, Intel did not directly respond to that
allegation, but it has long asserted its right to give or withhold
information about its microprocessors, the brains of a computer, as
it sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   F. Thomas Dunlap, Intel's vice president and general counsel,
said Monday: ``For years Intel has shared its intellectual property
and early samples of its products with a number of key customers.
These customers work with Intel to develop products for the market
on a mutually beneficial basis. At the same time, for more than 10
years, Intel has taken unprecedented steps to ensure that all of
our activities and policies are in full compliance with existing
law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intel executives, in interviews, conceded every factual element
of the case. They differ with the government, however, in asserting
that they had every right to take the actions they took against
Compaq, Digital and Intergraph, and they say that Intel would take
similar actions again if the need arose.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it will argue the case based on the premise
that the government is trying to enforce a new legal theory, that
``because you are successful, the legal rights you had to control
your intellectual property no longer apply,'' said Chuck Mulloy, a
company spokesman. ``What's at work here is a fundamental
disagreement about what the law says. And we think we have 100
years of case law on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap added, ``The commission's decision today signals that
they want to change the very laws upon which we've based our
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer, on the other hand, said that the commission was pursuing a
traditional antitrust action. Intel, he said, ``remains free to
bargain with other companies over patent rights and to protect
those rights in court.'' But he added, ``Under the law, Intel is a
monopoly, and it's illegal under antitrust law for a monopolist to
wield its monopolistic power to prevent others from challenging its
dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings last week, Baer said, Intel executives told the
commissioners: ``All we did was put speed bumps in the way of some
of our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In those meetings last week, Intel executives also argued that
their actions had not actually harmed Intergraph or the other
affected companies in any significant way. But in an interview
Monday, Intergraph's chairman, Jim Meadlock, called that idea
``absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't be on the front end of the marketplace in this
business, then you can't compete,'' Meadlock said. And, he added,
when Intel withheld technical information about upcoming versions
of the Pentium II microprocessors, Intergraph could not design
updated computers as quickly as the company's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, ``we went from first in the work-station
marketplace in 1996 to forth or fifth. For us, this is a very
serious business.''

COMMENTARY: LET'S PLAY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since everyone is giving President Clinton travel advice, I'll
chime in too: On your way home from China, stop in Iran. Yes, Iran.
Invite yourself. Don't make this upcoming trip to China just about
the last crisis. Make it about the next one. Looked at a map of
South Asia lately? China's got the bomb. India's got the bomb.
Pakistan's got the bomb. Let's see, who's next to Pakistan ...
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably only a matter of time, a decade or less, before
Iran, for its own geostrategic reasons, develops or acquires a
nuclear device. Who knows, maybe Pakistan, reeling from sanctions,
will sell Iran one. The only question is what regime will be in
power in Tehran with its finger on the trigger. There is a struggle
now under way in Iran over exactly that question. The outcome of
that struggle is a vital U.S. strategic interest. It must be
defined as such, and it must be acted upon as such.
</P>
<P>
   If Iran obtains a nuclear bomb and the most radical ayatollahs
are in charge there, it will further undermine stability in the
Middle East. If Iran obtains nuclear technology and the moderate
forces now on the rise there can consolidate their hold on Iranian
politics, it is possible that Iran can once again be a bulwark for
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It is time the United States stopped debating whether to try to
bolster the moderate _ yes, moderate _ new Iranian President,
Mohammed Khatami, and started thinking about far-reaching ways to
strengthen him and the popular forces behind him. Washington should
be doing everything it can to encourage U.S.-Iran contacts _ from
soccer to diplomatic dialogues to cultural exchanges _ and to lay
out a specific road map of what it wants from Iran now, and what
Iran could expect in return. It's time for a Nixon-to-China-like,
bold U.S.-Iran initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping, or at least slowing down, Iran's acquisition of
nuclear technology must remain a top U.S. objective, even if it
means sanctioning Russian nuclear-export companies. It is necessary
for the stability of the Middle East, but it is not sufficient. If
we focus only on preventing Iran from going nuclear by isolating
it, without also focusing on who in Iran has his finger on the
trigger, we will be making a strategic blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up! Smell the Turkish coffee! The Iranian people stunned
Tehran's hard-line leadership last year by rejecting the
conservative candidates and electing Khatami in a landslide,
embracing his platform of permitting greater cultural, personal and
political freedoms. Ever since then, a low-grade civil war has been
under way in Iran between the pro- and anti-Khatami forces.
</P>
<P>
   Last month two senior clergymen on Iran's watchdog Council of
Guardians attacked Khatami for his policies of opening Iran to the
world. Two weeks ago Iran's supreme religious guide and chief
hard-liner, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suddenly showed up at Tehran
University to address the students in an effort to puncture the
huge outpourings of support there for President Khatami. After the
commander of the Revolutionary Guards told a closed meeting of his
officers that he would ``cut the necks and tongues'' of Iran's new
liberal press, he was denounced and had to back off his remarks,
saying he had been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important forces in Iran today are the students, the
women and the middle classes broadly defined,'' said Shaul Bakhash,
an Iran expert at George Mason University. ``Those forces, all of
which are militating for a more open society and the rule of law,
are strengthened today, not weakened, by Iran's economic
development and its interaction with the West. The way to
strengthen these forces further is by helping Khatami further open
Iran internationally and to develop it rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would advance U.S. interests in the Middle East more
than if this struggle is won by those who want to see Iran become a
law-abiding member of the world community. The United States cannot
bring about an end to Saddam Hussein, or produce a radical
Arab-Israeli breakthrough, or really prevent the spread of nuclear
technology in the Middle East, without a different Iran. Whether
Iran is actually capable of being a pivot of stability is unclear.
It needs to be tested. But the potential is there. Unlike elsewhere
in the Middle East, Iran is the only country where the people
themselves are now leading a genuine movement for change.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 20 years, Iran is in play. So let's play.

SCIENCE WATCH: OIL SPILLS? ASK A HAIRDRESSER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ohio, Mass.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cleaning up oil spills could turn out to be easy, if people just
use their heads. Or at least their hair.
</P>
<P>
   It is an idea the space agency has field-tested _ or
ditch-tested, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from Phillip McCrory, an Alabama hairdresser who,
as he puts it, ``walks around in the stuff all day'' in his
Huntsville salon. In 1989, McCrory saw television footage of an
otter soaked in oil from the Exxon Valdez spill. ``That's when the
light went off,'' he said. If the otter's fur soaked up oil, would
human hair do the same?
</P>
<P>
   McCrory went straight to the experimental stage. He built a test
otter by stuffing four pounds of human hair into a pair of tights,
filled his son's wading pool with water, dumped a gallon of used
motor oil on top and heaved in the hair. ``In two minutes the water
was crystal clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering gave way to figuring. How much hair is thrown out
every day? If there are more than 200,000 salons in America, he
figured, 200,000 pounds a day would be an extremely conservative
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, some of McCrory's customers from NASA's Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville put him in touch with Maurice Hale, a
technology transfer expert. When some diesel oil spilled in a ditch
at the center, McCrory made a rough filter _ 16 pounds of hair in a
barrel. When the tainted water was pumped through, it came out
containing 17 parts per million of oil _ clean enough to dump in a
sewer.
</P>
<P>
   The secret is that every hair shaft is covered with tiny
cuticles _ ``like fish scales,'' McCrory said _ that give the
surface tension of oil, which cannot bind with water, something to
cling to.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent lab tests with Hale yielded the estimate that 1.4
million pounds of hair in re-usable mesh pillows could have soaked
up the 11 million gallons spilled by the Exxon Valdez in about a
week. By contrast, Exxon spent $2 billion on a lengthy cleanup that
captured only about 12 percent of the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Zapping Dust Mites
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are exploring a new way to get rid of hazardous dust
mites: by attacking their chemical communication system, as an
alternative to the standard labor-intensive bedroom-cleaning
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, the mites get as snug as bugs in a rug, most likely
the one by your bed. They pack into clusters to store water between
their tiny bodies. And in order to cluster, they recognize their
fellow mites by a chemical, as yet unknown.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists can interrupt that chemical message system, the
bugs would stay apart, dry out and die, said Emmett Glass, a
researcher in internal medicine in the College of Medicine and
Public Health at Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Dust mites frequently cause asthma, which affects 15 percent of
humans. Most asthma sufferers are allergic to dust mites, making
them the most common indoor allergen, even ahead of mold. Mites
devour the skin cells shed at night by humans and excrete proteins
that can touch off asthma and allergy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The research team is studying how the mites' message system
works and how they might interrupt it, said Glass. The team's work
appeared in a recent issue of the journal Experimental and Applied
Acarology.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting Collapsed Lungs
</P>
<P>
   A collapsed lung has a random way of reopening as air presses in
from a life-support system, and tissue damage is more likely if the
air pressure is not varied in a random pattern, scientists suggest.
</P>
<P>
   A team at Boston University said that mechanical ventilators
should supply air with randomized pressure that shifts between a
little more and a little less of the normal breath. Such shifts,
they said, will best reopen the closed regions without damage to
the tiny cells that take in the oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long known that the air forced in by ventilators
can cause harm to lungs. A new computer model of lung injury by the
Boston University scientists, described in May in the journal
Nature, shows how the lung pops open in sudden bursts that expose
large surface areas available for gas exchange, or breathing.
</P>
<P>
   They say that randomly varying the amount of air coming in, from
breath to breath, can decrease possible damage to tissues and
maximize oxygen intake.

LAWYERS AGREE TO SEPARATE TRIAL FOR CISNEROS, EX-LOVER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
and a special prosecutor agreed Monday to separate conspiracy
trials for the one-time Cabinet member and his former lover.
</P>
<P>
   The move by independent counsel David Barrett signals possible
cooperation by the woman, Linda Jones, in the case and makes
approval of the separate trials a formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it's in the government's best interest,''
Mathew Rosengart, the associate independent counsel, told reporters
following a 2-1/2-hour hearing before U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin also is expected to rule on other motions to sever the
trials of John Rosales and Sylvia Arce-Garcia, who were assistants
to the former housing official, from the government's case against
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   The four defendants are accused in a 21-count indictment of
lying to the FBI and Internal Revenue Service about $250,000
Cisneros allegedly paid Jones in exchange for her silence about the
highly publicized affair in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros has acknowledged having had an extramarital affair with
Jones _ then known as Linda Medlar _ while he was mayor of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales' lawyer, Reid Weingarten, argued that publicity and
evidence in the government's case against Cisneros would be unfair
to his client, who is accused of playing a minor role in the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not even a fly on an elephant's backside,'' Weingarten
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arce-Garcia's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said his client ``was even
smaller'' than an insect on the pachyderm.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengart countered that the independent counsel would produce
circumstantial and direct evidence to prove its case against
Rosales and Garcia-Arce.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Monday was marked by verbal outbursts by government
and defense lawyers to the point that Sporkin had to admonish them
to ``put the swords down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that life is too short,'' the judge said
following a flurry of shouts.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin is expected to file written rulings on the motions
argued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he set a July 20 hearing for arguments on the defense
motions attacking the validity of 88 tapes of telephone
conversations and boxes of documents from Jones' home in Lubbock,
Texas. The government wants to use the tapes as evidence in the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings are the heart of the government's case against
Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who headed the Department of Housing and Urban
Development from 1993 through 1996, is scheduled to go to trial on
Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former San Antonio political fund-raiser, waived her
right to appear in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She is serving a three-year, six-month sentence in a federal
prison in Texas after pleading guilty to a 28-count indictment for
money laundering, bank fraud and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges were brought against Jones in Texas and grew out
of the independent counsel's initial investigation into allegations
against Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million probe was launched in 1995 after Jones told the
tabloid television show ``Inside Edition'' during a paid interview
that Cisneros lied to the FBI about money he paid her after their
1988 affair.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros told FBI agents he had paid Jones about $60,000 before
his nomination to be housing.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel said the payments actually reached
$250,000, including roughly $73,000 that was paid after Cisneros
took office at HUD. Those payments included two $8,000 deposits
Cisneros made to Jones' relatives to help her buy a home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the extramarital affair was public, the indictment
stated Cisneros paid Jones ``in order to ensure her public silence
regarding, among other things, their relationship and the nature,
purpose and extent of his payments to her and to another woman, so
that he could be nominated, confirmed and serve as secretary to
HUD.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of a second woman referred to in the indictment has not
been made public.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros currently is president of the Spanish-language
television network Univision. Arce-Garcia is an aide to Cisneros at
the network. Rosales is still employed by HUD.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the Roman Catholic
prelate who presides over an Indian-dominated diocese in southern
Chiapas state, has stepped down as mediator in peace talks between
the government and the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In a homily on Sunday, Ruiz, who has been mediator since the
earliest days of the conflict in 1994, accused the government of
``abandoning the path of dialogue'' and promoting a ``constant and
growing aggression'' against him and his diocese.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation represents a low point in the peace
negotiations, which have been stalled since late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a cease-fire is in effect, factional village
conflicts have proliferated since January as the government has
stepped up a campaign to reassert control in regions where the
Zapatistas have grown strong.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have accused Ruiz of being partial to the
Zapatistas. In a recent speech President Ernesto Zedillo criticized
``theologians of violence'' who, he said, were aggravating the
conflict, a comment that was widely understood as referring to the
bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The government leaked to the press a letter from last year that
another bishop in Chiapas wrote to Ruiz, questioning him about a
flier circulating in the diocese that advocated armed violence. The
government did not release a response in which Ruiz said the flier
had not been written by anyone in the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have systematically opposed violence and no one among us
preaches it or promotes it,'' Ruiz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials made no secret that they hoped to force
Ruiz, who has been an outspoken critic of the government, to step
aside. Several greeted his stepping down with delight.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Ruiz noted that seven priests had been expelled
from Chiapas in recent years, that four priests had been jailed on
charges that were dismissed in court and that 40 churches had been
closed or destroyed by pro-government factions.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry replied that it was ``absolutely false''
that there was persecution of the Catholic church in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In his 38 years at the head of the Diocese of San Cristobal de
las Casas, Ruiz's tenacious advocacy of Indian equality has earned
him enemies within the government and among more conservative
members of the Catholic hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare statement Sunday, Pope John Paul II praised the work
of Mexican bishops who work in Indian regions, although he did not
mention Ruiz by name.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the Zapatista movement, which began with a brief
armed uprising, are a few hundred armed guerrillas hidden in jungle
canyons. But it has spread into many Indian villages through
unarmed grass-roots groups.

NRA ELECTS CHARLTON HESTON PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Iowa) (ja) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With a courtly bow, Charlton Heston acknowledged
a loud, standing ovation Monday by the National Rifle Association
board of directors, which voted overwhelmingly to make the actor
the NRA's 56th president.
</P>
<P>
   While Heston ran unopposed to succeed Marion Hammer, and only
one of 76 board members voted against him, the election was a
highlight of the association's annual convention. The gathering
drew about 40,000 of the NRA's 2.8 million members to a city where
almost one person a day dies by a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Edward Rendell met elsewhere Monday with gun makers to
discuss possible lawsuits by the city to recoup from them the
health-care costs of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, 73, a veteran of almost 100 motion pictures, said one of
his first priorities would be to restore the image of the NRA,
which many members contend has been tarnished by opponents who
characterize it as extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to reverse the trends of the last 10 or 15 years, to a
large extent driven by the media, to demonize the NRA,'' Heston
said in an interview after the vote, which elevated him from first
vice president. ``It's not fair; you're not supposed to play that
way. But I am a reasonably good communicator, and I think I can be
useful, and sometimes successful, in shifting people.''
</P>
<P>
   The election was held shortly after the meeting was interrupted
by an incident that some members said would reinforce the group's
harsh image.
</P>
<P>
   A member from Iowa, Ken Brodbeck, had been videotaping his wife,
Sally, a director, as she addressed the NRA officers.
</P>
<P>
   After Brodbeck ignored two security guards who quietly told him
that taping inside board meetings violated NRA rules, one guard
grabbed him by the throat and threw him to the ground, according to
Brodbeck and several witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Brodbeck's wife ran over and screamed, ``What did you do to my
husband?'' An emergency team was summoned, but Brodbeck said he did
not need treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the accounts of several witnesses, the NRA's security
manager, Tris Barry, who was one of the guards, said Brodbeck
simply fell out of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Russell, the guard who witnesses said grabbed Brodbeck,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Heston brushed off the incident, saying it had
been staged by opponents of the leadership ``to stir up trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor and director, I can tell you it was very bad
acting,'' he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Internal squabbles aside, Heston considered the larger
challenges ahead and said that he would be happy just to reach the
large numbers of Americans who have ambiguous feelings about the
country's largest gun group. Vocal opponents of the NRA, he
conceded, are probably beyond the persuasive powers of his mellow
voice and movie-star looks that made him a convincing Moses in
``The Ten Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   One such opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who favors
tighter restrictions on gun ownership, wasted no time in attacking
Heston as the wrong choice for an organization seeking mainstream
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Charlton Heston wants to lead the NRA out of the
wilderness, into the promised land, then they have to abandon their
extremist positions,'' Schumer said in a telephone interview. ``The
idea that he is a moderate is wrong. He is as extreme as the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who has appealed to Heston to
support safety locks on guns, a position the NRA opposes, said:
``Even a good messenger can't make something out of a bad
message.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wherever Heston falls on the ideological spectrum, he gives the
NRA an imposing force for its message that gun ownership by
law-abiding people has less to do with crime than do broken
families and a broken criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those who traditionally carry the NRA banner into
Congress and state legislatures, including Wayne LaPierre, the
executive vice president, and Tanya Metaksa, the chief lobbyist,
Heston said he would devote most of his energy to speaking to
average Americans, calling it ``the most useful thing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his goals, he said, is to expand NRA membership among
women and minorities. The association is composed overwhelmingly of
white males, and officials estimated that only 10 to 15 percent of
the members are women. They said they have no idea how many people
in the organization are members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women,'' Heston said, ``make up the fastest-growing group of
handgun owners, especially single women. They are also very good
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Heston also said he would try recruiting people who consider gun
ownership a private matter. ``In Hollywood, a community I know
better,'' he said, reprising a line he used often over the last few
days, ``there are more gun owners in the closet than homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   While statements like that invariably outrage opponents of the
NRA, they are wildly appreciated by association members, who are
convinced that Heston's views represent those of the majority of
Americans and that by the strength of his charismatic personality
and passion for gun-owners' rights, he can win over converts to
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a great leader for the NRA and a great spokesman,''
said Oliver North, the former Iran-contra figure who was elected to
the board Monday. ``After all, when you hear the voice of Moses
speak, you know people are going to pay attention.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DETROIT _ While it may only seem as if the Ice Age lasted longer
than the 1997-98 National Hockey League season, the end to the
longest year in hockey history is in sight.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the greater good of the NHL, however, the league is hoping
the playoffs can last a bit longer _ in terms of games _ than they
have the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When the Detroit Red Wings and Washington Capitals open the
Stanley Cup finals tonight at Joe Louis Arena, a nagging streak of
sweeps will be in place.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Detroit beat Philadelphia in four games. The year
before, Colorado swept Florida. In 1995, New Jersey swept Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   With TV ratings for this year's playoffs down substantially on
both Fox and ESPN, a compelling, dramatic, seven-game finals would
help the NHL regain some fading glory.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it is not shaping up that way. The Red Wings are
heavily favored to become the first NHL team to win consecutive
championships since Pittsburgh in 1991-92. The Capitals are making
their first appearance in the finals, and even their coach raised
the possibility of a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have our hands full,'' said Washington coach
Ron Wilson. ``Not too many people are going to give us a chance.
Everyone probably thinks that we'll go out in four straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, of course, has been known to use the media to try to
manipulate things, so his observation must be taken with several
grains of salt.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Red Wings have shown throughout this year's
playoffs that they are capable of sweeping away Washington, a team
that finished in the middle of the pack in the Eastern Conference
during the regular season and has scant playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won last year,'' said Washington center Joe Juneau.
``Obviously, they have all these big names on their team, and I
think that any team facing the Red Wings in the finals would be the
underdog. I'm not surprised. I'm not thinking about it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings know what it's like to be the new kids on the
block. In 1995, they were caught up in the distractions of the
final series and swept away by New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the ultimate disappointment in the series against New
Jersey,'' said Detroit center Kris Draper. ``We were cocky. We had
a lot of young kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we knew it, the series was over. Last year, we took a
100-percent businesslike approach to playing the Philadelphia
Flyers. That's exactly what we have to do. Washington is obviously
excited to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Only five Capitals have been this far. Esa Tikkanen (five) and
Brian Bellows (one) are the only Caps with Stanley Cup rings. That
disadvantage is of little concern to Washington goaltender Olaf
Kolzig, who has provided the impetus for the Caps to reach the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the defending Stanley Cup champions, and they are
playing well,'' said Kolzig. ``You guys (media) can write all you
want about how it's going to be a sweep, but we don't believe that.
And I'm sure they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job to go out and prove everybody wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings may not be able to sweep the Capitals, who have a
hot goaltender in Kolzig, two high-powered scoring lines and a
capable defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps, however, will be taking a huge step up in class when
they face Detroit. Washington got out of the East by beating Boston
(the No. 5 seed), Ottawa (No. 8) and Buffalo (No. 6).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a lot like us,'' said Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman.
``They've got two lines that have scored in the playoffs and two
lines that can shut down other lines. One thing you wonder about in
these situations is how your team will do against a team you
haven't played that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington might be a team that some people are taking
lightly, but we aren't. We know that they've done very well on the
road in the playoffs (7-1), and that's been their big secret.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that for the Caps to have any chance, Kolzig will
have to continue his sizzling goaltending. He has been nicknamed
``Godzilla'' because of his 6-3, 225-pound stature, which limits
opposing players' openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really come into his own,'' said Detroit left wing
Brendan Shanahan. ``When you face a great goaltender, you really
can't change your habits. I think the worst thing you can do when
you are playing against a great goaltender is think about him too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you start trying to pick corners and change your
mind on shots, that's when the goaltender already has the advantage
on you. The idea is to shoot the puck on net and try to get traffic
in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood has been solid, posting two
shutouts against Dallas in the Western Conference finals, but he
also has allowed several soft goals that caused some people to
wonder how he will react under the pressure of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood was the backup to Mike Vernon when the Red Wings won the
Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every player makes mistakes,'' said Osgood.
``Forwards, defense, goalies. That's why it's a team game.
Everybody covers for everybody. That's what makes our team such a
good team. We play as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be honest. Our team thinks not about the mistakes we've made;
we think what we're going to do about it. We don't dwell on things.
It's over the minute it happens, really.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Wings ride their high-powered offense of Sergei
Fedorov, Steve Yzerman and defensemen Nicklas Lidstrom to another
title, they will give Bowman two back-to-back titles in the 1990s.
He was the coach of the 1992 Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be difficult to keep a team intact,'' said Bowman,
trying to explain why five teams have won the Stanley Cup in the
last five years. ``We have a lot of teams that are pretty close,
and with a good offseason you can make a lot of strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the biggest difficulty is complacency. You have a
bit of success, and you sit back, and then all of a sudden there
are new teams that come right by you. We've done a good job this
year in that regard. We feel comfortable with each other. We're
still hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that appetite for winning has been a never-ending
war of attrition in a season interrupted for 16 days in February to
allow NHL players to take part in the Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, having the defending champs matched against an
upstart newcomer could provide some compelling hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But only if the Capitals cooperate and win a game or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into this series with a lot of respect for the Red
Wings, but we are not intimidated,'' said Wilson. ``We've got some
guys like (Brian) Bellows and (Esa) Tikkanen who have been here
before. We're not a young team, so intimidation shouldn't be a
factor. I don't think I even have to talk to our players about the
word intimidation.''

LAWMAKERS WANT TO EXEMPT WHEAT FROM SANCTIONS AGAINST PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fearful that the economic and political fallout
from last month's nuclear tests will devastate the Northwest wheat
industry, regional lawmakers are pushing the Clinton aministration
to find a way to prevent sanctions against Pakistan from affecting
Washington state's most valuable agricultural export.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash, will be joined by at
least 32 other House members in introducing legislation barring
President Clinton from including agricultural products as part of
the sanctions used to punish nations that test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has suggested he might try to amend
the defense budget to accomplish the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Sens. Gorton, Patty Murray, D-Wash., Max Baucus,
D-Mont., and Washington Gov. Gary Locke have pleaded the case of
Northwest wheat growers to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Locke predicted that 20 percent of the state's wheat growers
could be driven out of business if Pakistan is prevented from
buying U.S. wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unilateral sanctions don't work, they're ineffective, and they
hurt the American farmer,'' said Nethercutt, whose district
includes southeast Washington, where the wheat industry is
concentrated. ``If we can't sell to Pakistan, some other country
will, and we will lose that market. That's an unacceptable
consequence of bad American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative activity comes because of an unusual feature of
the wheat market in the Pacific Northwest. Unlike much of the grain
grown in the United States, which is red, the vast majority of
grain grown in the Northwest is white and resembles indigenous
Pakistani wheat. As a result, Pakistan over the past five years has
become a huge importer of Northwest wheat. Any interruption would
be devastating for Washington's wheat farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan imports about $500 million worth of wheat each year, of
which about half comes from the Pacific Northwest, according to the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state's 13,000 wheat farmers already are suffering
from depressed prices and oversupply, and the problem is expected
to be exacerbated by a bumper crop this year. Wheat, which costs
about $4 a bushel to produce, is now selling for less than $3,
according to the state Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pakistan was the largest single buyer of Pacific
Northwest white year, purchasing 37 percent of the crop, according
to the Washington State Wheat Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions would have a devastating effect on the price of
wheat and the ability to move it at all,'' said Jim Jesernig, the
director of the state Department of Agriculture. ``Once you have a
market taken off limits for political reasons, the usual drill is
for our competitors to come in and take that market over, and
that's a market you're not going to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as required under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act, has
imposed broad sanctions against India and Pakistan because those
countries conducted underground nuclear tests last month. The
sanctions, designed to deter testing, affect development
assistance, military sales and exchanges, trade in specified
technology, U.S. financial assistance, guarantees and credits,
loans and credits by U.S. banks to those two governments, and
denial of support within international financial institutions for
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Although food products are generally exempted from sanctions,
the wheat industry may be affected because Pakistan uses
U.S.-backed credits to buy the wheat. Clinton administration
officials are debating whether the law allows them to exempt those
credits from sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No decision has been made, and our legal experts are currently
analyzing the construction and intent'' of the law, said State
Department spokesman Jim Desler.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Clinton administration finds an exemption from
sanctions for the credits Pakistan uses to buy wheat, wheat growers
worry that the other sanctions will make Pakistan ineligible for
credits or unwilling to continue buying from the United States. A
similar concern faces the Washington state pea and lentil industry,
which sells 5 to 7 percent of its product to India.
</P>
<P>
   Locke suggested that if Clinton can't find an exemption for
wheat, he should take other steps to protect the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (an exemption) is not possible, it is essential that our
country have agreements with the major food exporting nations that
they will not supply Pakistan with wheat,'' Locke wrote to Clinton.
``Otherwise, the penalty for the nuclear testing will not be levied
against Pakistan or India, but rather against the Pacific Northwest
wheat growers.''

FDA WITHDRAWS A HEART DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Texas)  (lb) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than one year after it was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration, the prescription heart drug Posicor
was pulled off pharmacy shelves in 38 countries Monday, amid
mounting evidence that it is dangerous, and possibly lethal, when
used in combination with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, made by Roche Laboratories of Nutley, N.J., is used to
treat high blood pressure and the chest pains known as angina,
particularly in the elderly. It is used by 400,000 people
worldwide, including 200,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials have long known that it did not mix well with
certain other medications. Over the last few months, however, the
list of drugs that cause toxic interactions with Posicor has grown
so long _ 26 in all, from antihistamines to antibiotics to
cholesterol-lowering medications and the cancer drug tamoxifen _
that the agency asked Roche last week to withdraw it from the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Roche, which spent a decade and several hundred million dollars
developing the drug, complied, describing the decision as
voluntary. Both the FDA and the company urged patients who are
taking Posicor not to stop taking the drug, but rather to consult
their doctors as quickly as possible to find an alternative
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too complicated to try to use a drug in the elderly
population when you have more than 25 different drugs that you
can't use it with,'' said Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ``We were going
to the company and saying, `Let's take it off the market now before
we get into a bad situation.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely rare for the FDA, which is widely regarded as
being extremely safety-conscious, to have to withdraw a drug once
it has been approved. Lumpkin said that the only such withdrawals
in the past decade were Posicor and the popular diet drug
combination known as fen-phen, which was taken off the market last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the agency has been been under intense
pressure from congressional Republicans to speed up its
drug-approval process; it has given its imprimatur to a record
number of new drugs, 92, over the past two years. After Monday's
announcement, agency critics complained that the FDA is relaxing
its standards, particularly for ``me-too drugs'' like Posicor,
which imitate medicines that are already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one thing if this drug were a significant
breakthrough for treatment of this disease, and there were some
safety problems,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public
Citizen's Health Research Group, a monitoring organization in
Washington. ``But when you've got a drug that no one remotely
thinks is any better than any of the other eight or nine already on
the market, why for the purpose of public health or public safety
do you approve it?''
</P>
<P>
   But Lumpkin defended the FDA, saying that patients and doctors
benefit from having a wide variety of drugs, and that there was no
way to know when Posicor was approved that it would be dangerous in
combination with so many other medications.
</P>
<P>
   Posicor, which is part of a class of medications known as
calcium channel-blockers, inhibits certain liver enzymes that
enable the body to eliminate other drugs. When the enzymes are not
working, those other drugs can build to toxic levels. ``The drug
itself is a pretty clean drug,'' Lumpkin said. ``The problem is its
interference with other drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Posicor went on the market last July, Lumpkin said, the
FDA has been monitoring it closely and has received dozens of
reports of adverse side effects _ including dangerously low heart
rate, irregular heartbeat and a breakdown of muscle that can cause
permanent damage to the kidneys _ in patients taking it in
combination with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports included 24 deaths, although how many were
actually caused by the medications is unclear, in part because the
patients taking them were so sick to begin with. Valerie Suga, a
spokeswoman for Roche, said that ``no causal link'' had been
established between Posicor and any deaths. But Lumpkin said agency
officials believed two or three of the fatalities could be directly
attributed to the drug combinations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Concerns about Posicor, which is also known by the generic name
mibefradil, first emerged in February 1997, when an independent
panel of expert scientists voted by a relatively slim margin, 5-3,
to advise the FDA to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who voted against approval was Dr. Lemuel Moye, a
biostatistician at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center
in Houston. Moye said he was troubled by preliminary data from an
ongoing study of 2,600 patients that suggested Posicor might cause
unusual electrical activity in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just could not justify voting for this drug in the presence
of a finding which may be a harbinger of danger,'' he said. ``I
wanted us to wait and see what this large clinical trial showed,
before voting for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that concern, and despite concerns about drug
interactions, the FDA approved Posicor on June 20. The approval
instructed Roche to warn doctors about the drug's effect on the
liver enzymes; the label specifically mentioned three drugs that
can lower the heart rate and should not be prescribed with Posicor.
</P>
<P>
   The drug went on the market in the United States and elsewhere a
month later; by last December, the FDA stepped up its warnings,
asking Roche to add two cholesterol-lowering drugs to the list of
medications that patients taking Posicor should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 2,600-patient clinical trial continued; Roche
officials were hoping it would prove that Posicor could be used to
treat not only high blood pressure and angina, but also congestive
heart failure. That might have given the company a reason to press
ahead with the drug in the face of all the warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Suga said, the study found that Posicor was no more
effective than a placebo for congestive heart failure. At the same
time, Ms. Suga said, it yielded additional reports of adverse drug
interactions, which the company shared with the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in full compliance and worked closely with them,'' Ms.
Suga said. As part of Monday's action, the company has written to
doctors telling them to stop prescribing Posicor immediately, and
has also set up a 24-hour telephone line for consumers and health
professionals: 1 (800) 205-4611.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue now is that the patients' well-being is of the
highest priority,'' Ms. Suga said. ``We are doing the most
responsible approach.''

NABISCO TO LAY OFF 3,000, OR 6 PERCENT OF ITS WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nabisco announced a $524 million reorganization plan
Monday that will include factory closings and the layoffs of more
than 3,000 of its 53,000 employees in an effort to pump new energy
into Cheese Nips, Fig Newtons and the rest of its languishing
cookie and cracker business. But Wall Street, caught off guard,
knocked the price of Nabisco stock down by more than 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nabisco revealed in a midmorning conference
call with analysts that cookie-and-cracker sales _ the lineup
includes such icons as Oreo, Mallomar, Saltines and Ritz _ are down
3 to 4 percent, worse than the flat sales that had been expected
this year. In addition, several businesses are expected to be sold
off, further diluting earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will cost an estimated $406 million, or $1.01
a share, in the current quarter, with another $118 million in
related expenses spread over the next 12 months, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will mean layoffs for an estimated 6 percent of the
company's work force worldwide. While savings this year of $35
million are expected as a result of the restructuring, marketing
spending will rise by $50 million, and another $70 million will be
spent to reconfigure the basic sales force, which, after being
reorganized in early 1997, has been blamed for a 4 percent drop in
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco carried out a reorganization almost exactly two years
ago that shed 8 percent of the work force, and there had long been
expectations that a similar move was in the works. But the extent
of the latest overhaul seemed to take several analysts by surprise.
``We didn't think the numbers would be this high, and the near-term
hits this big,'' said John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Following the conference call, Nomi Ghez, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., downgraded the stock from ``buy'' to ``market
perform,'' based on uncertainty about what earnings will be. ``Not
only is the reduction in estimates bigger than I thought,'' she
said, ``but there is still earnings uncertainty because they
indicated they will be reduced further by dilutive asset sales. We
really are faced with not knowing what earnings will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Holdings stock did a day-long swan dive, falling $6.625,
or 13.2 percent, to close at $39.875, in the biggest percentage
decline since it went public in January 1995. RJR Nabisco, which
owns 80.5 percent of the shares, fell $1.625, or 5.8 percent, to
close at $26.50.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Kilts, who became president and chief executive of Nabisco
in January, said the restructuring and marketing were necessary, in
tandem, to move the company forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you'd like to do is be in a situation where you can take
the cost out before you need to make the stepped-up investment,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``But where I see the competitive
situation today, we need to move quickly to invest against the
consumer and at the same time, attack our cost structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilts added that he expected the company to show improvement in
sales and earnings by next year. But that growth will be coming off
a diminished base, McMillin noted, estimating that earnings per
share will fall to $1.30 this year from the $1.60 forecast earlier
this year. Some analysts expect the earnings estimate to fall
further, once the effects of the asset sales become known. No
details were given Monday about what might be sold, though many
people said Nabisco's margarine business, which the company bought
from Kraft when Kilts was in charge there, was a likely candidate.
Kilts said there would be announcements by the third quarter, if
not during the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kilts is in the difficult position of having to grow earnings
at the same time there is pressure on volume and prices as well,''
said Martin Feldman, a director at Salomon Smith Barney. ``The
category is a very competitive one.'' During the conference call,
Feldman noted, the Nabisco chairman ``used the expression, `Biscuit
is struggling.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for Nabisco's doldrums range from changes in eating
habits _ more salsa and taco chips at America's get-togethers in
place of cheese and crackers _ to fierce rivalry from Keebler,
which has long spent more on advertising than Nabisco. ``You can
have the greatest brands in the world,'' said Emanuel Goldman, who
follows RJR Nabisco for PaineWebber, ``but if you don't manage them
right, there's someone out there to take your share.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Ghez said the problems were homegrown, stemming from a
decision made 18 months ago in which seasoned salespeople _ the
ones who go into supermarkets and other retail outlets and persuade
owners to stock their shelves with Nabisco products _ were let go
and replaced with younger, cheaper and less experienced people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous management was trying very hard to deliver numbers
they had promised that were unrealistic,'' she said. ``They looked
for places to cut costs, and they did it by damaging the most
important asset that they had. It's a case study of what you should
not do. In this business, your infrastructure, your nitty-gritty,
is so important. If you don't have the right people out there
selling to people they have a relationship with, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilts, who turned around similar disarray at Kraft, a unit of
Philip Morris, plans to change the sales force so that a single
customer-sales representative is assigned to specific stores and
oversees all sales activity in those stores. New compensation and
training programs will begin, as well as consumer promotions, using
the $70 million announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 million for marketing will be used to increase
advertising of brands like Snackwell's, once a star performer for
the company, as well as Fig Newtons and Ritz crackers. ``There are
a number of brands that merit our attention and support,'' Kilts
said. ``Oreos and Chips Ahoy are examples of where we have done a
good job with the marketing, and those brands are doing well.''

SEXUAL OVERDRIVE: THERAPIST SEEKS OUT ADDICTION'S CAUSES,
TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKENBURG, Ariz. _ If Bill Clinton calls, Dr. Patrick Carnes
will serve.
</P>
<P>
   If the president decides his sex drive is out of control, Carnes
is willing to head for the White House with his little black bag of
psychological remedies.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not waiting for the hotline to ring.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes, clinical director of sexual disorder services at The
Meadows addiction treatment facility, is a renowned expert on
urge-curbing.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, he has been at the vanguard of treatment for
sexual addiction, a disorder as real and troubling, he says, as
alcoholism, drug abuse or compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   It's a disease that breaks up marriages, destroys careers, and
saps money, health and reputations. It can result in bodily injury
and death.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual addiction is not a sign of poor moral instincts, Carnes
insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of choice or goodwill. It's not a matter of
character,'' he says. ``Sexual addicts have a very intact
conscience. . . . They make promises to stop, and they make an
effort to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention surrounding President Clinton's sexcapades has
heightened awareness of the issue, Carnes says. Therapists are
rejoicing that more addicts are seeking the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very grateful, profoundly grateful . . . It's been
a gift.``
</P>
<P>
   Carnes, who holds a doctorate in counseling psychology, was
asked to give expert testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit against
the president. He will not, however, judge whether Clinton actually
has a disorderly libido.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met the man,'' he says simply.
</P>
<P>
   But in the one-page affidavit he provided an Arkansas court
after interviewing Jones for half a day, he determined that she
was, indeed, emotionally damaged in 1991 by Clinton's alleged
request for oral sex in a Little Rock hotel room. He believes that
although no further harassment occurred and Jones' job as a state
employee never was threatened, she lived with continued fears of
reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes will share no further information from his examination of
Jones, keeping his findings confidential until her case goes to
trial. Then he will take the stand and render a more comprehensive
diagnosis. The judge in the case threw out Jones' suit, but that
decision is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt protective of Paula,'' he says, adding that he
personally likes the president and voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of the case have been fascinating to watch. It's
certainly not about justice. It's about the most powerful man in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He offers three theories for the beleaguered president's
reputation as a sexual aggressor:
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he doesn't have a problem and there have been unfair
and false accusations, or he has a problem and he will get help, or
he has a problem and he's getting advice ``not'' to get help.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnes despairs at the thought of the latter. Since entering the
field of addiction in the early 1970s and publishing his first
paper on sexual addiction in 1973 _ one of the first published
anywhere _ he has seen the devastation caused by a condition rooted
in childhood, the result of a repressive household or an
emotionally impoverished family.
</P>
<P>
   Most sex addicts, he says, were sexually, physically or
psychologically abused. Research has found that when they perform
an inappropriate act, they are repeating the abuse, ``re-creating
the neurochemical experience they had as a child, the erotic
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Addicts are not necessarily seeking a turn-on, he says: ``It's
not about orgasm.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sexual addiction can be about pain.
</P>
<P>
   Some sufferers engage in ``pain exchange,'' commonly known as
sadomasochism, in which they seek out physical abuse. Mistakenly
considered a victimless crime, the practice can result in severe
injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Some men injure themselves masturbating so vigorously that they
bruise or lacerate their genitals, requiring a trip to the doctor
or emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Other manifestations of sexual addiction include rape, child
molestation, voyeurism, peeping, procuring prostitutes (or
practicing prostitution), frequenting topless bars (or performing
in them), exhibitionism and ``intrusive sex'' _ making obscene
phone calls, touching or brushing against people inappropriately,
repeatedly telling dirty jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors might find themselves betraying their patients with
erotic touches. A clergy member might pursue parishioners sexually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a minirape,'' he says of professionals who betray.
``They know it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnes treated a Florida clergyman acclaimed for his
anti-pornography crusades who shocked his flock when he was
arrested for a pornography trade of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent news reports have spotlighted such risky sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   British singer George Michael was arrested for performing a lewd
act in a park restroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hustler'' publisher Larry Flynt was arrested for allegedly
peddling obscene videos, including to a 14-year-old boy. The
pornography industry is rife with sexual addicts, Carnes says.
</P>
<P>
   And in Seattle, a respected female teacher was jailed for having
an affair with a student who was 13 when the relationship began.
She has borne one child by the boy and is pregnant with a second.
</P>
<P>
   For Carnes, such cases are all too familiar. He says he sees
clients like the Seattle teacher ``all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't help themselves,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Though sexual aggression most often is perpetrated by men and
directed at women, ``we see it can happen the other way around.
Women can be victimizers.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of sexual addiction in the general population is
about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Addicts usually do not seek help until a crisis arises _ the
breakup of a marriage, an arrest, one more visit to the emergency
room.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is providing the newest outlet for sexual
appetites, Carnes says, offering as many as 50,000 pornographic Web
sites. Anonymity has made cybersex a popular clandestine activity _
but no less dangerous when users risk being introduced to deviants.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use can be costly in other ways. Carnes recalls one
patient who rang up $7,000 in weekly fees exploring pornographic
Web sites before being stopped. He'd been charging his bills to his
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to such compulsions, cybersex has become big business.
Two women working out of their garage in Seattle, Carnes says, are
making $60,000 a month helping clients find carnal Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Although technology has expanded the opportunity for pursuing
sexual activity, such behavior is not new. Sexual aberration has
been practiced since the beginning of time, Carnes says.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, ``if you were a woman, your chances of
getting through life without being raped were zip. . . . Those were
violent times.''
</P>
<P>
   Research on sexual addiction began in the 1970s, when similar
disorders such as compulsive gambling and compulsive shopping also
were identified.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, progress has been made in the understanding and
treatment of sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much happening,'' Carnes says. ``So much research
is coming out that's interesting. . . We're starting to talk about
it. There is an openness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although frisky Europeans sometimes accuse America of
prudishness, Carnes argues that intolerance for promiscuity signals
a maturing of the culture and indicates that we are moving out of
our collective adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have found that sexual violence is almost
nonexistent in societies that have achieved equality between men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about evolution . . . how men and women treat
each other and how we raise our children,'' Carnes says. ``That
changes the core of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexual addiction usually is accompanied by other addictions _
alcoholism, drug abuse. Only 13 percent of sex addicts are free of
other compulsions, Carnes says. ``It's a package deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other addicts, sex addicts alternate between bingeing and
purging, first engaging in voracious sex and then falling into what
Carnes calls ``sexual anorexia,'' or celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for sexual addiction works, he says. Addicts can
return to a nearly normal sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to be asexual,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although medications such as Prozac can help curb cravings,
behavioral modification has proved the best remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective treatment includes 10 components:
</P>
<P>
   _Participation in a 12-step program.
</P>
<P>
   _Treatment for concurrent addictions.
</P>
<P>
   _Doing the homework required for recovery.
</P>
<P>
   _Group therapy _ at least 175 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _Private therapy _ three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   _Family involvement.
</P>
<P>
   _Counseling for co-dependents.
</P>
<P>
   _Couples' therapy.
</P>
<P>
   _Finding a spiritual life, regardless of denomination or
religion.
</P>
<P>
   _A lifestyle of good nutrition and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Carnes says addicts need not remain slaves to their sex drives,
whether they are ordinary citizens or world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have the patient's cooperation,'' he says, ``the
prognosis is good.'' &QL;

CLINTON, ZEDILLO VOW TO IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS BETWEEN
U.S., MEXICO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton and President Ernesto Zedillo
pledged Monday to avoid a repeat of the secret sting operation in
which U.S. agents arrested more than two dozen Mexican bankers
without informing the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   The money laundering probe, dubbed ``Operation Casablanca,''
strained relations between the United States and Mexico, a tension
that was underscored dramatically as both leaders appeared at a
special United Nations summit on drug trafficking with differing
messages.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton appealed for international cooperation, Zedillo
countered with demands that national sovereignty must be respected.
The two later met privately at the presidential suite of the
Waldorf Astoria to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The two issued a joint communique in which they ordered their
attorneys general to ``develop a process for improved consultation
and collaboration on law enforcement operations of mutual interest
and avoid actions that could have undesirable effects on the
bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement appeared to signal that the United States would
not act on its own again.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. federal agents arrested 160 people, more than
two dozen of them Mexican bankers, on charges of operating a large
scale scheme to launder drug money. U.S. officials seized $87
million, two tons of cocaine and four tons of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Mexican nationals without informing the Mexican
government of the pending action prompted an outcry as some in
Zedillo's government called for the extradition of the federal
agents who carried out the arrests for violation of Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Casablanca was just the latest episode to create
friction between the United States and Mexico over the issues of
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Clinton called for
an end to the bickering between nations and for a united effort to
curtail both production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate between drug-supplying and drug-consuming nations
about whose responsibility the drug problem is has gone on too
long,'' Clinton told the Assembly. ``Pointing fingers is
distracting. It does not dismantle a single cartel, help a single
addict, prevent a single child from trying and perhaps dying from
heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo, frustrated by the U.S. actions, pointedly chastised
the United States, though not by name, for violating Mexico's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all must respect the sovereignty of each nation so that no
one becomes a judge of others, so that no one feels entitled to
violate other country's laws for the sake of enforcing its own,''
Zedillo retorted in his remarks to the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Zedillo were among 30 heads of state who spoke at
the opening session of the U.N.'s special forum.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing a campaign to cut U.S. drug demand and consumption in
half by 2007, Clinton announced the United States would begin a
five-year, $2 billion media campaign, funded from private and
public sources, to persuade children to stay away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States would create a ``virtual
university'' that would use modern technology to share drug
prevention and treatment news. He also announced the creation of an
international drug fellowship to enable foreign law officers to
train in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first leader to address the assembly, followed
immediately by Zedillo. Clinton sat at the United States desk and
listened intently as the Mexican president spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who has often blamed drug consumption in the United
States for Mexico's rising crime and social problems, maintained it
is the drug-producing and drug-transit nations that suffer the most
while the drug-consuming nations often are wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our men and women who die first combating drug
trafficking. It is our communities that are the first to suffer
from violence. Our institutions that are first to be undermined by
corruption. It is our governments that are the first to have to
shift valuable resources needed to fight poverty to serve as the
first bulwark in this war,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is why we have the right to demand that this strategy
be a balanced one. Balanced so that each country recognizes that in
the fight against drug trafficking we are all co-responsible. We
have the same rights and obligations,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the sting operation, Mexico also bristled in recent
years over a U.S. process that requires the State Department to
certify that the Mexican government is cooperating in combating
drugs. Corruption of Mexican government officials and police, as
the nation has emerged as a major transit point for cocaine, has
been a critical problem.
</P>
<P>
   Forest fires in southern Mexico have added to the strain as
smoke has blanketed Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
   The joint communique issued by Clinton and Zedillo, who met
formally for 40 minutes and then privately afterward, ``underscored
the importance of combating all drug trafficking, in conformity
with the laws in each country.'' It pledged to ``improve
cooperation, communication and information exchange between both
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials refused to interpret the communique, saying it
spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials also downplayed any tensions
between the two nations. ``Clearly, the mutual problem that both
nations face is what do we do about drugs and money laundering. And
we will continue to focus every effort on that. We will also
continue to work with the government of Mexico in every way
possible,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug czar, praised the U.S. Treasury
Department and Justice Department for ``aggressively pursuing
international crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm also persuaded, as are the rest of the
president's team, that we have to do this in partnership with our
neighbors and with absolute respect and deference for their own
sovereign institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton noted progress was being made in
curtailing drug abuse. He said drug use is down 49 percent in the
United States since 1979 and drug use by youths is stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we come here to say no nation is so large and powerful
that it can conquer drugs alone; none is too small to make a
difference. All share a responsibility to take up this battle.
Therefore, we will stand as one against this threat to our security
and our future,'' Clinton said.

CLINTON SEEKS MORE MONEY TO COUNTER GERM WARFARE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday asked Congress to add
some $300 million to next year's federal budget to better protect
Americans from germ and chemical attacks, a 30 percent rise in
financing, the White House announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that the increase is the
largest single supplement to the federal budget ever requested
specifically to bolster civilian and military defenses against
chemical and biological terrorism. The government is spending an
estimated $1 billion a year on such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The budget amendment for fiscal 1999, which begins this October,
includes $51 million to begin creating a civilian stockpile for
antibiotics and other medicines to be administered in the event of
a biological or chemical emergency. But surprisingly, the White
House did not request money for stockpiling vaccines to immunize
civilians against anthrax or other lethal biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said that the administration
had ruled out buying such vaccines this year in the hope of
developing improved ones that could immunize the nation's
population more cheaply and effectively two or three years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists faulted the government's go-slow approach on
vaccines as unwise given the emerging germ threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely disappointed that they have not gone forward
vigorously on a procurement program,'' Dr. Donald Henderson, the
scientist who led the global campaign that eradicated smallpox,
said in an interview. ``We need a Manhattan project to put
everything possible behind this. Two diseases, anthrax and
smallpox, represent the biggest problem. We have them to fear the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has begun vaccinating every member of the armed
services against anthrax, one of the deadliest known biological
agents. Administering the six-shot series and yearly boosters to
the entire military _ which now has 1.4 million troops on active
duty and another 1 million reservists _ is expected to take six
years and cost an estimated $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   That vaccination program will continue, administration officials
said. ``But vaccinating civilians is another thing entirely and
we're don't think we want to do that to do that with the vaccines
currently available,'' one official explained.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that a high-level interagency committee would
consider the vaccine issue again later this year. He also said that
the new budget amendment requests $10 million for the National
Institutes of Health to help conduct vaccine research, a two-thirds
increase in the $15 million a year now allocated for such research.
Clinton has also asked Congress to give the Centers for Disease
Control an extra $43 million to help public health centers and
laboratories better detect outbreaks of suspicious diseases and
share information among them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the administration is seeking a $16 million increase in
next year's budget for metropolitan medical strike teams, which
would increase the office's current budget from $4 to $20 million,
an almost five-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the lion's share of the supplement, some $190 million, would
go to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department
of Justice, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency for
equipping and training state and local officials to deal with a
biological or chemical weapons attack. There is no new money for
the Pentagon, which is currently spending about $50 million a year
training and equipping such officials. The Pentagon, said one
official, told the White House that it did not need additional
funds at this time. So far, it has trained so-called ``first
responders'' in 28 of the 120 cities chosen to receive such
training.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement reflects Clinton's growing alarm about the
germ-wielding terrorists who might cripple the nation by sowing
deadly epidemics. Clinton's personal interest, officials said, has
become a powerful force behind a series of secret federal meetings
and directives meant to bolster the nation's anti-terrorism work.
Clinton recently appointed a ``national coordinator'' to attacks
using weapons of mass destruction and to better prepare the country
for such an emergency. Richard Clarke, the coordinator, had pressed
hard for the extra money, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House statement issued Monday quoted Clinton as saying
it was ``vital that we take measures to safeguard the health and
safety of our civilian population.''
</P>
<P>
   The supplement is to be offset by budget reductions in other
agencies, especially the Justice Department, which is planning to
take $168 million out of its budget, most of its from its prison
administration budget.
</P>
<P>
   Reached late Monday evening, several aides to members of the
House and Senate appropriations committees said that Congress would
probably support most items of the Clinton's request. ``Chemical
and biological terrorism has become an equally grave concern here
on Capitol Hill,'' said one aide to a senior Republican Senate
appropriations committee member. In 1996, Congress approved a $1.2
billion supplement over five years to boost the nation's effort to
fight terrorism, some of which has been used to help foil chemical
and biological weapons attacks.

SCHOOL OF AMERICAN BALLET: STUDENTS STRUT THEIR STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ambition and execution of the 34th Annual
Workshop Performance on Saturday afternoon at the Juilliard Theater
would have been impressive even if it had been the work of adult
professionals. But the performers were students at the New York
City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Danilova, a popular faculty member who died last year,
was remembered in well-danced excerpts from ``Coppelia,''
choreographed by Danilova and George Balanchine and staged by Susan
Pilarre and Garielle Whittle. The cast was led by a polished Davena
Gross and an exalted Nicole Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Ostergren stepped in for the injured Megan Pepin in a
staging by Suki Schorer of Balanchine's ``Donizetti Variations,''
partnered by Adam Hendrickson in a performance of awesome aplomb.
Subsidiary roles were danced with endearing verve by Christina Hall
and Elizabeth Ford in a cast completed by a corps of soloist-level
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wheeldon's sophisticated new ``Soiree Musicale''
confirmed the choreographic gifts of this City Ballet dancer.
Wheeldon makes his performers look good in the suite of dances, set
to music by Samuel Barber and rooted in social-dance forms. An
ingeniously plotted, suggestive duet, which received a nicely
nuanced performance from Janie Taylor and Jared Angle, is at the
heart of the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gounod Symphony,'' one of the great beauties of the Balanchine
repertory, is a difficult ballet, and Rebecca Krohn, partnered by a
suave Jonathan Stafford, did not make the choreography look easy.
But despite her dizzyingly busy arms, quirky attack and apparent
nerves, Ms. Krohn stood out as a dancer of rare individuality. The
ballet was staged by Ms. Pilarre.
</P>
<P>
   The winners of the school's 1998 Mae L. Wien Awards were Ms.
Pilarre, for distinguished service, and Ms. Taylor and Hendrickson,
graduating dancers, for outstanding promise.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Williams, another popular faculty member who died last
year, was remembered in a tribute on Sunday night at the Juilliard
Theater. Williams was known for his training of male dancers. A
crystalline performance of an excerpt from Peter Martins'
``Gentilhommes,'' danced by the City Ballet principal Peter Boal
and eight advanced male students, did him proud.
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight was the witty, accomplished dancing of Damian
Woetzel and Ethan Stiefel in August Bournonville's ``Jockey
Dance,'' staged by Williams. The program also included
Bournonville's ``Flower Festival'' pas de deux, danced by Miranda
Weese and Nilas Martins, and the Rose Adagio, featuring Darci
Kistler.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' teaching in classes that were meditations on form and
execution was explored on film in excerpts from a PBS Dance in
America program and from Anne Belles' ``Reaching for Perfection.''
A rather dark but amusing side of Williams was reflected in
comments by Martins and Edward Villella. Anne Hoyrup talked
charmingly of Williams as a doting uncle. Other speakers included
Albert Bellas, chairman of the school board, and Robert Weiss, a
former pupil who now directs the Carolina Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The program ended poignantly with a poem, written and read by
Carlton Smith, director of security at the school. ``Goodbye, my
teacher, mentor and friend,'' Smith said. ``May your journey be
peaceful and bright.''

ADVERTISING: SWAPPING CUTTING-EDGE FOR CONVENTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Switzerland)   (mk) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Swiss company TAG Heuer AG is abandoning an unusually
striking style of advertising in favor of a more traditional
campaign that uses top athletes to sell its premium-priced sports
watches.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting-edge ads for TAG Heuer proved in the end to be a bit
too sharp for the company. The print ads had featured anonymous
athletes competing against seemingly insurmountable odds: a runner
jumping over hurdles made of razor blades or a swimmer racing
against sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Now the replacement print campaign features much more
conventional images: photographs of the star athletes accompanied
by beauty shots of the watches.
</P>
<P>
   The previous campaign was ``a bit distant and a bit cold,'' said
Philippe Champion, executive vice president at the TAG Heuer
headquarters in Marin, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to add humanity to the campaign,'' he added, ``more
human presence, more emotion,'' so that consumers could ``relate
more closely to the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Viros, chief executive at TAG Heuer, said: ``Consumers
responded very positively to our old campaign. It captured the
intensity of sports and the notion of mental toughness. But looking
toward the future, our most important objective is enhancing the
prestige of the brand. We have an impressive pedigree and want to
be seen as an institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which is indeed institutional in its routine
familiarity, is the first from Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London since
that agency was awarded the worldwide creative duties for TAG Heuer
in December. The ads arrive amid a fierce battle in the crowded
watch category as brands like Timex, Swatch and Swiss Army all
promote themselves as amazingly strong and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The TAG Heuer campaign, which carries the theme ``Inner
strength,'' draws comparisons between the endurance and power
needed to succeed at the highest level in sports and the qualities
of the watches.
</P>
<P>
   An international team of athletes was assembled to appear in the
campaign. Some are well known, like the basketball player Grant
Hill and the tennis champion Boris Becker. Others are more ``Who's
that?'' like the runners Marion Jones and Colin Jackson and the
Brazilian soccer player Leonardo.
</P>
<P>
   Each ad includes text in which the athlete describes the role
that ``Inner strength'' plays in his or her competitive psyche and
overall formula for success.
</P>
<P>
   The edgier ads of the previous campaign, which carried the theme
``Success. It's a mind game,'' were created by offices of the
Paris-based agency network BDDP, now a unit of Omnicom Group; they
included Wells BDDP in New York, which closed last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maintained the sports association which is so important
to the positioning of the brand,'' said Susan Nicholas, president
at TAG Heuer USA in Springfield, N.J. ``But in a way that relates
not only to professional athletes and sports enthusiasts but to
those who have succeeded in other disciplines.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad featuring Becker quotes him as saying: ``I drew my
strength from fear. Fear of losing. I don't remember the games I've
won, only the games I've lost.'' The ad featuring Jones, the
100-meter sprint world champion, has her stating: ``Winning is a
refusal to accept second place. It has happened to me a couple of
times, and to be honest I hated that feeling.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each ad also explores the ``Inner strength'' of the watches. The
Becker ad describes how they are ``subjected to a program of over
60 different chemical, mechanical and atmospheric tests which
exceed industry standards,'' and the Jones ad discusses how TAG
Heuer chronographs ``are placed in a thermal tank and subjected to
extreme temperatures for 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>

NIGERIAN LEADER, KNOWN FOR BRUTAL RULE, IS DEAD AT 54
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NIGERIA-ABACHA)  
(sw) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who died Monday, was the seventh Nigerian
officer to come to power by force since the country gained
independence from Britain in 1960. But even against this
background, Abacha established a distinctive record of brutal rule.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian human rights groups, clandestinely active in the
country and openly critical in exile, have charged that more people
were arrested in his five and a half years in power than in the
five decades of British rule. Abacha regularly expressed his
authority through fiat or intimidation, but he rarely revealed much
about himself, giving no interviews and keeping to the confines of
his official mansion, known as Aso Rock. He would arrive at his
office late in the day and work through the night, keeping aloof
even from his own ministers and military advisers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 article in The New York Times reported that ``journalists
who have gotten too close to the subject of General Abacha's
personal life are often arrested.'' And even in Nigerian circles,
little was known about the dictator's life beyond the terse entries
in the public record.
</P>
<P>
   But his face, always obscured by dark glasses, was seen
throughout the country on billboards that proclaimed, ``Abacha is
the Answer.'' Public works projects and housing developments were
named for him or his wife, Maryam, with whom he had nine children.
The face and its menacing sunglasses also looked out from the lapel
pins worn by his followers.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Sept. 20, 1943, in Kano State in the northern
Muslim area that has produced most of the country's military and
political leaders. He attended school in Kano and just after
independence was admitted to the Nigerian Military Training College
in the dusty northern city of Kaduna. In 1963, he received his
commission as a second lieutenant after studying at the Mons
Defense Officers' Cadet Training College in Aldershot, England.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, when mostly Ibo forces tried to wrench their area and
its oil riches out of a federated Nigeria and gain independence as
Biafra, the young officer fought in the civil war. After the
secessionists were defeated, he continued his military training in
England and then in Monterey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Though his superiors recommended in 1971 that he never be
promoted above the rank of colonel because he was ``not considered
stable enough for higher command,'' he nonetheless rose steadily.
He was made a brigadier in 1980, a major general in 1984 and a
lieutenant general in 1987. He was also involving himself in
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As oil, the country's main source of revenue, fell in price in
the early '80s, a crisis ensued and the position of President
Alhaji Shehu Shagari, who was elected in 1979, became shaky. On
Dec. 31, 1983, he was toppled in a military plot. It was the first
of three coups in which Abacha shared a leading role, this time
collaborating with Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   The plotters installed Muhammadu Buhari as leader. The new ruler
was unable to reverse Nigeria's economic trials and showed little
concern for human rights or freedom of expression, signing off on a
decree that made the publication of any material critical of the
government illegal.
</P>
<P>
   As things continued to fall apart, Babangida and Abacha sent
units out to depose the man they had enthroned. On this occasion,
Babangida took over as head of state, and Abacha became chief of
staff of the army.
</P>
<P>
   Babangida opened a nationwide debate on the form Nigeria's
government should take once democracy was restored. Local elections
were held, and national elections were scheduled, but the head of
state decided that political traditions in the country were too
harmful and banned all 13 parties seeking to run candidates. In
their place he created two factions, ``one a little to the left''
and the other ``a little to the right,`` and both under his
control.
</P>
<P>
   Elections were finally held on June 12, 1993. It appeared that
Mashood Abiola, a wealthy businessman who was a member of the
Yoruba people of southern Nigeria, had won. Babangida annulled the
election.
</P>
<P>
   When widespread protests erupted, Babangida resigned a day
before he had promised to cede power to a civilian government. He
gave the presidency to Ernest Shonekan, a civilian leader who was
also a Yoruban. Abacha was the only member of Babangida's
government to stay on, remaining as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Shonekan lasted only two and a half tempestuous months. On Nov.
17, 1993, as he was preparing for a meeting with striking labor
leaders, Abacha launched his third coup, this time taking the top
post himself.
</P>
<P>
   A day later he outlawed the two government-sponsored parties and
banned political activity. ``We will not condone or tolerate any
act of indiscipline,'' he declared in his 10-minute radio address.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 1994, Abiola, declared himself to be the rightful
president. A day later he was jailed. Oil workers struck, calling
for democracy. The military responded with shootings and bombings
and broke the strike within two months. Over the summer of 1994,
Abacha imprisoned labor officials, journalists, politicians and
human rights activists. He announced decrees that put his
government above Nigeria's courts and permitted preventive
detention. He shut down three major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In March of 1995, his government announced, to some skepticism,
that it had squelched a coup, and it was reported that within a
month between 60 and 300 officers were executed along with 40
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Abacho ordered the arrest of Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo, who in 1979 had been the only Nigerian military leader to
have ever voluntarily turned over power to an elected official.
Along with 39 others he was charged with treason, leading to
appeals from Pope John Paul II and Margaret Thatcher for leniency.
On Oct.1 1995, Abacha announced that he had lifted the death
sentence on the 40 men.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, pay attention to the protests and appeals
for clemency in the case of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a writer and human
rights activist, who was hanged along with eight of his associates
on Nov. 10, 1995. He had been charged with provoking assassinations
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the government's critics believed he was killed because
of his role in the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni people,
which sought a share of oil money for the ethnic group whose
traditional lands lie over oil deposits. Abacha is widely believed
to have amassed a personal fortune from oil.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, a group calling itself the United Front for
Nigeria's Liberation claimed responsibility for causing an airplane
crash in which the general's 28-year-old son, Ibrahim, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has imposed various levels of sanctions
against Nigeria, banning flights because of security concerns,
cutting assistance after the annulment of elections and again
because of charges of Nigerian government involvement in drug
trafficking. When Walter Carrington, the U.S. ambassador was
leaving his post after four years, his farewell party was broken up
by police. Despite an official protest, no apology was offered.
</P>
<P>
   As Abacha was being chastised by world leaders and his
government made subject to economic pressures, he sought to
establish Nigeria's military might as the peace-keeping power of
West Africa. In February, Nigerian troops took Freetown, the
capital of Sierra Leone, chased out a junta and, in a seeming
paradox, paved the way for the return of a democratically elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Pope John Paul visited Nigeria calling for greater
democracy and human rights in the country. On April 25, the country
held parliamentary elections, but at many polling places soldiers
and police outnumbered voters as the opposition called for a
boycott and fears of violence also led to absenteeism. Pro
Democracy groups claimed that Abacha had rigged the list of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The general himself was preparing to run for president in August
in an election in which he had effectively selected token
opponents.

WUORINEN TRIBUTE: A COMPOSER'S 60TH, QUIRKS AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Tuesday, Charles Wuorinen celebrates his 60th
birthday. Two days ago, the Works and Process series at the
Guggenheim Museum was helping him get in the mood by presenting a
short concert of his music, given by longstanding friends and other
virtuosos. Many characteristic Wuorinenian qualities were
prominently on display: the rhythmic dynamism, the playfulness, the
solid and thoroughly traditional handling of instruments, the odd
combination of the studied and the quirky.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sherry, who had given a warmly engaged performance of the
recent ``Cello Variations III'' at the start of the program, spoke
of Wuorinen with equal warmth and aptness in the middle, and told
of how, on a concert tour of Greece, the composer preferred to stay
in his hotel room composing rather than visit the Parthenon.
</P>
<P>
   This was revealing. There is probably nothing Wuorinen would
rather do than compose; that could well be what he is doing now.
But his reasons for doing so are not obvious. His works tell us
very little about him. They have their own lives to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Being so ready for life, they can be the occasions of great
performances, as they were here. Sherry was followed on the
platform by Ursula Oppens, exuberant in the piano piece ``Blue
Bamboula,'' and then by Susan Narucki and Christopher Oldfather in
three songs for soprano and piano, including a new diversion on
``Christes Crosse Be My Speede'' by Thomas Morley.
</P>
<P>
   Here the two contrapuntal lines of the accompaniment are
progressively entangled and speeded up until they start to sound
like Conlon Nancarrow's player-piano studies. Meanwhile the voice
serenely repeats its melody, except that near the end it jumps up
an octave in alarm. Ms. Narucki was beautifully steadfast,
Oldfather conscientiously deranged.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the New Jersey Percussion Ensemble gave a hugely
exciting performance of the Percussion Quartet, where music slops
and splashes between keyed instruments (vibraphones and marimbas)
and drums in both movements, the second a vigorous and learned
gigue based on something like a children's tune.

THE DAVE MATTHEWS BAND: CLAMOR AND HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in easy times, according to the prevailing mood. Stocks
are ascendant; crime has plummeted. If the late 1990s were a
rock-and-roll show, they'd be a long, mellifluous jam by the Dave
Matthews Band. Yet this pleasant haze is regularly punctuated by
hard reality: teen-agers killing teen-agers, terrorists blowing up
fairgrounds. If the late 1990s had a rock singer's voice, it would
be the cracked, capricious wail of Dave Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   The Dave Matthews Band, which played a sold-out Giants Stadium
on Sunday night, are an unassuming bunch of skilled, unassuming
musicians. Critics puzzled by the band's success have declared its
tastefully funky pop a dull soundtrack to an apathetic era. Yet the
DMB's live act clarified its appeal in ways its hits do not.
</P>
<P>
   The energy begins in its rhythms, inspired by world-music
sources including the township jive of Matthews' birthplace, South
Africa, salsa and reggae. Sunday's guest stars, the bluegrass
auteur Bela Fleck and the Johannesburg-based penny whistler
Ikgopoleng Aaron Lerole, emphasized this eclecticism. If the
remarkably agile drummer Carter Beauford and the supple bassist
Stefan Lessard simply steered the band through these wide-ranging
grooves, the Grateful Dead would have a rightful heir.
</P>
<P>
   But the DMB also found direction in forceful rock beats. Just as
a song sagged into incessant noodling, Beauford would deliver a
straightforward note on his kick drum, met by aggressive guitar
strumming from Matthews and bowing by the violinist Boyd Tinsley.
These breaks refocused the band. And while Matthews' singing, which
floated from a soul man's growl to a childlike falsetto, was as
vagrant as his coffeehouse musings, most lyrics included a hearty
sing-along chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Confidently moving between drift and drama, the DMB made its
uncanny musical blend accessible. But the music's disjunctions also
served a deeper purpose. Rock and roll's power originated in its
determination to disrupt. Now this rebelliousness seems arcane, and
young bands must find ways to renew it. The DMB does so by
incorporating clamor into a harmonious whole. Matthews' persona
further plays out this resolution. Emotionally intense but able to
roll with the punches, focused on momentary pleasures like sex and
intoxication, he is an innocent rather than a rebel, sometimes
seeking change but mostly hoping to survive it. His flexibility
makes him a hero at a time when uncertainty is a compelling force
in many people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews and his band are not the only artists adjusting rock's
disruptions to new times. Beck and Ben Folds Five, who both
delivered dynamic opening sets, approached the same conundrum in
different ways. Beck created a virtual museum of bold rock star
moves; like his music, which rearranges the jigsaw history of pop
in surprising patterns, his stage show contorted and refreshed pop
cliches, from the usual stadium patter to choreographed soul
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Folds Five, a piano-based trio, applies rock frenzy to
whimsical lyrical subjects, like being dropped by a girlfriend
after paying for her dinner; delivered by the sweetly nerdy Ben
Folds in his reedy tenor, the band's rants illuminate and amuse.
Rumor has it that Matthews personally selected these innovative
opening acts. Perhaps he realizes that they are all allies in
keeping rock alive despite the diminishment of its chaotic spark.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANK SOCCER INCLUDES FINE WHINE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-JEAN-D'ARDIERES, France _ For reading matter, Brian
Maisonneuve had the latest copy of Les Pages Jaunes, a page-turner
if ever there was one. His family name would indicate that he might
be able to decipher the thrilling plot within, but Maisonneuve
assured his visitors, ``I'm looking at the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was looking for a pizza delivery service in the Yellow
Pages for the quiet vineyard region in which the U.S. soccer team
currently finds itself ensconced. Maybe he was looking for a taxi
to get him to bustling downtown Belleville or Villefranche.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson, the coach, has said _ with basically a straight
face _ that he put them in a rural chateau so they could get the
true feeling of being in deepest France. The players say: Yeah,
right.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do when the coach has put the team in the outback of
the Beaujolais region? You cool your heels, literally. Maisonneuve
was sitting outside the American wing of the chateau, both feet
stuck in a bucket of ice, which, under better circumstances might
have chilled a new bottle of Georges DeBoeuf.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little boredom isn't bad,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks are grumbling here in the countryside, but this is
normal for itinerant bands of men in uniform. It was either
Napoleon or Lafayette or John Thompson who said that an army fights
best when it is mad at its general, which bodes well for the Little
Country That Could.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every one of the 32 teams in this World Cup is
quartered in reasonable seclusion, even the Brazilians and the
Italians. Our lads do not like being quartered in the boonies in
preparation for their opening game in Paris against Germany, but
Sampson wants them fresh and rested and a trifle surly next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first game in the World Cup is the biggie for the Americans.
Germany is still putting together its aged and its infirm, and the
United States just might gain a tie or a victory before the Germans
get their act together.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when does the United States get its act together?
Sampson is talking up team unity and says he now has 22 healthy
players for the first time, but there are many questions about this
team.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Kasey Keller in goal, and a few other skilled
individuals, the team is a work in progress. There are no
Romario-Bebeto tandems up front, no Maldini-Baresi tandems on
defense, which got Brazil and Italy to the 1994 final. Sampson is
still putting together the pieces, which could be a bit of a
problem when the marauders come down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop, of course, is tranquillity. Sampson found the
Chateau de Pizay on an inspection trip last fall and immediately
fell in love with its six centuries of history, its exotic topiary,
its ancient chapel, its crowing roosters and attack geese. Or maybe
it was the distance from diversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare for Germany,'' Sampson said Monday at a
news conference in the courtyard. ``I don't want them on their feet
all day shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   He has tentatively scheduled a bus ride to Lyons, 25 miles away,
for an afternoon on the town on Thursday. He has provided
diversions like a golf outing on Sunday, at which Alexi Lalas
scored 24 for the first two holes, presumably striking many of his
shots as headers.
</P>
<P>
   To keep busy, the players have a dart board, a television with
English soccer news, plus a VCR equipped with tapes of
``Hoosiers,'' ``JFK'' and ``Jerry Springer 2 Hot 4 TV.'' Other than
that, it's quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came from New York, where the horns honk 24 hours a
day,'' Tab Ramos said. ``Here there are no horns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson is probably aware of at least 10 percent of the griping,
but he insists the players will have time to meander from their
quaint hotel off the Champs-Elysee on Saturday night and Sunday,
and the team hotel for the Yugoslavia game in Nantes is right on
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they are finished with this World Cup, they will not say
they did not have a World Cup experience,'' Sampson promised.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of wine country, he has allowed his players to
drink one glass of beer with dinner, but he noted proudly that the
other night not one player asked for a beer. There is a tradition
of nocturnal card-playing _ known to participants as the Card
School _ but after the stakes kept rising, Sampson put in a curfew
of 10:30 p.m. for that activity.
</P>
<P>
   What do the players do when they dutifully put away their decks
of cards at the appointed hour? There are always Les Pages Jaunes.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Radio host, trombonist and jazz man  &UR; Mal Sharpe &LR;  called last
week to say that he probably wouldn't be there this December, &LR;  for
the Salvation Army's annual celebrity bell-ringing day in Union
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't in good conscience do it,'' he said, because he can't
go along with the army's overt opposition to same-sex couples
living together. Like most people in the Bay Area, he has gay
relatives and friends; furthermore, he notes, a large proportion of
Union Square pedestrians he'd be panhandling that day are probably
gay.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other bell-ringer agreed, but many probably won't.
Said author  &UR; Merla Zellerbach &LR; , ``Whether you agree or not, the
Salvation Army shows a lot of guts. Bell-ringing's great and
everyone has a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terry Lowry &LR; , a Salvation Army board member, has been ringing
bells for at least 18 years, and serves as a kind of director and
hostess for the event. She said she hadn't received any calls from
unhappy participants. ``My feeling is that the Salvation Army
doesn't ring bells for political reasons,'' she said. ``They ring
bells to help people in need.''

<P>
   ``I can't in good conscience do it,'' he said, because he can't

gay.

   At least one other bell-ringer agreed, but many probably won't.

Salvation Army shows a lot of guts. Bell-ringing's great and
everyone has a good time.''

   &UR; Terry Lowry &LR; , a Salvation Army board member, has been ringing
bells for at least 18 years, and serves as a kind of director and

BAHIA MAKES ROOM FOR A CANDOMBLE PANTHEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14)  
 (JT ) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil _ A century ago, the African-rooted religion of
Candomble was an unspoken secret in Bahia and its capital,
Salvador. Today, the former mystery is a matter of public pride,
and now it has its own monument. Eight towering statues of orixas,
the deities of Candomble, were dedicated in April in the Dique do
Tororo, a lake in the center of downtown Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   The statues, by sculptor Tatti Moreno, are more than 22 feet
tall and weigh 2 tons each. By night, they are illuminated and
appear to float above the water in a circle as if they are dancing,
around a lighted fountain. They are monuments to Brazil's African
heritage, which remains strongest in the state of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   Candomble is the Brazilian relative of voodoo in Haiti and
santeria in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The tradition is a New
World resurgence of a Yoruba religion that arrived with African
slaves. When Salvador, with its superb natural harbor, was Brazil's
capital and major trading center under the the Portuguese empire,
Brazil was the largest importer of slaves in the Americas.
Descendants of those slaves make Bahia the state with Brazil's
highest percentage of African-Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   The orixas of Candomble are worshiped as powerful, capricious
beings, each with its own constellation of attributes. They are
associated with natural phenomena, with colors, with occupations
and with days of the week. In Candomble ceremonies, drumming and
chanting help carry believers into a trance where they are taken
over by the spirit of an orixa. The rhythms and the tradition of
drumming have filtered into Brazilian popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial overseers tried to stamp out candomble, which survived,
in part, by continuing to worship the African deities in the guise
of Christian saints. The Virgin Mary, for instance, is equated with
Iemanja, the goddess of the sea, who also wears white; the aged
Omolu is matched to Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this century, the police still raided Candomble
ceremonies, and until 1976, candomble celebrants were required to
obtain permits from the police vice squad. Yet today, Salvador is
estimated to have at least twice as many Candomble houses as it
does churches, and it has churches everywhere. In a country that is
90 percent Roman Catholic, many of the faithful attend both
Candomble ceremonies and Catholic Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Candomble believers long ago designated the Dique do Tororo a
sacred site for Oxum, the goddess who rules lakes. On a secular
level, the lake has lately been reclaimed by the city from years of
pollution and neglect. The orixa statues are part of a
rehabilitation that includes new plantings and playgrounds around
the lake's perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   From the shore, the orixas look like women in long wigwam-sized
skirts; actually, they are male and female deities wearing African
robes. It's well worth taking along binoculars to see them more
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Made of fiberglass resin over conical iron frames, with
elaborately textured robes and crowns painted in their traditional
colors, the orixas carry the symbols of their godhood. Xango, the
deity of fire, thunder and drums, holds a two-bladed axe, and Ogum,
the patron of people who work with their hands, carries a
carpenter's saw, hammer and drill. The orixas' faces are black,
brown and tan, and their features are African, Indian and European,
reflecting the mixture of worshipers that Moreno sees at Candomble
services.
</P>
<P>
   As a combination of public and religious art, the orixas
involved a certain amount of diplomacy. There was a brief
controversy when a Protestant evangelical church, which had planned
to acquire a building on the lake shore, objected to the prospect
of having African deities on its doorstep. Eventually, the church
decided to move.
</P>
<P>
   Now, eight orixas command the lake; four remaining deities in
the pantheon, whose attributes prevent them from living on the
water, have been built to stand in other sites around Salvador,
still to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   For the exact arrangement of the orixas in the lake, Moreno
consulted the many Candomble houses nearby, and knowing the lore of
the orixas, he was cautious. ``Some of them simply shouldn't be
next to each other,'' he said. ``If they are, they will fight.''

LAWYERS FIGHT TO COLLECT FEES FROM STATES IN TOBACCO SUITS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers who fought the tobacco industry have found a new focus
for their energies: fighting for their share of the spoils from
lawsuits against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the issue of the lawyers' fees has been the
focus of intense controversy in states that have settled lawsuits
against cigarette makers. But now the debate has also erupted in
Washington, where Congress is considering federal legislation that
will resolve many tobacco lawsuits and allow the government to
regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the richest pot of legal fees ever to be awarded _
billions of dollars scheduled to be paid to a small group of trial
lawyers who were either hired by state attorneys general to sue
cigarette makers on the states' behalf, or who brought class-action
claims on behalf of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas and Florida, which have already settled with the
industry, a battle has broken out over fees to lawyers that could
exceed $3.4 billion in those two states. And if lawyers, whose
cases were to have been paid as part of last June's proposed $368.5
billion settlement between the industry and 41 other states, were
awarded fees of just 5 percent, the earnings of some 160 law firms
nationwide could reach $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such huge awards has triggered outcries,
particularly from conservative Republicans who have long sought to
rein in the fees of trial lawyers, traditionally big donors to
Democrats. Even some moderates like Sen. John McCain, the Arizona
Republican who is the sponsor of a new $516-billion tobacco bill
before Congress, have begun to argue for controls on fees.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of tobacco cases that would have been settled
under the 1997 accord are still in the courts. But some of them, in
particular a number of class-action cases, risk being pre-empted by
federal tobacco legislation or are given little chance for success
at trial. Fears that the fees will be scaled back has inspired
intense lobbying by trial lawyers from more than 65 firms
nationwide, who are spending millions of dollars in an effort to
insure that the fees are paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large body of opinion that the present scenario is
skewed too much in favor of the trial lawyers,'' said McCain. He
added that he had recently asked Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., to
propose limits on lawyer fees resulting from federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who led cases against cigarette makers say they deserve
to be richly rewarded. They point out that they took big risks b
taking cases on contingency, spending millions of dollars of their
own money suing the tobacco industry at a time when many experts
believed it was invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, including Richard Scruggs, the brother-in-law of
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, are already
multi-millionaires as the result of lawsuits brought against
asbestos producers. Others, like John Coale, a class-action lawyer
from Washington, built their reputations on more controversial
ventures. Coale, for example, raced to Bhopal, India, in the
mid-1980s to sign up clients who were victims of the explosion of a
Union Carbide chemical plant there.
</P>
<P>
   Those class-action cases, which were filed in some 25 states, do
not seek monetary damages for smokers but rather demand that the
industry pay for programs like smoking-cessation courses. However,
many tobacco proposals now before Congress would finance such
programs and so effectively pre-empt the lawsuits and the lawyers'
chance to collect fees.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had agreed to settle the class-action lawsuits,
a step that would qualify them to collect fees as part of their
tobacco bills. Herman said that he believed that he and his
colleagues deserved to be paid because they had invested millions
of dollars in the lawsuits and convinced the industry last June to
finance programs like the smoking-cessation courses.
</P>
<P>
   But since the June plan, some of the class-action lawsuits have
faced setbacks in the courts and some lawmakers, like Rep. Martin
Meehan, D-Mass., have declined to include the cases in their bills,
saying that any special consideration for trial lawyers could
damage a bill's bipartisan appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the class-action lawsuits are not covered,
federal tobacco legislation, if passed, could generate billions in
fees because such a law would settle the remaining state lawsuits
against the tobacco companies that seek to recover the cost of
treating smoking-related illnesses. To handle those cases, state
attorneys general, beginning in 1994, hired outside law firms and
signed contracts which, depending on the state, guaranteed the
lawyers 3 percent to 33 percent of any recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical contingency fee case, it is not unusual for lawyers
to receive 33 percent of an award. However, the settlement amount
in the tobacco cases are so large that many legal experts believe
that the fees generated y such contracts are excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 100 law firms were retained, although just a
handful of lawyers dominated the cases. For example, the law firm
headed by Scruggs represented Mississippi, the first state to sue,
and was later hired by 29 other states. Ness, Motley, Loadholt &AMP;
Richardson, a law firm in Charleston, S.C., was retained by many of
the same states.
</P>
<P>
   But as Congress debates a tobacco bill, lawyers in some states
that have already settled their cases are battling each other over
fees with the same fervor they once reserved for cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a battle has been under way in Texas for months
over the $2.3 billion in fees sought by a group of prominent trial
lawyers who negotiated the state's $15.3 billion settlement with
the tobacco industry in January. The lawyers say they were promised
15 percent of the Texas award when they agreed in 1996 to represent
state Attorney General Dan Morales.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George Bush of Texas, a Republican, opposes the award,
calling it outrageous and unjustified. A legal expert hired by Bush
has estimated that the fees sought by the lawyers equal an hourly
billing rate of $92,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fight recently took a bizarre turn when Joe Jamail, one of
the country's richest trial lawyers, said that Morales had demanded
a $1 million payment from him in a 1996 meeting to discuss the
possibility of Morales hiring Jamail to head the state's legal
team. Jamail was not hired.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has denied the claim calling it a ``sideshow'' concocted
by his political enemies to divert attention from the ``improper
conduct'' of state officials like Bush, who are trying to change
the settlement terms. He has also asked a federal judge for
millions of dollars in sanctions Bush and others.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers fear that the Texas spectacle and a similar fight
over legal fees in Florida are only feeding the anti-lawyer
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these tobacco lawyers are becoming the poster children
for tort reform,'' said Scruggs, who is from Pascagoula, Miss.
``The biggest problem is that some of these lawyers don't give a
damn about their colleagues. They just want their money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the fee issue has split lawmakers on both the
state and federal levels along partisan lines. Many of the lawyers
involved in lawsuits against the tobacco industry are well-known in
Washington because of their large contributions to the Democratic
Party. Since 1995, lawyers from 13 firms with tobacco cases have
made nearly $3 million in political contributions, with the vast
majority going to Democratic Party committees or candidates, public
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers have been battling tort reform legislation
championed by business interests and Republicans in the Congress.
They have been among the Democratic Party's most generous and
stalwart contributors over the last decade. The tobacco settlement
reached last year has deeply divided the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America, because it curbs the future ability of lawyers
to sue the tobacco industry. However, some of ATLA's most prominent
members are the very lawyers who have sued the tobacco industry and
stand to gain from national tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And since last June, many of those lawyers have also spent
heavily on lobbying on behalf of tobacco legislation. Scruggs, for
example, estimated that his firm paid some $2 million over the past
year to three lobbying firms. He said that virtually all of that
lobbying has been in support of tobacco legislation, rather than on
the issue of fees.
</P>
<P>
   Under most pending federal tobacco bills, an arbitration panel
would be established to weigh lawyers' claims for fees and to award
up to $500 million annually. That method is also being backed by
tobacco companies and by many trial lawyers like Scruggs, who under
his contracts with Mississippi, Texas and Florida already stands to
share in more than $4.5 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts also say that resolving fee disputes through
arbitration may defuse partisan bickering. ``We need to get one
step removed from the politics of attorneys' fees awards,'' said
Robert Rabin, a professor at Stanford University Law School, who
has followed tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts argue that because Congress is being asked to
settle lawsuits, lawmakers should set the fees. And some
politicians fear that even arbitration will result in too much
money going to lawyers. As a result, some lawmakers that fees in
tobacco cases should be limited to an hourly rate.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Senate narrowly defeated a proposal to cap the
hourly rate for plaintiffs' lawyers in tobacco cases at $250 an
hour. And there are even more stringent bills to cap fees in the
House, with one proposal calling for a $150-an-hour rate.
Separately, a tobacco bill introduced by two Republican senators,
Phil Gramm of Texas and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, would take a
different approach by imposing a tax on lawyers' windfall profits.

<P>
   Word Monday that Norwest and Wells Fargo plan to merge in a
stock-for-stock transaction may have set bank stock investors'
pulses racing. But for those who had hoped the most recent
mega-merger would breathe a little life into bank stocks, the
sector was a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's bank stock index could
not even eke out a 1 percent gain Monday. The index, which closed
on Friday at 850, traded as high as 858 during the day. But by the
close of trading, it had settled back to 857, an eight-tenths of a
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks, in general, are down between 9 percent and 12
percent from their highs achieved in April of this year. Money
center banks, like Citicorp and J.P. Morgan, are down slightly more
than regional banks like Fleet Financial or First Chicago NBD. This
likely reflects two views: one, that problem loans in Asia will
affect money center banks more than regionals. And two,
notwithstanding occasional rumors about J.P. Morgan as a possible
takeover candidate, regional banks are the only buyouts likely to
take place the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if more bank takeovers happen, they will not be done at
enormous premiums to prevailing market prices. In fact, the
Norwest-Wells Fargo deal confirms the recent trend toward so-called
mergers of equals in which little in the way of a premium is paid
by the acquirer to shareholders of the company that's being bought
out.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a bank might pay 30 percent above the prevailing
market price for another in a buyout, but managements are now
dispensing 10 percent or less to shareholders in the acquired
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say this shift to considerably lower premiums has
not been fully digested by investors. ``Many investors still
believe that today's mergers will push their stocks up on big
takeover premiums,'' said Thomas Theurkauf, senior vice president
at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, a bank research concern. Investors may
feel justified in clinging to this belief as bank stocks'
price/earnings multiples are between 25 percent and 30 percent
below the multiple on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   But this old way of thinking can buy investors trouble. Those
who bought shares in Wells Fargo in early May, when the rumors of
its imminent takeover were rife, are facing losses today of around
6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Where did all those juicy takeover premiums go?
</P>
<P>
   There are several forces at work in the shift. For starters,
bank stocks have had a monumental run in recent years. Though they
have come off their highs this year, the bank stock index is still
24 percent above its January lows. Investors cannot expect rich
premiums over these already high prices in a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the currency used to make these acquisitions _
shares of the acquirer's stock _ is down from April. As bank stocks
have fallen in value the last two months, so, too, has the currency
used by acquirers to do their deals.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, bank mergers are not struck because they are a
cheap way to amass assets. They are done because industry growth is
slowing. ``If everybody was growing their revenues by 20 percent,
you wouldn't see these deals,'' said Diane Glossman, bank analyst
at Lehman Brothers. ``Deals are happening because top-line growth
is relatively limited.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also cutting into the premiums paid in these takeovers may be
the realization among bank managements that they will be forced to
make enormous investments in technology. And, the jury is still
decidedly out on how well these recent mergers will be integrated.
If the integration is not smooth, the entire bank could be at risk.
It was essentially Wells Fargo's difficulties in meshing its
two-year-old acquisition of First Interstate that forced it into
the arms of Norwest.
</P>
<P>
   Lower merger premiums are not the only part of the bank merger
scene that's beginning to look different. Charles Peabody, analyst
at Mitchell Securities in New York, said the pace of big-bank
mergers will slow in coming months. ``We're starting to see who the
survivors are going to be _ BankAmerica-Nationsbank,
Travelers-Citicorp, First Chicago NBD and Norwest-Wells Fargo,'' he
said. `Those guys may want to make another acquisition, but they
can't do the next big deal because they need to integrate what
they've got.'' It can take up to three years to digest one of these
huge acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   And, while smaller banks may continue to benefit from takeovers,
the prices at which these deals are struck might be disappointing.
Like Wells Fargo's stock price in May, many of these banks' shares
have been bid up to unsustainable levels in deal mania. Theurkauf
at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods said, ``Small to midsize regional
banking companies that carry a big premium to the group are
especially vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Any stock trading well above 18 times earnings may
be too rich. As Wells Fargo shareholders found, premiums can
evaporate fast.

 &HT;    'Watershed day' for CSX, Norfolk Southern
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal Surface Transportation Board voted Monday
to approve in principle the $10 billion purchase of Conrail by
rivals CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The board decision, which will be published formally July 23,
becomes effective Aug. 22, freeing CSX and Norfolk Southern to
begin changing routes to absorb the Conrail lines and facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of the new competing rail systems promises to
speed shipments between Southern states to and from the Northeast
and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The railroads have hailed this new service as a means to make
them more competitive with traditional truck traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a nation that depends on safe, efficient, reliable rail
transportation service, June 8 will be remembered as a watershed
day,'' said David R. Good, chairman and chief executive of Norfolk
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Equally pleased by the board approval, John W. Snow, chairman of
CSX, said, ``This marks the dawn of a new era of transportation
growth, in jobs and business development ...''
</P>
<P>
   To gain approval, the two competing Eastern railroads modified
the application to address concerns of some communities, including
the area around Cleveland, Ohio, where citizens worried about the
noise and congestion from increased traffic.
</P>
<P>
   CSX said the new service will open the way for faster
single-line service from Montreal to Miami, from Boston to Atlanta,
and from the farms factories of the Midwest to East Coast ports.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Southern has been particularly enthusiastic about
potential improved service between Atlanta and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Both railroads say the improved service will mean more jobs and
and a bigger presence in Georgia and the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Some parties, including New York City and several labor unions,
have indicated they may challenge the final merger approval with
court litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some New York officials insist the plans need to be changed to
assure competition in the metropolitan area.

LOUD RADIOS CREATE UNSOUND WORKPLACE

columnist for the Los Angeles Daily News. His column moves Mondays

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: In the facility where I work, there are
no fewer than six or seven individual radios or tape players on at
the same time and playing different selections of music or talk
radio. The level of noise and confusion is irritating and affects
my concentration. The manager feels that this is what the majority
wants and that it is OK. What do you think? M.B.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: What if the majority wanted to bring in their
surround-sound systems and 12-foot speakers? In fact, what if the
majority wanted a one-day workweek? This is not the way to make a
sound managerial decision.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, your work situation is probably going to get
worse. When one employee turns his or her radio or tape player a
little louder, a neighboring employee is almost forced to do
likewise, and this cycle repeats itself until the work area sounds
like a three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   There are many voices extolling the virtues of allowing
employees to bring radios, tape players or headsets to work.
However, no matter what they bring, there can be problems with
employees paying more attention to the music or radio discussions
than to their work. In your situation, not only are the employees
with the radios or tape players distracted, but the noise they
generate is distracting those who share the ambient airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for you and any fellow employees who feel the same
way about the noise to first meet your electronically enhanced
co-workers. If the decibels continue to ring, your next stop is the
manager. His style seems to place major emphasis on being popular.
Be specific in describing the costs associated with the present
racket and let him know that these costs will not make him popular
with senior management.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you deal with a manager who talks all the time? He
thinks he is this great communicator, but he doesn't listen. For me
to get a point across, I have to say it at least five times, and
I'm starting to feel it's just not worth it. What ideas do you
have? R.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Communication is one of the most important managerial
functions, and the one word that does not describe your manager's
communication skills is ``great.'' Great communicators are great
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way for you to go deep into his psyche and reprogram
whatever may be causing him to be in constant verbal overload. All
you can do is try to alter the way he communicates with you.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the day, there are probably times when he
is less talkative, such as in the early afternoon or late in the
day. You should meet with him during one of these quieter periods.
</P>
<P>
   Your approach should be honest and businesslike, and your
comments should be descriptive rather than evaluative. That is,
rather than saying he is too talkative or domineering, describe
specific situations in which more two-way communication was needed.
Be sure he understands the advantages of such communication,
including increased productivity, motivation and departmental
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If you see some signs of improved listening, be sure to give him
positive feedback. But if he still refuses to listen, then it is
time for you to listen to what your better judgment is telling you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any advice on how to survive in a large workplace
that is filled with employees who are constantly trying to get in
good with management? They are rude and bossy, and if you confront
them, they go straight to management. T.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: Being in a workplace with employees who advertise their
adoration for management is not unusual, as many employees expend
at least some effort trying to win points from the topsiders. Can
you honestly say you have never done this?
</P>
<P>
   However, being in a work environment that is laden with rude and
bossy employees is another matter. The first step is to ask
yourself if there is anything you may have done to alienate the
group. If you have tried to deal with your fellow employees in a
fair and open manner, only to be treated rudely in return, the best
approach is for you to continue to try to work positively with
them, while spending time with co-workers who actually know how to
be friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure that the quality and quantity of your work are
excellent, and that management is aware of your solid performance.
Some employees who do not adequately market their achievements to
management can actually resent those who do. You may feel better
about this whole situation if you put a little more effort into
publicizing your successes.

 &HT;    Experts: Big future in online commerce, but overhaul neededBy
Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From groceries to factory parts to European vacations,
online commerce is forecast to top $600 billion in sales within
five years _ but only if corporate America drastically overhauls
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the assessment of technology experts at this week's
SuperComm, the world's largest communications conference, which is
expected to draw 45,000 people to Atlanta's Georgia World Congress
Center this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make the Internet business-class,'' Bay Networks
Executive Vice President Stephen Pearse told Monday's luncheon
panel. ``It is not safe to go into the water yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The buying and selling of goods and services over the Internet
is estimated at $100 billion, and it is rising fast. It will more
than double to $208 billion in 2000 and reach $633 billion in 2003,
according to the Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly typical example, Yankee Group Senior Vice
President Robert Rich said, he and his wife, Barbara, relied on
electronic mail to plan a vacation next week in Austria and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet ``is becoming more a part of the everyday market
for ... the technologically advanced family,'' said Rich, adding
that the trend is accelerating with the steady decline in personal
computer prices.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in commerce, however, is headed for a collision
course with what Pearse calls ``Web mania,'' the public's exploding
interest in sending electronic mail, playing games and searching
for information on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Just as people sometimes run into snags cruising the Internet, a
growing number of the companies that move massive volumes of
information online face similar obstacles, but on a much broader
scale, Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most companies, the Internet is not mission-critical right
now,'' Rich said. ``But if we want this to become a
business-to-business market, we have to invest in the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is spreading. According to Pearse, technology suppliers
to the Internet are doubling their investment in routers, cables
and other equipment to $20 billion over the next five years.

 &HT;    Strike in Michigan may have far-reaching consequences
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A strike at a General Motors Corp. plant in
Flint, Mich., triggered parts shortages Monday that shut down the
company's truck assembly plant in Moraine, Ohio and two other
assembly plants in Michigan and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Two shifts of employees represented by the International Union
of Electronics Workers Local 801 in Moraine were sent home Monday
after putting in five hours' work. About 4,200 hourly employees
work at the Moraine plant, which will remain idle until the United
Auto Workers Local 659 and GM settle the five-day strike at the
Flint Metal Center north of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The center stamps hoods, fenders, doors and other body parts
that supply the Moraine plant, which has capacity to roll out about
1,200 GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Blazer and Oldsmobile Bravada sport
utility vehicles a day, according to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Moraine shutdown highlights one of the pitfalls of
just-in-time-delivery of parts, a relatively recent business
practice that reduces inventory and other costs, but leaves
parts-dependent plants vulnerable to labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW strike also idled an assembly plants in Orion Twp.,
Michigan and Fairfax, Kan., GM said. The two plants employ about
4,300 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to reveal how many other plants could shut
down if the strike lingers. But David Cole, director of the Office
for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of
Michigan, said the woes in Flint could affect more than a dozen
facilities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Idled Moraine plant workers may be eligible for unemployment
benefits equal to 95 percent of their take-home pay, said Local 801
Vice President Blake Griffin. The state pays up to 50 percent of a
workers' take-home pay, with the company or the union footing most
of the balance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, before the state issues any checks, the Ohio Bureau of
Employment Services must determine if the layoffs are due to a
labor dispute or a lack of work as the result of a parts shortage,
a decision that could be reached by Wednesday, said OBES spokesman
David Garick.
</P>
<P>
   If the state finds a parts shortage triggered layoffs, Moraine
plant workers could be eligible for checks in about two weeks, at
the earliest, Garick said. But if the state determines the UAW
labor dispute caused the IUE layoffs, the state would call a public
hearing, which could lead to a denial of employment benefits. A
public hearing would delay any payments at least 30 days, Garick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because two unions are involved, ``These things get very
complicated,'' Garick said.
</P>
<P>
   A company memo issued to employees Monday said if the plant is
still quiet by Thursday, regular paychecks for ``A'' and ``B''
shift workers will be available. Swing or ``C'' shift workers will
be able to collect their checks ``in the normal manner,'' the memo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Local 801 members said they support the UAW, despite the fact
the UAW has been critical of the IUE over the years because it has
compromised more with GM and agreed to different pay for workers
doing the same jobs. The fact Local 801 members may be eligible for
unemployment compensation buoyed the solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m., the first wave of idled Moraine plant workers
crowded into the Upper Deck Tavern across the street from the
Moraine plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to accept the time off when you're getting paid,''
said Jeff Smith, 30, of West Carrollton, Ohio, while enjoying his
third Miller Lite of the morning. ``The job is boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gosney, 28, of Carlisle, sipped a bottle of Stroh's in
solidarity with the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about supporting people,'' Gosney said. ``If not, why
even have unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Down time is nothing new at the Moraine plant. GM halted
production for a week in May, citing an overload of inventory due
to slumping sales of its sport utility vehicles and stiff
competition from Chrysler's new Dodge Durango. The company also
will expand a scheduled shutdown in August by two days starting
Aug. 10 to help control inventory at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,400 workers are employed at GM's Flint center, which
analysts say is not as competitive as others in the industry. The
strike is the seventh at a domestic GM plant since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Flint union leaders said GM reneged on some of the $300 million
investment planned for the their plant. They also object to what
they say are GM's plans to cut 191 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   GM maintains the union has not cooperated with changes to make
the plant more competitive. The company insists it has made a
significant portion of the planned investment, though officials
will not say how much.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute in Flint escalated in late May, when the automaker
removed equipment at its key stamping plant and moved it to an
undisclosed site. Although employees speculated the company hauled
the die-stamp equipment to Mexico, GM refused to disclose where it
shipped the machinery.
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street on Monday, GM stock (NYSE: GM) closed at 73 7/8,
down 1 3/8.

 &HT;    Textbooks face extinction in Gingrich's plan for first gradersBy

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If House Speaker Newt Gingrich is right, your child's
textbooks might be passe in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, speaking Monday at the SuperComm trade show at the
Georgia World Congress Center, said the onrush of technology will
make textbooks obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the goals should be to replace all textbooks with a
PC,'' Gingrich said. ``I would hope within five years they would
have no more textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers are the new focus for learning and students
should be given one when they enter first grade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion drew immediate fire from Washington, D.C.-based
author Harriet Tyson, who wrote ``A Conspiracy of Good Intentions:
America's Textbook Fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Many books are awful, but computers are not the answer, Tyson
said. ``Computers don't provide moral or philosophical guidance,
although they are terrific sources of information. The world is
drowning in information. What kids need is structure. A kid needs a
written, organized, portable source of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has distorted technology's value, she said. ``He is
like a 16-year-old who just fell in love with computers. He is not
a techie. He's just in love with techies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, a former college professor who peppers his talks with
references to writers such as Peter Drucker, W. Edwards Deming and
Alexis de Toqueville, also called for an overhaul of the nation's
schools. Gingrich urged that schools be judged in a business
context.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you consider schools as a supplier like any other supplier,
you should be in a rage at the quality of people they send you,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has long advocated the use of technology as a tool for
improving healthcare and education. To the several thousand
Supercomm attendees present, Gingrich argued that Internet
connections should often be available to replace the traditional
lecture by a professor. In contrast to the old-style teaching
model, the Net would be accessible 24 hours a day, he said. ``We
have to become a learning society.

 &HT;    Gingrich encourages funding of research agencies By Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The champion of sleeked-down government has called for
doubling the federal budget for basic research.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, speaking Monday at the Supercomm
trade show, said he supports a potent injection of cash into
agencies that do that research and development work including the
National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Those
agencies fund science that would not be likely be done by the
private sector, since it would not prove profitable quickly.
</P>
<P>
   However, that research can lead to dramatic breakthroughs _ such
as the Internet, which is often credited to DARPA funding. ``Basic
research has enriched this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But accompanying Gingrich's support for bigger budgets is a
demand for greater openness and efficiency. All agencies _
especially those doing high-tech research _ should have top-notch
Internet sites that are accessible to researchers and interested
citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said he thinks society and government should be updated
to combine the best elements of technology and democracy. ``The
public sector is operating at a rate that is inappropriate to the
world around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses succeed or fail based on a ``performance-based,
achievement-based standard,'' while the government faces no such
tests, he said. ``That is exactly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Gingrich's presidential ambitions has been
spurred in recent months by his increasingly feisty posture toward
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Long a technology buff, Gingrich has also warned of trouble with
the government's preparations for handling ``the millenium bug,''
the problem many computers will have in telling the difference
between Jan. 1, 2000, and the same date a century earlier. Gingrich
said every large government department is behind schedule in
dealing with the issue _ something with implications for at leat
one potential rival for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything more destructive for Vice President
Gore's political careers than to talk about the information highway
and then have the largest wreck in history on Jan. 1, 2000,''
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   A futurist friend of Gingrich, George Gilder, will deliver
Supercomm's closing address Thursday morning. Preceding Gingrich on
the stage Monday was Nobel Prize Winner Arno Penzias of Lucent
Technologies subsidiary Bell Labs.
</P>
<P>
   Penzias predicted that the cost of building a computer will soon
be comparable to a postage stamp, ``although what Intel will charge
for it, I do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   With computing that cheap, various new networks will spring up
in addition to those that now carry phone calls and computer
messages, he said. For instance, appliances from toaster to freezer
will soon be computer controlled, he said. Penzias said he expects
increased links between all those networks. ``To me, that's really
the local telephone business of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Penzias said the best opportunity might be for technology to
help solve the nation's transportation problems. ``You could be the
Microsoft of transportation.''

 0609 &HT;    Kukoc-Rodman switch thriving
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was a curious move by coach Phil Jackson. Whether
he turned Toni Kukoc into a starter and Dennis Rodman into a
reserve because of matchups, as Jackson said, or punishment for
Rodman's perpetual tardiness, as many believe, it's worked out
nicely for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc _ dubbed the Croatian Sensation _ has been a viable
offensive weapon at the start of games, and Rodman finally has
stopped sulking and delivered the kind of energy, defense and
rebounding Chicago needs to fulfill its championship ambition.
Those two are major reasons the Bulls are within two victories of
their sixth NBA title in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of Toni and Dennis has given us great play,''
Chicago guard Steve Kerr said. ``They changed when they'll play,
but they didn't change roles. And it's given us what we needed at
different times in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc has wanted to be a starter for a long time, but there was
no place for him to crack the lineup with Rodman at power forward
and Scottie Pippen at the other forward. So he became one of the
best sixth men in the league, with guard's skills in a flexible
6-foot-10 body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni can cause problems for any defense,'' Michael Jordan
said. ``His skills make it tough to defend him.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals, Jackson said
he elevated Kukoc to starter because he wanted Rodman to match up
with Antonio Davis, the Indiana Pacers' top substitute. Jackson's
decision came after Rodman missed a practice and showed up late for
the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc did not question why he suddenly became a starter; he just
flourished. Matched against any of the Pacers' big men, Kukoc took
them outside, where they were uncomfortable. When defended by
smaller players, he moved inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the deciding Game 7 of the conference finals, Kukoc scored 21
points and helped lead Chicago to victory. He has been a major
factor in two victories against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, he attacked the basket off the dribble early,
establishing a mindset that carried the Bulls to a critical
victory. And in Sunday night's historic 96-54 crushing of the Jazz,
Kukoc had 16 points, four rebounds, four assists and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Toni's offense, and he's been giving it to us,''
Pippen said. ``He takes pressure off me and Michael to carry all
the load. That's what Phil was looking for in starting Toni.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all worked out _ so far, at least _ because Rodman, in his
own words, has ``decided to just shut up and play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni's in there, and that's it,'' Rodman said. ``I just know I
have to do my thing when I get in. It's tough, because I've started
all year. But we're trying to win a championship, so you just play
when you're told.''

 0609 &HT;    Intense Sloan mellows
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was the morning after Utah's Game 1 victory in the
Finals, and Jerry Sloan was listening to reports of discord among
the Chicago Bulls. He was openly skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never been inside my huddle,'' he said, recounting
strong disagreements among his players. ``When it happens I tell
'em, `Look, you guys want to fight, wait until after the game.
We'll get the ice picks and go out in the parking lot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan grins under the John Deere tractor hat he wears, the one
with ``Coach Sloan'' written on the back. He's not a very patient
man, and he doesn't suffer fools very well.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter asks a question, and Sloan says he already has dealt
with that issue earlier. ``Where were you?'' he asks. Sloan decides
to answer the question anyway, and when the reporter begins to walk
away, Sloan grabs his shoulder and says, ``Hey, I didn't hurt your
feelings, did I?''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he wouldn't have worried about the reporter's
feelings. Wouldn't have answered the question, either.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Jerry Sloan is a tough guy. Always was. He came
from tiny Evansville College in the 1960s and earned a reputation
as the toughest player in the NBA. Although he couldn't shoot a
lick, he still made the All-NBA team twice on the strength of his
defense. He was named to the All-NBA defensive team six times.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Loughery, who played against Sloan, compared his
relentlessness on the court to Michael Jordan's and Bill Russell's.
``Only thing is, Jerry wasn't the most talented guy in the world,''
Loughery said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why what happened here Sunday _ Chicago's 96-54 victory
in Game 3 of the NBA finals _ is so difficult for Sloan to stomach.
His teams are supposed to compete. Period. But his Utah team was
manhandled.
</P>
<P>
   So Sloan was faced with the task of picking up the pieces on
Monday. A year ago, it would have been a fire-and-brimstone
proposition. But Sloan has been calm this week, mellowed by what he
calls, ``the toughest year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after the Jazz lost to the Bulls in the finals, his
wife, Bobbye, was diagnosed with breast cancer. The chemotherapy,
then the surgery in January, the wrenching emotional turns of
despair, hope and recovery have softened Jerry Sloan, a little
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller, who owns the Jazz, says he saw a new side of Sloan
in February, when the Rony Seikaly trade broke down and Greg Foster
and Chris Morris were returned to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Foster and Morris were angry, and Miller asked them in front of
the team if they were going to accept what happened and get on with
the season.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Sloan if he had anything to say. ``He said, `Yeah,
there is,' and he started talking about Bobbye. Blew my mind. I
mean, I think it blew everybody's mind, because he's never done
that. He said, `I've learned what's important. We all like to win
basketball games, but winning games isn't as important as your wife
and your family and stuff like that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it in about two minutes,'' Miller said. ``It was so out
of character for him. But it really showed all of us a side of him
that he had never been willing to disclose to us before, especially
as a group. It simply boils down to him learning what really is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why Sloan did not wreak havoc after Sunday's
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat embarrassed for NBA basketball,'' he said after
the loss. ``I can accept losing, but it's always a disappointment
not playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Their lackadaisical effort landed the Jazz in the record book
for futility. Utah's 54 points are the fewest scored in an NBA game
since the inception of the 24-second shot clock in 1954-55, one
point less than Indiana's output against the San Antonio Spurs in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 42-point victory is the largest margin of victory
in NBA Finals history, eclipsing a 35-point Washington victory over
Seattle in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment to all of us,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   And that was enough.

PENTAGON TO INVESTIGATE CHARGES IT USED NERVE GAS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen has ordered an
inquiry into new charges that U.S. forces used nerve gas against
U.S. defectors during the Vietnam War, the Pentagon said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen stressed that the Pentagon had not found evidence to
substantiate the allegations, which were raised by Cable News
Network and Time magazine. But he said he had asked the Air Force
and the Army to search their records from the Vietnam War era to
determine whether the accusations have merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious allegation, obviously,'' Cohen said Monday.
``And it's something that I have asked the service secretaries and
those acting in their place to conduct an investigation and to find
out whatever information that could validate these charges. At this
point, I see no such information that would support that. But you
know, it is always possible. So we will continue to look at it, and
I will follow up with the information that comes from the service
secretaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report on Sunday asserted that sarin, a lethal nerve
gas, was used by U.S. Special Forces in a covert operation in Laos
in September 1970 aimed at a village believed to be harboring U.S.
soldiers who had defected. The Time article on the subject was
published concurrently; Time and CNN are both owned by Time-Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Code-named Operation Tailwind, the mission was to attack the
village and kill the defectors, according to the CNN-Time account.
Quoting several soldiers who said they had been involved, CNN and
Time reported that the unit found a number of white men in the
village whom they believed to be U.S. defectors. In the report one
officer described chasing two white men into a tunnel system, and
then dropping in a grenade, presumably killing them.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief attack on the village, the report alleges,
Montagnard tribesmen fighting with the special forces said they
found several Americans dead in the village huts, but no bodies
were identified or recovered.
</P>
<P>
   As the special forces unit was withdrawing, it came under
increased fire and called for air support, according to the report.
Air Force planes then dropped gas canisters on North Vietnamese and
Pathet Lao soldiers, and the U.S. soldiers say they saw the enemy
troops vomiting and convulsing from exposure to the gas. CNN and
Time added that ``veteran special forces officers'' said sarin was
also used the night before the raid to ``prepare'' the village for
the upcoming attack, indicating that civilians as well as soldiers
were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Time reported that Thomas Moorer, a retired Navy admiral who
served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1970, confirmed
the use of sarin during the Laotian mission and on a number of
search-and-rescue missions for downed U.S. pilots during the war
</P>
<P>
   But Moorer said Monday that he had no firsthand knowledge of the
Laotian mission, or of the use of sarin in Vietnam. ``The
authorization for the use of gas would have had to come from higher
than me,'' he said.

TEXAS GUARD ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY ABUSING MISSOURI INMATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Mo.) 
 
(Eds.: A tilde goes over N in ZUNIGA) 
 
By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A former Houston-area jail guard was arrested Monday
for allegedly slamming a Missouri inmate's face into a wall, an
incident that was uncovered in an investigation of videotaped abuse
of prisoners by guards.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton David Wallace, 50, was arrested on federal civil rights
charges at 6:30 a.m. Monday at his home in Angleton and taken
before a federal magistrate, said Don K. Clark, special agent in
charge of the Houston FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   Angleton is about 35 miles south of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nov. 7, 1996, incident, inmate Clarence Fisher lost a
tooth and suffered facial injuries at the Brazoria County jail.
Fisher was one of hundreds of Missouri inmates housed at the East
Texas jail through a contract with Capital Correctional Resources
Inc., a private Texas company.
</P>
<P>
   Although the November incident was not videotaped, the charge
did stem from an investigation into the tape of the Sept. 18, 1996,
incident, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   On that videotape, which was released in August 1997 and
televised nationally, prisoners from the state of Missouri can be
seen being prodded with stun guns, kicked by guards and bitten by
police dogs as they are forced to crawl on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation into Brazoria County is still ongoing,''
said Clark, who declined to specify whether any subsequent
indictments would involve guards hired by CCRI as Wallace was, or
sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're looking into a wide spectrum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Brazoria County authorities had brought the
problem and the videotape to the federal agency's attention.
</P>
<P>
   James H. DeAtley, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
Texas, said Wallace could get 10 years in prison and fined $250,000
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indictment represents a commitment by this office to
ensure that all citizens, even those who are serving terms of
imprisonment, have their civil rights protected,'' DeAtley said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, attorney general of Missouri, said, ``What we saw in
the videotape was not acceptable conduct. We do not allow and do
not condone abusive conduct toward our inmates. In Missouri we
believe in hard time, not abusive time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the investigation had shown ``CCRI had not done a
good enough job to ensure the guards were controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace told U.S. Magistrate John Froeschner that he understood
his rights and that he could not afford an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Froeschner released him on a $25,000 personal recognizance bond
and ordered the U.S. Public Defender's office in Houston to
represent him. After signing bond papers, Wallace left the
courthouse with his wife. He will be formally arraigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who CCRI employed as a lieutenant, pleaded guilty to
brutalizing an inmate with a riot stick in 1983, when he was a
major in a Texas state prison, the Darrington unit. He was
sentenced to five months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   On the Brazoria County videotape, Wallace is shown pushing an
inmate on the floor with his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Private guards and sheriff's emergency response team officers
clad in riot gear were involved in the incident, which sheriff's
officials have said was sparked when some prisoners tossed food
trays and guards smelled marijuana smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the disturbance, which was taped for later use
as a training video, led to the FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has since canceled contracts totaling $12 million with
Brazoria, Limestone and Gregg counties, where jails are managed by
Capital Correctional Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 inmates were withdrawn and bused back to Missouri.
CCRI laid off most of the 82 full-time employees and 33 part-time
employees who had been hired to guard them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for CCRI, which was previously headquartered in
Groesbeck, Texas, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County District Attorney Jerome Aldrich, who gave the
FBI and the state Commission on Jail Standards copies of the
videotape, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Brazoria County Sheriff Joe King's office also declined comment,
saying Wallace was not his employee.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape and alleged assaults have spawned at least two
lawsuits _ one from inmates and another from Missouri seeking
additional information for a possible breach of contract lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who is now serving his 10-year robbery sentence in
Sikeston, Mo., is one of about 500 inmates who have filed federal
civil rights lawsuits against CCRI.

 JUSTICES HEAR STARR'S CASE THAT DEATH ENDS LAWYER-CLIENT PRIVILEGE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors for the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, argued before the Supreme Court Monday that notes from a
conversation between the late White House aide Vincent Foster and
his lawyer should be turned over to the Whitewater grand jury. If
the court agrees, the relationship between attorneys and their
clients could be forever changed.
</P>
<P>
   The case marks the the first time the court has addressed this
bedrock aspect of legal practice. Foster's lawyer, James Hamilton,
argued Monday that the attorney-client privilege should extend
beyond a client's death in order to protect reputations and promote
candor between lawyers and those they represent. As Hamilton argued
before the justices, President Clinton's personal lawyer, David
Kendall, watched intently from the middle of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do care about reputations and the faith of family and
friends after their death,'' said Hamilton. He added that if the
attorney-client privilege ends with death, it would have a
``significant chilling effect on client candor.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Starr told the nine justices that the notes between
Hamilton and Foster were crucial to the investigation and should be
turned over to the grand jury in the pursuit of truth. Starr is
investigating whether White House aides lied about the extent of
Hillary Rodham Clinton's involvement in the mass firing of White
House travel office employees in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first position is that death ends it,'' said Brett
Kavanaugh, a prosecutor in Starr's office. As Kavanaugh spoke,
Starr, who argued many cases before the Supreme Court when he was
the US solicitor general, sat next to the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1993, nine days before he put a gun to his head and
killed himself in a Virginia park, Foster, a White House deputy
counsel, arrived in Hamilton's living room and talked for two hours
about the travel office firings and the controversy that ensued.
Hamilton took three pages of notes and marked them confidential, he
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the two began talking, Foster asked if the conversation
was confidential, Hamilton said. ``Without hesitation, I said that
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in Washington had ruled in the Foster
case that once a client dies, the disclosure of information is
permissible if it is of substantial importance to a criminal
investigation. Such a loophole prompted Justice Antonin Scalia to
comment that the exception ``pretty much swallows up the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices blitzed the two attorneys with questions and
comments during the hourlong oral arguments, leaving the lawyers
often unable to complete a sentence before being interrupted from
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Justice Anthony Kennedy appeared particularly
skeptical of Hamilton's argument that the privilege is extended
into eternity. At one point, Kennedy questioned what might happen
if a client confessed to a crime another suspect was accused of.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said if Foster
had lived, the grand jury probably would not be entitled to the
attorney's notes. Because of Foster's death, she said, the
prosecution might get more information than it otherwise would be
entitled.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer said to Kavanaugh, ``People all over the
country go to a lawyer and think they're safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavanaugh argued that clients may want information given to a
grand jury after their death to ``fulfill their basic obligation as
a citizen and provide information to the grand jury.'' Justice
David Souter said there may be some people who do not want any such
obligation fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The court accepted the case on an unusually expedited schedule.
A decision is expected by the end of the month, before the justices
leave for their extended summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers around the country have already marked the decision as
crucial to the way clients will relate to their attorneys for years
to come. For generations, the attorney-client privilege, which
forbids a lawyer to divulge the contents of any conversation with
his client without the client's permission, was considered
absolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sweeping is the chilling effect of this,'' said Larry
Fox, a Philadelphia trial lawyer and the former chairman of the
American Bar Association ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You create what looks like a relatively narrow exception, but
in advance, you never know when it might apply,'' Fox said. ``So it
has the effect of a lawyer having to say that you can't promise the
confidentiality you ordinarily could.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox and other lawyers said they can envision scenarios where
attorneys would have to explain to clients in criminal cases that
when the client dies, some of the information might have to be
divulged. Such a warning, the lawyers said, would likely cause
clients to hold back crucial information.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, noting this fear, said in court
that a client must ``feel free to tell a lawyer the truth and the
whole truth.'' Still, Rehnquist questioned both sides closely.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the White House travel office firings has lingered
for five years, as have the questions over the first lady's role.
Initially, White House aides denied that Mrs. Clinton played any
part in the firings, but a memorandum from former Clinton adviser
David Watkins was turned over to Starr's office in 1996 saying she
``desired action _ the action desired was the firing of the travel
office.''

   After Monday's court session, Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly
said his office was not trying to diminish attorney-client
privileges except in criminal cases involving significant
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is we are trying to seek every means to get
information to the grand jury,'' Bakaly said. ``The point is, we're
looking to get the information, the facts, as many ways as we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the case, Starr's office sent aides to Boston to
comb the records of the Charles Stuart case, in which Stuart killed
his pregnant wife, made up a black assailant, and later killed
himself after meeting with a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled
that the attorney-client privilege is not altered by the client's
death, and that Stuart's words to lawyer John Dawley were ordered
protected.

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM WORLD CUP '98
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Brazil? Germany? England? Inquiring minds want to
know what to expect from the 16th World Cup, which kicks off
Wednesday with games in Saint-Denis and Montpellier.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ronaldo fulfill all the hype in his first real test since
being crowned ``the new Pele''? Might Roberto Baggio get the
opportunity to redeem himself for that penalty-kick disaster in the
Rose Bowl four years ago? Can the United States provide the biggest
surprise in an event that promises many?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? That's what they play the games for there are other
issues, far more vital if you happen to be in France for the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Who, for instance, will go on strike next? And where will we be
stranded when they do? Are the threats of terrorism and hooliganism
serious? Anyone know where a decent meal can be found for a
reasonable price?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the primary concerns of those fortunate enough or damned,
depending on one's outlook to spend the next month in France will
be peripheral to the soccer that goes on around them. The game is
there, everywhere, from Toulouse to Lens to Bordeaux to Lyon, sort
of like air and bottled water. If you love the sport, this is
Mecca; if you don't, this is hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had enough of the Coupe de Monde, and it hasn't even
started yet,'' one railway worker here noted the other night as he
stepped over one of the dozens of young fans who had taken
residence in Lyon's Gare de Perrache.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when play finally begins, he figured to be off the
job. What better way, the rail workers figure, to get your point
across than with a strike on the day the entire world's attention
is on France. Of course, the French's attitude might be there's no
day that's too good for a strike. Air France pilots have been off
the job for about a week now, and before the champion is crowned
July 12 at the new Stade de France in Saint-Denis, they are
expected to be joined by just about everyone in the transportation
industry. Work stoppages, it appears, are the true national sport
here.
</P>
<P>
   It's not soccer. France, unlike Italy or Germany or England (or
a major part of the civilized world) isn't gaga over booting a ball
around, but that might change in the next few weeks. It all depends
on Zinedine Zidane remember the name and what he can prod from the
home team. The French are one of the favorites for the title, which
has never been so wide-open before. Brazil, Argentina, France,
Germany, England, Holland, Yugoslavia, Spain all appear capable of
capturing the title ... or of failure. Of that group, only
Argentina, Holland, Yugoslavia and Spain are playing like champions
at the moment; so is Norway, which nobody seriously considers a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody has to win. Here's my best guess who it will be:
</P>
<P>
   (8 point) Group play (top 2 each group advance)
</P>
<P>
   Group A:
</P>
<P>
   1. Norway; 2. Brazil; 3. Morocco; 4. Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, my ``surprise'' team of the tournament, edges the
favored Brazilians for first, stunning everyone except Norway coach
Egil Olsen, who has spent most of '98 insisting his is the better
team. A fine performance isn't enough for Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Group B:
</P>
<P>
   1. Italy; 2. Chile; 3. Cameroon; 4. Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The Azzurri are the class of the group, shutting down Chilean
strikers Marcelo Salas and Ivan Zamorano, who score at will against
overmatched Cameroonians and Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   Group C:
</P>
<P>
   1. France; 2. South Africa; 3. Denmark; 4. Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The host has it easy, and Bafana Bafana's artistry outweighs the
Danes' toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Group D:
</P>
<P>
   1. Spain; 2. Nigeria; 3. Bulgaria; 4. Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Group of Death? Not for the Spaniards, who have far too much for
any of their D comrades. Nigeria somehow gets its act together to
edge the aging Bulgars.
</P>
<P>
   Group E:
</P>
<P>
   1. Netherlands; 2. Belgium; 3. South Korea; 4. Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   No problem for the Dutch, and none really for the Belgians,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Group F:
</P>
<P>
   1. Yugoslavia; 2. Germany; 3. United States; 4. Iran
</P>
<P>
   The Germans might be in for a surprise when they meet the
Americans, but Yugoslavia will be the class of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Group G:
</P>
<P>
   1. Romania; 2. England; 3. Colombia; 4. Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Romania takes charge and England hangs on.
</P>
<P>
   Group H:
</P>
<P>
   1. Argentina; 2. Croatia; 3. Jamaica; 4. Japan.
</P>
<P>
   No contest here:
</P>
<P>
   Argentina romps to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Knockout phase
</P>
<P>
   Second round:
</P>
<P>
   Norway over Chile, Italy over Brazil, France over Bulgaria,
Spain over South Africa, Netherlands over Germany, Yugoslavia over
Belgium, Romania over Croatia, Argentina over England.
</P>
<P>
   Intense matchups await Brazil, Germany and England, who pay for
their inadequate first-round performances; the Italians gain
revenge for 1994, on penalty kicks, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterfinals:
</P>
<P>
   France over Italy, Norway over Spain, Argentina over
Netherlands, Yugoslavia over Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Norway's stunning run continues, and Yugoslavia is looking
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   Semifinals:
</P>
<P>
   Argentina over Norway, Yugoslavia over France.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina has too much and France not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Third place:
</P>
<P>
   France over Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts treat this as a real game and school the Norwegians,
who are still celebrating their drive to the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Championship:
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia over Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   A classic encounter, with skill winning out.

TOBACCO BILL FACES DEATH IN SENATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The architects of a landmark plan to combat youth
smoking faced a new reality Monday: All the momentum that propelled
the proposal to the front lines of Congress has dissolved into an
aura of doom.
</P>
<P>
   After defying a series of death notices in recent months, the
$516 billion effort to overhaul the tobacco industry is gasping in
the Senate in what partisans on both sides said could be its last
breath.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate poised for a key confrontation today over the
controversial antitobacco measure, the Republican majority leader,
Trent Lott told reporters Monday the bill is close to ``not being
able to be resurrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, echoing several conservative colleagues, said the bill's
sponsors have ``lost control,'' allowing the measure to mushroom
from an effort to reduce youth smoking into ``a budget-busting
spending bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has lost its focus,'' Lott said, ``and it should be
pulled'' from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a senior aide to a senator who helped craft the
bill said closed-door negotiations were under way ``to see whether
there is any life still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the general mood is not very optimistic,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's demise, which supporters vowed to try to prevent,
would immediately transform the tobacco showdown from a legislative
debate to a major issue in the 1998 congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the defining issue this year,'' said Senator
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote today on Daschle's motion to end
debate and force a final vote on the bill. But even though a
majority of senators are considered likely to support the measure's
final passage if a vote is held, Lott said the GOP majority was
united against cutting short the debate because it would prevent
senators from presenting and voting on numerous amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle's motion to end debate requires 60 votes to pass, more
than Daschle said he can muster. The motion's failure could
ultimately prevent a final vote on the bill unless negotiators
reach an agreement for considering amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Daschle, who has filed a second motion to end debate that is
scheduled for a vote tomorrow, vowed to press on, despite the
serious obstacles. He said that if his motions fail, he will offer
the antitobacco measure as an amendment ``to every bill coming down
the pike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the Republicans to come to the realization that
we're going to do this one like we've done others _ the easy way or
the hard way,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that the measure is not dead. ``We'll see to it that
it's not dead,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require tobacco companies to pay the government
$516 billion over 25 years to help pay for smoking-related
illnesses. The measure also would increase the price of cigarettes
by $1.10 over three years. And it would cap the amount of civil
damages the industry would have to pay each year at $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of highly contentious issues are pending, including
attempts to use revenues from the bill to reduce the so-called
marriage tax penalty and to combat drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, disputes loom over how to deal with tobacco farmers
who would be affected by the legislation and whether limits should
be placed on the fees lawyers receive for suing the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is being slammed from the left and the right,'' said
the Senate aide.
</P>
<P>
   The question, the aide said, is whether the legislation can be
saved by a coalition described by the prime sponsor, Arizona
Republican Senator John McCain, as ``the great center.''

FLINT STRIKE IDLES OTHER GM PLANTS, AND WORKERS ARE SENT HOME  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Kan., Ohio)   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With two of its factories running out of essential
components, General Motors sent 4,500 workers home Monday as a
four-day strike at a metal stamping plant in Flint, Mich.,
threatened to halt vehicle production for the world's largest
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors
Corp. began their fourth straight day of bargaining, assembly
factories in Orion Township, Mich., and Kansas City, Kan., were
closed because of a shortage of engine cradles, according to the
company and union officials. Salaried employees remained at the
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The auto maker said an additional 8,500 workers could be idled
on Tuesday with the scheduled closing of a light truck factory in
Moraine, Ohio, a car assembly factory in Flint and a second shift
at the Kansas factory.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday is the strike deadline at a second Flint
parts-making factory, where 5,000 workers are demanding more job
security.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of plant closings was set in motion by the strike of
3,400 hourly workers at GM's sprawling metal plant in Flint, where
the workers contend that the automaker has reneged on a promise of
$300 million in new investments that would essentially guarantee
future employment. At least 17 of GM's 29 North American assembly
plants use fenders, hoods and engine cradles built in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM says the plant is not competitive, but that's their answer
to everything,'' said Dick Shoemaker, the union's vice president
for negotiations with the company. GM's response is that it will
not back down until the UAW lives up to its promise to abolish work
practices that give workers a full day's pay for a half-day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts estimate that the strike could cost the
company $300 million a week in profits. Strikers receive $150 a
week from the UAW and risk losing two weeks of paid vacation that
other employees will get this month during the company's annual
two-week summer shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, workers who are laid off are eligible for state
unemployment benefits, but GM typically fights against issuing
benefits to UAW workers laid off during a strike. A company
spokesman said GM was still deciding whether it would challenge the
benefits, a tactic it tried during a strike at two Dayton, Ohio,
plants in 1996. ``Nobody can afford to be laid off,'' said Dan
Fairbanks of UAW Local 31, which represents GM's 3,400 workers in
Kansas City. ``But somebody has to make GM keep its promises to
us.''

11 PLAYES TO WATCH IN FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Keep your eye on these players who can have an
impact at the World Cup:
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Keller/United States
</P>
<P>
   The only American who can be called ``world-class'' --- he stops
the unstoppable --- and the one man who can carry the Yanks to the
second round or better. If he plays as in the 1-0 win over Brazil,
the U.S. might stun the field.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Maldini/Italy
</P>
<P>
   The Azzurri coach's son got no favors from dad: He's been the
game's premier defender for nearly a decade. He's slowed down a
bit, but his positioning is so good that it hardly matters.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Carlos/Brazil
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Ronaldo hype --- OK, don't forget it. But remember
this wing-defender, only 5-foot-6, is the planet's premier
footballer. Works hard, crosses well and the goals he scores belong
in the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Jaap Stam/Netherlands
</P>
<P>
   No one questions Holland's flair, but its defending ... well,
that's another tale. With Stam, the best Dutch player of the past
year or so, that could change: He's speedy man-marker, solid but
not spectacular --- exactly what is needed from a top-flight
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielders
</P>
<P>
   Didier Deschamps/France
</P>
<P>
   Eric Cantona, the great, arrogant forward, dismissed Deschamps
as a ``water carrier'' --- wine is more like it. The best defensive
midfielder in the world and the key figure in France's transition
game. He can tackle, he can distribute, and --- unlike Cantona ---
isn't about to brag about his skills. They're quite apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Nwankwo Kanu/Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   He led the Super Eagles to the Olympic gold medal two years ago,
then was told to quit when diagnosed with a hole in his heart. The
gentle giant --- he's 6-foot-6 --- refused, returned to America for
surgery and rehabbed at UCLA under an assumed name. He's back,
better than ever, and could guide Nigeria to the heights so many
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Ortega/Argentina
</P>
<P>
   The successor to Diego Maradona, with a good deal of the skill
and none of the trouble. He can score goals --- had five to lead
Argentina in qualifying --- and has built a strong relationship
with striker Gabriel Batistuta, who has never scored as often for
his national team as for his club sides. Ortega could change that.
</P>
<P>
   Zinedine Zidane/France
</P>
<P>
   The second coming of Michel Platini? Maybe. The son of Algerian
immigrants, Zidane is the most dangerous playmaker in the
tournament, able to score, create goals --- do anything, really. If
he can connect with France's inconsistent forwards, the hosts could
go far.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards
</P>
<P>
   Tore Andre Flo/Norway
</P>
<P>
   Hulking striker at the center of Norway's ugly but effective
attack, nicknamed ``Flonaldo'' for his scoring ability. One of
three Flos on a squad that, if everything does flow, could be the
surprise of the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Mijatovic/Yugoslavia
</P>
<P>
   Loves to take chances, and they could pay off sweetly for this
rising star. He's got speed, superb reactions and technique, and it
led to 14 goals during qualifying --- and another to give Real
Madrid the European Champions Cup crown.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo/Brazil
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed as the ``next Pele,'' there's certainly no better
finisher in the game. He's the world's answer to Michael Jordan,
making $15 million a year on the field and far, far more from
endorsements. How he deals with the attention of rival defenders
may determine whether the Brazilians repeat.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. said on Monday that it had lowered
prices on its Pentium II microprocessors for desktop computers by
12 percent to 20 percent. Intel also introduced a faster version of
its low-end Celeron processor and dropped the price of the older,
slower model by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said the price cuts reflected increased
efficiencies in manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the cuts, the first that Intel has made in the
final month of a quarter, more likely reflected an attempt to
revive a sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also dismissed the faster Celeron, noting that it still
lacked the memory called cache, which improves performance on
Pentium and equivalent chips from competing companies such as
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the Cyrix unit of the National
Semiconductor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think revenues are coming in below plan to date, and the
company is hoping these price cuts really provide a kick start for
the quarter's end,'' said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``Revenues are going to have to
pick up pretty smartly for margins not to be impacted. It's a tough
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel slipped 50 cents on Monday, to $69.3125.
Analysts said the price cuts had been long expected, as was the
antitrust suit filed against Intel on Monday by the Federal Trade
Commission. Intel shares are down 32 percent from their 52-week
high of $102 reached in August.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the company and Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's largest
computer maker, said that they planned to strengthen their
relationship. People close to the companies said Fujitsu would
announce that it planned to make work stations and servers using
Intel's forthcoming Pentium II Xeon and Merced microprocessors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In announcing the price cuts, Intel said it had shifted desktop
production exclusively to the Pentium II product line, which is
made using an advanced manufacturing process called .25 micron. But
it said that the older Pentium with MMX Technology chips would
remain in production for notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel cut the price of its 400-megahertz Pentium II processor
from $824 to $722, or about 12 percent; the 350-megahertz from $621
to $519, or 16 percent; the 333-megahertz from $492 to $412, or 16
percent; the 300-megahertz from $375 to $305, or 19 percent; the
266-megahertz from $246 to $198, or 20 percent, and the
233-megahertz from $198 to $161, or 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new Celeron 300-megahertz chip is priced at $159; the price
of the 266-megahertz Celeron was lowered to $106, from $155.

ACCORD ON MERCURY EMISSIONS COULD PROD OTHERS INTO ACTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New England governors and eastern Canadian premiers agreed
Monday to cut in half emissions of mercury from power plants,
incinerators, and other sources by 2003, in a dramatic move aimed
at reducing elevated levels of the toxic metal found in freshwater
fish across the region.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, aimed in part at pressuring the US and Canadian
governments to take stronger action, probably will lead to tougher
regulation of the burning of coal, trash, and medical waste as well
as a regional effort to get mercury out of consumer products from
batteries to children's sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the prospect of mounting state and federal regulations
on mercury and other pollutants prompted permanent closure of a
waste incinerator in Massachusetts last week. The owners of a
second incinerator, a medical waste burner in Lawrence, also were
reportedly considering closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of agreement that almost two decades ago set
in motion the national legislation in the US and Canada that has
(reduced) acid rain,'' said Ned Sullivan, Maine's commissioner of
environmental protection. ``We think we lit a fuse today that will
ultimately have implications well beyond the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont led the
charge in passing the resolution, at one point advocating the
``virtual elimination'' of mercury emissions in 10 years. However,
Canadian officials concerned about the impact on Nova Scotia's coal
industry succeeded in removing the phase-out deadline from the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the softer language, Governor Howard Dean of Vermont was
jubilant that the premiers and governors had endorsed a call to
action. He said the resolution would put pressure to follow suit on
the Midwest, where coal-burning plants account for nearly a third
of the mercury that falls on New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really put the problem on the screen for the leadership
of the eastern provinces and the Northeast states, and, because of
this, it will put it on the national screen,'' said Dean in a
telephone interview from the regional premiers and governors
meeting in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also praised the resolution, but warned that
the real test will be laws and regulations passed by each state and
province. ``These plans are an important first step in reducing
mercury pollution and acid deposition in our region,'' said Cindy
Luppi of Clean Water Action in Boston. ``But the real work lies
ahead'' in implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury pollution has emerged as a growing issue in New England
as samples of freshwater fish increasingly show high levels of
mercury, especially in larger sport fish prized by fishermen.
Massachusetts has issued a statewide advisory that women of
childbearing age and children should limit consumption of
freshwater fish, while other states have gone further.
</P>
<P>
   The human body has no use for mercury, which attacks the central
nervous system and, in high doses, can cause insanity or even
death. In the 1950s, mercury poisoning killed hundreds of people in
Minimata, Japan, who ate seafood caught near an offshore industrial
dumping ground.
</P>
<P>
   However, much less is known about long-term, low-level exposure
to mercury such as that from eating bass or trout caught in New
England. Public health officials say they are most concerned about
people who eat large amounts of freshwater fish.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury also harms fish-eating wildlife, such as bald eagles,
many of which have elevated mercury levels in their blood, studies
have shown.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the mercury falling on the Northeast comes from sources
within the region, according to a study by the Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management in Boston. Trash and medical waste
incinerators, in turn, account for about half of the 15,000 pounds
of mercury coming from New England sources.
</P>
<P>
   To address the mercury problem, Maine, Vermont, and
Massachusetts have adopted new laws and regulations. For example,
Vermont and Maine will require mercury-containing products to be
labeled in hopes of keeping them out of incinerators. Vermont
officials also plan to require mercury-containing waste to be
handled as hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, meanwhile, has proposed tight limits on mercury
coming out of incinerator stacks that will force plant owners to
install new antipollution equipment and prevent lamps, batteries,
and other mercury-containing waste from being burned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ogden Corp. announced it would close down its
waste-to-energy incinerator in Lawrence rather than invest in new
pollution controls that would reduce emissions of mercury and other
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, environmentalist Bill Ravanasi of Health Care
Without Harm said that Browning-Ferris Industries has filed an
application with the state to close its medical waste incinerator
in Lawrence and replace it with sterilization equipment. Company
officials could not be reached to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   But New England officials said no single state can solve a
problem that is carried on the wind. Maine official Sullivan called
on the US government to limit mercury from all coal-burning plants,
while Dean said the government should lead the effort to get
mercury out of consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
Commissioner David Struhs said the resolution adopted Monday should
give the Northeast and eastern Canada a powerful voice in the
mercury debate. ``This is a big win for us,'' said Struhs. ``For
the first time ever, it says that our goal should be the virtual
elimination of manmade mercury.''

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norwest Corp. and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. agreed on Monday to merge in
a $34 billion deal, the latest in a string of blockbuster unions
that have created a cadre of giants and a few dozen also-rans in
the once sleepy banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by stalled revenue growth and heightened competition from
mutual funds, brokerage firms and credit-card companies, banks have
been rushing into one another's arms in record numbers over the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   But bank mergers like the expected deal Monday have proceeded at
a particularly blistering pace so far this year and only a handful
of outsized deals remain to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Banks that have already linked up now have to prove to the
public and shareholders that mammoth banking franchises with
national or international aspirations can be managed effectively,
and are more than merely the unwieldy creations of chief
executives' egos.
</P>
<P>
   If all bank mergers announced so far this year are completed,
the ranks of the elite titans will include Citigroup, BankAmerica
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Banc One Corp.,
First Union Corp. and Wells Fargo, which will be based in San
Francisco and retain its name but will be run by Norwest's chief
executive, Richard Kovacevich.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest and Wells expect the deal to be completed in three to
four months.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction will pressure smaller banks to jump into the
merger game, especially Fleet Financial Group, National City Corp.,
Keycorp, PNC Bank Corp., BankBoston Corp., U.S. Bancorp, Mellon
Bank Corp., Wachovia Corp. and Sun Trust Banks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the merger, the new Wells, with about $186 billion in
assets, still would be quite a bit smaller than the top three banks
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.,
would have $697 billion in assets; BankAmerica, a combination of
BankAmerica and Nationsbank Corp., would have assets of $571
billion, while Chase has assets of about $366 billion. The new
Wells, and even Banc One, could become part of larger empires in
another year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Yet size does not really matter if a bank cannot make a buck.
And profitability, as Wells learned when it botched its takeover of
First Interstate Corp. over the last few years, can be derailed
when a merger goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Norwest and Wells would create a potential powerhouse
west of the Mississippi River. Norwest, the biggest mortgage lender
in the country, is one of the few banks that have successfully sold
products like insurance, credit cards, and annuities to their
customers. It styles itself as a financial Wal-Mart, and tapping
into Wells' customer base in Western states would provide it with
more shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said that layoffs associated with the merger are
expected to be ``minimal,'' but they declined to quantify job
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have embraced different operating philosophies
over the years. Norwest, based in Minneapolis, likes to keep its
operations decentralized, while Wells has traditionally been very
centralized. Norwest favors bank branches, while Wells has
emphasized electronic banking via telephone, online services and
automated teller machines. All of this could have an impact on some
of the banks' smaller customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think you will see a very significant culture clash that
will result in the loss of smaller companies and individuals,''
said Evie Fass, a banking analyst with Stern Marketing Group, a
consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif. ``Ultimately you have two very
smart banks that know how to make money. But smaller community
banks will be able to target individual customers left in the dust
by big mergers like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see the merger as working despite inevitable culture
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's attractive because of the complementary nature of their
markets and the fact that they're both retail banks,'' said Keith
Stock, a consultant with A.T. Kearney Inc. in New York. ``This
merger is based on the potential for top-line revenue growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The two banks have talked informally over the last few years
about a merger, but the talks became more serious a few months ago
when Kovacevich invited Wells' chief executive, Paul Hazen, to talk
about the merits of a deal. Investment bankers and lawyers were
then retained, and the real outlines of a merger began to take
shape about 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest was advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and by the law firms
of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &AMP; Jacobson and Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen &AMP; Katz. Wells was advised by Goldman, Credit Suisse First
Boston and the New York law firms of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell and
Wachtell, Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for an investment bank to straddle both sides of a
deal, and Credit Suisse was invited in to render its opinion of the
transaction because Goldman was advising both banks.
</P>
<P>
   The combined banks' board of directors will be evenly
represented by both companies, but Wells shareholders, who will
receive 10 Norwest shares for each Wells share they own, will own
about 52.5 percent of the combined company with Norwest
shareholders holding the balance. Based on Norwest's share price
Friday, the merger with Wells is worth $396.875 a share or nearly
$34 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Norwest's
shares dropped $2.875 to $36.8125 while Wells' shares rose $2.50 to
$365.75.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hazen will be chairman, Kovacevich will be chief
executive and president and is expected to exert more managerial
influence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-regarded executives in banking, the 53-year-old
Kovacevich began his banking career at Citicorp in 1975. He stayed
there for 10 years and left in 1986 after he was passed over for
the presidency. He became Norwest's president in 1989 and was named
chief executive in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is credited with helping turn around Norwest, which was mired
in bad loans when he arrived, and for building the bank's business
through small but profitable acquisitions in the Midwest. But none
remotely resemble the megamerger with Wells, and Kovacevich is
ignoring his aversion to doing a deal in what he has repeatedly
called an overheated merger environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We complement each other,'' Kovacevich said Monday. ``Where
one has a strength, the other has a weakness. That is the essence
and excitement of this great new franchise.''

TENSIONS ESCALATE AS JEWISH SETTLERS MOVE INTO ARAB NEIGHBORHOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Jewish settlers took over two old stone houses in an
Arab neighborhood of east Jerusalem before dawn Monday, raising
Israeli flags over the structures, putting up barbed wire and
scuffling with Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen settlers from Elad, a hard-line Jewish
organization dedicated to buying property in the Palestinian
neighborhood of Silwan, took over the homes, Palestinians said.
Silwan is built over the ancient City of David.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2:30 a.m., my neighbor called me and told me the settlers
had opened my house and thrown my things outside,'' said Fatima
Karaeen, one of the owners, who has been living at her
mother-in-law's house since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-morning, Palestinian leaders and Israeli peace activists
had descended upon the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffles broke out when the settlers tried to prevent the
Palestinians living next door to one of the houses from climbing to
the roof, according to Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian Authority's
representative in Jerusalem. Police also fought with about 20
Israeli Peace Now members, who refused to leave and were dragged
away by the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers' takeover was the latest in a series of incidents
that have raised tensions in the disputed city. Two weeks ago,
settlers from a different organization called Ateret Cohanim
provoked scuffles with Palestinians after they erected seven tin
shacks in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. Two days earlier,
Ateret Cohanim members took over a Palestinian home a few streets
away and threw the owner's belongings into the street.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents occurred as U.S. efforts to pull peace
negotiations out of a 15-month freeze continue to be frustrated. On
Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dashed
expectations that an agreement was imminent on the long-awaited
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank by telling Israel Radio
that negotiators would not rush toward an agreement that would
compromise Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's incident also took place while Israeli Cabinet
ministers debated whether to allow Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the
spiritual leader of the militant Hamas organization, to return to
Gaza after the 61-year-old cleric completes a tour of Muslim
countries. Yassin, who opposes the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords, has been rallying support abroad, prompting some ministers
to argue that Israel should not allow him to return.
</P>
<P>
   In Silwan, settlers and Palestinians gave different accounts of
the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Elad activists said the group had purchased one of the houses,
which is divided into three separate apartments, from the
Palestinian owners.
</P>
<P>
   They said the other one was purchased from the Israeli
government, which had expropriated it after the property's owner,
Fatima Karaeen's father, was declared an ``absentee'' in 1991
because he lives in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Israel's courts ruled in favor of the settlers
after lengthy court cases, settler activists said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Netanyahu government appeared to side with the
settlers. ``This is an absolutely legal transaction,'' David
Bar-Illan, the prime minister's adviser, said.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser to Netanyahu, Danny Naveh, told Israel's Army
Radio: ``We believe Jews should be able to live in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians accuse the settlers of using unscrupulous means to
acquire the homes and of maneuvering to influence the outcome of
negotiations over the city by changing the demographic makeup of
the eastern half. Jerusalem is one of the issues that has yet to be
resolved in a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians hope to make eastern sectors that are majority Arab
part of the capital of an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlers say that the Palestinians are selling their
houses _ they are not,'' said Husseini, the the Palestinian
Authority's Jerusalem representative. ``There are a lot of illegal
things happening here, and the problem is that the Israeli
government does not always act in a legal way. They use the law to
serve one side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority echoed Husseini's statements, calling
the settlers' moves part of an ``unholy war against Palestinian
property.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the authority condemned an archaeological dig at the
site where the seven shacks had been put up in the Muslim Quarter,
calling it a search for ``fake Jewish antiquities.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Ateret Cohanim agreed to a compromise by
which the group would tear down the shacks and instead help finance
the dig for Jewish artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Elad spokesman Dully Basok said the group would
continue to purchase homes in Silwan, where they believe King David
built his palace 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area is the center of the ancient Jerusalem,'' said
Basok, who lives in one of 17 homes in Silwan owned by Elad. Unlike
the Ateret Cohanim, which buys property in all Arab areas of the
city, Elad concentrates only on Silwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very natural that Jews hope to live in this area,'' he
said. ``Our national song is about Zion and Jerusalem. All our
hopes are about Zion and Jerusalem, so it's very simply why we want
to live exactly here on this hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Basok said Elad now owns 54 percent of the City of David, which
covers a small part of Silwan closest to the Old City, much of it
empty houses and open fields. He said the group was trying to
acquire several other properties through the courts. He would not
disclose the number.

TEAM CAPSULES OF THE WORLD CUP FIELD
</HEADLINE>

By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEAM CAPSULES
</P>
<P>
   GROUP A
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Mario Zagallo
</P>
<P>
   Cup note: Champions in '58, '62, '70, '94, runners-up in '50.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   D Roberto Carlos, MF Dunga, MF Leonardo, MF Denilson, F Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Alberto Parreira drew the wrath of his countryman when he
forfeited beauty for organization four years ago, but it paid off
with the championship. Zagallo, his successor, has brought back the
beautiful game, but his team has looked uninspired and disjointed.
Injuries to Romario and Juninho haven't helped, and Edmundo's
fistfight with Leonardo can't have aided a fragile team chemistry,
but there's enough talent here particularly Ronaldo and Roberto
Carlos to overcome anything.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's team to beat. It wouldn't be a surprise if someone
did beat them. Can go all the way or get knocked out in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTLAND
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Craig Brown
</P>
<P>
   Cup note:
</P>
<P>
   Never reached second round.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   GK Jim Leighton, D Colin Hendry, MF John Collins, MF Jackie
McNamara, F Kevin Gallacher.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   The pragmatic Brown has assembled a gritty, tenacious team that
will play strong defense, but Scottish hopes of grandeur
disappeared when captain and midfield general Gary McAllister went
down with injury. Collins provides class in midfield and Gallacher
is a scoring threat, but it isn't likely that will be enough
against the likes of Brazil and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   First-round exit, again.
</P>
<P>
   MOROCCO
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Henri Michel
</P>
<P>
   Cup note:
</P>
<P>
   Fourth appearance (1970-86-94); reached the second round in '86.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   D Noureddine Naybet, MF Youssef Chippo, MF Moustafa Hadji, F
Salaheddine Bassir.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the most organized of Africa's entrants, with strength
in attack and defense. Bassir, Hadji and the veteran Naybet,
teammates with Spanish power Deportivo de La Coruna, are the
anchors. Frenchman Michel has the team playing well heading into
the tournament, drawing with England and falling by one goal to
France at its King Hassan II Cup last month in Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   Draw is too tough; Three and out.
</P>
<P>
   NORWAY
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Egil Olsen
</P>
<P>
   Cup note:
</P>
<P>
   Third appearance (1938-94); never reached the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   D Henning Berg, MF Erik Myklsnd, MF Vidar Riseth, F Tore Andre
Flo, F Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Unbeaten in 19 matches since January 1997 including a telling
4-2 win over Brazil last year in Oslo the Norwegians have never
been better. Not the most talented side, but Mykland adds a bit of
skill to a long-ball game that benefits from target man Flo's size
and the team's increased international exposure. Olsen's confidence
has spread to his players, who believe they are capable of beating
any team in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   Could be the
</P>
<P>
   surprise; Quarterfinals likely, semis possibly.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP B
</P>
<P>
   ITALY
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Cesare Maldini
</P>
<P>
   Cup note:
</P>
<P>
   Champions in '34, '38 and '82, runners-up in '70 and '94.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   GK Gianluca Pagliuca, D Paolo Maldini, MF Demetrio Albertini, F
Alessandro Del Piero, F Fabrizio Ravanelli, F Roberto Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Always contenders for the crown, the Italians disappointments
two years ago during the European Championship and strugglers in
qualifying appear to be peaking at the best possible time. The
defense, led by Maldini, the coach's son, is among the world's
best, and a fine group of forwards should make the Azzurri's fine
counterattack pay off. Del Piero is the best of the bunch, but he's
been slowed by a groin injury, and '94 star Baggio, out of the
lineup for 3{ years, has returned following a superb campaign for
Bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   Italy has a tough draw once it's out of the first round, so the
tournament could end sooner than it would like. If things go well,
it could hoist the trophy on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Acosta
</P>
<P>
   Cup note:
</P>
<P>
   First appearance since '82; semifinalists in '62, best showing
in six Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   GK Nelson Tapia, MF Clarence Acuna, MF Marcelo Vega, F Ivan
Zamorano, F Marcelo Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Salas and Zamorano are terrific forwards, as good a 1-2 punch as
exists in this Cup, but what else can Chile offer? The defense is
weak, the midfield offers nothing special, and the Chileans figure
to struggle with life on the road and their opponents' quicker
tempos. They'll be tough to stop, particularly Salas, but will be
susceptible to counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   Salas and Zamorano may be enough to offset defensive troubles in
group play, but the Chileans can't hope for much more.
</P>
<P>
   CAMEROON
</P>
<P>
   Coach:
</P>
<P>
   Claude Le Roy
</P>
<P>
   Cup note:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterfinalist in '90.
</P>
<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   GK Jacques Songo'o, D Rigobert Song, MF Patrick Mboma, MF
Salomon Olembe, F Francois Omam-Biyik, F Alphonse Tchami.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Marc-Vivien Foe to a broken leg may prove a crushing
blow he was the Indomitable Lions' midfield workhorse and won't be
easily replaced. Frenchman Le Roy was brought in following a
disastrous African Nations Cup earlier this year and made wholesale
changes, but there's only so much he can do. Omam-Biyik, Mboma and
Tchami give Cameroon power up front, but the defense, aside from
Songo'o and Song, is iffy.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Lions upset Argentina and Brazil; in 1994, they
tanked.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA

   Defense is supposed to be the Austrians' strength, but the

Djorkaeff.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Seem to have all they need, aside from a top-notch goalscorer,
to win the title: the world's most talented defense and midfield, a
playmaker without peer and an adoring audience. Zidane is the
playmaker, and he may be a household name by the time the Cup is
done, but he needs someone to finish what he creates. Djorkaeff is
the top forward, but he's not a goalscorer in the classic sense,
and Jacquet has found it difficult to find him a suitable partner.
France may not surrender a goal: Laurent and Desailly are
world-class defenders, and there is no better defensive midfielder
than Deschamps.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   France hasn't played like a champion during its preparation, and
it must overcome the pressure of playing at home. The title is
within reach, but an early exit is more likely.

</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Troussier is known as the ``White Witchdoctor'' in Africa for
his accomplishments on the continent, but his brief reign with
Bafana Bafana has been contentious. He's got plenty of talent to
work with particularly McCarthy, who shared the scoring title at
the African Nations Cup earlier this year but was nearly left off
the squad and a solid defense led by Nyathi. Only 13 players from
the runners-up in Burkina Faso have been invited to France, and
among those added to the team were former MLS players Doctor
Khumalo and Shaun Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   In the past six years have emerged as a force in Africa after 28
years of isolation because of Apartheid. Troussier is a proven
commodity, and Group C isn't all that tough. The second round is

</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Parreira, who guided Brazil to the title in '94, will have the
Saudis organized, and forwards Al-Jaber and Al-Owairan, who scored
the goal of the tournament four years ago, provide some firepower.
The defense is poor and none of the side play outside Saudi Arabia,
leaving it little international know-how.

   Parreira's presence makes the second round possible, but

   Outlook:

<P>
   If Schmeichel has fully recovered from a hamstring injury that
bothered him late this past season, the Danes could go far. He's
one of the world's great netminders and the defining personality of
a squad long on physical presence but short on skill. The
exceptions to that are the Brothers Laudrup, the two finest field
players Denmark has produced, extraordinary talents that could mean
the difference between an early exit and being the surprise of the
tournament.

   The classic underachievers might be ready, finally, to excel.
The Spaniards are in great form, with talent everywhere on the

and Morientes, who has four goals in two national team appearances.
Luis Enrique does everything in midfield, and Hierro offers
experience in the back.

<P>
   Prediction:

   Clemente built his team around the 1992 Olympic gold medalists,

</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Olympic champions have more attacking talent than
any other team in France, and ex-U.S. coach Milutinovic's emphasis
on defense should, theoretically, shore up the Super Eagles' great
weakness. But the lead-up to the Cup has been abysmal, with Nigeria
demonstrating neither a cohesive attack nor the ability to shut
down the opposition. Kanu's return from heart surgery and the form
of African player of the year Ikpeba are huge pluses, but players'
squabbles with the Nigerian federation over money has damaged the
team's focus.

on its attitude than its capabilities.

<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic Chilavert is one of the game's great goalkeepers,
and a scoring threat, too he takes all free kicks within goal
range. He won't be nearly enough to save Paraguay, which has been
beset by internal strife, a good deal of it Chilavert's doing. The
defense isn't bad, but so what? Inconsistency and inadequacy define
the Paraguayans.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:

   The Paraguayans peaked during qualifying, but got no favors from
the draw. Even one win would be stunning.

</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Stoichkov led a miracle run to the semifinals four years ago,
but he's 32 now and there's only so much magic left in his aging
legs. Most of his support is older, too, and team chemistry is a
problem. Bonev has already withstood one Stoichkov-led mutiny, and
the mood within camp has been tense. Add inconsistent defense and
the ancient midfield, and there's only so much that can be
accomplished.

   There's little optimism that occurred in '94 can be duplicated.

   Outlook:

   One of the world's most richly talented sides, capable of truly
beautiful work, and are playing well as the Cup begins. The return
of Davids, who was dumped after a row with Hiddink during the
European Championships two years ago, could be crucial, and there's
enough depth that the potential loss of Bergkamp one of the world's
great strikers with a hamstring injury isn't as worrisome as it
might be. They're strong in the back (especially Van der Sar and
Stam), have one of the world's best midfields, and in Overmars have
an incomparable winger. And the selection of leader Pierre van
Hooijdonk is supposed to erase the the usual racial tensions.

   Outlook:

<P>
   Belgium's success has been built on defensive organization, but
this time out its attack is far superior to its back line. The
Brazilian-born Oliveira is key, as is Scifo, who rejoined the squad
last month after quitting in anger when he was left out of a
``friendly'' with the United States in February. He and Van der
Elst are in their fourth World Cups, and that experience could be
crucial, especially against South Korea and Mexico.

<P>
   Asia's reigning power still is seeking to prove it can be a
force in the international game, and while some performances the
near-upset of Germany in '94 suggest the Koreans are closing in on
their goal, others hint otherwise. Cha, who played in the '86 Cup,
hasn't done well in preparation matches, but he's got a solid
defense led by Hong, South Korea's most versatile player. The
attack is limited, which could be troublesome in this group,
although none of their opponents can match the Koreans' energy
level.

   Outlook:

   Sampson's decision to drop captain John Harkes and switch to a
3-6-1 alignment appears to have invigorated the Americans,
providing Claudio Reyna the tools he needs to run things on the
field and erasing the troubles that plagued a slow-footed defense.
At issue is whether the U.S. can score goals, which may not be a
problem if Wynalda is fully healed from a knee injury suffered two
months ago. There's speed on the wings, with Cobi Jones and Frankie
Hejduk, a creative defensive midfield tandem in Deering and Brian
Maisonneuve, veteran leadership from Dooley, a solid bench (with
Preki Radosavljevic, Tab Ramos and Joe-Max Moore all capable of
changing games) and superb goalkeeping with Keller and backup Brad
Friedel.

at the moment, Mihajlovic a superb sweeper, Jugovic a top-notch
midfielder, and the supporting talent particularly veteran
Savicevic is nearly as good. Capable of scoring plenty of goals,
but how they deal with the Germans' and Americans' fighting spirit
will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>

   This is the last chance for an outstanding generation of
Romanian players to shine. Essentially the same team that played in
the 1990 and '94 Cups, Iordanescu's side has great talent but is a
bit old to do anything of real significance. Turmoil has hurt the
team, with several players quitting because of disagreements with
Iordanescu, who has battled Romania's federation and plans to take

Andres Escobar was killed after the team returned home.
Bushy-haired playmaker Valderrama remains the key figure, but at 36
he's slowed down a good step or so and won't deal well with

Uri Gellar's crystals have played havoc with the team's focus. The
English still play hard, but their skills are now more continental,

to make an imprint on the team's character. Chief among them will
be playmaker Ortega, who is strong on the ball, in setting up
teammates and shooting but has struggled most of this year. The
chief target player is Batistuta, known as ``Batigol'' for his
exploits. The team really is defined by Passarella, a star defender
on Argentina's 1978 championship squad and a disciplinarian as

<P>
   Coach:

<P>
   First appearance.

   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Japan's triumph was getting to this point, and they don't expect
to go further. Already out is Kazu Miura, Japan's greatest player,
whom Okada had described as indispensable. The stars are Nakayama,
who recently scored 16 goals in four J-League games, and superb
playmaker Nakata, better known for his orange hair and outrageous
remarks than for all the good he does on field.

<P>
   Outlook:

<P>
   Brazilian Simoes has turned a team of nobodies into an
international cause celebre the Reggae Boyz, essentially an English
B side, may be the most popular team in France, but that will count
for only so much once the whistle blows. The Boyz have speed and
quite a bit of skill, and the addition of a half-dozen English-born
players of Jamaican origin has improved the team's organization
immeasurably. Key is Burton, one of the Brits, who scored six times
during qualifying, and veteran goalkeeper Warren Barrett, one of
the best in CONCACAF.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   Second round possible but not expected.

<P>
   Key players:
</P>
<P>
   D Robert Jarni, D Igor Tudor, MF Zvonimir Boban, MF Robert
Prosinecki, F Davor Suker, F Goran Vlaovic.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Don't think of this team as a first-time qualifier. Blessed with
experience and superb talent, the Croats are one of two excellent
teams to emerge from the rubble of Yugoslavia's civil war. Their
chances to do much here were hurt by the loss last month of forward
Alen Boksic, their most important player, to a knee injury; Suker,
the No. 2 striker, has been out of form, but the midfield is
outstanding especially half-Serb, half-Croat playmaker Prosinecki,
a standout with Yugoslavia in the 1990 Cup, and captain Boban.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction:
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Boksic likely will prevent the Croats from doing
anything special, but they should expect to reach the second round.

FIVE BOSTON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE STRANDED IN NIGER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlestown High School sophomore Darnell Crump knew a field
trip to Western Africa was going to be an adventure. After all, he
had never been on a plane before; the farthest he can remember
being from Boston was to Vermont last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the 16-year-old is getting more than he ever bargained for
in Niger. After an action-packed two-week trip, an airline strike
has stranded him and four classmates in the African country since
Friday, and rumors of a possible coup are rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons about the country's camel trade and millet production
have been traded for studies in how to get out of a country where
most flights leave once a week. Instead of sharing stories with
African youth, as they did their first two weeks in Niger, the
students and their teacher are trying to persuade Moroccan
authorities to ease strict visa requirements so they can catch a
New York-bound plane from Casablanca later this week.
</P>
<P>
   While the students are not in any danger, they can't wait to get
home and, they admit, back to school. They are crossing their
fingers that the latest of four escape plans will land them in
Boston by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``More than anything, what I really want is to go home ... and
then I want a pizza,'' said Crump from the hotel Gaweye in the
Niger capital of Niamey Monday. ``But it's been a great time, I'm
learning so much more than reading any book.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit is the first field trip abroad in Charlestown High
School's history. Jonathan Silverman, who studied in
French-speaking Niger while at Harvard, obtained enough funding
from private foundation grants to pay for five students to study
the country's culture and report back to classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The five were chosen from among 120 students who wrote papers
and made presentations about Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, &UR;  &LR; the trip was everything they had planned. The
students were attending local schools every day, meeting with
villagers, and studying Niger's political structure, history, and
culture. They visited the village of Balleyra, where students rode
camels and learned how villagers build their homes out of mud.
</P>
<P>
   True, they were cautioned by their guide not to talk too loudly
about the president, who overthrew a democratic government in a
1996 military coup. Then again, they knew there was some civil
unrest in the country before they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us got scared by what the guide said,'' said Jennifer
Camacho, 18. ``But we're fine.''
</P>
<P>
   During their trip, they've exchanged addresses with about ``a
hundred people'' and feel a bit like movie stars because so many
Africans stare and follow them out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The students, who raised $485 from staff and peers at
Charlestown High, bought red pens for the village teachers to mark
papers and notebooks for their students. The rest of the money was
used to buy giant sacks of corn and rice that were carried into the
village on a cart pulled by a donkey, Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   The students stayed in various areas of the parched country,
expecting to go home last week. But then Air France went on strike
_ and remained on strike as of last night.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, which subsidized the students' trip, has put them
up in the fanciest hotel in Niamey at $140 a night. For Niger
``it's the best,'' said Camacho Monday, lowering her voice to
finish the sentence, ``but for America it's like a Days Inn.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are given a food allowance from the airline to eat in
one of the hotel's two restaurants. They've spent the last three
days chatting with guests, swimming in the pool, and sleeping.
Local residents have invited them to parties and a city newspaper
has interviewed them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Silverman and student Santo Perez are spending their
days at the Moroccan embassy to ensure that Perez, who was born in
the Dominican Republic, can get a visa to stay in Casablanca for
one night. Americans do not need a visa. The flight will arrive in
New York, where Silverman's parents will pick up the students in a
rented van and drive them home.
</P>
<P>
   The students appear to be taking their unintended vacation well.
They have gotten used to the torrential rain and sandstorms, and
have learned how to cool down in the 105-plus degree heat by
brushing their teeth with toothpaste refrigerated overnight putting
toothpaste and washing their hair with chilled shampoo. When the
water only comes out hot, they say, you have to cool down other
items.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind blows, it's hotter than the sun,'' said student
Xaymara Saez, who is somewhat upset she is missing her father's
birthday today.
</P>
<P>
   But her family and other parents are at ease, saying
communication has been good from the landlocked nation and they
trust their children will be home soon.
</P>
<P>
   All the students _ Camacho, Janniver Castro, Perez, Saez and
Crump _ dream of McDonald's and Silverman plans to treat them at
the Golden Arches if and when they arrive in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Crump, who prays every night for a safe journey home, is
concerned more about getting on a plane again. But after the first
few hours, he says, he'll look forward to giving his mother, Lisa,
a big hug and telling his classmates all he's learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so much,'' Crump said. ``I know I'll go back.''

BOSTON FORUM CONTRIBUTES TO CLINTON'S DIALOGUE ON RACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton got a lot of advice Monday on how to deal with
the nation's race problems, but if he is looking for a consensus in
the debate, he will have to keep the dialogue going.
</P>
<P>
   Forty people _ black, white, and Asian _ from the Boston area
sat for two hours at the John F. Kennedy Library and contributed to
Clinton's ongoing ``One America'' conversation. There were many and
often conflicting views, which were videotaped and will be
considered for inclusion in a final report in several months.
</P>
<P>
   With dark clouds and the South Boston horizon in view through
the Stephen Smith Center's wall of windows at the library,
participants talked of Boston and its rocky racial history as a
source of conflict and possible lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Amstead, a black Vietnam veteran, said he returned from the
war to street violence sparked by the court-ordered busing of
students, and an attack he witnessed on Ted Landsmark, a black man
who was struck by a white man wielding an American flag in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Boston people pointed to the South and said, `We're
not like that,''' said Amstead, who noted that events in Boston in
the 1970s changed that belief.
</P>
<P>
   But Amstead and almost all of the other participants were
pessimistic that quick solutions could be found to racial problems.
Community exchanges like Monday's _ the first one in Massachusetts,
among 150 or so that have been held in 42 cities around the nation
_ will wrap up in September.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who spoke Monday embraced affirmative action,
though Boston City Council President James Kelly did not. The only
question that should be asked of student applicants or prospective
employees is, ``Are they fit and willing and qualified?'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a trust fund either,'' he said, responding to a
previous speaker's view that one legacy of slavery is relative
poverty in the black community. Said Kelly, ``I never wanted to
have a slave, never had a slave, so don't blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Kelly and of the blunt-spoken Jack Osgood, who
said whites and ``many sophisticated blacks'' do not want
integration, was a bold response to the early criticism from
conservatives that Clinton's race conversation was one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   However, even those who embrace more government-fostered
solutions and proactive remedies for lingering racial inequalities
differ on where the focus of discussion should be. Some favored
less formal, neighbor-to-neighbor talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Glendora Putnam said, ``Institutional racism is what we
should be looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always struck as to how quickly we get into
victimization,'' she said. ``We can never solve our problems if we
continue to say, `I'm more oppressed than you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Peter Kiang: ``I don't like to count, but I always do
count. And I think I'm the only Asian-American in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Blackwell, who works for the Greater Boston Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said honest talk about what works is
necessary. ``The current threats against affirmative action
threaten everything we've done to get to this point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be able to live and work in Boston were it not for
affirmative action,'' added Blackwell, who said she went to a
predominantly black college where her race's contributions were
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parks, who was the first black president of the Boston
School Committee, went so far as to say that slavery should not be
viewed only for its ``absolute negative'' aspects. Blacks have
suffered the aftermath, but they played a vital part in making the
United States the rich country it is today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred years of free labor built a nation,'' Parks
said. ``All you have to do is look at the cities we have built. ...
We don't have to take a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hayward of Allston said a formal apology is in order, and,
``Clinton, being the voice of America, should offer that apology to
black folks.'' Others disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in an apology for anything,'' said Brenda
Cherry, a 10-year Boston resident. ``It must be articulated in a
language that people understand, and that's money. I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry said she had in mind grants and research that would prove
to an unconvinced public that racial diversity is critical to any
successful institution.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived in the Midwest and the South, she also said she had
observed an unwillingness to admit a problem in the Boston area.
``There's a lot of pretense here,'' she said. ``Because you're
`enlightened,' you're `New Englanders.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's discussion was led by William E. Leftwich III, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for equal opportunity. Like other
Clinton administration officials, he has been on the road over the
last year, explaining the process and listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership is important,'' he said of Clinton and other
politicians. ``But I don't think we can look to them to carry the
water. It's really up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyra Sidberry said Mondayshe hopes some of the views expressed
make their way into a Clinton advisory board's report on race,
along with strategies to reach a solution. But she added, ``I don't
think we'll get there in my lifetime.''

ARIZONA BORDER CITIES CHALLENGED BY MEXICAN  ENTREPRENEURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOGALES, Sonora _ Businessman Mario de la Fuente sees a lot more
dollar signs these days on the Arizona-Sonora border.
</P>
<P>
   Just south of the border, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for Arizona cities like Nogales and Douglas, the
increasing economic activity celebrated by de la Fuente and others
is happening on the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. border towns like Nogales and Douglas, used to benefiting
from the complexity of Mexican trade regulations and the unmet
needs of Mexican shoppers, are now facing stiff challenges from
ambitious Mexican entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   And given the weak peso, the additional restrictions on Mexicans
crossing the border and the flow of business south to cheap labor,
the situation is expected to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Free Trade Agreement, advertised as a boon
for border areas, has been a cruel joke on cities like Douglas,
Mayor Ray Borane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been one job created here by NAFTA,'' Borane
said. ``The truth of the matter is it doesn't work on our side of
the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, de la Fuente's bulldozers here, three miles south of
the border, begin work this week on a 5,000-seat domed amphitheater
for bullfighting, concerts and other tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican department store chain recently bought by Wal-Mart, a
bowling alley and the first U.S. fast-food franchises in this city
of 250,000 will come within a year, de la Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just starting to catch up to the demand here,'' he said.
``I went to Ciudad Juarez recently and visited 14 shopping centers,
and that was only about half of what's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the American side, El Paso is experiencing its
roughest times economically since the Great Depression in the
aftermath of Mexico's peso devaluation in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente doesn't see anything better ahead for Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, I don't see it as anything but a tourist
stop on the way to Mexico,'' he said, ``with some hotels and gas
stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nogales officials are quick to differ.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Nogales is in dire need of an economic
plan, Assistant City Administrator Ignacio Barraza said that
doesn't mean it will become ``anyone's damn parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're revitalizing downtown with a Main Street program, and we
are investigating a lot of other avenues to help us progress,''
said Barraza, noting that the city doesn't have a property tax.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Coogan, a Nogales attorney who is a member of a
tri-national NAFTA dispute resolution board, said great concern
about the future of the state's border cities is justified,
especially in Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nogales' niche has been the physical transfer of goods,
primarily produce in warehouses on this side, going north,'' Coogan
said. ``But what is to stop a supermarket chain in the Midwest from
ordering something directly from Mexico?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Nogales have got to be thinking about what they
can do to stay in the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlemen in the produce industry already have raised red flags,
Coogan said. Land speculators have bought land along both sides of
the border for use of the direct off-load of Mexican products into
U.S. trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could spell big trouble for the produce warehouse
industry in this area because it could lead to direct transfer from
the grower to the market,'' Coogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ley, a customs broker in Douglas, sees other troubles
ahead for U.S. border cities whose economies in part rely on
business with Mexican ``maquilas,'' or twin plant, industries.
</P>
<P>
   About 34,000 Mexicans work in those plants in Nogales and in
Agua Prieta, across the border from Douglas. Traditionally,
unfinished products are shipped to the U.S. side of the border and
stored in warehouses while awaiting export to Mexico. After the
products are assembled by cheaper Mexican labor, they are exported
back to this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing less and less of companies having both a U.S.
and Mexican presence,'' Ley said. ``The Mexicans have really
streamlined their import-permit process, and there isn't the need
like there once was for warehouses on this side. As a result, more
companies are locating their entire operations in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   But the largest concern in Nogales and Douglas is the negative
impact of federal immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced
that all Mexicans would have to obtain new border-crossing cards at
a cost of $45 a person by Oct. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican shoppers account for about 70 percent of retail sales in
Nogales and about 50 percent in Douglas, city officials said.
Officials predict dire consequences for the two towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large majority of the people who walk across to shop here
can't afford the $45,'' said Borane, the Douglas mayor. ``Those who
can already bypass us and go to Tucson for their shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city still pushes a plan to allow Mexicans with
legal crossing documents to receive a free ``shopper card'' for
eight hours to come into the U.S. border communities. But thus far,
Borane said, the idea has fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   That means U.S. border-city retailers now face the burden of
high-priced cards, a $50 limit on U.S. purchases allowed back in
Mexico without paying a 23 percent tax, and the development of
competing retail outlets south of the border, Borane said.

JAZZ PLAYERS TRY TO EXPLAIN EMBARRASSING LOSS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Utah Jazz spent Monday trying to explain the most
embarrassing defeat in the history of the NBA Finals. Answering
questions about Sunday night's 96-54 massacre wasn't much fun for
Karl Malone and Co., but they didn't argue with the postgame
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The Mailman and Co. delivered a stink bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two days we got to swallow it, but I'm looking forward to
Wednesday,'' said Malone, who is quickly becoming the Roger Clemens
of the NBA postseason.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jazz want some inspiration, they can look back to the
golden days of the Celtic-Laker, Bird-Magic rivalry of the
mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Celtics opened the Finals on the Garden parquet and
suffered a 137-104 defeat at the hands of the Lakers. It was a
butt-kicking of the highest order and left little doubt that the
Lakers were the superior team. LA managed to humiliate Boston on
its home court and it looked as if James Worthy and Magic Johnson
could run the Celtics off the floor at will.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, the Celtics played better, but still faced a 2-point
deficit in the closing seconds while the Lakers had enough time to
dribble out the clock. It was then that Celtic guard Gerald
Henderson stole a lazy cross-court pass from Worthy and made a
layup to send the game into overtime, and Boston went on to
victory. When the Celtics were routed again in Game 3, we all
counted them out because they could easily have been down, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston rallied in Los Angeles. Kevin McHale performed his
WWF takedown of Kurt Rambis in Game 4, and Cedric Maxwell said,
``It's different now. Before, the Lakers were just running across
the street without stopping to look. Now, they stop, they hit the
button, they look both ways, then they wait for the signal to
cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics won it in seven.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the butt-kicking shoe was on the other foot. The
Lakers came to Boston for another Game 1 and were routed, 148-114,
in the famous Memorial Day Massacre. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was
compared with Willie Mays, stumbling toward retirement in the 1973
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Kareem and the Lakers rallied to take the
second game, then won the series in six, winning the championship
on the parquet floor. To this day, Pat Riley and Kareem will tell
you that winning the championship in Boston was the highlight of
their professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   So you see, it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls assistant coach Jimmy Rodgers, who was on the bench as an
assistant with the Celtics in both '84 and '85, said, ``I can't
believe our team is going to be fooled by anything. We know we're
up against a fine basketball team. I sense from the reaction of our
players that they know. You can't live on what you did two nights
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1984 when I was with the Celtics, we were embarrassed. When
a good team with pride gets embarrassed, they usually respond.''
</P>
<P>
   At this hour, the Jazz look more hopeless than the Celtics did
in 1984. Despite nine days of rest and a home-court crowd, the Jazz
struggled to beat the Bulls in overtime in the first game, they
dropped Game 2 at home. Bloody Sunday no doubt drove some Mormons
to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the next game,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said
bravely Monday. ``I always want to see whose got fight left in
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, perhaps two games from retirement, downplayed
the blowout, saying, ``We're gonna look at it as just one game. I'm
pretty sure they want to redeem themselves. They're going to be
wounded, but I think that's going to make them come back harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's late-game onslaught might give the Jazz extra
incentive. Leading, 72-45, after three quarters, the Bulls went to
the bench and the Chicago scrubs demolished the Jazz reserves,
24-9, in the fourth period. Some of the Jazz took exception to the
fact that the Bulls bench hoisted five 3-pointers in the
fourth-period garbage time, connecting on four of the treys (two
apiece by Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler).

<P>
   Malone said, ``What they did to us definitely has to be
motivation. They was having a good time, still taking those threes
in the last quarter. If that can't get you motivated nothing can.''

OPPOSITION LEADERS CALL ON MILITARY TO RELINQUISH POWER
</HEADLINE>

 By ELAINE SCIOLINO

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the succession to Nigeria's military ruler
Gen. Sani Abacha undecided, the daughter of Moshood Abiola, the
opposition leader who was imprisoned after being elected president
in 1993, called for the military to step aside and for her father's
immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era, and I hope, the end of military
rule,'' said Hafsat Abiola, his 23-year-old Harvard-educated
daughter who has worked with other opposition figures to protest
military rule in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abiola, who works for the Special Olympics and lives in
suburban Maryland with 5 of her 18 siblings, said she is concerned
about her father's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha wanted to use my father as a hostage, to keep him close
by so that if he was ever attacked he'd attack my dad,'' she said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she thought her father should take over the reins
of power in Nigeria now that Abacha is dead, she replied, ``I just
want my father released. I am very concerned about his safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Nigerian opposition leaders called for Moshood Abiola to
be installed as president of a transitional government in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Wole Soyinka, the exiled Nigerian playwright, told reporters in
Jerusalem on Monday, ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's
a democratic option. And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka added that the general's death presented an opportunity
for the military to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, other countries should increase diplomatic
pressure and economic sanctions on the military government, Soyinka
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, fled
Nigeria in 1994. He was charged in absentia with treason last March
in connection with bomb attacks aimed mostly at the military, which
left two people dead and about 60 people wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The view that it was time for the military to step aside was
echoed by the son of Ken Saro Wiwa, a human rights activist and
writer who was executed by the Nigerian government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for the opposition and an opportunity
for democracy to be restored to Nigeria, though how that actually
happens is anybody's guess,'' Ken Wiwa told Britain's Channel Four
television news.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One hopes that democracy will have a chance to establish
itself,'' said Wiwa, whose father was hanged in 1995 with eight
others.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was unclear whether Abiola was well enough to
assume power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really not sure how healthy and fit Moshood Abiola
is.'' Wiwa said. ``Reports say he himself is close to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abiola said that she was not ready to embrace the call of
other opposition leaders like Soyinka for her father to assume the
leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he is not doing very well and have to attend to his
medical needs first,'' she said. She said that he suffered from
high blood pressure, a pinched nerve and had trouble moving his
left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The family has not seen her father in well over a year. When
they saw him in January 1995, ``he had been tussled, beaten around
and looked very disheveled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abiola said that her father was the only person who can
bring democracy to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who can move the country beyond the point
where it is peaceful and democratic is my father,'' Ms. Abiola
said. ``He is the only person chosen by the people to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola has been in jail since mid-1994, after he was charged
with treason by a federal high court in Abuja for naming himself
president. He was chosen by popular vote in an election that was
annulled by the military.
</P>
<P>
   One of his three wives, Kudirat Abiola, Ms. Abiola's mother, was
killed two years ago while working to free her husband from prison,
in what her daughter called a political execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abiola, who has spent nearly a third of her life in the
United States, said she was ready to go home if she could feel safe
again. ``I want to be able to welcome my father back to our
house,'' she said.

BELL ATLANTIC PLANS TO BUILD $500 MILLION LONG DISTANCE DATA
NETWORK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to stave off competitors offering a new generation of
digital networks, &UR;  &LR; Bell Atlantic Corp. Monday said it will begin
building a $500 million high-speed long distance data network to
carry Internet traffic &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.5 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Sprint announced plans to offer a new data and
voice network using its existing fiber optic cable network. And
other upstart companies increasingly are challenging big carriers
like Bell Atlantic by offering voice and data services directly to
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sprint &UR;  &LR; and Bell Atlantic are the latest carriers to
develop the next generation of long distance phone networks. Both
are designed mostley for businesses that depend on the Internet _
although, for Bell Atlantic, the new data capability is independent
of its current voice network.
</P>
<P>
   Several other carriers, most notably Level 3 Communications Inc.
of Omaha and Qwest Communications International Inc. of Denver, are
also developing very high speed networks to transmit data, voice
and video over fiber optic wires at a fraction of the cost of
today's much slower voice phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic said it expects to offer its service initially in
Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. as early as
Jan. 1. Within five years, the company expects revenues to reach $4
billion to $6 billion in the 13-state region it serves between
Maine and Virgina, said Joseph Farina, chief executive of Bell
Atlantic's data solutions group.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bell Atlantic expects to spend up to $500 million over
the next five years to create the network, of &UR;  &LR; which $225 million
will go to Lucent Technologies Inc., which will provide equipment
and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that for the Boston market, this data network will
offer businesses in the Route 128 corridor tremendous potential for
high speed Internet,'' said Stewart Verge, president of Bell
Atlantic Global Networks Inc., a new unregulated subsidiary created
to build and manage the long distance data network.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic could face regulatory roadblocks in building
the new network. The company is awaiting federal regulatory
approval to offer long distance phone services. Bell Atlantic must
still prove to the Federal Communications Commission that it has
opened its local phone market _ a requirement that company
officials say they will meet in the next 18 months in New York and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, MCI Communications Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp. have voiced
objections to plans by Bell Atlantic and two other regional Bell
operating companies to start high speed data networks. MCI and ATT
claim the networks are a way to circumvent the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which requires that the regional phone
companies open up competition in local service before offering long
distance telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technology improvements will soon enable users to
send data and make voice calls over the Internet, creating a
possible loophole to the Telecommunications Act that worries MCI
and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a clear attempt to circumvent the law, which we think
will be unsuccessful,'' said Jonathan Sallet, MCI chief policy
counsel. ``The law applies to communications generally, not just to
voice. Bell Atlantic wants to have a monopoly on Internet traffic _
voice and data _ and that is not good for the consumer because it
takes away choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic shares closed Monday at 94 3/4, down 2 1/16.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States said Monday that it would support
a British resolution in the United Nations to authorize a NATO
military intervention in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo,
and that Washington would press NATO to speed up planning for such
an action.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that military action is not imminent,
and that Washington would act only through NATO. But they said that
a credible threat of military action is an important part of NATO
strategy to convince President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
end his armed forces' attacks on civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The national security adviser, Samuel Berger, said early Monday
that American military intervention ``is not something that is on
the table.'' But American officials said later that he meant that
unilateral American action is not being considered, and that
military planning would be left to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the United States also joined the European Union in
imposing a ban on new investment in Serbia and to freeze Yugoslav
and Serbian government assets abroad. Washington and the European
Union, pressed by Britain, acted after a continuing crackdown by
Serbian special police and Yugoslav Army units in Kosovo that has
caused at least 250 deaths, driven at least 10,000 ethnic Albanians
into Albania and displaced another 50,000 people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were approved last month but were suspended at
Washington's request when Milosevic agreed to open talks with
Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   After a first round of talks, however, Milosevic began his
crackdown, aimed at defeating guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army and creating a cordon sanitaire near the Albanian border to
prevent infiltration of arms and recruits into Kosovo. Rugova and
his team said they could not continue the talks while the violence
continued because it would undermine their credibility and their
search for a nonviolent, negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the light of the indiscriminate use of violence over the
last two weeks, and the way such violence has undermined the basis
for talks, we are proceeding to implement these bans while calling
on both sides to continue the talks,'' said James Rubin, the State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The investment ban will hurt Milosevic because he depends on the
sale of state industries to finance his government, Western
officials said. Government credit for private companies to invest
in Serbia was already banned. The asset freeze is largely symbolic,
since Belgrade has few assets abroad. But it will also serve as a
disincentive for future investments, because it will mean that
Belgrade cannot open bank accounts overseas. Both the European
Union and American officials said they were ready to consider other
sanctions and measures.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 nations of the European Union acted first Monday, when
foreign ministers agreed to put the sanctions in place and called
on the United Nations and NATO to consider authorizing military
action to force Milosevic and Serbia to stop its attacks on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, where they represent 90 percent of a
population of about 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Kosovo is internationally recognized as a part of
Serbia _ unlike Bosnia, which was internationally recognized as
independent _ Western officials believe that a Security Council
resolution authorizing the use of force would be necessary. The
resolution would come under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which
allows intervention to deal with a threat to international peace
and security, the same authority used in the gulf war with Iraq.
The British are consulting key countries but have not yet
circulated a draft resolution, American officials said. All key
Western countries are working to persuade Russia, which has a veto
and is a traditional Serb ally, to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, fearing the precedent that an independent Kosovo could
set for Chechnya, Ingushetia, Tatarstan and other restless parts of
the Russian Federation, is extremely sensitive to any suggestion of
Western backing for Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn on Monday night, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to
try to persuade the visiting Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, to
agree to the resolution, which would serve as a strong deterrent to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That effort will continue when senior officials of the so-called
contact group _ the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy
and Russia _ meet in Paris on Wednesday. The foreign ministers of
those countries, plus Japan and Canada, will meet in London on
Friday, while NATO defense ministers will meet in Brussels on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense ministers could authorize planning for allied air
strikes against targets inside Serbia, a NATO diplomat said, in
addition to working on plans for ``preventive deployments'' around
Kosovo to try to prevent the fighting there from spreading through
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's crackdown has served to accelerate the recruiting
efforts of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which draws many of its
members from among ethnic Albanians from Germany and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every day he makes the mistake of using force rather than
finding the wisdom to negotiate, Milosevic becomes the membership
chairman'' of the KLA, Rubin said Monday, ``because he continues to
push the people of Kosovo into a more extremist posture than they
would otherwise be.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure of the KLA's popularity, even Rugova
advocates independence for Kosovo, while Washington and the West
favor only more political autonomy for the province within a
federal Yugoslavia. But the federal Yugoslavia is already breaking
apart, with Milosevic having driven Montenegro into virtual
independence and Kosovo rising in rebellion.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ Scottie Pippen will go down in basketball history as
Michael Jordan's sidekick.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Except, maybe, if you're a member of the Utah Jazz. In that
case, he will be forever known as the biggest nuisance of the 1998
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, perhaps even more than Jordan, has put his imprint on
the Finals with his quick, rangy and _ if you believe the Jazz _
soon-to-be-illegal defense. After the Bulls held Utah to the lowest
point total in any game since the advent of the shot clock in their
96-54 win in Game 3 on Sunday, Pippen's defensive reputation has
grown to mountainous proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our most memorable defensive performance for a full
game,'' Bulls center Luc Longley said. ``We corralled them better
than we have since I've been with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen is the ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, is he ever,'' Longley said. ``The great thing about
Scottie is he can do so many things. You can put him on the ball
and have him guard a specific guy. Or in this case, you can put him
on (Greg) Foster or (Greg) Ostertag and have him roam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he's like the boy and the dike. He just sticks his thumb
in wherever it's needed. He did a great job. I don't know how many
charges he took. But he seemed to be everywhere we needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Chicago's defensive strategy has been to put
Pippen on Utah's offensively challenged centers. Without having to
worry about them doing a lot of damage, Pippen can brush them off
and leave quickly to double-team John Stockton or step into the
lane when Karl Malone begins driving to the basket. Pippen drew a
pair of charges against Malone on Sunday, the second of which
started the Bulls on the blitz that broke open the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a better defensive player in terms of
understanding visualization and concepts,'' Bulls coach Phil
Jackson said. ``He's a one-man wrecking crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's defense has been terrific throughout the playoffs but
especially so in the past two series.
</P>
<P>
   Against Indiana, he sacrificed his offense to put all his energy
into guarding Pacers point guard Mark Jackson. He effectively
neutralized the NBA's regular-season assist king.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pippen is playing the NBA equivalent of center field,
helping out where necessary when the opportunity presents itself.
At 6-8 and with his long arms, he has been a pest to the Jazz's
offensive attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing a roaming defense,'' Pippen said. ``A lot of
times, Phil wants me to be a help defender, and that's how I'm
trying to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to force Karl to make jump shots, but Karl
is going to try to get to the basket. You have to be man enough to
take the charge, because he comes to the basket pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it that makes Pippen so good at his job? It's a number
of things, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's both natural ability and desire, as well as
knowing that he has four other players in the lineup who play the
same style of defense,'' said Jordan. ``So he can gamble a little
bit, and we can cover his back. I can gamble a little bit, and they
can cover my back. There's a certain understanding there, a certain
connection with all five guys on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sets the tempo defensively. The more active Scottie Pippen
is, the better we are because we read off of his situations. He can
disrupt anybody's offense because of his ability to play so many
different players, from the point guard to, on some teams, the
(center) spot. That type (of) versatility on the defensive end
really gives us some chances to gamble quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, what Pippen is doing against the Jazz is clogging up
the works because he's not respecting the man he's charged with
guarding. When Stockton and Malone begin to work the pick-and-roll,
Pippen goes to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz blames itself for letting this happen. Coach Jerry
Sloan's players know they can combat Pippen's roaming. But it takes
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be the best defensive player playing,'' Malone said.
``But you can have a great defensive player, and there are things
that you can do to offset that. But you have to do it as a team. We
talk about spacing and all that. And if you don't do those things,
you're playing right into their hands because he recovers really
quick and he gets into the position he wants to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, meanwhile, said the Jazz is at fault for not making
Pippen pay for his roaming tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were tremendous defensively,'' Stockton said of Game 3.
``I'm not going to take that away from them. The help side, the
recovery for when guys did help, was just terrific. We counter that
by being more patient when they come to help so we can expose the
illegal defense. By not doing that, it's not illegal. So it makes
it kind of simple in that regard. That's something they did from
day one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy comes right across the lane, and you go right to him,
it's not illegal. He's come to help. If you somehow maintain your
patience and don't charge right at him, trying to get something out
of it, then he's across the line. It's very visible. So there's no
finger-pointing, except at ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen countered by saying he in no way considers his defensive
tactics to be illegal under the NBA's complicated no-zone rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never. I'm never illegal,'' he said. ``When I'm leaving my
offensive player, I'm trying to go to the ball and be aggressive.
And that's what the rules say _ that any time you come double-team,
you have to be aggressive. If they turn back away, I have the right
to turn and go back to my man. That's the way I'm playing defense.
And until the officials see differently, that's the way I'm going
to continue to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan added that the way Pippen plays defense helps the rest of
the Bulls play better at that end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rhythm starts with Scottie and myself and then (filters
down),'' Jordan said. ``It becomes infectious. We know our
defensive strategies, and we go out and execute that. (Sunday)
night was a great execution of our defensive strategy. And we're
going to have to continue that to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task they have to deal with is how they break down our
defensive intensity. We seem to have a good plan to try to contain
them and their set offense. What they have to do is find a way to
break open the game with their offense and get more people involved
than Karl and John. But I think we have a good feel for them. We've
played pretty solid defensively in the first three games. Sure, we
made mental mistakes in the first game, or it could be a 3-0
series. We have to keep the pressure on them defensively.''

FBI ASKED TO INVESTIGATE MAN'S MURDER IN TEXAS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Federal investigators have been called to this
East Texas town to probe the murder of a 49-year-old black man
early Sunday and the three white suspects in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said he does not
believe the crime was racially motivated, he said he contacted FBI
officials in Beaumont to see if federal charges of conspiracy to
deprive constitutional rights could be filed against the
defendants. Such charges often are filed in racially motivated
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff refused to comment on allegations the victim had
been dragged behind a vehicle. He denied rumors that James Byrd Jr.
had been cut, lynched or set on fire, and said only that no firearm
was used in the crime and death was caused by ``blunt trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowles also refused to identify the three men, two of them from
Jasper, who have been arrested but not yet charged in the case. The
trio could be formally charged Tuesday morning, and the sheriff
planned to address the news media afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was found dead Sunday morning about 10 miles from his
northeast Jasper home. As investigators continued searching the
heavily wooded area late Monday afternoon, an FBI agent met with
the man's family. FBI lab personnel were processing evidence,
Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators would not elaborate on how Byrd died. Family
members gathered at his parents' home also would not discuss it,
citing a request by authorities. An official at Robinson's
Community Funeral Home, which was expecting to receive the body
Tuesday morning, said the condition of the remains was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives did say they doubt the people who killed Byrd knew the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was totally at random,'' said his sister, Clara Taylor of
Houston. ``Nobody who knew him would have done anything like this.
He was in the right place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she admitted that her brother had his faults and had
spent time in a Texas prison, she said he was well-liked within the
community. Family called him ``Son'' and friends knew him as
``Toe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a real gift of gab,'' Taylor said of her brother.
``Everybody liked him. The sheriff cried when he told us about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Criminal Justice records show that Byrd was
given a seven-year sentence for theft in 1990. He was paroled twice
and returned to prison for violating parole. He was last released
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of eight children, Byrd spent most of his time with family
and friends, Taylor said. He was the divorced father of three and
had been gleefully holding a year-old granddaughter in his lap and
playing with her on Saturday at a gathering at his parents' home
for a niece who is getting married.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, he went to an anniversary party for a
sister-in-law and then to visit friends, Taylor said. He was last
seen alive about 1 a.m. Sunday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said she thinks her brother, who had no car, was walking
home to his apartment when he was induced to get into a passing
vehicle. She said she doesn't know what happened to him after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his faults like anyone else,'' she said, ``but nothing
to make anyone want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers told the sheriff's department about seeing his body in
the Huff Creek area east of Jasper at 8:20 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been a robbery,'' Taylor said. ``He didn't
have any money. He was always asking us for a few cents here or
there so he could buy something.''
</P>
<P>
   A former vacuum cleaner salesman, Byrd lived alone in an
apartment and supported himself on a small disability check.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rowles said he doubted Byrd's murder was related to the
beating death a week earlier of Jerry Lynn McQueen, who was white.
Donald Louis Kenebrew, who is black, has been charged in that
crime.

   U.S. SUES INTEL, CITING HARM TO COMPUTER MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission filed antitrust charges against
Intel, accusing it of threatening and injuring three computer
makers, including Compaq, the leading maker of personal computers.
The government contended that the company withheld information
about its microprocessors that are at the heart of a personal
computer in an effort to coerce the three companies to turn over
rights to patented technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Intel contended that the suit was ``based upon a mistaken
interpretation of the law and the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel lowered prices on its Pentium II microprocessors for
desktop computers by 12 percent to 20 percent and introduced a
faster version of its low-end Celeron processor. It cut the price
of its older, slower model by 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   WEAK YEN IMPERILS ASIA RECOVERY
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese yen weakened to 140 to the dollar for the first
time in seven years. Its yearlong decline is now threatening the
economic recovery of the emerging Asian markets that were battered
by their currency devaluations last year.
</P>
<P>
   DOW INDUSTRIALS UP 31.89 POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks extended last week's gains, rising modestly, led by
financial-service and pharmaceutical stocks. The Dow industrials
gained 31.89 points, to 9,069.60.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities were little changed. Investors were cautious
ahead of Wednesday's scheduled congressional testimony by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   STRIKE IDLES TWO GM PLANTS
</P>
<P>
   General Motors sent 4,500 workers home at two plants as a
four-day strike by the United Auto Workers at a metal-stamping
plant in Flint, Mich., threatened to halt the company's vehicle
production.
</P>
<P>
   HONDA AND FORD FINED ON POLLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Honda will pay a record $12.6 million environmental fine,
federal prosecutors announced, because of bad programming on the
pollution-control computers in 1.6 million Honda and Accura models.
Ford will pay a $2.5 million fine for selling 60,000 Econoline vans
that emit more nitrogen oxides at highway speeds than they do on
treadmill tests.
</P>
<P>
   ROCHE RECALLS POSICOR HEART DRUG
</P>
<P>
   The prescription heart drug Posicor was pulled off pharmacy
shelves in 38 countries by its maker, Roche Laboratories. The Food
and Drug Administration cited mounting evidence of dangerous,
possibly even lethal, drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   AOL TO BUY CHAT SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   America Online will pay at least $287 million for Mirabilis, a
small Israeli company known for its highly regarded online chat
service that enables users to detect when fellow users are online
and to communicate instantly with them. AOL's stock rose 2 percent
on the news, which was viewed by analysts as a shrewd move.
</P>
<P>
   STATE FARM TO ISSUE REBATE
</P>
<P>
   State Farm, the United States' largest auto insurer, said it
would return $891.6 million to its policyholders in 35 states and
the District of Columbia. Accident claims have fallen.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   KOREAN ECONOMIC PAIN MOUNTS
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's economic pain is mounting, with few signs of a
turnaround. Economic output fell 3.8 percent in the first quarter,
and unemployment reached 6.7 percent in April. Both numbers
exceeded forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea, who assumed office in
February, told New York business leaders that his country's
once-prized economic miracle was nothing but a ``house of cards''
and that his people now needed U.S. help to rebuild the economy.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS GRAPPLE FOR TOBACCO FEES
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who fought the tobacco industry have found a new battle:
fighting for their share of the richest pot of legal fees ever to
be awarded. Some in Congress are arguing for controls on the
multibillion-dollar fees.

ANALYSIS: DREAD REPLACES MOURNING IN NIGERIA
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NIGERIA-ABACHA, ABACHA-OBIT, NIGERIA-OPPOSITION)  
(ja) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Few Nigerians are in a state of
mourning over the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, a deeply unpopular
leader. But while Nigeria awaits clearer signs of its political
future, nearly all of the nation is in a state of dread.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's legacy is a divided and demoralized army with no clear
lines of succession, a political class whose leaders have been
jailed or driven into exile and a national economy that has been
looted into penury.
</P>
<P>
   The booby traps he left in the nation's path could not only
violently rend Africa's most populous country, but also send
shudders through the West African countries that gravitate around
this region's demographic giant like so many small moons.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the very first hints of potential trouble came from
within the Nigerian army itself, when journalists summoned without
explanation to the presidential compound in the capital, Abuja,
early Monday afternoon were just as suddenly chased away.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later the military government officially announced the
death of the president which had taken place early in the day. The
lapse reflected deep divisions at the highest level of command over
the army's role both immediately and into the future, according to
retired senior officers in the Nigerian military.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha, governing in a style bordering on heightened paranoia,
left a military that is both Africa's largest and perhaps least
unified. Wave after wave of purges of senior officers, show trials
of suspected opponents and long-sustained ethnic favoritism in the
officer corps have left many commanders deeply demoralized and
dangerously suspicious of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many of us who have made our lives in the army
because we were trained to believe that the military had something
vital to offer to the nation,'' said one senior Nigerian general in
a recent interview. ``This, however, does not include politics, and
we have a bunch of officers who come to think of themselves as
permanent politicians. In behaving this way they are dragging us
all down.''
</P>
<P>
   With feelings this raw and opinions so divergent, between those
who wish to get back to a classic republican army and those who
have for years cherished military power as a means of access to the
country's trough of abundant petroleum wealth, many now fear an
open and potentially violent split.
</P>
<P>
   ``How divided is this military? It is seriously divided,'' said
Bolaji Akinyemi, a former Nigerian foreign minister. ``What is the
strength of each faction? Nobody knows. What is certain is that
this is a very dangerous moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's unexpected death came less than four months before a
transition toward democratically-elected civilian rule he had long
promised. But by the time he died early Monday, reportedly of a
heart attack, even those who had been temporarily willing to
believe in the improbable gift of democratic rule from a stern and
secretive military man had long ago concluded that he would destroy
the country in his attempt to maintain tight personal control.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Nigerian high command is able to maintain a
reasonably united front and put forth yet another officer-designed
plan for a ``transition to democracy,'' just as seven other
military dictatorships that have dominated the country's history
since independence from Britain have before, there is no sign that
the country's political class will meekly sit back and await the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the hours following Abacha's death there have been
impassioned renewed calls for the restoration of the presidential
mandate of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the millionaire businessman who is
widely believed to have won the country's militarily annulled
elections in 1993, which international human rights groups have
called the most democratic ever held in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abiola should be invited to head a government of national
unity to organize a sovereign national conference and lead Nigeria
to genuine democracy,'' the Nigerian human rights lawyer, Gani
Fawehinmi told Reuters. ``The Nigerian people will not allow the
military to take over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, already suspecting the military has little intention of
relinquishing power, have begun to warn of the possibility of
spreading unrest. In the weeks leading up to his death street
protests against the military have erupted into small-scale riots,
and opposition leaders had already announced plans for a series of
strikes and other demonstrations against the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't relinquish power quickly there will be factional
struggles and great social disorder,'' said the leader of one
Nigerian human rights group who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians, still haunted by the 30-year-old memories of the
Biafran conflict, one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, have little
difficulty imagining a continuation, indeed acceleration of their
national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout West Africa, where Nigeria looms huge, whether by
virtue of its 105 million people, its large army or sophisticated
economy, these kinds of scenarios are already causing serious
worry.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, where Nigerian soldiers intervened recently to
restore the overthrown elected president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and
rout a rural guerrilla force that has been terrorizing much of the
countryside, people from street vendors to government officials
expressed fear Monday that disorder in Nigeria would cause that
country to lessen its commitment in Sierra Leone, perhaps allowing
the rebels to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha may have been hated in Nigeria, but he saved us here,''
said one Sierra Leonean journalist. ``If things go badly in
Nigeria, we will surely suffer again.''
</P>
<P>
   In other West African countries mounting concerns about
stability in Nigeria have less to do with Nigerian military
involvements than with fears of a huge refugee outflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is trouble in Nigeria, there is trouble for all of
West Africa,'' said one senior official from Ivory Coast. ``A
sinking Nigeria is big enough to swamp us all.''

ONLINE WORLD ADDS NEW PERIL TO JOB HUNTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the march, the diploma and the champagne,
area graduates have to face this sober fact: Landing a job.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they face one of the best job markets in recent
history, job seekers should not be complacent, recruiters say.
Indeed, pitfalls await the unprepared grad from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   And with cyberspace getting a big share of job applications, new
protocols have emerged for job seekers as well: Should applicants
send a hard copy resume after e-mailing it? Is it appropriate to
provide a personal Web site address on an online resume? How does
an applicant follow up on an application _ call or e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduates have degrees in certain industries. They don't have
a degree in interviewing and how to get hired,'' said Lynn Taylor,
research director for OfficeTeam, a unit of employment services
firm Robert Half International.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these blunders by actual candidates in an OfficeTeam
survey:
</P>
<P>
   _ An employer walked into the lobby to meet a nervous candidate,
whose mouth displayed a ring of antacid from the bottle he was
holding.
</P>
<P>
   _ An applicant was asked why she wanted the job. ``I'm here for
a paycheck, isn't everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   _ An entry-level candidate became so animated during an
interview that his clip-on tie fell off.
</P>
<P>
   _ A job seeker fell asleep during a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   _ A candidate pulled his pet iguana from his briefcase, saying,
``I didn't want to bring him here, but he hates to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the examples are as extreme as they are funny. But
there are more subtle mistakes that can kill an applicant's chances
_ and that's no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   When sending resumes online, it's a good idea to send one in
ASCII or plain text format with a file attachment of a Microsoft
Word or WordPerfect document, said Ken Ramberg, founder of JobTrak,
a Los Angeles-based online job search company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any computer can open ASCII,'' he said. The Word or
WordPerfect files provide a refined version of one's resume to
employers who can access it.
</P>
<P>
   Since recruiters want to see resumes that fit on one printed
page, it's OK to provide a link to a personal Web page for the
employer to look through, as long as it will help _ not hurt _ the
candidate, Ramberg added.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a silly or humorous Web page will probably hamper
the chances of an applicant seeking a job at a bank or investment
house.
</P>
<P>
   Before e-mailing the resume to the company, send a copy to
yourself first to make sure the format and font show up fine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use fancy graphics, unless the job calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers want the resume to pull up quickly. Be
straightforward with the data,'' said Marc Goldman, corporate
marketing vice president at AppleOne Employment Services, a
staffing firm in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Send both a cover letter and resume with the online application,
Taylor said. The cover letter reinforces the candidate's interest
in the job.
</P>
<P>
   It's advisable, but not necessary, to send a hard copy cover
letter and resume after e-mailing them to the employer, Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Call or e-mail the company within a week to make sure they have
received the application, but don't make a pest of yourself, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   To get your resume noticed, plug in buzzwords for the job
opening, whether or not you're applying online. Because employers
receive thousands of resumes, many Fortune 1000 companies'
computers scan them for certain key words to narrow their search.
</P>
<P>
   Resumes containing the words sought _ such as C++ for a computer
programming job _ will be retained and gradually narrowed down to a
pool of candidates that the company can handle.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Amgen, based in Ventura County's Thousand Oaks,
does.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech firm, for instance, may scan for the word ``DNA
sequencing'' in resumes of candidates applying for a research
associate or scientist position, said Thomas Hutton, senior manager
of staffing and staffing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the company will fine-tune the search to include
words like ``biology degree'' and ``chemistry degree'' or ``master
of science.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pool is sufficiently narrowed, Amgen recruiters then
look at the individual resumes for work experience, skills and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get carried away and list all possible skills, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful not to say proficiency if you only have some
exposure to it. It could get you in trouble later on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical to make a good first impression with one's resume
and cover letter, since they usually form the candidate's first
contact with the company, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Misspellings, grammatical errors, smudges and a poor print job
will hurt an applicant's chances. Using brightly colored paper also
isn't recommended for most positions, recruiters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Kinko's. It's money well-spent,'' Goldman said. ``The
first impression is sometimes the only impression you get to make.
Make it perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Let someone else proofread them before they're mailed out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for content, the most relevant work and academic experience
should be highlighted. A college graduate without years of
experience in the field would do well to emphasize any academic
achievements, internships or part-time jobs. A high grade-point
average should be listed as well.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   But tell the truth. Listing false degrees or job experiences can
be grounds for termination later on, recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Once an interview is granted, the candidate should research the
company's business, culture and goals to prepare for the one-on-one
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet making research easy, candidates have no
excuse for not finding out about their prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many college graduates don't do it,'' said
Anthony Mulkern, founder of Mulkern Associates, a Glendale
management consulting firm that helps recruiters assess job
candidates. ``There's no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the interview, dress conservatively. That means
dark-colored suits for men and women, preferably navy blue. Even if
the company has a casual dress policy, the recruiter wants to see
the candidate at his or her best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a risk when you go outside that set,'' Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Look neat. Men should trim beards and chuck any earrings,
Goldman said. Women shouldn't wear overpowering perfume or big
jewelry, but panty hose are a must.
</P>
<P>
   Show up a little early for the interview. In Southern
California, that means allowing enough time for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   When meeting recruiters, have a firm handshake and look them in
the eye.

   ``It's hard to like somebody who won't look you in the eyes,''
Goldman said. ``(Recruiters) will hire someone they feel

   In the interview, be prepared but stay away from canned answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as bad as coming in too slick,'' Mulkern said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters don't like candidates who oversell themselves without
having anything specific to back their claims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, before claiming to be a team player, candidates
must come up with specific examples where they exhibited this
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to talk about what they have done specifically
rather than (spout) vague generalities,'' Mulkern said.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, send a thank-you note within a day or two
of the meeting reiterating your interest in and appropriateness for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Having recommended all that, job recruiters say there's one
exception to all those rules: computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   With more jobs than graduates, competition for candidates is
stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're good, you can get away with almost anything,''
Ramberg said.

<P>
   CARLISLE, Mass. _ Do not be fooled by the virtuous grins on all
those celebrities with the white mustaches. The question ``Got
Milk?'' and its corollaries ``How much?'' and ``At what price?''
are fueling what economists call the most contentious, most
political battle over agricultural policy in the East, if not the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The fight affecting cows named Oprah and Cher involves Mark
Duffy's dairy farm here, 20 miles northwest of Boston. It has
already burst through a score of other statehouses and is expected
to flare in the New York legislature this week. And it will soon
play itself out in Washington, pitting East against Midwest,
farmers against dairy processors, those who want to preserve
farmland against those who want to preserve lower milk prices.
</P>
<P>
   The formal name for the focus of these milk wars is the
Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a treaty-like agreement among
the six New England states. It guarantees their dairy farmers a
higher price for drinking milk than the one dictated under the
system the federal government has been using to set farmers' milk
prices since the depression. Created by federal law, the agreement
acts something like a regional minimum wage for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The compact, which went into effect last July, is meant to shore
up the region's remaining dairy farms, whose numbers have dropped
by nearly half over the last decade to about 4,600. By April, the
compact had paid New England farmers a total of $33 million more
for their milk than what federal pricing would have paid them, the
commission that runs the compact says.
</P>
<P>
   The price of milk in New England stores, meanwhile, has jumped
about a dime or 15 cents a gallon to an average of $2.88, the
commission's executive director, Ken Becker, said. He figures the
compact has cost New England's 13 million residents about $2.50
each since it went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   That seems acceptable to some, but not to opponents of the
compact, who include advocates for consumers and the poor, groups
of dairy processors who must pay the higher prices, and Midwestern
farmers, who are worried that if New England's milk production
rises and increases the national supply, then the prices for milk
outside New England will drop.
</P>
<P>
   These opponents say the agreement has fulfilled several of their
Economics 101 projections that when price rises, so does the
incentive to produce, thus swelling supplies, while demand drops.
New England's production this spring was up 2.4 percent over 1997,
Becker said, while the national average was up less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is another problem because the compact specifies that if
New England milk supplies jump disproportionately and the compact
is determined to be the cause, the New England states must
reimburse the U.S. Department of Agriculture for buying up the
extra supply to keep it from affecting the national market.
Already, the compact commission has held back a total of $1 million
from farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has backfired,'' said John Schnittker, an economist
with Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer advocacy
group in Washington. ``We've got consumers paying more; we've got
surplus production; we've got government cost, and the extra
revenues the consumers are paying are being directed back into the
federal Treasury. This is a lose-lose-lose policy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The compact's backers, however, say that other factors besides
price are at work: El Nino brought bad weather to the West and
warmer weather to the East, they say, and the mild winter combined
with better feed harvests has increased cows' milk production here.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, whose farm in Carlisle is about average for New England
in its milking herd size _ 60 cows _ said that the compact has
brought him $5,570 extra so far, raising his milk receipts by about
3 percent. But he said his production is up because of the mild
winter and a good harvest of corn for feed last fall, not because
of the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go out and buy a single cow,'' Duffy said. Rather,
his family decided to use the extra money to invest in modernizing
some stalls and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the compact commission is working on altering its rules
in order to discourage big increases in production, and is
discussing ways to direct the payments more to small farmers and
less to big farms, which already enjoy economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a work in progress,'' said Jay Healy, Massachusetts
commissioner of food and agriculture and a backer of the compact
for its potential to save disappearing farmland. The compact has
already altered its rules in response to criticism that higher milk
prices hurt those who can least afford it. Participants in the
Women, Infants and Children nutrition program were compensated for
higher milk costs from the start; school lunch programs will be as
well, beginning this August.
</P>
<P>
   But the compact will be hard-put to compensate for another
predictable result: New Englanders are drinking about 2 percent
less milk than a year ago, compared with a slight rise in the rest
of the country, said E. Linwood Tipton, president of the Milk
Industry Foundation, a Washington organization of milk processors,
manufacturers and marketers that is leading the charge against the
compact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a word,'' he said. ``It's spelled M-A-R-K-E-T. It
actually works and that's what the rest of the dairy industry is
living with, and they seem to be surviving and thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict also touches on the question of whether, at a time
when the federal government is moving away from supporting prices
for commodities like corn, wheat and milk, consumers should be
asked to help provide American farmers with a new economic safety
net. Many see the compact as insurance for farmers as the federal
government fiddles with its own complex system for pricing milk
across the nation. But the dairy compact itself is facing an
imminent deadline. Under federal law, the compact expires next
April. Unless it is re-authorized, it dies.

</P>
<P>
   But while the federal fate of the agreement may be up in the
air, other states are jumping on the compact bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Southern states, from Tennessee to Texas, have
expressed interest in forming a Southern dairy compact, and several
of their legislatures have passed laws to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia have passed laws
recently seeking to join the existing dairy compact. The federal
law creating the Northeast compact left it open to future
participation by New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and
Delaware but only as contiguous states. The focus of the political
fight over the compact has thus shifted to Albany, because if New
York does not join, neither can New Jersey and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Senate passed a bill calling for the state,
with its 9,000 dairy farms, to join this winter, and Gov. George
Pataki endorsed the idea despite complaints that it helped upstate
farmers at the expense of downstate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Assembly, where the bill's fate is expected to be
decided this week, the compact suffered a major blow last month
when William Parment, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee,
withdrew his sponsorship of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I want to jump into something that's not
well-tested and has the potential for negative impact for both
consumers and farmers,'' Parment said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Novakovic, director of Cornell University's Program on
Dairy Markets and Policy and a leading expert on the dairy
industry, said he believed the compact could be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   In his assessment, retail prices have risen only slightly thus
far to a level not unusual in other parts of the country, while
farmers have gotten a definite lift; but it is worrisome that there
are reports of a surplus that can drive prices down elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He was gloomy about the compact's prospects for a federal
extension, but then immediately hedged his bet, noting that he had
bet his house the compact would never pass in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing nobody took me up on it,'' he said.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ In case anybody had forgotten, Dennis Rodman is still
Dennis Rodman.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The unpredictable Chicago forward was fined $10,000 by the NBA
and an undisclosed amount by the Bulls for missing practice and a
mandatory media session Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls coach Phil Jackson said he talked to Rodman by telephone
as the team's practice was winding down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with Dennis,'' Jackson said. ``He didn't speak back.
But this is not a practice day. This is a day when you have to be
here to meet the press. Dennis obviously is susceptible to the fine
from the NBA for not being here and also from us. But he's willing
to go through that. Physically, we didn't go through a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, Dennis, practice is at 10:30 tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's unexcused absence is another in a long line of problems
the hair-dye king has had with respecting the Bulls' coaching staff
and authority figures in general. Last season, he kicked a
cameraman, suffered a lengthy suspension, missed countless Bulls
workouts, showed up late for games and had a plethora of other
controversies envelop him.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with a contract based mostly on incentives for
remaining on good behavior and playing in at least 75 of the 82
regular-season games, Rodman improved his work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody understands that this is a guy concentrating
at times on the mundane parts of this game,'' Jackson said. ``He's
not particularly comfortable in these (interview) situations. He's
willing to take whatever deviant action happens and take
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely offers an excuse for this. He never tells me he had
a flat tire, or something happened, or his dog ate his keys. He
just says, `I was late.' I asked him, `What do you think I should
say to the press?' And he hung up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he hung up because he was on his way out to lunch, a
place some of his superiors believe describes where Rodman often
is.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after the other Bulls filtered out of the
United Center, Rodman was seen arriving for lunch with his
entourage at a Hooters restaurant in downtown Chicago. He was in a
jovial mood, although he did not want to talk about what activities
kept him from the morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Bulls know Rodman wasn't in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dennis Distraction Factor cannot be dismissed,
especially in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is not here, and I'm pretty sure Phil is going to fine
him,'' Michael Jordan said. ``That's something we have to address.
With Dennis comes a lot of baggage. And unfortunately, this is one
of the baggage areas we have to accept. How long will the
organization accept it? It depends. But we know when he steps on
the basketball court, he's going to give us 110 percent. In some
ways, we have to put up with some of the baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scottie Pippen: ``It's very frustrating at this time, but
you don't want to carry that into the next game or the next
practice. You want the team chemistry to stay as strong as
possible. The situation we're in right now, we don't want Dennis
taking the focus away from the team. He's going to come to practice
tomorrow, hopefully, and have some lame excuse. But we're going to
overlook it and look forward to the next game. We want him to come
to play but also come to practice, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The one bit of solace Jackson can take is that he at least
doesn't have a whole team of Rodmans _ or young players who might
be overly distracted by him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was asked what it would be like if there were more
Rodmans in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be in chaos,'' Jackson said. ``We couldn't have a
society. Dennis is not a normal person.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if managing Rodman is a little like being a kindergarten
teacher, Jackson said: ``It's a little bit more like being in
special ed.''

INTEL'S GO-GO DAYS SEEM OVER, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER AND LISA GONDERINGER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Intel Corp. faces a triumvirate of troubles: layoffs,
lackluster stock performance and now a government lawsuit that
could define antitrust laws in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Are the go-go days of Intel gone-gone, at least for now?
</P>
<P>
   By most indications, yes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock is down almost $30 since mid-February, it's
earning less money, it was slapped Monday with an antitrust action
by the Federal Trade Commission and it's cutting 3,000 jobs,
including 600 in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad year for Intel,'' said Jeff Weir, spokesman for
the Semiconductor Industry Association. ``They're not all that
different than everyone else in the industry, but they just have
one more example with the FTC action.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, few Intel employees say they're worried. They
praise the company for notifying employees early of the layoffs,
which begin in October and come with four months' pay and benefits,
and shrug off the lawsuit as a political poker game.
</P>
<P>
   Weir agrees, saying the problems are nothing new for the plucky
company that maintains an entrepreneurial spirit despite sales of
$25 billion a year and worldwide employment of 64,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're relentless in their style, with their
take-no-prisoners attitude and only-the-paranoid survive
approach,'' he said. ``They've responded to every challenge
historically and thrived through every challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think given that history, anyone's going to assume
that they can't overcome this,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   But from one insider's perspective, there is worry on the part
of Intel's legion of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks are exceedingly achievement-oriented
individuals,'' said a consultant who trains workers at Intel and
other high-tech employers in the Valley. ``The confidence is a
little bit shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   The old adage was that Intel didn't have customers, it had
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, people are a little bit scared,'' added the consultant,
who is prohibited by the company from talking about Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is not obvious in visits to various haunts around Intel
facilities. Some workers believe they are immune from the cutbacks,
either because their job is needed or their work performance is
superior.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who have lost their jobs are optimistic that they'll
land something else with the state's second-largest private
employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in software development, and if that's all I could do,
yeah, I'd be nervous,'' said one female worker, who declined to
give her name. ``But there are so many more things, like systems
analysis, et cetera, that I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But her optimism might be misguided.
</P>
<P>
   The entire semiconductor industry is in a tailspin, due in part
to the Asian economic crisis. The bust is prompting Motorola Inc.,
the state's largest private employer, to slash 15,000 jobs
worldwide, including perhaps 2,000 in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Motorola's shocking news, it was in the process of
closing two product lines, idling more than 400 workers in the
Valley. The communications giant cut 225 positions with the
shutdown of its Advanced Custom Technologies team in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Another 180 workers lost jobs at the chip-making factory at 52nd
Street and McDowell Road.
</P>
<P>
   The losses mean Intel engineers will have one less place to find
work.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microchip Technology Inc., a Chandler-based maker of
microcontrollers that has weathered the chip downturn better than
most, isn't looking to employ Intel workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have any plans to do promotions or target the
employees that are being laid off at Intel,'' said spokesman Eric
Sells.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's woes are exaggerated by factors both inside and outside
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest chipmaker said May 29 that it will delay its
next-generation microprocessor, Merced, until mid-2000. The chip
had been expected to be released in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company also faces stiff competition from computer systems
costing less than $1,000, which don't use Intel's latest chip
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that are waning financial results. The Santa Clara,
Calif., company made $1.3 billion in the first quarter, down 36
percent from the same period a year ago. It expects revenue in the
second quarter to be flat or even decrease.
</P>
<P>
   The problems come just months after Intel Chairman Andrew Grove,
a co-founder, relinquished his job as chief executive officer to
Valley resident Craig Barrett. Barrett has been with the company
full time since 1974 and was picked last year as its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as having their dirty laundry aired in public through
the lawsuit, it does hurt their public image,'' said Bill McClean,
president of Scottsdale-based IC Insights, a market researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you (Intel) are truly the only option, it doesn't
really hurt the bottom line.'' &QL;

COHEN UPHOLDS MIXED MILITARY TRAINING FOR MEN AND WOMEN  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said on Monday that
the Army, Navy, and Air Force would continue to train male and
female recruits together but would provide stricter privacy and
security in the barracks areas.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's announcement was expected and, in a sense,
anticlimactic. On March 16, when he rejected a special panel's
recommendation that the services segregate men and women for much
of basic training, he nevertheless told military leaders to do more
to separate them in their living quarters. Cohen said Monday he had
approved plans that the services submitted to him for carrying out
those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot run a military without women, and our goal is to
find a way to train men and women together,'' the secretary said,
noting that 14 percent of the people in the military are women.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of the treatment of women in the military remains
contentious. Although he stressed Monday that he had accepted most
of the recommendations of a special panel that investigated the
issue, Cohen nonetheless rejected in March the panel's main
recommendation, for segregation in basic training.
</P>
<P>
   That panel, headed by former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum Baker, was
appointed by Cohen in the aftermath of several highly publicized
sex scandals, some involving male instructors who had relations
with female trainees.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of segregating men and women in the services is sure to
be hotly debated in Congress. The House, as part of the
defense-authorization bill, voted last month to separate basic
training of men and women, and the Senate is expected to take up
the matter soon.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said he did not plan a ``massive lobbying
campaign'' but was confident that Congress would listen to the
recommendations of military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen sought to give the impression that stricter security and
privacy, as opposed to outright segregation, would require no major
changes. He said the Army would need to spend relatively little to
provide ``totally separate and secure sleeping areas and latrines''
for men and women, but would not necessarily house men and women on
different floors. The Navy and Air Force, on the other hand, will
continue to house male and female recruits on separate floors, with
some additional security ``enhancements.'' The Marine Corps will
continue to house men and women in separate barracks and run
separate boot camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their different missions, traditions and conditions of
service, some differences in the ways the services conduct their
basic training are appropriate and desirable,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said the services would also intensify physical
training, make the job of training instructor more attractive, and
re-emphasize ``core military values,'' like courage, honesty and
loyalty, over materialistic values, like joining the service to get
money for college.

PHONE COMPANIES' TACTICS MAY KILL PLAN TO WIRE SCHOOLS FOR
INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A plan by President Clinton and Congress to help
wire all classrooms to the Internet has prompted a revolt by phone
companies, lawmakers and consumer groups, now that the cost is
about to show up on long-distance phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission expects to vote on the
future of the program this week amid growing pressure to kill it or
scale it back. Key lawmakers who supervise telephone legislation
are calling the program ``fundamentally flawed and legally
suspect,'' and House Speaker Newt Gingrich yesterday threatened to
pass a bill to block what he and others have called the ``Gore
tax,'' a reference to Vice President Al Gore's pledge to wire all
schools to the Internet by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The losers could be 30,000 schools and libraries that have
applied for federal grants and subsidies for equipment and
telecommunications services to link to the Internet. They include
more than 350 schools or school districts and 135 libraries in
Massachusetts. About half of the 180 schools in the Archdiocese of
Boston system have applied for money under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Without the federal money, ``our project is dead, and we will
have to find some way to resurrect it from oblivion,'' said Peter
J. Sullivan, a parent who has led efforts by the East Boston
Central Catholic School to set up an e-mail account for each grade
level at the elementary school. About 40 volunteers have already
begun wiring the classrooms for Internet access. The school is
hoping the federal government will cover about $8,000 of the
$40,000 pricetag.
</P>
<P>
   But even some groups that support the subsidies say the FCC
should not issue the first checks to schools, which were expected
to go out in July. ``We like the program, but it's a little funny
the way it is being funded right now,'' said Kathy McShea of the
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the subsidy program, which could cost as
much as $2 billion annually, is raising the nation's phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidy program, which goes by the shorthand of ``E-Rate,''
was created by Congress in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the
bill that set broad new rules for the long-distance, local
telephone and cable TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   By law, phone companies have always subsidized phone rates for
low-income users and for people in rural communities, where the low
population density can make phone service expensive. But under a
plan championed by Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, the
1996 bill broadened the subsidy program to include schools,
libraries and rural health centers. They were invited to apply for
grants to buy computer equipment, as well as for discounted rates
on Internet access charges.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance and local phone companies were to pay the bulk of
the cost, but cellular phone, paging and other telecommunications
companies would also pay in.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional aides, lawmakers believed that
telephone costs would fall significantly because of new rules
designed to bring more competition to the long-distance and local
phone markets. As competition forced the phone companies to operate
more efficiently, money could be diverted to the subsidy program
without raising the nation's phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Residential long-distance phone bills have in fact fallen 5
percent or more since early 1996, at least partly because of
government-ordered changes in the way phone companies bill each
other and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, AT&AMP;T announced that it would not absorb the
cost of the new subsidies and instead would pass it to residential
customers. Starting July 1, a new line will appear on residential
phone bills showing a 5 percent surcharge on long-distance calls to
pay for the subsidy program. MCI followed suit with plans for a 5.9
percent surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than raise rates, the phone companies could have absorbed
the cost of the program ``in your ample profit margins,'' comlained
Senator Robert Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, in letters to AT&AMP;T and
MCI last week. ``Even more disturbing, you are now mounting a
public relations campaign to convince consumers that your price
increase is the equivalent of a tax. ... I am gravely disappoined
in the long distance companies' behavior,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich yesterday said the FCC had in fact turned the
subsidy program into a new form of taxation. ``It is wrong for five
unelected, appointed commissiners to be able to establish a tax on
every telephone line in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairmen and senior Democrats on both the House
and Senate Commerce Committees have also called on the FCC to stop
collecting any money for the subsidy program, saying Congress never
intended to raise phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and FCC Chairman William Kennard have
issued statements supporting the subsidy plan, and President
Clinton hailed it during his commencement address at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Clinton cited a $1 billion pricetag for the
program, less money than many people anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC intially envisioned a $2.25 billion program, which
Kerrey said comes to less than 3 percent of the 1996 revenues of
the long-distance industry alone. The FCC later scaled the plan
back to about $2 billion, and it approved a plan to collect money
only for the first six months of the year, saying it would revisit
the issue this month.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has collected about $625 million so far. It will collect
$1.4 billion more this year unless it changes the size of the
program this week. Some long-distance companies have raised their
share of the $625 million raised so far by adding a surcharge to
business customer bills.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC may also vote on the mechanism by which phone companies
collect money for the program, such as the surcharge on business
and residential long-distance bills. In addition, the commissioners
may consider a complaint that local phone companies, taking
advantage of rules that force phone companies to pay each other
fees, have found a way to pass their share of the Internet program
to long-distance firms instead of to their own customers.
</P>
<P>
   The program's supporters say there should be no cutbacks in the
size of the Internet subsidies. ``If we lose this vote at the FCC
this week, we're down the tubes,'' said Lynne Bradley of the
American Library Association. ``It will show that the forces of
darkness are prevailing, that it's profits over kids and corporate
interests over our kids' education.''
</P>
<P>
   And in East Boston, any cutbacks could force parents and local
churches to make up the difference, or lose the Internet program
altogether. The school's primary source of money is tuition, and
after that it relies on local parishes for its budget, said Sister
Mary Jude Waters, director of school planning at the Archdiocese's
Catholic School Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school across the nation is going to be a loser if this
doesn't come through,'' Waters said. ``With 30,000 applications,
there will be a lot of disappointed folks.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator of Nigeria, whose ruthless
suppression of opponents, human rights and democracy led to
condemnation around the world and seething discontent at home, died
suddenly early Monday, leaving Africa's most populous nation
rudderless, and also at a crucial political crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria's top military and government leaders convened, it
was unclear who would succeed the general and lead the oil-rich
nation of 115 million, a country wracked by decades of harsh,
corrupt military regimes and the effects of Western sanctions
imposed in a futile effort to hasten democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But from Washington, London, Paris and other capitals, world
leaders and exiled Nigerians said that the death of the general
offered an opportunity for Nigeria to release hundreds of political
prisoners, cancel impending executions set by kangaroo courts and
restore civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha's death is not going to bring my father back,'' said
Ken Wiwa, the son of playwright and environmental activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa, who, with eight other opponents of the general, was
publicly hanged for ``treason'' in 1995 while a worldwide
outpouring of appeals for mercy was icily ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright who won the 1986 Nobel
Prize for literature, fled to exile in Paris in 1994 and was
recently charged in absentia with treason, said from Jerusalem that
the general's death was an ``incredible opportunity'' for Nigeria
to resurrect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House offered no comment, but a State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, offered sympathy to Abacha's
family, reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to promoting democracy in
Nigeria, and urged a ``peaceful transition to civilian, democratic
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of rumors and confusion in which heavily armed
soldiers sealed off the general's compound in the capital of Abuja,
a brief communique by the defense chief of staff, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, confirmed that the 54-year-old Nigerian leader, who
seized power in 1993, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head of state and commander in chief of the Nigerian armed
forces, Gen. San Abacha, died at dawn,'' the statement read on
national radio said. ``He was to be buried today in Kano, his
native town, in accordance with Muslim rites and tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The communique did not specify the cause of death, but news
reports quoted family friends and western diplomats as saying he
had suffered a heart attack. U.S. officials said they had no
evidence of foul play. Reports that Abacha's health was failing
circulated after he canceled a highly publicized trip to Lagos,
Nigeria's principal city and former capital, last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the death drew no outpouring of sorrow in Nigeria, where
the general had tamed political parties, trade unions and the
press, and had an enemies list that read like a Who's Who of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, where opposition to Abacha had been strongest, there
were no signs of mourning. Small crowds gathered on corners, and
there was cautious talk about the passing of a widely despised
leader. ``God is capable of wonderful things,'' an opposition
political figure in Lagos said from behind a screen of anonymity.
``Perhaps Nigerians will be free at last.''

LOTT WANTS TOBACCO BILL WITHDRAWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.D.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Turning up the heat in a partisan debate, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said Monday that
the tobacco bill now before the Senate was such poor legislation
that it should be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott was careful not to say at his news conference how or
when that could happen or who would do it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third week the bill has been before the Senate, and
little progress has been made in bringing it to a vote. The Senate
is scheduled to vote on Tuesday and Wednesday on Democratic moves
to cut off debate, efforts that are bound to fail as long as nearly
all Republicans follow Lott and oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   At a separate news conference, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the Democratic leader, threatened that Democrats would tie up the
Senate so that no other issue could be voted on until a definitive
vote was cast on the tobacco bill. He also said that if the
Republicans blocked the anti-smoking measure, they would have to
answer for it in the election campaigns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, meant to discourage teen-agers from starting to smoke,
would raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack over
five years, strengthen federal regulation of tobacco products and
force the cigarette manufacturers to pay stiff penalties if youth
smoking did not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks ago, the bill was approved by the Senate Commerce
Committee by a bipartisan 19-1 vote. But since then, a deep
partisan divide has developed, as the statements Monday by Lott and
Daschle suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans argue that the legislation is a tax-and-spend,
big-government approach to the problem of teen-age smoking. ``The
bill has grown and grown and grown, and what has happened is that
greed has just taken over,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spending bill,'' he added, ``and it should be pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader has the authority to pull, or withdraw, a
bill from consideration, and Lott, like all leaders, has sometimes
done so despite the wishes of a bill's supporters. But on Monday,
when asked when and whether he would do that, he replied, ``Well,
you know, in the Senate, you don't just walk up and pull it on your
own.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Wells merger makes bank 7th largest  
   
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In yet another megabanking deal, Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. confirmed
yesterday that it has agreed to merge with Norwest Corp. of
Minneapolis to create the country's seventh-largest bank.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The combined bank will retain the Wells Fargo name, which has
been around since the Gold Rush era, and its headquarters will
remain in San Francisco. It will have $191 billion in assets,
branches in 21 states, about 20 million customers and more than
90,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo shareholders will own approximately 52.5 percent of
the combined company, and both banks will have equal representation
on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The major concession by Wells is that Chairman Paul Hazen will
relinquish his chief executive title at the new Wells Fargo to
Richard Kovacevich, his counterpart at Norwest who initiated merger
discussions about a month ago. Both Kovacevich and Norwest
President Leslie Biller will move to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in New York yesterday, both Hazen and
Kovacevich characterized the deal as ``a merger of equals.'' The
same term was used by the CEOs of Bankamerica and NationsBank to
describe their merger plans two months ago. In that case, though,
BofA ceded not only the CEO slot, but the headquarters of the
combined bank and equal representation on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's concessions _ especially its agreement to move the
headquarters of the new bank to Charlotte, N.C. _ ignited a storm
of protest in the Bay Area. By contrast, Wells Fargo's deal with
Norwest was greeted with general approval.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco city officials even suggested that Wells Fargo
should get preference in obtaining city business. ``I will look
with much greater fondness on a company based here,'' said
Supervisor Michael Yaki, a leading critic of the BofA deal. ``The
city should look at ways to reward them, maybe by moving their
checking accounts there.''
</P>
<P>
   City Treasurer Susan Leal added, ``The news of the Wells Fargo
merger is as good as can be expected. It sounds as though Wells
Fargo will become bigger and stronger, and that's good news for San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA currently handles most of the city's checks, but Leal
indicated that Wells Fargo could break into the business. ``Someone
who is based here would mean something to us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevich, who earned his MBA degree at Stanford while Hazen
received his from the University of California at Berkeley, said
that basing the bank in San Francisco and adopting the Wells Fargo
name made obvious sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined bank will have $54billion of deposits in
California, compared to $13 billion in Minnesota,'' he said. In
addition, he noted that the Wells Fargo name and stagecoach logo
are known throughout the West, while ``there were problems with the
Norwest name (short for Northwest) in states like California, Texas
and Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides their geographic differences, the product lines are
different at both banks. Wells Fargo is a leader in alternative
financial delivery channels such as ATMs, supermarket branches and
online banking. It also is big in commercial real estate and small
business lending.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Norwest is strong in a broader range of consumer
financial products, including home mortgages, insurance and loans
to consumers with less than sterling credit records.
</P>
<P>
   The Wells Fargo-Norwest merger is taking place as banks have
been merging at a frenzied pace to gain economies of scale and
compete more forcefully with nonbank competitors like brokerages,
mutual funds and credit card companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wells and Norwest could have grown by themselves, but
merging achieved the goal more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which needs shareholder and regulator
approval, Wells Fargo shareholders would get 10 shares of common
stock of Norwest for each share of Wells Fargo common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is valued at about $31.4 billion, based on the price of
Norwest stock, which lost $2.87 yesterday and closed at $36.81.
Wells stock closed at $365.75, up $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the deal, the combined bank will rank as the
top U.S. bank in originating mortgage loans and servicing them, as
well as No. 1 in agricultural lending and online banking. It will
rank No. 2 in small business loans and automated teller machines,
with a network of 6,152 ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that Wells was looking for a merger
partner,'' said analyst Campbell Chaney of Sandler O'Neill &AMP;
Partners. ``Its earnings were not living up to expectations since
its merger with First Interstate, and shareholders were very
restless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the massive consolidation of the financial services
industry,'' he added, ``if you don't keep investors happy, you
don't earn the right to remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   At a teleconference from New York, Hazen did not say Wells Fargo
had to merge. But he conceded that he learned important lessons
from the First Interstate acquisition _ namely, that it doesn't pay
to embark on unfriendly takeovers and try to rush the results.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said that because of lucrative severance packages, about
500 of First Interstate's top executives had more financial
incentive to leave than see the merger through and help with the
transition. In addition, Hazen said, ``We tried to integrate the
company too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In that merger there was extensive overlap, and Wells axed more
than 7,000 jobs as well as hundreds of branches. As a result of
faltering service and computer glitches, there were serious
customer defections, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than complete all systems conversions in nine months, as
it did with First Interstate, Wells is looking for a much longer
gestation period this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Integration of the two banks will not be completed for three
years. In part, that results from the need to focus attention on
upgrading the banks' computer systems to handle the year 2000
conversion problem.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to achieve $650 million in annual cost savings
within three years. About 2,300 positions out of 90,000 will be
eliminated, mostly at the headquarters of the two banks. But citing
the ``train and retain'' theme, both Kovacevich and Hazen said that
the plan is to lay off few workers.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this kinder, gentler approach is that there is
hardly any overlap between Norwest and Wells Fargo. The two banks
operate in five of the same states, but they only expect to have to
sell or close a few branches in Arizona and Nevada to meet the
concerns of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said another reason for the more deliberative
approach to the bank merger is Norwest's very different corporate
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norwest is more in rural markets and has high-touch
relationships with its customers,'' said Van Kasper analyst Joe
Morford. ``Wells Fargo deals more in densely populated metropolitan
markets and has a cost-conscious streamlined approach to banking.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Banks Come From Different Perspectives  
   
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
It was strictly lovey-dovey yesterday as the chief executives of
Wells Fargo and Norwest took turns ballyhooing the proposed merger
of their companies. But experts say the two banking giants have
``wildly dissimilar'' corporate cultures.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minneapolis-based Norwest, which was founded in 1929, ranks 10th
in the nation in assets _ just ahead of 11th-place Wells. But it is
about as old-fashioned as a big bank can be, with an abundance of
branches and a strong emphasis on personalized customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Most other banks _ Wells foremost among them _ impose tight,
centralized control over their operations and try to squeeze out
profits largely by cutting personnel and other costs and shutting
down supposedly superfluous branches.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest has bucked the trend by expanding aggressively, mainly
through &UR;  &LR; acquisitions of much-smaller banks. It boasts more than
4,000 bank branches, consumer-finance offices and mortgage-lending
outlets spread across all 50 states and offering a vast array of
financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest grants considerable autonomy to its 60,000 employees _
whom it dubs ``team members'' _ at the branch level, on the premise
that it will help build solid relationships with customers.
</P>
<P>
   It follows what the banking industry calls the ``high-touch''
approach, as distinguished from the ``high-tech'' approach, in
which customers are encouraged to interact with automated teller
machines rather than bank employees. Wells Fargo is a leading
proponent of ``high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Norwest's theory is if we sell more products, we will grow,''
says Ben Crabtree, an analyst with the Dain Rauscher brokerage firm
in Minneapolis. ``They are far more revenue-oriented than
cost-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy clearly has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest's profits have grown by more than 20 percent annually
over the past decade, and its stock price has shot up tenfold. It
ranks among the top five banks nationwide in return on assets and
in keeping bad loans off its books.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest is the nation's largest originator and servicer of home
mortgages, operates the largest bank-owned insurance agency and is
the fourth-largest issuer of student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kovacevich, who has served as chief executive of Norwest
for five years and will continue in that role with the merged
company, is a fervent advocate of the growth-and-service culture
and a principal architect of the company's great success. Crabtree,
who has observed him up close, calls him ``a very strong leader.''
</P>
<P>
   His opposite number, Wells CEO Paul Hazen, who will hold the
largely ceremonial title of chairman in the merged operation, has
faced a slew of troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them stem from his company's hostile takeover of First
Interstate in 1996, which was followed by a wave of branch
closings, asset sales and layoffs totaling 20 percent of the
workforce. That drove away many former First Interstate customers
who were accustomed to a greater measure of ``high touch'' service.
</P>
<P>
   Although the merged bank will be based in San Francisco and take
the Wells Fargo name, experts say the presence of Kovacevich in the
CEO's chair should make for a kinder, gentler operation.

YEN CONTINUES ITS SLIDE, THREATENING OTHER ASIAN MARKETS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese yen weakened to 140 to the dollar for the first
time in seven years Monday, extending a yearlong decline that is
now threatening the economic recovery of the emerging markets in
Asia that were battered by their currency devaluations last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fallout from the weakening yen, many currency
traders and strategists expect its value to decline further because
the Japanese government has not come up with a convincing program
to stimulate the economy. Many economists have already said Japan
is in a recession, which could be confirmed Friday when Tokyo is
expected to report its second consecutive quarterly decline in
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and analysts said the falling yen was hurting Asia's
recovery in two ways: One, the decline is a reflection of a
weakening Japanese economy that means Japan will not be a big buyer
of products from the troubled countries of South Korea, Thailand
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening yen also means South Korean, Thai and other Asian
manufacturers will have a harder time competing against Japanese
goods sold elsewhere, especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening currency makes that country's products less
expensive abroad. But the advantage that South Korea and other
Asian countries gained with their devaluations has been reduced by
the 18 percent fall in the yen since last July, when the Asian
crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive edge that South Korea has obtained is
minimal,'' said Desmond Lachman, the head of emerging-markets
research at Salomon Smith Barney. And, he said, ``If the yen slides
toward 150 we can be sure we are going to have real regional
currency turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one important unknown was how the Chinese would
react to the yen's weakness. The Chinese said they would not
devalue in the wake of the Asian devaluations. But Lachman said
that he believed China's restraint was based on the assumption that
the yen would remain relatively stable and not damage China's
competitiveness. A Chinese devaluation now could set off another
round of devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's latest decline came after Koji Tanami, Japan's vice
finance minister, indicated that finance ministers in the Group of
Seven industrialized nations were not going to discuss the yen's
problems in Paris today and tomorrow. In addition, Tanami said it
was unlikely that the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada would take action to support the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main topic of the meeting will be Russia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the dollar cost 140.71 yen, up from
139.75 Friday. The dollar also rallied against the German mark,
rising to 1.7794 marks from 1.7745.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to its strength against the yen, the dollar had been
falling in value against the mark since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a whole lot the G-7 can do for the yen without
the Japanese government providing the policy for support,'' Lachman
said. Even a surprising round of central bank intervention to
support the yen after these comments would only have a temporary
impact if Japan's policies are not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a succession of fiscal stimulus programs, the Japanese
government has not yet done enough to stimulate the economy or to
deal with the mountain of bad loans that is undermining its banking
system, said Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at
BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, there is no reason why the yen should
strengthen,'' said Fand, who is forecasting that the dollar could
strengthen to 180 yen in the next 12 months. But he also said that
the yen had fallen so much recently that it might be in line for a
sharp rebound in the near term before resuming its decline.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the dollar's strength was also highlighted
yesterday in a report by the Bank for International Settlements,
which coordinates the activities of the world's central banks. The
bank said the dollar was overvalued by 33 percent against the yen
and 21 percent against the mark, which makes American exports less
competitive and increases the likelihood that the American trade
deficit will keep growing.

 UNDATED: at last.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports from Kano, the northern city where Abacha was born in
1943, said that thousands of people lined the streets, awaiting the
arrival of the general's body and an escort of senior government
and military officials who were to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what to think,'' a Kano businessman who had
closed his shop for the day told the Reuters news service. ``It's
true some people are sad, but some will not be so sad either. We
just worry over what comes next.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the question on many minds.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Abacha _ who wielded absolute power and was so
haunted by the specter of a coup that he surrounded himself with a
2,000-member personal security force, rarely appeared in public and
jailed or executed many leading Nigerians _ there was a political
vacuum Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The general left no clear successor. His former
second-in-command, Lt. Gen. Donaldson Oladipo Diya, who had been
seen as a possible successor, was sentenced to death by a military
tribunal in April for allegedly plotting a coup. His fate is still
in the hands of the military junta.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria's leaders gathered in Abuja in a body called the
Provisional Ruling Council, a behind-the-scenes power struggle over
the next few days seemed likely. Political analysts said the likely
contenders to succeed the general included Abubakar, the defense
chief; Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni, Nigeria's most senior officer, and
Maj. Gen. Ishiaya Bamaiyi, the army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of 45 Nigerian groups that had clandestinely
opposed Abacha called Monday for the installation of a civilian
government headed by Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was imprisoned by
Abacha after his election as president in 1993 in what was widely
seen as the country's most democratic vote since it gained
independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   While Abiola remains in prison, his wife, Kudirat, an outspoken
critic of the regime, was shot down in Lagos in an execution style
killing in 1996 that has gone unsolved. Abiola's daughter, Hafsat,
23, a Harvard-educated resident of Maryland who works with the
Special Olympics, called Monday for her father's release. ``It's
the end of an era, and I hope the end of military rule,'' she said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha has been the seventh and by most accounts most brutal of
the military dictators who have ruled Nigeria for 27 of its 38
years of nationhood. independence. Tucked into the elbow of
Africa's west coast, Nigeria was under British control for more
than a century before gaining independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   It is a nation of 250 tribal groups. The Hausa and Fulani in the
north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Ibos in the southeast
make up 65 percent of the population. The 1960s were marked by a
struggle for political dominance among the major ethnic groups, and
a devastating civil war almost broke the country apart in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s oil exports helped Nigeria recover
economically, and in the early 1980s, with a civilian government in
Lagos, Nigeria became known as a model of African democracy and
prosperity. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press
was one of the freest anywhere. Nigerian diplomacy forcefully
challenged the United States and Britain over issues like
apartheid. The nation's currency was worth twice as much as the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy in Nigeria died in 1983, and Abacha, a career
soldier who became an infantryman at 18 and attended military
colleges in England, the United States and Nigeria, had a role in
three military coups.
</P>
<P>
   When generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983,
it was Abacha who announced it on national television. In 1985, he
again went on television, this time to announce that Gen. Mohammed
Buhari was being replaced by Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. Later,
Babangida named Abacha as his defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a return to democracy were high in June 1993, when
Abiola, a millionaire businessman, won an election with pledges to
return Nigeria to civilian government. But Babangida annulled the
election, and three months later Abacha overthrew Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, frustrated over his stolen victory, declared himself
president in defiance of Abacha and was jailed on treason charges.
Abacha promised democratic reforms and an election in 1996 to bring
back civilian government, but the promises proved hollow.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing that he was stretching his rule to 1998, Abacha
began a virtual reign of terror. He cracked down on all political
opposition, subdued trade unions, took control of the press, jailed
hundreds of people and began a series of trials that sent opponents
to prison or the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa was executed on charges stemming from his campaign to
have Nigeria's huge oil revenues shared with the communities where
the petroleum was produced. The general's purges also reached out
to prominent Nigerians and into his inner circle, many fled into
exile.
</P>
<P>
   His iron rule drew wide condemnation in the West. While an
international oil embargo did not materialize, but limited economic
sanctions against Nigerian oil, which accounts for 80 percent of
its foreign currency earnings, were invoked. There were reports
that he and other military leaders were siphoning off billions from
oil.
</P>
<P>
   As the general became a virtual pariah in Western countries, he
was said to have turned increasingly for support to the Middle East
and to Asia, particularly China. At the same time, he became
increasingly isolated personally.

PHONE COMPANIES' TACTICS MAY KILL PLAN TO WIRE SCHOOLS FOR
INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- A plan by President Clinton and Congress to help
wire all classrooms to the Internet has prompted a revolt by phone
companies, lawmakers and consumer groups, now that the cost is
about to show up on long-distance phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission expects to vote on the
future of the program this week amid growing pressure to kill it or
scale it back. Key lawmakers who supervise telephone legislation
are calling the program ``fundamentally flawed and legally
suspect,'' and House Speaker Newt Gingrich yesterday threatened to
pass a bill to block what he and others have called the ``Gore
tax,'' a reference to Vice President Al Gore's pledge to wire all
schools to the Internet by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The losers could be 30,000 schools and libraries that have
applied for federal grants and subsidies for equipment and
telecommunications services to link to the Internet. They include
more than 350 schools or school districts and 135 libraries in
Massachusetts. About half of the 180 schools in the Archdiocese of
Boston system have applied for money under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Without the federal money, ``our project is dead, and we will
have to find some way to resurrect it from oblivion,'' said Peter
J. Sullivan, a parent who has led efforts by the East Boston
Central Catholic School to set up an e-mail account for each grade
level at the elementary school. About 40 volunteers have already
begun wiring the classrooms for Internet access. The school is
hoping the federal government will cover about $8,000 of the
$40,000 pricetag.
</P>
<P>
   But even some groups that support the subsidies say the FCC
should not issue the first checks to schools, which were expected
to go out in July. ``We like the program, but it's a little funny
the way it is being funded right now,'' said Kathy McShea of the
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the subsidy program, which could cost as
much as $2 billion annually, is raising the nation's phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidy program, which goes by the shorthand of ``E-Rate,''
was created by Congress in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the
bill that set broad new rules for the long-distance, local
telephone and cable TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   By law, phone companies have always subsidized phone rates for
low-income users and for people in rural communities, where the low
population density can make phone service expensive. But under a
plan championed by Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, the
1996 bill broadened the subsidy program to include schools,
libraries and rural health centers. They were invited to apply for
grants to buy computer equipment, as well as for discounted rates
on Internet access charges.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance and local phone companies were to pay the bulk of
the cost, but cellular phone, paging and other telecommunications
companies would also pay in.
</P>
<P>
   According to congressional aides, lawmakers believed that
telephone costs would fall significantly because of new rules
designed to bring more competition to the long-distance and local
phone markets. As competition forced the phone companies to operate
more efficiently, money could be diverted to the subsidy program
without raising the nation's phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Residential long-distance phone bills have in fact fallen 5
percent or more since early 1996, at least partly because of
government-ordered changes in the way phone companies bill each
other and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, AT&AMP;T announced that it would not absorb the
cost of the new subsidies and instead would pass it to residential
customers. Starting July 1, a new line will appear on residential
phone bills showing a 5 percent surcharge on long-distance calls to
pay for the subsidy program. MCI followed suit with plans for a 5.9
percent surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than raise rates, the phone companies could have absorbed
the cost of the program ``in your ample profit margins,'' comlained
Senator Robert Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, in letters to AT&AMP;T and
MCI last week. ``Even more disturbing, you are now mounting a
public relations campaign to convince consumers that your price
increase is the equivalent of a tax. ... I am gravely disappoined
in the long distance companies' behavior,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich yesterday said the FCC had in fact turned the
subsidy program into a new form of taxation. ``It is wrong for five
unelected, appointed commissiners to be able to establish a tax on
every telephone line in the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairmen and senior Democrats on both the House
and Senate Commerce Committees have also called on the FCC to stop
collecting any money for the subsidy program, saying Congress never
intended to raise phone rates.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and FCC Chairman William Kennard have
issued statements supporting the subsidy plan, and President
Clinton hailed it during his commencement address at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech, Clinton cited a $1 billion pricetag for the
program, less money than many people anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC intially envisioned a $2.25 billion program, which
Kerrey said comes to less than 3 percent of the 1996 revenues of
the long-distance industry alone. The FCC later scaled the plan
back to about $2 billion, and it approved a plan to collect money
only for the first six months of the year, saying it would revisit
the issue this month.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has collected about $625 million so far. It will collect
$1.4 billion more this year unless it changes the size of the
program this week. Some long-distance companies have raised their
share of the $625 million raised so far by adding a surcharge to
business customer bills.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC may also vote on the mechanism by which phone companies
collect money for the program, such as the surcharge on business
and residential long-distance bills. In addition, the commissioners
may consider a complaint that local phone companies, taking
advantage of rules that force phone companies to pay each other
fees, have found a way to pass their share of the Internet program
to long-distance firms instead of to their own customers.
</P>
<P>
   The program's supporters say there should be no cutbacks in the
size of the Internet subsidies. ``If we lose this vote at the FCC
this week, we're down the tubes,'' said Lynne Bradley of the
American Library Association. ``It will show that the forces of
darkness are prevailing, that it's profits over kids and corporate
interests over our kids' education.''
</P>
<P>
   And in East Boston, any cutbacks could force parents and local
churches to make up the difference, or lose the Internet program
altogether. The school's primary source of money is tuition, and
after that it relies on local parishes for its budget, said Sister
Mary Jude Waters, director of school planning at the Archdiocese's
Catholic School Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every school across the nation is going to be a loser if this
doesn't come through,'' Waters said. ``With 30,000 applications,
there will be a lot of disappointed folks.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   FTC Suing Intel Over Tactics  
   
 By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Federal Trade Commission filed suit against Intel Corp.
yesterday, accusing the chipmaker of using its monopoly power to
bully computer companies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FTC, in a 3-to-1 vote, accused Santa Clara-based Intel of
punishing three computer companies by withholding vital information
about its Pentium microprocessors _ the brains that power more than
90 percent of computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   Intel wielded its monopoly like a ``nuclear bomb,'' said William
Baer, head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, which investigated
Intel. ``They can pull it out of their weapons arsenal, and they
win,'' Baer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the suit is narrower in scope than the action the
Justice Department brought against software-maker Microsoft Corp.
last month, Intel said the case threatens the core of the company's
business: its intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Federal Trade Commission is mistaken in
its interpretation of the law,'' said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   The basic facts of the case are not in dispute. Intel admits it
canceled agreements to share advanced information about its
next-generation chips with certain computer-makers when those
companies engaged in patent disputes with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has settled its lawsuits with Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's largest personal computer maker, and with
Massachusetts-based Digital Equipment Corp., a large workstation
and PC-maker. It remains a defendant in a suit brought in Alabama
by Intergraph Corp., a maker of computer workstations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central issue here is the law,'' Mulloy said. ``Is Intel
within its rights to withhold its intellectual property from
companies that are suing it over intellectual property?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  When Intel attained its dominant market share, it anticipated
heightened government scrutiny. ``We put 12 years into an antitrust
compliance program based on existing law,'' Mulloy said. ``Now it
appears the FTC is beginning to assert a new legal theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its claim, some
observers said, and even if the government wins, Intel may not be
hurt too badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No judge is going to say Intel has to give out its
intellectual property willy-nilly,'' said Joe Sims, an antitrust
attorney with Jones Day Reavis and Pogue in Washington, D.C.
``Assuming the government won _ which is a big assumption _ you're
talking about some kind of injunctive relief, some limits on the
circumstances in which Intel can withhold its intellectual
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers said the FTC may decide to file more charges
later. ``This is the narrow case,'' Sims said, noting that other
allegations against Intel may be more difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said that Intel faces a greater threat from a
changing marketplace than it does from government prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company you could argue is not doing well,'' said
Ken Pearlman, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer in San Francisco.
``It has not been able to grow its revenues last year or this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock price dropped 50 cents yesterday, closing at
$69.31. But, Pearlman said, that doesn't mean the FTC suit presents
a big threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anyone on Wall Street who thinks this
will have any impact on Intel anytime soon,'' he said. ``Intel is
very well equipped to deal with it. It has a huge organization and
a lot of experience with the FTC, and it's going to make sure
(this) doesn't have any effect on its business.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Intel needs to watch competitors like Advanced Micro
Devices of Sunnyvale and National Semiconductor of Santa Clara.
Those companies have stolen market share from Intel in the past
year by selling chips for computers that cost less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is expected to argue that such competition weakens the
FTC's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC is stepping into the middle of disputes between Intel
and its customers, which have had no effect on competition,'' said
Carl Shapiro, a professor of economics at the University of
California at Berkeley, who is working on Intel's behalf in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel certainly faces competition from AMD and National
Semiconductor,'' Shapiro said. ``What the FTC did (Monday) is
really unrelated to competition in the marketplace. I fail to see
how they're protecting consumers in doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the suit was widely expected, the FTC had remained mum
until yesterday, not even confirming its investigation. Intel had
disclosed in September that the FTC was probing its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the FTC's Baer said Intel used its clout in the
marketplace to create winners and losers in the workstation market.
Baer said the three cases show a pattern of Intel demanding that
its business partners sign over their patent rights _ and when they
don't, retaliating against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel used its monopoly power as a club to obtain licenses to
other firms' intellectual property,'' Baer said. ``Intel illegally
used its monopoly power to lock others out of the market. If firms
cannot protect their patented information from Intel, there is no
incentive for them to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel argues that the FTC won't be able to show that competition
was harmed by its actions or that Intel leveraged its monopoly to
grab a new market _ both key components of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   With companies like Silicon Graphics, Hewlett-Packard, Digital,
IBM, Compaq, Dell and others all making workstations _ large
corporate computers _ ``there are more choices in workstations
today than there ever have been in the history of that market,''
Mulloy said. ``There are 1,000 PC choices. Consumers have never had
more choices ... from the low end to the high end.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial will likely begin in three to four months. The matter
will be heard before an FTC administrative law judge, who must
issue an opinion within the next 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Intel will now interview witnesses and review documents. If it
loses at trial, it can appeal, first to the FTC and then to a U.S.
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   With sales last year of $25 billion, profits of nearly $7
billion, and a market value of more than $116 billion, Intel is the
largest company in the Bay Area. It employs 6,000 people in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   At lunchtime yesterday, dozens of Intel workers were outside
jogging or walking on the path that runs along the edge of the chip
giant's Santa Clara headquarters. None of those questioned would
discuss the FTC's suit. Some knew little about it, and others
simply declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has long been hailed as an innovative leader in the chip
industry, but some observers say that it is now a victim of its
success. ``The thing people love you for when you're small, they
hate you for when you get to a certain market share and size,''
said Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI, a San Jose market research
firm. ``There are certain characteristics that we love in toddlers,
but we don't want to see them in adults.''

FTC FILES SUIT AGAINST GIANT CHIP MAKER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chipmaking giant Intel Corp. has joined software titan Microsoft
Corp. squarely in the crosshairs of federal antitrust regulators,
though the government's case againt Intel differs significantly
from the charges lodged against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission filed suit against Santa
Clara, Calif.-based Intel, accusing the company of using its
near-monopoly on desktop computer processor chips to undermine some
of its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC charged that Intel withheld vital technical information
about its chips in an effort to punish companies that refused to
provide information on their own products. And in the case of
Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp., the FTC says that Intel
wielded this weapon after Digital had sued Intel for alleged patent
violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only issue here is Intel's use of that club that it had as
a monopolist, to force other companies to turn over their
intellectual property,'' said Willard Tom, deputy director of the
FTC's Bureau of Competition. ``They're attacking companies that
have competing intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has vowed a vigorous defense.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has an absolute right to control information
about its products. In addition, an Intel spokesman said that the
company only cut off companies that had filed intellectual property
suits against Intel, or were threatening to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prudent legal strategy is not to provide our intellectual
property to a company that is suing us over our intellectual
property,'' said Intel spokesman Chuck Molloy.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC complaint is Phase 2 of an aggressive federal campaign
to rein in the power of two computer industry titans, Intel and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the computer industry, the two companies collectively
constitute a duopoloy dubbed ``Wintel.'' Intel processor chips are
found inside over 80 percent of the world's desktop computers,
while Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft's Windows operating system is
found on about 90 percent of all computers sold.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that merely becoming a monopoly is no
crime. But they say that both companies have unfairly used their
power to crush rivals and force other industry players to do their
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust case filed against Microsoft last month by the
Justice Department _ the FTC and Justice share federal antitrust
oversight _ claims that Microsoft has incorporated Internet
features in its Windows operating system in order to destroy rival
company Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against Intel is different. The FTC cites three
companies that have been harmed by Intel's actions: Digital,
Intergraph Corp. of Huntsville, Ala., and Houston-based Compaq
Computer Corp., which will soon acquire Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, only Digital competes directly against Intel in the
chip business, with its powerful Alpha processor. And even there,
Intel isn't accused of trying to drive the Alpha off the market.
Instead, the FTC complaint alleges that Intel used vital
information about the functioning of its computer chips as a weapon
after Digital sued Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every computer maker must use Intel chips to manufacture
its machines. In order to bring new products to market quickly,
companies sign agreements with Intel that entitle them to detailed
specifications for present and future Intel chips. This information
is essential in order to design new computers that use the chips.
</P>
<P>
   If a company is cut off from this data, it could take it months
longer to design a machine using a new Intel chip. Meanwhile, rival
computer makers will already have brought their products to market.
Such a lag would be devastating to a company at the high end of the
computer market, where users insist on obtaining the newest
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Digital sued Intel for patent infringement, claiming
that certain features of Intel's Pentium chips were unfairly
derived from Digital's Alpha microprocessors. Intel responded by
cutting off Digital's information about future Pentium designs, and
by threatening to withhold Pentium chips from Digital. The threat
carried a lot of weight with Digital, a major producer of
Intel-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Digital and Intel settled their patent dispute out
of court. Yesterday, a Digital spokeswoman said the matter had been
resolved to the company's satisfaction. She refused to comment on
the FTC complaint, except to say that Digital is providing
information to the FTC under subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In another example of alleged wrongdoing, Intel stopped
providing technical information to Intergraph Corp., an Alabama
firm that makes high-powered engineering computers using Intel
chips. Intel took its action after Intergraph CEO Jim Meadlock
refused to hand over patented information about Intergraph chip
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They began to try to say if you want to participate in future
programs, you have to sign away your patent rights,'' said
Meadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph took Intel to court. In a dramatic early victory for
Intergraph, a federal judge ruled in April that Intel's chips are
an ``essential facility,'' similar to an electrical utility,
because computer companies can hardly do business without them. The
judge ordered Intel to resume providing technical information to
Intergraph. Intel has appealed the ruling. But the FTC sees the
Intergraph affair as one more example of Intel's abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, however, says that it only took action after Intergraph
claimed that Intel products had violated some Intergraph patents.
Mulloy said that Intergraph officials had approached some firms
that used Intel chips and threatened to sue them. These companies,
in turn, contacted Intel asking for protection against Intergraph
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on the verge of taking the customers to court,''
Mulloy said. ``We had every reason to believe at the very least
that we'd be brought into litigation along with our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts said that the FTC case has merit. ``I think
that Intel...was being extraordinarily aggressive,'' said Rich
Gray, an antitrust attorney with Bergeson, Eliopoulos, Grady &AMP; Gray
in San Jose, Calif. ``That wouldn't be a problem with a company
that didn't have market power, but it is a problem for a company
with market power.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gray also believes that Intel has a right to refuse to
share its intellectual property with some firms. He said that the
FTC should forbid Intel from cutting off a company suddenly.
Instead, Intel might be ordered to give a couple of years' notice
before taking such an action.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neil Motenko of Nutter, McClennen &AMP; Fish in Boston
raised a more fundamental question: Is Intel really a monopoly? He
noted that a variety of chipmakers, including National Semicondutor
and Advanced Micro Devices, have begun winning market share in the
desktop computer business. Indeed, Intel has had to slash its
prices and roll out a new line of cut-rate chips to compete with
the upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real question as to whether Intel has monopoly power
when they have to cut their prices,'' Motenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock closed yesterday at 69 5/16, down 1/2.

 AOL Buys Net Chat Company   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
America Online said yesterday it has acquired Israeli startup
Mirabilis Ltd. and its popular Internet chat technology for $287
million in cash.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deal is expected to extend the reach of the world's largest
online company and could pave the way for it to provide
telephone-like service over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis, a closely held Tel Aviv company, provides software
that lets people privately exchange instant messages over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 million registered users, its ICQ (short for ``I Seek
You'') real-time chat technology is second only to AOL's Instant
Messenger Service. AIM is available to AOL's 12 million subscribers
plus 70 million users of Netscape's Navigator Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Both services are free. But ICQ is considered the better
technology and is especially popular with overseas Web surfers, who
account for 60 percent of Mirabilis' subscribers. More than 50,000
copies of ICQ are downloaded from the Internet each day.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that provide free instant messaging _ which also
include Excite, Inc., E-Share and OnLive Technologies _ hope to
make money by selling advertising. But so far advertisers aren't
enthused, in part because the window where the messages appear is
very small _ less than 10 percent of the overall screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice, attractive feature for AOL to retain happy
subscribers,'' said analyst Jim Balderston, of Zona Research in
Redwood City. ``It's not necessarily about jamming in more ads, but
about strengthening the bond between AOL subscribers and the AOL
brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger of the two biggest instant messaging services worries
some industry observers because it will draw even more users to
AOL's site. To use instant messaging, both parties must be logged
onto the same service.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``AOL is cornering the market on eyeballs,'' said David
Cassel, editor of AOL Watch, a Berkeley newsletter. ``With this
acquisition, they have established the dialtone of cyberspace and
they already are the world's largest online service with 12 million
subscribers. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But AOL critics doubt that federal regulators will move to stop
the merger, since they made barely a peep when AOL took over its
largest competitor, CompuServe, last year.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Chairman Steve Case told The Chronicle he expects the deal
to accelerate AOL's international expansion.
</P>
<P>
   And he said it is ``conceivable'' AOL will meld voice technology
into its instant-messaging services, creating a cyber equivalent to
the phone system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a blurring between different forms of
communications,'' he said. ``We are as much a communications
company as we are a media company.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he declined to say when audio will be incorporated into
ICQ or AIM.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that AOL doesn't have enough network capacity to
provide voice communication. The Dulles, Va., company will have to
partner with a telecommunications giant to handle a glut of traffic
if it decides to add audio to its instant-messaging system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the purchase price, AOL will pay the owners of
the Mirabilis as much as $120 million a year over three years
starting in 2001, depending on Mirabilis' performance.
</P>
<P>
   AOL shares rose $1.50, to $84.75, in trading yesterday.

 UNDATED: at last.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports from Kano, the northern city where Abacha was born in
1943, said that thousands of people lined the streets, awaiting the
arrival of the general's body and an escort of senior government
and military officials who were to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what to think,'' a Kano businessman who had
closed his shop for the day told the Reuters news service. ``It's
true some people are sad, but some will not be so sad either. We
just worry over what comes next.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the question on many minds.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Abacha _ who wielded absolute power and was so
haunted by the specter of a coup that he surrounded himself with a
2,000-member personal security force, rarely appeared in public and
jailed or executed many leading Nigerians _ there was a political
vacuum Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The general left no clear successor. His former
second-in-command, Lt. Gen. Donaldson Oladipo Diya, who had been
seen as a possible successor, was sentenced to death by a military
tribunal in April for allegedly plotting a coup. His fate is still
in the hands of the military junta.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria's leaders gathered in Abuja in a body called the
Provisional Ruling Council, a behind-the-scenes power struggle over
the next few days seemed likely. Political analysts said the likely
contenders to succeed the general included Abubakar, the defense
chief; Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni, Nigeria's most senior officer, and
Maj. Gen. Ishiaya Bamaiyi, the army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of 45 Nigerian groups that had clandestinely
opposed Abacha called Monday for the installation of a civilian
government headed by Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was imprisoned by
Abacha after his election as president in 1993 in what was widely
seen as the country's most democratic vote since it gained
independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   While Abiola remains in prison, his wife, Kudirat, an outspoken
critic of the regime, was shot down in Lagos in an execution-style
killing in 1996 that has gone unsolved. Abiola's daughter, Hafsat,
23, a Harvard-educated resident of Maryland who works with the
Special Olympics, called on Monday for her father's release. ``It's
the end of an era, and I hope the end of military rule,'' she said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha has been the seventh and by most accounts most brutal of
the military dictators who have ruled Nigeria for 27 of its 38
years of nationhood. independence. Tucked into the elbow of
Africa's west coast, Nigeria was under British control for more
than a century before gaining independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   It is a nation of 250 tribal groups. The Hausa and Fulani in the
north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Ibos in the southeast
make up 65 percent of the population. The 1960s were marked by a
struggle for political dominance among the major ethnic groups, and
a devastating civil war almost broke the country apart in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s oil exports helped Nigeria recover
economically, and in the early 1980s, with a civilian government in
Lagos, Nigeria became known as a model of African democracy and
prosperity. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press
was one of the freest anywhere. Nigerian diplomacy forcefully
challenged the United States and Britain over issues like
apartheid. The nation's currency was worth twice as much as the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy in Nigeria died in 1983, and Abacha, a career
soldier who became an infantryman at 18 and attended military
colleges in England, the United States and Nigeria, had a role in
three military coups.
</P>
<P>
   When generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983,
it was Abacha who announced it on national television. In 1985, he
again went on television, this time to announce that Gen. Mohammed
Buhari was being replaced by Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. Later,
Babangida named Abacha as his defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a return to democracy were high in June 1993, when
Abiola, a millionaire businessman, won an election with pledges to
return Nigeria to civilian government. But Babangida annulled the
election, and three months later Abacha overthrew Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, frustrated over his stolen victory, declared himself
president in defiance of Abacha and was jailed on treason charges.
Abacha promised democratic reforms and an election in 1996 to bring
back civilian government, but the promises proved hollow.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing that he was stretching his rule to 1998, Abacha
began a virtual reign of terror. He cracked down on all political
opposition, subdued trade unions, took control of the press, jailed
hundreds of people and began a series of trials that sent opponents
to prison or the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa was executed on charges stemming from his campaign to
have Nigeria's huge oil revenues shared with the communities where
the petroleum was produced. The general's purges also reached out
to prominent Nigerians and into his inner circle, many fled into
exile.
</P>
<P>
   His iron rule drew wide condemnation in the West. While an
international oil embargo did not materialize, but limited economic
sanctions against Nigerian oil, which accounts for 80 percent of
its foreign currency earnings, were invoked. There were reports
that he and other military leaders were siphoning off billions from
oil.
</P>
<P>
   As the general became a virtual pariah in Western countries, he
was said to have turned increasingly for support to the Middle East
and to Asia, particularly China. At the same time, he became
increasingly isolated personally.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Wintel Showdown  
   
 By Julia Angwin and Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Both halves of the WinTel alliance _ Microsoft and Intel _ now
stand accused of unfair business practices by the U.S. government.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the case against chipmaking giant Intel _ brought by the FTC
yesterday _ is much less damaging than the case against software
giant Microsoft, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more on the periphery of Intel's business than the
Microsoft case, which goes to the core of its business,'' said
Nathan Brookwood, an analyst at Dataquest in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust enforcers at the FTC yesterday accused Intel of
unfairly withholding crucial information about its computer chips
from customers that challenged its patents. Antitrust enforcers at
the Justice Department and 20 states accused Microsoft last month
of unfairly including its Web browser in its leading Windows
operating system software.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, both cases appear to be similar government
actions against high-tech giants. But in fact, they are as
different as the button-down culture at Intel is from the younger,
feistier Microsoft style.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, 42, responded to the Justice lawsuit
with a nationally broadcast press conference. In strongly worded
remarks, he accused antitrust regulators of ``trying to promote
their ideas of software design ...and trying to punish an American
company that has worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Intel CEO Craig Barrett, 58, was traveling in Japan
yesterday and had no comment on the FTC lawsuit. Intel Chairman
Andrew Grove, 61, also had no comment. The Santa Clara company's
only official response was a six-paragraph statement from chief
counsel Tom Dunlap that addressed the legal merits of the suit in a
mild tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel intends to work through the administrative complaint
process and if necessary appeal to a federal court,'' Dunlap said.
``We believe that ultimately that process will conclude that our
actions are lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that Intel's understated reaction is also due to
the fact that it doesn't feel very threatened by the narrow scope
of the FTC lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the suit only focuses on information Intel
distributes to its customers rather than broader questions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This case doesn't go to the heart of the Intel development
and marketing machine,'' said Jack Russo, a high-tech lawyer in
Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The case also is not likely to resonate with the computer-buying
public in the same way as the Microsoft suit. Unlike the unassuming
Barrett, Microsoft chief Gates, the richest man in the country, has
attained a celebrity status. In addition, while almost every
computer user is familiar with Microsoft's software, relatively few
have opened up their machines to tinker with the Intel chip inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel case is not generating as much interest among Silicon
Valley consumers and workers as the hotly debated Microsoft case
did.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed yesterday knew little about the Intel
case. Those who were familiar with the charges were reluctant to
openly criticize their powerful Silicon Valley neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be applying for a job at Intel someday,'' explained
one engineer, who works for semiconductor equipment-maker Applied
Materials, just a few miles away from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   He and a co-worker were spending their lunch hour browsing
computer superstore T-Zone, a popular Silicon Valley shopping spot.
</P>
<P>
   His companion, also an engineer, said he agrees that Intel has
become too powerful, but hopes the government doesn't come down too
hard because he fears curtailing Intel could hurt the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel does have some unethical practices, but I don't want to
see the FTC put a crimp in the (computer) market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A technology marketer lunching at the Sandwich Construction
delicatessen across the street from Intel declined even to give the
name of his company, which is an Intel customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's our neighbor. They support the economy. They help
maintain property values. They employ thousands of people in the
Valley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Some said they prefer Intel, the home team, to the upstart
outsiders in Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel keeps quiet and it knows what it's doing,'' added an
electrical technician whose company sells chip-making chemicals to
Intel. ``Bill Gates does not keep quiet.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Netscape Puts Some Flash Into Web Browser  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Angling for an edge in its war with Microsoft, Netscape
Communications said yesterday it will incorporate animation
technology into an upgrade of its popular Web browser.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Starting this summer, Netscape Communicator will include the
Flash player, which lets users view animated content designed with
Macromedia's Flash software.
</P>
<P>
   Flash _ the latest incarnation of Macromedia's popular Shockwave
software _ is widely used to add animation to Web sites for movies,
television shows and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   The Flash player is currently available as a ``plug-in'' for
both the Netscape and Microsoft browsers. Web surfers must download
the player from the Internet and install it in their browsers.
Macromedia officials claim that 40 million copies of the Flash
player have been downloaded in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Netscape's move eliminates the need to download and plug in
the Flash player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates a big advantage for the Netscape user, who wants
to enjoy a really rich Web experience without having to go get a
plug-in,'' said Bob Lisbonne, senior vice president of Client
Products at Mountain View-based Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage might not last long. Microsoft plans to include
the Flash player (along with the Internet Explorer browser) in
versions of Windows 98 that come with new computers. Macromedia
officials said Microsoft also may decide to put the Flash player
into the upgrade version of Windows 98 sold in stores.
</P>
<P>
   The real winner in yesterday's deal could be Macromedia, which
has been trying to regain the heights it attained during the first
wave of Internet mania two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Macromedia was originally known for its programs that let
developers working on Macintosh computers design multimedia
software and games. The San Francisco company became a Wall Street
darling when Shockwave caught on as a tool for animating Web sites.
Macromedia's stock soared as high as $62.50 in the winter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of ill-advised acquisitions and softness in the
Apple Macintosh market led to four losses in the five quarters
prior to its last one. That, coupled with a deflation in the value
of Internet stocks, sent Macromedia's shares plunging to a low of
$7 in April of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Former Silicon Graphics executive Bob Burgess was brought in to
turn the situation around. He cleaned up the product line and
focused the company on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription may be working. In its latest quarter,
Macromedia showed a profit of 5 cents a share on revenue of $30
million. And its stock has doubled since late January, closing
yesterday at $16.13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are improving for them,'' said analyst Greg Vogel of
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``The new management is pretty
solid, they're doing the right thing in focusing on the Internet
and they have some products that are doing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Netscape may not give Macromedia's bottom line a
big boost, said Vogel, ``but it's a significant endorsement for
them.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Breaking the Sound Barrier  
   
 By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
How do you say ``love'' to a deaf person at the other end of a
phone? With a videophone _ and your arms crossed over your chest.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As video-conferencing technology improves, the deaf and
hard-of-hearing are enjoying new levels of communication with
distant friends and loved ones. Inexpensive videophones are
becoming good enough to permit signing, the most comfortable
language for many deaf people, as well as some lip reading.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the only way the deaf could communicate in real
time over long distances was typing into a teletype (TTY) machine,
which sends text messages over ordinary phone lines to a similar
machine at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Dirk Visser of Fremont has found videophones a great tool
for letting his deaf daughter, Zoe, communicate with her hearing
grandmother and deaf great-grandmother in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been real fun because our 4-year-old is now a participant
(in phone conversations), whereas before she was left out almost
completely,'' he said. ``Now, she's one of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The videophone also has had a big impact on the other end of the
conversation, Visser said. ``It's been real good for the older
folks. Her great-grandmother started crying when she saw how big
Zoe was and how well she was signing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Visser family uses a new videophone tailored especially for
the deaf and hard-of-hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced this spring by Santa Clara-based 8x8 Inc., the $399
VideoTTY Videophone connects to a standard camcorder camera, TV set
and touch-tone telephone to offer full audio and video over a
standard phone line.
</P>
<P>
   With a wireless keyboard (included), it also lets parties at
either end type messages, in addition to talking, signing and
gesturing.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgetta Bourne-Firl, a Newark resident and co-leader of the
famous student revolt in 1988 at Gallaudet University, the national
college for the deaf, said she was awed the first time she used the
8x8 videophone. She and her family called up her father, mother,
sister and sister's fiance in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of picture was not on the top of the world, but it
was amazing,'' she recalled. ``My sister, who is hearing, could
speak to my son, who is also hearing. My husband typed with my
father. My mother and I were signing to each other. All of us were
talking simultaneously _ wow! Also, I could show off my baby who
was growing fast.''
</P>
<P>
   When 8x8 introduced its original videophone in early 1997, it
had no thought of serving deaf customers. But then it hired Richard
Medugno to write copy for its Web page. Medugno had moved from
Toronto, Canada, to Fremont to enroll his deaf, 6-year-old daughter
in the renowned California School for the Deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Medugno worked on persuading company officials to produce the
VideoTTY version, so deaf users could do text chat as well as sign.
He now manages the product line, propelled by his personal mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deafness is so isolating,'' he said. ``If we can get (the
deaf) videophones, suddenly the world is open to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Medugno noted that his in-laws in Canada and his sister in San
Diego weren't about to buy a TTY machine, which costs from $200 to
$800, just to communicate with his daughter, who can hardly type.
But they were quick to buy videophones so that they could converse
with each other as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, his daughter now is part of the conversation. ``She
can sign `I love you,' show a missing tooth, show a picture she's
drawn or wish her grandfather happy birthday,'' Medugno said.
</P>
<P>
   Videophones put direct emotion back into conversations between
the deaf, said Ray Willingham, manager of the telecommunications
program for the Oklahoma Department of Rehabilitation Services.
Until now, they've had to simulate emotion over TTY machines with
phrases like ``LOL,'' for ``laughing out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Gendel, director of technical services for the New
York-based League for the Hard of Hearing, said many of the
agency's clients can't hear well enough to understand phone calls
but can follow a conversation over 8x8's videophone. They pick up
on visual clues, including lip movements, and can use text chat to
clarify any misunderstood words.
</P>
<P>
   The 8x8 videophone doesn't yet support fast enough video to
permit rapid signing. But with practice, deaf users can slow down
their signing and get their message across, said Susan McGee, a
researcher at the University of Arkansas. ``I prefer it to plain
TTY,'' she said. ``It's nice to be able to have the face to go with
the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaf people have several other videophone options if they don't
mind doing without text chat. 3Com sells the BigPicture TV phone,
based on 8x8's technology. C-Phone Corp. in North Carolina sells a
higher-quality videophone, but it costs $1,000 and requires a
digital ISDN line. And Fremont-based Advis has just introduced a
videophone called the AD-20, promising higher performance for
customers with two phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Many video-conferencing kits also exist for use with high-end
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Other new technologies, including two-way pagers and wireless
e-mail devices, also are helping the deaf communicate at a distance
and deal with emergencies without the benefit of voice.
</P>
<P>
   Many new digital phones permit short text messaging. Lucia
Erwin-Stowbunenko of San Jose uses her Pacific Bell PCS phone to
keep in touch with her deaf, 12-year-old stepson, Vincent. If
Vincent wants to stay over at a friend's house or forgets his lunch
at school, he need only tap out a short message on the phone's
keypad. And if any family members send him a message, a vibrator on
the phone will alert him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are amazed when you give a 12-year-old a cell phone,''
Erwin-Stowbunenko said. ``But for mom and dad, it's good knowing
he's OK.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Sources Say Intel Bullying Into 3-D  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Here's an allegation against Intel that the Federal Trade
Commission isn't investigating _ yet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two industry sources said yesterday that Intel has been trying
to muscle its way into the 3-D market by ``bundling'' its 3-D chip
_ the I-740 _ with its Pentium II microprocessor and Pentium II
chipset.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Intel has told Taiwanese PC vendors that the
best way to get large volumes of Pentium IIs is to buy them as a
package deal with I-740 3-D graphics chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to at least 20 companies at a trade show here, and
that's what they're saying,'' market researcher John Latta said
yesterday in an interview from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Latta is president of 4thWave, a market research firm in
Alexandria, Va., that publishes a newsletter for industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Peddie, a Tiburon-based chip analyst, confirmed some parts
of Latta's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwanese motherboard manufacturers are horny as hell for
Pentium IIs, and they may be accepting these bundle deals to get
more P2s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust lawyers say it can be anti-competitive if a company
with monopoly power bundles new products with its market-leading
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Peddie said he didn't think that Intel would be ``stupid
enough'' to do anything illegal. But he described Intel as a
newcomer to the 3-D market, trying to take share from S3, ATI,
Matrox, Cirrus Logic, Trident, 3DFX, Rendition and 3D Labs.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at one 3-D firm, who asked to remain anonymous,
told me that Intel's tactics have hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dinner with one (Taiwanese) customer the day after he
met with (a top Intel exec),'' the source said. ``Our customer said
he would have to buy Intel's 3-D graphics chip'' to get other Intel
chips.
</P>
<P>
   The executive has never complained to the FTC because he doesn't
think the feds can move fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said Latta is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bundling report is untrue,'' he said, rejecting ``any
inference there that there's some antitrust violation. We are very
careful with our (sales) policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldrop said the supply of Pentium II chips is increasing very
rapidly and that there is no shortage for Intel to take advantage
of.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Intel characterized the 3-D allegations as
``piling on'' by competitors trying to exploit yesterday's
antitrust news.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Here come da judge: &LR;  The FTC's antitrust case now goes to
administrative law Judge James Timony.
</P>
<P>
   Art Amolsch, editor of the FTCWatch Newsletter, described Timony
as an independent jurist who has been known to reject cases that he
feels are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Timony did several years ago, when the FTC voted to
file suit against the college football association, alleging that
it had restricted the supply of televised college football by
deciding which schools could sell broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timony said the FTC has no power over nonprofit groups, and
ultimately, his view prevailed,'' Amolsch said.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Timony ruled that New Jersey-based Toys `R' Us
had illegally tried to keep toy manufacturers from selling toys to
shopping clubs. That case is still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Personal notes: &LR;  The four FTC commissioners who debated
Intel's fate are a colorful lot. Their chairman is Bob Pitofsky, a
former Georgetown University law professor and expert on antitrust
law. It was he who engineered the three-vote majority in favor of
taking action against Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him was Sheila Anthony, a personal friend of Bill and
Hillary Clinton and sister of late White House aide Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Mozelle Thompson, a former Treasury official, cast the third
``Yes'' vote, leaving Orson Swindle, the commission's lone
Republican, to cast the single dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Swindle was the first national leader of Ross Perot's United We
Stand America group. A former Marine aviator, Swindle was shot down
over Vietnam and spent several years in a North Vietnamese POW
camp. His cellmate was John McCain, now a U.S. senator from
Arizona.

ANALYSIS: A LEAP OF LOGIC TO CLEAR A HURDLE OF FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also INTEL-FTC, INTEL-PRICE)  
 (JT)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The antitrust laws are designed to protect an industry from
monopolists that use predatory or other illegal tactics to
extinguish rivals. The odd feature of the antitrust complaint
brought Monday by the Federal Trade Commission is that it accused
Intel of victimizing putative rivals that are also customers.
</P>
<P>
   In separate instances involving the Intergraph Corp., the Compaq
Computer Co., and the Digital Equipment Corp., the Intel Corp. is
accused of withholding technical data about its processors from
companies that were designing computers around Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   What will make the government's case difficult is that only one
of those companies _ Digital _ ever seriously competed with Intel.
What is more, the information that Intel freely acknowledges it
withheld from those companies had no direct bearing on any area in
which they competed with Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The question, antitrust experts agree, is whether the commission
can create a strong factual case for its accusations. Given the
oddity of the charges, that task will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Intel controls more than 80 percent of the market for the
microprocessor brains of computers. When it designs a new chip,
Intel gives advance information to its customers _ computer
manufactures _ to give them time to design new machines that will
run the next generation of Intel's processors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel acknowledges that it withheld vital information from
Intergraph, Digital, and Compaq, with which it was engaged in
continuing patent disputes, but it says that it was not about to
share intellectual property with customers that were suing it over
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues that it is not compelled by the antitrust
laws to reveal proprietary information to customers who could
exploit that information in subsequent patent disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The commission says that while the three companies may have
indeed been customers, they were also rivals and that it is illegal
for a monopolist to exploit its market power to force them to cave
into Intel's patent demands.
</P>
<P>
   Intel insists that its hardball tactics were in pursuit of
business objectives that were perfectly legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute with Intergraph, for example, was a negotiation
between buyer and seller. Intel wanted a free license to use
Intergraph's chip technology. Intergraph wanted proprietary
information. Intel asserts that the government has no business
intruding on this negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Shapiro, an economics consultant to Intel from the
University of California at Berkeley, acknowledges that while there
might be areas of rivalry _ Digital, for example, produces a
microprocessor that competes with Intel's Pentium chips in a very
limited market _ but argues that the behavior under challenge by
the commission is overwhelmingly limited to the relationship
between the chip maker and its customers.
</P>
<P>
   William Baer, the director of the trade commission's Bureau of
Competition, says that it is unlawful for monopolists to injure
rivals without an efficiency-enhancing business justification _ for
instance, resulting in lower prices or better products.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Baer says, Intel's decision to punish the three
manufacturers was done only to compel the companies to settle their
patent dispute on Intel's terms.
</P>
<P>
   But to win its case, the commission must show that Intel not
only hurt rivals, if any of the three companies are in fact rivals,
but that it hurt competition within the microchip industry.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean proving that Intel's behavior drove its rivals
into extinction. It could mean showing that Intel's behavior
persuaded rivals to spend less on research and development, thereby
undermining their ability to innovate as fast as Intel. Or it could
mean showing that Intel's behavior convinced actual and potential
chip makers that they could not survive because any computer
company that needed to do business with Intel would be punished if
it also bought chips from Intel's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, the trade commission's case mirrors the suit the
Justice Department filed last month against the Microsoft Corp. In
that case, the government pointed to cross-marketing and other
exclusionary contracts between Microsoft and its partners that
would be perfectly legal by nearly any other company. But Justice
Department lawyers argue, with ample precedent, that those same
tactics are illegal when used by a monopolist to shut its rivals
out of a market.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the commission is saying that Intel's refusal to do
business in the midst of a legal dispute would be perfectly legal
in nearly any other context but that the same tactic is not legal
when embraced by a monopolist seeking to drive potential
competitors out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two cases will lie in facts, not
theory. In the Microsoft case, the government is offering evidence
that the software giant's contracts directly affected actual
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission, on the other hand, may be relegated to
proving a counterfact: that Intel drove away potential competition.
That is a hard case to win, especially when only one of the three
alleged victims was ever a significant competitor in any sense of
the word and all are among Intel's biggest and best customers.

Future may be now for `new' Argentina
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ortega takes over Maradona role
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ Call it Argentina, The Next Generation.
</P>
<P>
   Diego Maradona, the star-crossed superstar who remarkably has
been a part of every Argentine World Cup team since 1978, finally
has faded away. It was a difficult and often painful separation for
the superstar and the once-super team.
</P>
<P>
   Now 37, Maradona spent much of the past four years trying in
vain to return to form in time to make one more run at the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Argentine national team often tried in vain to
find the right mix of players that could continue the tradition of
greatness. Just in time for the grandest event of the quadrennium,
the Argentines finally think they've got it.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Daniel Pasarella, who took over the national team four
months after the 1994 World Cup, which Maradona left in shame after
testing positive for drugs, has his team on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   It took four years and numerous experiments. More than 70
players have seen service with Argentina's national team since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some humiliating defeats along the way, notably
a series of losses in 1995 to the likes of Israel and Morocco. The
United States drubbed Argentina 3-0 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The team seemed to lack direction.
</P>
<P>
   And the free-spirited Argentine players were not exactly
thrilled with Pasarella's banning of earrings and long hair, to say
nothing of his public scoldings of players he believed were living
promiscuous lives.
</P>
<P>
   But after settling on a roster and imparting much more
discipline to the team, the transition seems nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before today's World Cup opener, Argentina hit its
stride with victories over such powers as Chile, Ireland and Italy
and an impressive 1-0 victory over Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Argentina was drawn into what is essentially a
two-team group also could help build confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A strong Croatian team appears to be the only threat to
Argentina in Group H; Japan and Jamaica seem to be here only for
the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup definitely seems like a good time for the
emergence of previously overshadowed Argentine players such as
Gabriel Batistuta and young Ariel ``El Burrito'' Ortega, who was
given Maradona's No. 10 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Batistuta is well known in many parts of the world but always
has been a secondary thought to Maradona. What many fans might not
know: Batistuta actually has scored more career international goals
(39) than Maradona.
</P>
<P>
   And Ortega _ whose nicknamed means ``the little donkey'' _ is a
blur of energy who has grown into a leadership role. Throw in the
tough Juan ``The Witch'' Veron, and the Argentines again seem
capable of making a big World Cup run, with or without Maradona.
</P>
<P>
   The key match in the group should be the June 26 showdown with
Croatia in Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   The winner likely will win the group; the loser gets a tougher
road but likely still advances.
</P>
<P>
   And even in the head-to-head matchup with Croatia, Argentina
seems to have caught a break.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Croatian team was tabbed by many as a favorite for
the group but lost a pair of big goal-scorers only days before Cup
rosters were due.
</P>
<P>
   Alen Boksic, a veteran of more than 100 international matches,
including some in the former Soviet Union, injured his right knee
during training and will have to miss the Cup. Forward Davor Suker
was cut from the team by coach Miroslav Blazevic after the player
refused to do drills ordered by the coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Croats probably still will give fits to every opponent,
since they are one of the deeper teams in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Japan hopes to gain experience before it hosts the tournament in
2002, and the ``Reggae Boyz'' of Jamaica are only beginning to play
soccer at this level.
</P>
<P>
   But this grouping seems destined to be the start of something
big for Argentina.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Changing Your E-Mail `Reply To' Address  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Q:   Apparently my e-mail arrives at its destination with a 
 ``reply to'' address that is not my e-mail address. Instead it 
 is the address of my e-mail server. How can I get rid of it? I 
 use Outlook Express. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Outlook Express, Netscape Communicator and other e-mail
programs let you designate two return addresses in messages you
send: your regular e-mail address and a reply address. Ordinarily,
the two addresses will be the same. But a separate reply address
can come in handy if, for instance, you send someone a message from
work but you want the response sent to your personal e-mail account
at home (or vice versa).
</P>
<P>
   Use the following steps to change the reply address in Outlook
Express: Choose Accounts from the Tools menu, select your account
and click Properties. Tab to General, where you'll see a space in
which to enter a reply address. That's the place to enter a
separate address other than your regular e-mail address. If you
want both your addresses to be the same, leave the Reply space
blank.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; When I am on my home PC, how can I access my office PC &LR; 
 &LR; via modem? I have a Pentium with Win95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  There are several software programs that should do the job
for you, including pcANYWHERE from Symantec ($149) and LapLink from
Traveling Software ($124.95). Both programs can connect via modem,
local-area network or the Internet. Using a modem is the easiest
way to go, because all you have to do is load the software on your
PCs at home and at work. If you only plan to connect to your office
PC occasionally, consider Traveling Software's Remote DeskLink
($49.99). It offers many of the features of LapLink, although you
can't transfer files with it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go through your corporate network, make sure: A)
it's OK with the company; and B) they're able to configure the
network or intranet server so you can &LR;   &LR; access your office PC.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q: &LR;  In one of your columns you gave directions for blocking &LR; 
 &LR; the download of cookies for Microsoft Internet Explorer and &LR; 
 &LR; Netscape Navigator, but not for America Online and its browser. &LR; 
 &LR; Could you provide this, please? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Sure. Actually, the procedure is similar to the one for
Microsoft's browser, because AOL uses a version of Internet
Explorer. With the main AOL window open, choose Preferences from
the Members menu, then click the WWW button. Tab over to Advanced,
then scroll down until you get to the cookie options. There are
three: Always accept cookies; Prompt before accepting cookies; and
Disable all cookie use.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, for readers who don't know, cookies are tiny files
that Web sites download to your computer to keep track of
information about you, such as marketing preferences and passwords
for secure sites.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; When I point my mouse at the little monitor icon on the &LR; 
 &LR; Taskbar, a bubble pops up giving numbers like (640x480) 256 &LR; 
 &LR; color. What does this mean? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The message you're getting indicates that your display
resolution is 640 by 480 pixels, with 256 possible colors. You
might try increasing your resolution, which should improve the
quality of graphics. To do that, right-click an empty space on the
Windows desktop, choose Properties and tab over to Settings, where
you'll find the options for resolution and color. Try 800x600,
which is supported by all newer monitors.
</P>
<P>

RIGHT OF STATES TO EXTRADITE FUGITIVES IS UPHELD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.M., Ohio)   (Eds., Stevan, penultimate graf, is CQ.)  
 (JT)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ States have an unalterable duty to return other
states' fugitives, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in a unanimous
opinion that gave the New Mexico Supreme Court no choice but to
extradite an escaped parolee whom the state court had deemed to be
a ``refugee from injustice'' in the Ohio prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Even accepting as ``credible'' the fugitive's testimony that he
faced serious threats of injury at the hands of prison officials if
returned to custody in Ohio, the court said, ``this is simply not
the kind of issue that may be tried in the asylum state.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsigned, five-page opinion made no new law; Supreme Court
precedents dating to the 19th century have left states essentially
no discretion in extradition cases as long as proper procedures are
followed and the individual's identity and fugitive status are
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this was not an ordinary case. By a 4-to-1 decision
in September, the New Mexico Supreme Court acknowledged the weight
of precedent but declared that it would not give those cases a
``mechanical reading'' that would have the ``intolerable result''
of sending a fugitive ``back to face death or great bodily harm.''
The state court characterized the case as ``unique'' and said that
its reading of the federal and New Mexico Constitutions obliged it
to shelter the fugitive, Timothy Reed, from Ohio's extradition
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is a Lakota Sioux who became an active advocate for Native
American religious rights while serving a 25-year prison sentence,
for theft and robbery in the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility at
Lucasville. Under the name Little Rock Reed, his articles on Indian
affairs and prisoners' rights were published in national magazines
and circulated at academic conferences.
</P>
<P>
   After some delay, his parole was granted in 1992. Once freed,
Reed continued to write and speak critically of Ohio's prison
system and was ordered by parole officials to cancel speaking
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1993, six weeks before his parole was to end, Reed was
in a minor traffic accident in a borrowed car and paid a $105 fine.
He got into an argument with the car owner's husband, who
complained to parole officials that Reed had threatened him. The
incident led to a misdemeanor charge of ``terroristic
threatening.'' His parole officer ordered Reed to report to the
parole office and told him that he would be returned to the
Lucasville prison without a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New Mexico Supreme Court opinion, Reed knew, as
an experienced jailhouse lawyer, that U.S. Supreme Court precedent
gave prisoners the right to a hearing before their paroles could be
revoked. He believed that Ohio prison officials planned to violate
his rights, and his sources among the inmates told him that his
life would be in danger if he returned. He fled to Taos, N.M.,
where he worked as a paralegal and continued to speak out on prison
issues until he was arrested in response to Ohio's extradition
request in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While New Mexico officials wanted to return Reed to Ohio, the
New Mexico trial court, in a decision affirmed by the State Supreme
Court, granted him a writ of habeas corpus and barred his
extradition. The state courts found that Reed was not a ``fugitive
from justice'' but a ``refugee from injustice,'' in the State
Supreme Court's words, because ``the uncontroverted evidence shows
that he left Ohio under duress and under a reasonable fear for his
safety and his life.''
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that its
state court ruling threatened a ``profound expansion'' of the role
of states in extradition proceedings. Instead of automatically
rendering prisoners as demanded, New Mexico said, extradition would
become ``a process by which asylum states audit the functioning of
penal institutions in their sister states.'' Ohio, which was not a
party to the case, filed a brief signed by 39 other states,
including New York and Connecticut, that urged the justices to
overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court issued its ruling Monday, New Mexico vs. Reed, No.
97-1217, on the basis of the written briefs, without ever having
accepted the case for argument. Omitting nearly all the facts of
the case, the unsigned opinion quoted the Constitution's
extradition clause, which requires that a fugitive ``shall on
demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled
be delivered up.''
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1861, the court said, ``we held that the duty
imposed by the extradition clause on the asylum state was
mandatory.'' The opinion concluded that the Supreme Court of New
Mexico ``went beyond the permissible inquiry in an extradition
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Monday's ruling, the New Mexico Supreme Court
complied by revoking its earlier decision. Kay Bird, a spokeswoman
for the New Mexico attorney general's office, said that ``the
wheels are in motion'' to have Reed arrested and returned to Ohio.
Reed's lawyer, Stevan Looney, said he was trying to reach his
client and would have no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday night, which Reed initiated from
an undisclosed location in New Mexico, he said he planned to turn
himself in to Ohio authorities ``after I am confident that there
will be enough publicity that I will be treated fairly.'' He said
he expected to present evidence at a parole revocation hearing in
Ohio that he was forced to flee and that his flight should be
regarded as a minor parole violation. ``I want to clear this up,''
Reed said.

SUHARTO FINDS FRIENDS ARE FEW NOW THAT HE'S JUST AN EX-VIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Only his pet parrot still calls him ``
President.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, the man who led Indonesia with an iron hand for 32
years, celebrated his 77th birthday on Monday, in isolation and
disrepute, at his leafy central Jakarta home, The Jakarta Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Though Suharto viewed himself as a father to his nation, it now
appears that his power and respect were based mostly on the fear he
was able to instill. Since his resignation nearly three weeks ago,
Indonesians seem to have shucked off his memory with little
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   The accolytes who sought his company in the past now shun him as
the autocratic political system he created disintegrates in the
country's new atmosphere of openness and as the financial empire he
built begins to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he quit as president on May 21, few people sincerely
want to meet him,'' the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified
official who had worked with Suharto since the 1970s. ``It's
because closeness to Suharto, which often meant rewarding careers
or lucrative business deals in the past, has become a headache in
this reform era.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading journalist who observed him for years said Suharto was
reaping the harvest of a career based on personal manipulation.
``Suharto did not have a lot of friends,'' the journalist said.
``He always tried to buy people. He was a very cynical person.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, who remained
surrounded by obsequious retainers in his exile in Hawaii after his
ouster in 1986, nobody calls Suharto ``President'' any more, The
Post reported on Monday. His only reminder of past glory is his
trained parrot, which screeches, ``Good morning, President,''
whenever it sees him.
</P>
<P>
   His contingent of security guards will soon be reduced in
number, the newspaper said. Even now, the unidentified official
said, ``as he is no longer president, they do not give him a
military salute any more.'' And when he ventures out, the official
said, ``his car has to stop at red lights.''
</P>
<P>
   But he rarely leaves his home, according to local press reports.
A relative said he plays golf and jogs and a newspaper reported
that he had been seen visiting a mosque. Most of the time, The Post
said, Suharto sits at home watching television and reading
newspapers, a pastime that apparently upsets him.
</P>
<P>
   Television is filled with free-wheeling political chatter of a
style Suharto would never have brooked, and newspapers revel in
stories castigating him and his family for accumulating billions of
dollars in wealth. The Post said Suharto was considering holding a
news conference _ almost unheard-of during his presidency _ to give
his side of the story.

 IN THE SHKELZEN MOUNTAINS, Yugoslavia: always possible.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smolice, a few miles east of Ponosevac, is one of the
traditional strongholds of the rebels. It was an ambush there on a
Yugoslav army convoy on March 22 that Belgrade cited as its reason
for beginning the huge counter-insurgency campaign along the border
with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   As the rebels moved forward, the crash of heavy Serb artillery
boomed out, sending echoes through the narrow canyons. Two Serb
jets roared just over the ridge line, plummeting in fury toward the
valleys where the combat is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Distraught and stunned refugees, many of whom had been moving
toward Albania through the mountains for two or three days, sat
exhausted along the mountain path. Some 20,000 people have been
driven from their homes by the Serbs, and that number, according to
aid workers, is expected to double within the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Decani ``no longer exists,'' said Jusuf Vishaj,
71, as he sat with some 60 fleeing villagers on a gentle green
slope. ``It is just a name now. The Serb soldiers shelled it, came
in and looted our homes and then burned the town to the ground. We
fled to other, smaller villages, but the soldiers are just
repeating the tactic all along the border. There is nothing to eat.
We are constantly on the run. People are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidajete Viliaj, 26, cradled her 3-day-old baby girl, who was
born on the flight out of Kosovo. A woman, wounded by shrapnel, lay
next to the new mother clutching her head in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does not have a name yet,'' Mrs. Viliaj said of the baby.
``As soon as she was born I had to begin to walk again.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of new fighters, many ethnic Albanians from Germany
and Switzerland, can at best retard the scorched-earth policy of
the tens of thousands of Serb troops and special policemen deployed
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla force, despite the hundreds of volunteers and
impressive arms supplies, remains poorly organized, led by
commanders with little experience. Recruits receive desultory
training that rarely goes beyond showing them how to clean,
assemble and fire AK-47 assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are moving closer to the Albanian border by the
day,'' said a fighter, who like all the guerrillas refused to give
his name. ``The Serb artillery positions keep getting closer. The
routes in and out of Albania that a few days ago were safe and saw
heavy traffic have become dangerous and frequently attract fire.
The helicopters and planes often seem to know where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The column of rebels, who did not permit photos and refused to
say where they were headed in Kosovo, conceded that they were going
to reinforce other units holding villages surrounded by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Two massive stone peaks, perched above the lowlands that held
Decani and neighboring Kosovo towns, merged into a narrow gorge
that dropped swiftly toward the plain. It was here that the unit,
under the cover of darkness, intended to descend to fight the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the fading daylight two men walked up to the crevice to watch
the smoke billow from burning houses and search out the hilltops
below to pinpoint the Serb artillery. As they looked through
military binoculars the sharp crack of a sniper rifle tore through
the thin mountain air. The men turned and ran, leaping over rocks,
tumbling through scrub growth, but not out of sight of the Serb
sniper above them. Two more booms rang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs,'' said one fighter laconically, ``know we are
here.''

<P>
   PARIS _ After a quarter-century of one-man rule, soccer's world
governing body got a new president on Monday. If this had been a
soccer match instead of an election, the two candidates would have
received at least a yellow card warning for foul play during their
bitter campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, 62, a gregarious Swiss backed by the
United States, scored what many saw as an upset in defeating
Lennart Johansson, 68, of Sweden. Blatter prevailed by the
surprising margin of 111 to 80 in voting by the federation's
worldwide members.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter succeeds Joao Havelange, 82, of Brazil, who ran FIFA, as
the world soccer federation is known, with a combination of
autocratic rigidity and progressive reform. In 24 years as FIFA's
president, Havelange was credited with building the Zurich-based
organization from a fledgling operation in a private residence to a
worldwide force that oversees a $250 billion-a-year international
industry.
</P>
<P>
   With Blatter working by his side for 17 years and implementing
his programs as FIFA's general secretary, Havelange increased the
size of the World Cup, which begins on Wednesday, from 16 to 32
teams, introduced a World Cup for women, gained a place for women's
soccer in the Summer Olympics and built up marketing and television
rights fees to the point that each of FIFA's 204 national
federations will receive $1 million from the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter, who jumped into the campaign only several months ago,
said he would not deviate much from the path that Havelange created
in making the World Cup the world's most widely viewed sporting
event, one that remains independent from and dwarfs the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for continuity,'' Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
   To Johansson, that was the problem. For all his undeniable
success, Havelange has been accused by critics of running FIFA in
an iron-fisted, dictatorial manner and of gaining re-election five
times in part through favoritism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Johansson, the president of UEFA, the association of European
soccer federations, called Blatter a puppet of Havelange's and
campaigned for a more open, democratic and ``clean'' federation,
where many voices would be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be president of a system where one man decides
who gets what,'' Johansson said.
</P>
<P>
   His distrust of the voting process, and his fear that it would
be manipulated, was on full view Monday. Some 191 national soccer
federations had one vote apiece. Johansson wanted three members of
each federation to enter the voting booth together, so that the
delegate entrusted with the predetermined vote could not change his
mind secretly. He was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   He did succeed, however, in getting the votes counted in full
view of the FIFA congress, apparently concerned that ballots might
not be fairly counted in a backroom tally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he lost by a considerable margin. A two-thirds majority,
or 128 votes, was necessary to win on the first ballot, but when
Johansson saw how badly he trailed, he conceded, saying, ``The
game's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Johansson had the backing of Pele, the great Brazilian star who
had a falling-out with Havelange, and Johansson believed he had
sufficient backing in Europe and Africa to win. But he apparently
made two critical mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   One, he gave the impression to the United States and other
federations in the North American, Central American and Caribbean
region, as well to the South Americans, that he was too
Eurocentric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are former colonies of European countries, and we
don't want to return to that status,'' Alan I. Rothenberg,
president of the United States Soccer Federation, had said in
comments to Mexico, Jamaica, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, El
Salvador, Costa Rica and other regional partners.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg and Blatter worked closely when the United States put
on the hugely successful World Cup in 1994. Blatter insisted on
having Giants Stadium as a site and approved the use of instant
replay on scoreboards, as well as the experiment to grow natural
grass for use in the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that his victory will increase the United States'
chances of obtaining the World Cup again in the near future,
perhaps as early as 2010.

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS DEEMED MORE INCLUSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Subs for earlier story with today's developments)

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Southern Baptists who apologized for racism
three years ago have made major breakthroughs in hiring
African-Americans to key positions and are giving strong support to
the 2,700 predominantly black churches in the denomination, black
Southern Baptists said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That was the word during a meeting of the Southern Baptist
African American Fellowship held before Tuesday's opening of the
national Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into a new day, I believe,'' said the Rev.
Phillip Davis, one of several black leaders at the convention.
Davis recently was named director of a major thrust of Southern
Baptists _ creating new churches.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists apparently are serious about their
much-publicized 1995 statement in which they apologized for past
racism and pledged to be more inclusive in denominational
leadership, the black leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sincere effort to be more inclusive,'' said the Rev.
Joseph Lyles of Fort Washington, Md., president of the
African-American fellowship. ``The new thing is that they are
recognizing that we bring some contributions to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   African-American churches are among the fastest-growing segments
of the denomination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sid Smith, director of the African American Ministries
Division for the Florida Baptist Convention, said eight state
conventions of Southern Baptists have elected black presidents in
the past. The national denomination has elected three
African-Americans as vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people haven't kept up with where Southern Baptists are
today, they might think they are still holding to (racist) policies
of the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. E.W. McCall of La Puente, Calif., immediate past
president of the African American Fellowhip, agreed. He said the
denomination, founded in 1845 because of a dispute with northern
Baptists over slavery, is moving forward in racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress just in this last year,'' McCall
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted Davis' appointment and the naming of another
African-American, Franklin ``Jerry'' Burkett, as a vice president
of the North American Mission Board. Burkett supervises computer
technology with the mission board.
</P>
<P>
   Although no exact numbers are available, Davis said more and
more blacks are being hired in Southern Baptist state and national
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans are now getting positions besides those just
centering on work in black churches,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyles said not all blacks are open to the new inclusiveness of
Southern Baptists. When Southern Baptists offered their apology in
1995, some African-American church leaders said it was an attempt
to lure black churches away from their predominantly black Baptist
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans know how to be racist just as much as those
who are Euro-racist,'' Lyles said. ``We can't hold grudges. We need
to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tom Elliff, pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church
in Del City, Okla., and outgoing president of the denomination,
said Anglos and people of all ethnic backgrounds are slowly
learning how to work together in his denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we have a great deal to offer the world,'' he said.
``Separated we don't have much to offer at all.''

FASHION NEWS AND NOTES: 
SAINT LAURENT PASSES A REIN  
 FASHION AT PIER 94 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Certainly, several of the recent designer hires at
French fashion houses have been more sensational than the
appointment this week of Alber Elbaz as the designer and creative
director for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche. But none have been as
ripe with sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent is, after all, a legend, a living one, and a
monument of French culture. Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent's business
partner of almost 40 years, has continually suggested that no one
would ever replace the groundbreaking designer in his own house
while he was still alive. Amid the swirl of designer dust-ups, the
house of Saint Laurent seemed stubbornly determined to survive on
its memories.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Berge acknowledged that time had caught up with the
house. Saint Laurent, who is 62 and has become increasingly
reclusive, was relieved to be giving up the reins to Rive Gauche,
the house's ready-to-wear line, Berge said in a telephone interview
from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ready-to-wear in France has completely changed, and it was
difficult for him,'' Berge said. Saint Laurent, who Berge said was
unavailable for comment, will continue to design the haute couture
collection. Elbaz will direct the ready-to-wear, diffusion lines
like Encore and Variation and the licensed accessory lines.
</P>
<P>
   In his new position, to begin in November, Elbaz will report to
Berge. There was no thought, Berge said, that Elbaz would work with
the man whose name was on the door. ``I think he could be
paralyzed,'' Berge said of Elbaz, 37. ``I'm ready to accept what he
will create. He has wonderful technique, and he likes women. It's
not a question of replacing Saint Laurent; it's a question of
bringing something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Berge's head was turned by Elbaz's work at Guy Laroche. Elbaz
was at the Laroche studio in Paris Monday overseeing the production
of his last collection for the house, which hired him two years ago
from Geoffrey Beene, where he was the assistant designer.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz immediately stamped his imprint on the French line with a
fresh, light interpretation of a style that had become cloying and
out of date. His floor-sweeping, jewel-toned mohair skirts and
sweet embroidered tulle dresses buoyed up the beached house of
Laroche.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is consistent with the Saint Laurent esthetic. ``I
love that he makes women beautiful,'' Elbaz said, adding that he
had not yet met Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Morocco, a favorite inspiration of the older designer,
Elbaz grew up in Israel and moved to the United States when he was
25. His appointment to the house of Saint Laurent, with a
three-year contract, is not a dream come true, he said. ``It's my
only dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fashion at Pier 94  &LR;  Fashion will have another home in Manhattan
when renovations are completed on Pier 94, a 175,00-square-foot
space at 755 12th Ave. (at 55th Street). Formerly a parking garage,
the site, to be called the Unconvention Center, is to open on July
26 with the Collective, a men's-wear trade show produced by ENK
International. ENK presents some of fashion's premier trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   Elyse Kroll, the president of ENK, who has a financial interest
in the development of Pier 94, is overseeing the transformation
from garage to fashion center. The Unconvention Center is being
developed at a cost of about $3 million, Ms. Kroll said.
</P>
<P>
   The new space is a result of a two-year search that Ms. Kroll
undertook after presenting her shows primarily in hotels, like the
Omni and the Plaza. Accommodations for mid-size trade shows have
become scarce, she said. With the tourist boom, several city hotels
are now turning trade groups away, she said. Last year, ENK shows
were spread out over Piers 88, 90 and 92. ```Titanic' came out, and
all of a sudden the piers are fully booked with cruise ships,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In her search, Ms. Kroll turned for help to the city's Economic
Development Corp. The piers are owned by the city and leased to
private businesses like Port Parties and the International Terminal
Operating Co., which together will operate Pier 94 for a fee. &QL;

JAZZ COACH BRINGS CHEER TO PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Utah Coach Jerry Sloan came strolling onto the floor
as cheerful as a bluebird Monday. He stopped with a smile and said,
``Hello, everyone,'' with the glee of a morning show host.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the look of doom. The typically glum Sloan chuckled
as he called the film of his team's humiliating 96-54 loss to the
Bulls on Sunday in Game 3 of the National Basketball Association
finals a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get a couple of tables so our guys can lay back
in the training room and rest while we watch film, just in case
someone gets sick,'' Sloan said before the Jazz practiced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this was the best way to deal with disaster. If Sloan had
acted as if the Bulls were so superior to his team, the Jazz might
not have a psychological chance of showing up for Game 4 on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, as you know, a very competitive coach,'' John
Stockton said. ``He's ready to go again this morning. So we're
ready to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   So the Jazz spent Monday focusing on what it can do differently.
And that boils down to one simple goal: play intelligently. The
Jazz may not be as physically menacing as teams from the East, but
Sloan's players have succeeded against the Bulls by keeping their
heads no matter how much chaos Scottie Pippen and Chicago's defense
try to cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shut our pick-and-roll, but we had four or five shots
that, if we make those, it puts a different light on it,'' Sloan
said. ``We also have to take the shots. I think John Stockton got
over there and took one early, but then didn't after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to attack the basket and put it away or you lose
confidence. If a guy misses a layup, then it's, well, I can't make
a jumper.''
</P>
<P>
   More than missed shots, Utah missed assignments. The Jazz
players, slow to get to their spots on the floor, botched four
out-of-bounds plays that resulted in turnovers. On one, Greg
Ostertag threw the ball in. Ostertag? ``We never, in our last 13
years in Salt Lake City, have asked our center to take the ball out
of bounds,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 years, the Jazz also has not altered its pick-and-roll
formula. And Sloan is not going to start now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hide that we'll run certain plays and everyone knows
it,'' Sloan said. ``You've got to grit your teeth and be more
persistent in making it work. It's hard if you lose control because
of a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of playing under control is being patient under pressure.
If Bulls Coach Phil Jackson is going to unleash Pippen to roam the
floor, Stockton is going to have to make him pay with an illegal
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy comes across the lane and you go right to him, it's
not illegal, because he's come to help,'' Stockton said. ``By
maintaining your patience offensively and not charging right at
him, then he's across the line and it's very visible. Again,
there's no finger-pointing, except on us and how we executed. You
have to have the patience and the faith in your offense to take
care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   No one on the Jazz appeared to have lost faith after Game 3. No
one even appeared to lose sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time does the game start Wednesday, 8 o'clock?'' Sloan
said. ``All right, then, we'll try to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rodman AWOL Again  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ho-hum. Dennis Rodman missed practice Monday, and even hung up
on Coach Phil Jackson when he asked for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he showed up at the Palace of Auburn Hills in
Michigan, smoking a cigar in the ring alongside Hulk Hogan before
nationally televised World Championship Wrestling matches. ``This
is my home,'' Rodman told the crowd. ``I won my first championship
in Detroit. You have no choice but to love me.''
</P>
<P>
   The league fined Rodman $10,000 for failing to show up for
interviews, and Jackson was expected to fine him an additional sum.
But no further punishment was planned. The Bulls have learned to
accept these kinds of escapades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands he has a lot of trouble concentrating on
the mundane part of this game,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Inspired by Anger  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz was seeking some motivation for Game 4, so some players
pointed to the scoreboard, claiming the Bulls ran up the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were having a good time and they were obviously still
taking 3-pointers when the game was well out of hand,'' Karl Malone
said. ``Our coach would have a fit if we did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the game handed to us without a doubt. So you give
credit for that. But if this can't get you motivated, nothing else
can.''

SOUTH KOREAN CHIEF URGES U.S. HELP FOR ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea told New York
business leaders Monday that his country's once-prized economic
miracle was nothing but a ``house of cards'' and that his people
now needed U.S. help to rebuild the economy in a more Western
image.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, a former dissident who assumed the country's highest office
in February, lashed out at his predecessors for creating an economy
characterized by collusion and corruption. Now, he said, South
Korea has turned decisively to democracy and it has opened its
borders to foreign investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest purpose in coming here,'' he said, ``is to plead
with the American government and businessmen to invest in South
Korea, to tell you that we are doing everything we can to open''
the economy. He joked with an audience of executives, diplomats and
scholars at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, saying,
``If each of you today could invest just $100 million, that would
be a great help.''
</P>
<P>
   Once one of Asia's most successful growth machines, South Korea
has been a major victim of the economic turmoil that has swept the
region. Last year, the International Monetary Fund arranged a $58
billion rescue package. Since then, the country's foreign-currency
reserves have rebounded sharply and interest rates have stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   But Seoul is scrambling to find a solution to its huge
private-industry debt problems, which have crippled financial
institutions and bankrupted several leading conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who is in his 70s, looked haggard during back-to-back
appearances Monday, beginning with breakfast at the New York Stock
Exchange. He walked stiffly and stayed seated during a question
period after cutting short his lunchtime speech. Later, he left for
Washington, where he will meet with President Clinton and top
economic advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim was energetic in promoting his government's friendly new
attitude toward foreign business. He stressed that he had committed
South Korea to open capital markets and relaxed investment rules as
the cornerstone of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of New York's top business leaders turned out to hear the
president's remarks, including Sanford Weill, chairman of Travelers
Group; Jon Corzine, chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., and Maurice
Greenberg, chairman of American International Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said all the right things _ very direct, very positive,''
said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
``It will take some time for businesses to respond, but the
direction is right on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim outlined new rules that permit hostile takeovers of Korean
companies. Foreign executives can now run South Korean companies
and foreign investors can own land on the same terms as Koreans, a
first for a country that long maintained one of capitalist Asia's
most protectionist economies.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have contended that Kim has stalled on a basic
economic overhaul and allowed old practices _ including bailouts
for the some of the country's biggest companies instead of allowing
them to fail. But the president insisted that he was going forward
with a ``full-scale restructuring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He recited a list of measures straight out of the International
Monetary Fund's guidebook: abolish cross-guarantees of debt among
related companies; require better disclosure and accounting
standards; give shareholders more power; force companies to focus
on core businesses rather than peripheral investments.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his welcoming attitude toward foreign investment,
Kim said he considered Dow Chemical Co.'s decision to build a $1
billion plant in Malaysia instead of South Korea a ``serious
mistake,'' adding that his government would not allow bureaucratic
resistance to derail important foreign investments in the future.

BULLS' ENSEMBLE ORCHESTRATES A RECORD VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Scottie Pippen was buzzing John Stockton like an
annoying gnat in the backcourt, filling the passing lanes the way
Coach Jerry Sloan wishes his players would and taking a charge from
Karl Malone under the basket. On the next Utah Jazz possession,
Pippen caused more havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is probably the only guy in basketball who draws offensive
fouls anymore,'' Sloan said on Monday. ``He had a ton of them last
night, I think eight or nine. That was about as good a display of
being able to step up and take a charges as you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Carr, the veteran Jazz forward, added, ``Scottie is
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, a roving linebacker in high-tops, is using the finals to
reaffirm his position as the game's most complete and
chaos-inspiring defensive player. On Sunday night, he was largely
responsible for the lowest scoring total in National Basketball
Association history since the advent of the shot clock, when the
Chicago Bulls pulverized the Jazz, 96-54, to take a
two-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen roamed the floor, spreading his 6-foot-7-inch angular
body from player to player on the Jazz roster. Twenty-six Utah
turnovers and an unprecedented finals rout later, everyone wanted
to know how one player could cause such disruption.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jazz practiced at the United Center on Monday, Sloan
was asked whether Pippen was guilty of defending illegally _
guarding the ball instead of his man _ a violation punishable by a
technical foul after a warning. Sloan, perhaps Chicago's greatest
defender before this current group of Bulls made their mark, would
not take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear them call it, so I guess there was no illegal
defense,'' he said. ``I think floater is the right word. Pippen is
floating, and a lot of people didn't recognize it. We didn't adjust
to it. It's not like we had time to stop the game and practice on
it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was also the subject of a diatribe by Larry Bird, the
Indiana Pacers' coach, after the first two games of the Eastern
Conference finals. Bird wanted to know why Pippen was allowed to
bump and push a smaller, less-athletic player like Pacers point
guard Mark Jackson and not get called for fouls.
</P>
<P>
   On or off the floor, he is distracting his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michael is out there on the court, I look to be more
aggressive defensively because I feel that I can create things on
the defensive end that he can do on the offensive end,'' Pippen
said on Monday, referring to how he complements Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There is no great secret to Pippen's success. His long arms,
agility, timing and instinct are more responsible for Chicago's
defensive success than any pre-game chalk diagram. Pippen has been
disrupting offenses for as long as he has been in the league.
</P>
<P>
   He has obliterated the criticism he once received for not being
physical enough. This post-season alone, he shut down Charlotte's
Glen Rice in the second round and discombobulated the Pacers'
offense in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas everyone remembers Steve Kerr's game-winning shot in
Game 6 of last season's finals against the Jazz, few recall what
happened moments later. Pippen deflected the inbounds pass on the
other end to Toni Kukoc, who dunked to seal the victory and
Chicago's fifth title.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be the best defensive player playing,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense of Pippen, Jordan and Ron Harper has snipped Utah's
pick-and-roll play in half, defending the offensive staple of
Stockton and Malone like no other team has done this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to corral them on the side and give some
rotational help on different spots, and Scottie happens to be a guy
that we're able to do that with,'' said Jimmy Rodgers, the Bulls'
assistant coach. ``Some guys have range on their shooting ability;
Scottie has some great defensive range. He can cover a lot of
ground out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used him a little bit in a halfcourt trap last night, and
he was still able to get back and find people on the baseline. He's
the X-factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz guard Jeff Hornacek said: ``They're pushing the
pick-and-roll. We handled it in Game 1 when John was driving to the
baseline and getting the shot off right then. Now, with Pippen
running all over the place, they can afford to push John, and the
big guy can step out on John a little more and get a trap on him.
And Pippen can go fill the passing lanes. He's roaming out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out a way to get around that. If we do that,
we'll be able to execute our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   And if they cannot, the Bulls will win yet another championship
at the Jazz's expense. Jordan is on his way to scoring more points
in the series than anyone and would most assuredly be named the
finals' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, meanwhile, will assume his usual role as a cog in the
machine, the guy who pokes the ball away on the defensive end so
everyone else can get the credit.

   BC-CORRUPT-SHERIFF-NYT (moved on Sunday, May 31)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday May 31,
about a small-town Alabama publishing couple who exposed corruption
by a county sheriff misstated the sentence received by the sheriff,
Roger Davis of Marengo County, for extortion. It was 27 months in
prison, not 27 years, and is to be served concurrently with another
27-month sentence, for soliciting a bribe and failure to pay state
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the age of the editor and publisher,
Goodloe Sutton of the weekly Democrat-Reporter in Linden. He is 59,
not in his late 40's.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the article referred imprecisely to the timing of a
Democrat-Reporter article about Sheriff Davis's use of county money
for an all-terrain vehicle for his daughter. That article was
published after the sheriff had repaid the money, not before.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the process by which the sheriff took
money from the county mental health center. He had the center write
a check to him for each mental patient who was transported by
sheriff's deputies; he was not cashing checks that had been
intended for the center.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the circulation of The
Democrat-Reporter. It is 7,125, not 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   BC-INTERNET-U.S.-NYT (moved on Friday, June 5)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, June 5,
about the management of Internet addresses misstated the year that
the suffix ``.com'' was introduced for commercial enterprises. It
was 1985, not 1990.
</P>
<P>
   BC-PLUNDERED-ART-NYT (moved on Thursday, June 4)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, June 4,
about a pledge by American museums to search their collections for
artworks taken illegally from owners in the Nazi era misstated the
name of the group that announced the plan. It is the Association of
Art Museum Directors, not the Association of American Art Museum
Directors.
</P>
<P>
   BC-KURT-FILM-REVIEW-NYT (moved on Thursday, June 4)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, June 4,

Courtney'' included an incorrect given name, provided by the
production company, for the producer. She is Michele D'Acosta, not
Michael.

<P>
   A. Arthur Gottlieb, a biologist and immunologist who formed his
own biotechnology company, died on Sunday at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston. He was 60 and lived in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a blood clot that lodged in his lung

Sen. John McCain, left, with Attorney General Mike Moore of
Mississippi, W. Steve Bozeman, Richard Scruggs and Steve Mitchell.
The issue of lawyers' fees has been the focus of intense
controversy in states that have settled lawsuits against cigarette
makers. But now the debate has also erupted in Washington, where
Congress is considering federal legislation that will resolve many
tobacco lawsuits and allow the government to regulate nicotine.

William Baer of the Federal Trade Commission displays the insides
of a computer at a news conference held Monday to discuss the
agency's decision to file an antitrust suit against Intel. At the
core of the government's charges is the assertion that Intel's
pattern of withholding technical data as a weapon in patent
disputes stifles innovation in the microprocessor industry, thereby
enhancing Intel's dominant position. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times

   (NYT11) CARLISLE, Mass. -- June 8, 1998 -- DAIRY-PRICES, 6-08 --
Mark Duffy's dairy farm in Carlisle is part of a dairy price
agreement that could spread beyond the six New England states. The
agreement guarantees dairy farmers a higher price for drinking milk
than the one dictated under the system the federal government has
been using to set farmers' milk prices since the depression. (Keith

   (NYT10) UNITED NATIONS -- June 8, 1998 -- CLINTON-DRUGS, 6-08 --
Addressing a special summit-level session of the General Assembly
convened Monday to discuss ways to counter drug trafficking and
use, President Clinton says that pointing fingers has not advanced
the fight against drugs. ``It does not dismantle a single cartel,
help a single addict, prevent a single child from trying and
perhaps dying from heroin,'' he says. (Ruby Washington/New York

   (NYT9) NORCO, La. -- June 8, 1998 -- OIL-REFINERY, 6-08 -- Jack
Stanley, owner of TransAmerican Energy Corp., is converting this
1,000-acre refinery on the banks of the Mississippi into a fully
functional facility. ``There's $2 billion worth of equipment
here,'' he says. By the end of the summer, the towering coking and
cracking units are expected to be going full blast, converting
230,000 barrels of crude oil a day into kerosene, diesel fuel,
heating oil Q and 5.5 million gallons of gasoline. (Lee Celano/New

Marty Pottenger, carpenter and writer, in ``City Water Tunnel No.
3.'' Ms. Pottenger, who spent 20 years in the building trades,
gives new meaning to ``underground theater.'' Embroidered by video
scenes of the tunnel in progress and the actress's compassionate
impressions of laborers, engineers and bureaucrats, the performance
piece consists of vignettes illuminating aspects of the vast
project, begun more than 20 years ago. (Sara Krulwich/New York

Foxworth as an unfaithful husband and Jane Alexander as his wife in
``Honour,'' which closes Sunday at the Belasco Theater, becoming
the first casualty of the Tony Awards ceremony. The play had 57
regular performances and 28 previews. Producers for several other
shows that had hoped in vain for a Tony to bolster sagging ticket
sales met Monday to crunch numbers and decide whether to close as
well. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) HOLLYWOOD -- June 8, 1998 -- CALIF-EGYPTIAN-THEATER, 6-08
-- A Pharaonic icon oversees the work of painters on the exterior
of Grauman's Egyptian Theater recently. Like Times Square,
Hollywood Boulevard is staggering toward a comeback. And the
Egyptian, with the phoenix motifs sprinkled throughout its still
grand skeleton, is rising from the ashes as well. The theater will
be the new home of the American Cinematheque, a local film
preservation group that plans to use it for screenings of classic
movies. (Marissa Roth/New York Times Photo) *LITE

   (NYT5) NEW YORK -- June 8, 1998 -- AGENT-PROFILE, 6-08 -- Flora
Roberts has guided the careers of some of the theater's top
writers. She is one of the last of the red-hot play agents, a
fiercely independent woman who has gone her own way in a world
dominated by corporate agencies. In a career of almost 50 years,
she has been a formidable talent spotter, artful in her choice of
clients Q such as Stephen Sondheim, Tina Howe and Alfred Uhry.
``I'm very rough on clients,'' says Ms. Roberts.(Jack Manning/New

Rafael Cancel Miranda gestures towards some of the mementos that
hang in his home. Cancel Miranda and his three nationalist
compatriots who in 1954 etched their names in infamy by storming
the U.S. House of Representatives, unfurling national flags and
opening fire with pistols. Five lawmakers were wounded as they
dived under their desks. He served 25 years in jail before he and
the others were pardoned by President Carter. (Steve

early 1980s for a campaign of bombings and robberies and conspired
to use force to bring to an end the U.S. stewardship of Puerto
Rico. ``I have no regrets for serving a noble cause, but ... there

Cancer Center at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond,

likely fatal form of cancer. ``Ninety-nine percent of patients will
say, 'Tell me everything,''' says Smith who works to improve
communication between doctors and dying patients. (Timothy

<P>
   Trading Hakeem &QL; 
would be senseless
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ As the NBA Finals take a merciful two-day break to allow
the Jazz to try to pick up the pieces, two questions dominate the
buzz around the league:
</P>
<P>
   Could Utah possibly play worse if blindfolded?
</P>
<P>
   Would the Rockets even consider trading Hakeem Olajuwon?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to both is, well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Let Jerry Sloan worry about the Great Salt Fakes. Of immediate
concern is whether I'll be able to take more than two steps in the
next couple of days without hearing another Olajuwon trade rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem for Penny Hardaway and Bo Outlaw. Hakeem for Juwan Howard
and Calbert Cheaney. Hakeem for Stephon Marbury. Hakeem for Shareef
Abdur-Rahim. Hakeem for two Cubs tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out there,'' said one NBA general manager in town for the
pre-draft camp for rookies. ``But I don't know how serious they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious enough for us to address the notion, which can be done
in this very simple fashion:
</P>
<P>
   Dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Panicky.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Misguided rationale
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the Clinton administration's shipping off satellite
secrets to the Chinese. This is real treason. And it needs to be
nipped in the bud, even if we do get the usual raft of denials.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of this magnitude don't spring out of nowhere. Somebody
in the Rockets organization has, at the very least, decided to toss
Olajuwon's name out into the marketplace like high-priced chum,
then watch the hungry sharks come swimming. First, they make him
wear that clown-suit uniform. Now, they want to peddle him like a
corn dog at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Your candidates: executive vice president of basketball Carroll
Dawson; senior executive vice president of basketball affairs
Robert Barr; head coach Rudy Tomjanovich; and owner Leslie
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody here has decided that one subpar season that began with
surgery on his left knee and ended with a first-round playoff loss
to the Jazz means that Olajuwon, at 35, no longer has the stuff to
take the Rockets back to the level of championship contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wants us to believe that because Olajuwon decided to
take off for a vacation in the Caribbean, delaying a heart
examination and possible surgery on his right knee, he is no longer
committed to returning to his previous level as one of the top
centers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a news flash: Even after scoring a career-low 16.7 points
a game in 1997-98, Olajuwon still is one of the best centers in the
NBA. Who would you rank ahead of him right now? Shaquille O'Neal.
Maybe David Robinson. It's a short list.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would trade Olajuwon also believe the $44 million in
salary the Rockets will owe him over the next three years is a yoke
around the neck of the franchise and that it is time to move on and
rebuild completely.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are said to be looking very hard at Alief High
prospect Rashard Lewis in the draft. Put him alongside Abdur-Rahim,
and you could argue the Rockets might be hitting their championship
stride again in a few years, just when a new arena might be on the
horizon in downtown Houston. If Abdur-Rahim can carry a franchise.
If a high school kid can make the leap to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   A legend deserves better
</P>
<P>
   This is where you might suspect Alexander to be behind the
rumors. I have two names for Les: Nolan Ryan and John McMullen.
Don't mess with our legends.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the coaching staff behind the rumors, it would be a
disappointing case of blame-shifting and finger-pointing at the
player who took them all on two wild, heady championship rides. If
Hakeem is to be held responsible for one bad year, what about the
staff that assembled this underachieving team?
</P>
<P>
   Work him, prod him, goad him into a strenuous offseason rehab
program. Don't just give up on him. Not now. Not after what he has
been _ a splendid athlete and an honorable man.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody knows about loyalty and representing one franchise
for an entire career, it would be Rudy T. And if anybody could ever
share Rudy's title as Mr. Rocket, it should be Olajuwon. For 14
years, he has been the heart of this franchise, the sports pulse of
the city. Those championships were his, then theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that tripe about avoiding the trap of the fallen Celtics.
They had two great young talents _ Len Bias and Reggie Lewis _ die
on them and also hired a fool in M.L. Carr to be their coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won five titles in the '80s, never hit bottom, and
all of those Hollywood heroes _ Kareem, Magic, Worthy _ retired in
LA uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon deserves the same. Anything less would be a bad ending
to a Dream.

HAROLD SEGAL, 77, ACE FIGHTER PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Segal, a Marine fighter pilot who shot down 12
Japanese planes in World War II, three of them in a single duel
that ended with his being fished out of the Pacific Ocean by an
American destroyer, died on Wednesday at his home in Scottsdale,
Ariz. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1944, more than 500 people, including Army, Navy and
Marine officers and the Manhattan borough president, Edgar Harvey
Jr., gathered at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York to honor Segal,
a former art student from New York, on his triumphant return home.
The Marine ace and winner of the Distinguished Flying Cross had an
extraordinary tale for them.
</P>
<P>
   The odds had been overwhelming back on July 11, 1943, when Segal
and seven other pilots from Marine Flying Squadron 221 had taken
off in single-engine Corsair fighters that the Japanese called
Whistling Death to escort American bombers over Rendova island in
the Solomons. Then six pilots returned to base with faulty engines,
leaving only Segal and Capt. James Swett to continue the mission.
</P>
<P>
   When they spotted at least 40 Japanese Zero fighters and bombers
at 25,000 feet, Swett, who would win the Medal of Honor for having
downed seven Japanese planes in a single encounter the previous
April, dived toward the bombers. Segal, a lieutenant, followed in a
fighter he had named Ruthie in honor of his mother. The Zeros then
got on the Americans' tails, but just as one opened fire on Swett,
Segal shot it down.
</P>
<P>
   Before pulling out of his dive, Segal spotted two Zeros to his
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught the top Zero first,'' he reported soon afterward.
``He blew up like matchwood. The second Zero never knew what hit
him. My dive practically carried me into his cockpit with all guns
blazing. He hit the sea a mass of flaming wreckage.''
</P>
<P>
   While passing through a layer of Japanese bombers on his dive,
Segal's plane was hit by a long burst of fire. Four Zeroes then
pursued him, and two peppered his plane, sending it plunging into
the Pacific, 10 miles off New Georgia Island, at 110 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   His plane sank in 20 seconds, but his injuries were minor: a
broken nose, two cracked front teeth and a cut on his upper lip. He
freed himself, inflated his life jacket and spent 22 hours in the
ocean, killing a sea gull for his only source of food, before being
picked up by a destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was waving and yelling but the ship passed him by,''
Segal's son, Robb, recalled. ``A man on the end of the boat then
looked back and happened to see him. The ship had orders not to
turn around for anyone, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   The destroyer hauled Segal in with a rope and let him off on
Guadalcanal. He tried to learn the identity of the sailor who had
spotted him, hoping to offer thanks for saving his life, but he
never got the man's name.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Edward Segal was born in Chicago but moved with his
family to the New York area as a youngster. He graduated from
Lawrence High School in Cedarhurst and studied art at the Pratt
Institute in Brooklyn before enlisting in the military in September
1941.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge in 1946, he was involved in real estate in
Los Angeles. He later retired to Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, of San Gabriel, Calif., he is survived
by a daughter, Laurie Nadershahi of Scottsdale; a brother, George,
of New York City, and four grandchildren. His marriage to the
former Patricia Heselton ended in divorce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Upon his return home in 1944 as a captain, he was introduced to
reporters at the Marines' public relations office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he was able to survive after having been shot down, he
replied, ``A man named God was sitting beside me.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow pilots nicknamed him Murderous Mannie after his
exploits on July 11, 1943. As his son explained it, ``His father's
name was Mannie, and Murderous Mannie sounded a lot tougher than
Murderous Harold.'' The sobriquet stuck over the years, but Segal
came to be amused at the fuss that had been made over his heroics.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Col. R. Bruce Porter, himself a Marine air ace in
World War II, remembered what Segal had said a few years ago when
asked how he managed to down three Zeros that day in July 1943.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't shoot them down,'' he said. ``They just got in
my way when I was going home.''

END OF THE BRAWLEY CASE MAY BE IN SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ After nearly seven months of bitter
confrontation, legal wrangling and bizarre courtroom behavior, the
Tawana Brawley defamation case appears to be stampeding toward a
close.
</P>
<P>
   Alton Maddox Jr., the one of the three defendants who is
representing himself, rested his case Monday. Another defendant, C.
Vernon Mason, plans to present his case with only two witnesses on
Friday. Jurors could hear closing arguments by late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who had vowed ``a long hot summer in Dutchess County''
and promised to call about 20 witnesses, finished his examination
after putting only four people on the stand to counter the
plaintiff, Steven Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did a wonderful job,'' Maddox said to reporters
outside the courthouse Monday. ``That's why we rested today. We
have not only shattered his case, we have given the jury some
insight as to some of the things that happened to Tawana Brawley.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones, a former assistant district attorney, is suing Maddox,
Mason and the Rev. Al Sharpton, advisers to Ms. Brawley, for
publicly accusing him of kidnapping and raping her, a black
teen-ager, over the course of four days in 1987. A grand jury later
found that there was no evidence to show that Ms. Brawley had been
attacked, and it specifically exonerated Pagones. He sued the three
men for defamation and is seeking about $400 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial began on Nov. 18, the case has staggered through
29 witnesses and three seasons. In contrast, the state's second
death penalty trial, unfolding in the same building two flights up,
whipped through 13 witnesses in its first week. Prosecutors in the
Dalkeith McIntosh trial joke that they will be finished before
Pagones hears a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trial has been lengthy, the judge, Supreme Court
Justice S. Barrett Hickman, has kept it from being even longer. He
pared Maddox's original list of witnesses _ precluding testimony
from two former talk show hosts, Geraldo Rivera and Phil Donahue,
for example _ and limited the subjects about which Maddox could
question his witnesses. He also curtailed the case proposed by
Mason's lawyer, Stephen Jackson, who said he now planned to call an
FBI agent to the stand on Friday, as well as a woman who appeared
in silhouette in a videotape documentary about the case.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of other loose ends. Michael Hardy, who is
representing Sharpton, has already called two witnesses, but may
call one more. And for the next few days, Hickman will be ruling on
motions made by the lawyers, as well as deciding how to instruct to
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones, however, appeared giddy with relief that the case might
be over soon. ''I'm anxious to get this to the jury,'' he told
reporters outside court Monday. ``I think they will find in my
favor and put this case to rest once and for all.''

EARLY RADIO ASTRONOMER IS HONORED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ His assignment from his bosses at Bell
Laboratories in 1931 was simple: build a 100-foot-long rotating
antenna to find out what was causing the static that interfered
with trans-Atlantic telephone calls. His discovery was anything but
simple: the static was the first evidence that stars and galaxies
were emitting radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Jansky's serendipitous discovery of what he called ``star
noise'' led to work in the field of radio astronomy in 1950, and
the rest is history _ or, more properly, cosmology. For it is
through radio astronomy that scientists have confirmed much of what
they theorized about black holes, pulsars, and the lingering
microwave signature of the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, armed with new details from recently discovered
notes, a group of scientists, including two Nobel Prize winners
whose own discoveries were made possible by Jansky's, gathered here
on the grounds of Bell Laboratories to dedicate a sculpture of the
original device _ stylized and miniaturized _ on what is believed
to be its original site.
</P>
<P>
   Jansky died in 1950, and until his notes were found, the only
trace of his discovery was a sign that pointed vaguely toward a
grassy area of the company's research complex. No one knew exactly
where the rotating array of brass piping and receivers mounted on
four wheels from a Model T _ Jansky called it his merry-go-round _
had been situated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem right to just go out there and pick a spot,''
said Robert Wilson, the Nobel Prize-winning astronomer whose own
radio telescope in 1964 detected the microwave radiation left over
from the Big Bang itself, and who helped uncover the lost notes.
``Because Jansky's antenna was the start of our science, we wanted
to mark it appropriately'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jansky's son, David, noted on Monday that Jansky had died
without ever hearing the term radio astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Tyson, an astrophysicist who helped find the lost notes,
said of Jansky's discovery: ``The astronomers were mystified and
the electrical engineers were clueless. So no one beat a path to
his door, but he was 20 years ahead of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after World War II that the Jansky discovery
attracted widespread attention. Jesse Greenstein, 89, an astronomer
who was one of the few to recognize its importance at first, said
on Monday that analysis of radio waves emanating from space
provided researchers with ``10,000 times the information'' that
they could get from optical astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It led to information that overturned the idea of a rationally
developing universe,'' he said, ``and replaced it with a
relativistic, ultra-high energy cosmos of scary, violent,
uncontrollable forces like black holes and quasars. It was a
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Grote Reber, 95, who in the 1930s and '40s duplicated Jansky's
work, recalled Jansky as ``a competent, energetic and mild-mannered
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Jansky's sister, Helen Sanford, who came to the ceremony from
her home in Ojai, Calif., attributed her brother's perseverance in
pursuing the source of the static despite the lack of interest by
others to his training as a physicist and their father's admonition
to them as children to ``question everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Taylor, a 1993 Nobel Prize winner and the discoverer of
pulsars, agreed. ``When you have a prepared mind ready to receive
some signal from nature, then you have real progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Jansky's discovery the front page of The New York
Times of May 5, 1933, carried an account of a scientific paper
detailing the discovery of the star noise, under the headline ``New
Radio Waves Traced to Centre of the Milky Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, between a Lowell Thomas news broadcast and a
Marx Brothers show, radio's Blue Network broadcast an interview
with Jansky, complete with three 10-second-long live segments of
actual static hiss emanating ``from the depths of the universe.''
At one point, the announcer told the listeners that they were tuned
in to Sagittarius, the constellation at the center of the galaxy
from which the waves emanated.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine, with a wry, world-weary tone in its
Talk of the Town section, said at the time of the discovery that it
was ``believed to be the longest distance anybody ever went to look
for trouble.''

URGENT NEED FOR BLOOD DONORS IN NEW YORK REGION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With less than a day's supply of blood on hand for
hospitals in the New York region, health officials are urging
people to donate to curb the severe shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Blood supplies usually dwindle twice a year: around the December
holidays and near the end of the summer, both times when many
people are traveling and take off from work, where blood donations
are often collected. This year, however, the summer shortage
appears to have come early.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's scary to us now is we are reaching that point in
June,'' said Dr. Robert Jones, president of the New York Blood
Center. ``If that curve continues, we're going to be in real
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones described the need for blood as urgent, especially for
Type O, which can be used without negative reactions in patients
with any type of blood. The region's blood supply is typically
about 13,000 pints, Jones said. As of Monday, he said, there were
7,000 pints, an amount that would run out in one day if the stores
were not replenished.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, blood supplies are also down, though the need
varies by region. While some areas in the Middle West have small
surpluses, both coasts report severe shortages, particularly of
Type O blood.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and other health officials speculated that the early
shortage of blood was caused not by any single reason but an
accumulation of several trends. Since the start of the AIDS
epidemic more than a decade ago, the number of blood donors has
steadily declined. The reasons, Jones said, include an unfounded
fear of infection, fewer blood drives at businesses because of
corporate downsizing and a general belief that there is less need
to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to get people to come in and give blood,'' said
Angela Buscemi, manager of the National Blood Exchange in Bethesda,
Md. ``I don't think there is as much of a connection today _ that I
need to donate blood because I'm going to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said this year has also been more difficult than others
because there is less blood to borrow from other regions. ``It's
tight everywhere,'' he said. The New York region includes New York
City, Long Island, the Hudson Valley and northern New Jersey.
People interested in donating can call (800) 933-2566 for the
location of the nearest blood donation center.

SELIG WANTS TO TOUGHEN RULES TO LIMIT FIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Acting in the wake of nasty-looking on-field brawls two weeks
apart, baseball's acting commissioner, Bud Selig, called Monday for
more severe penalties for players who leave their locations to
``incite or further inflame violence of any sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, saying the fights have distressed him, called on three
high-ranking major-league baseball officials to meet with players
association representatives to discuss the issue and to take action
designed to deter the kind of brawls that broke out at Yankee
Stadium on May 19 and in Kansas City last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current fines and suspensions _ which do not include loss of
pay _should be revised or reformed to deter behavior which is not
in keeping with the integrity of the game,'' Selig said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   He instructed Paul Beeston, president and chief operating
officer of major-league baseball, and the league presidents, Gene
Budig of the American League and Leonard Coleman of the National
League, to meet with union officials to ``immediately devise new
and more effective penalties for those players and managers who
leave the dugout or their on-field positions to incite or further
inflame violence of any sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig did not include bullpens in his statement, but players in
those areas presumably would also be covered.
</P>
<P>
   New rules and penalties, Selig said, should be made effective as
soon as they can be agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Because such changes would affect working conditions, the
players must agree to them. Managers are not covered by the union,
but the leagues would not implement rules regarding their behavior
without new rules also applying to players.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fehr, head of the players association, said he was
prepared to listen to any proposals the baseball officials might
make. ``We'll wait and see what they have to say,'' he said. ``Most
people, I think, thought the penalties most recently imposed were
severe, especially on the managers. But we'll have to wait sand
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Fehr referred to Budig's disciplinary action against two
managers, three coaches and nine players for their roles in two
fights during the Angels-Royals game. Managers Terry Collins of
Anaheim and Tony Muser of Kansas City were suspended for eight
games each, the players were suspended for one to five games and
the coaches were fined.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the fight between the Yankees and the
Orioles after Armando Benitez hit Tino Martinez with a pitch
following a Bernie Williams home run, Budig suspended Benitez for
eight games and four other players for two or three games.
</P>
<P>
   The players suspended from both games were also fined amounts
ranging from $500 to $2,000. There has been a call from various
quarters for fines to be increased so that they would be more in
line with today's salaries. Asked about that idea, Fehr said, ``If
they want to make us proposals on fines, we'll listen to what they
have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the only one of the four major professional sports
that does not impose automatic penalties on players for joining
fights in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association warns its players that if
they leave the bench to join an on-court fight, they will be
suspended and fined. National Hockey League players incur automatic
suspensions for leaving the bench for an on-ice altercation. The
National Football League tells its players to ``stay away'' if a
fight breaks out among other players or face being fined.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials have said a similar rule would not make sense
for baseball because players whose team is at bat would be at a
disadvantage in a fight with the team in the field because it has
nine players not in the dugout or the bullpen. If a new rule
included penalties for players leaving their positions, however, a
fight would be fairer from the standpoint of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said fights bother him because they jeopardize players'
safety and ``reflect poorly on that large majority of players who
respect and maintain the tradition of sportsmanship long associated
with the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Players rarely emerge from baseball brawls with serious
injuries. The fights, for the most part, involve a lot of pushing
and shoving and grabbing and holding.
</P>
<P>
   As vicious as some viewers thought the Yankees-Orioles brawl
looked, the only punches that landed were thrown by Darryl
Strawberry at Benitez and Alan Mills at Strawberry. Graeme Lloyd, a
Yankees reliever, threw a series of punches at Benitez after he
raced to the mound from the bullpen, but he appeared to miss on
every one. Even so, he was suspended for three games.

COREY MILLER DOESN'T SHOW, BUT FASSEL'S ANGER DOES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When Giants linebacker Corey Miller
agreed to take a pay cut last week to stay with the team, he talked
with Coach Jim Fassel, and according to the coach, promised to be
at Giants Stadium this week for the passing-camp workouts.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller did not make an appearance at Giants Stadium on
Monday, an absence that clearly left Fassel miffed, although
Raymond Anderson, Miller's agent, told the team that Miller left
his South Carolina home early Monday morning, apparently heading
for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually flies up here, but maybe he's driving this time,''
Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said of Miller, whose
$1.5-million salary was slashed by $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he'd be here, and he's not,'' Fassel said. Asked
whether he was angered by Miller's absence, Fassel said to
reporters, ``You guys can draw your own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel then recited the names of a few players who had been
given excused absences from Monday's workout. ``They all talked to
me about why they wouldn't be here,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' workouts this month are technically optional, but
players customarily tell teams of any absence, anyway. Fassel gave
Miller last week off from the workouts. ``He said he had some
things to take care of, and I said that was OK,'' Fassel said.
``I'll visit with him about that. I always give the guy the benefit
of the doubt until I talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller may be on the verge of losing his starting job at
strongside linebacker. Some Giants coaches are leaning toward
giving that starting assignment to Marcus Buckley, whom the team
signed to a three-year free agent contract this winter.
</P>
<P>
   If Miller is upset over his pay cut, it will surprise Accorsi.
The Giants' general manager said that Miller signed his new
contract and mailed it to the team last week. ``There were no
problems,'' Accorsi said. &QL;

HONDA AND FORD TO PAY FINES FOR POLLUTION VIOLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Story rewritten throughout.)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Japan)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Honda and Ford have agreed to pay millions of
dollars in civil fines for selling cars that were designed to pass
emissions tests but were certain to run substantially dirtier on
the road, federal prosecutors announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency
fined Honda Motor Co. $12.6 million for violations of the Clean Air
Act. The EPA said the automaker would also face costs of about $250
million for remedial efforts, including extending warranties and
providing free tune-ups for the 1.6 million cars that are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. will pay a $2.5 million fine for a
pollution-control problem on 60,000 of its 1997 Econoline vans, the
officials said, and $3.8 million in other costs and compensatory
measures. Ford began a recall of the vans Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is an embarrassment to Honda, which in
advertising and public statements has portrayed itself as an
environmental leader. The automaker has voluntarily put extra
equipment on hundreds of thousands of vehicles to make sure that
they meet California's strict emission standards, even if they are
sold in states that enforce the looser federal standard. Ford also
voluntarily exceeds emission rules on many of its models.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making very clear that cars are a major source of air
pollution in this country and it is important for auto
manufacturers to assure they are carefully complying with the Clean
Air Act,'' said Lois Schiffer, an assistant attorney general and
head of the environment and natural-resources division at the
Justice Department. ``If they don't do it, we will take strong
action against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Honda covers all of the Honda and Acura
vehicles built in the 1996 and '97 model years, with the exception
of Passport and SLX, and the 1997 Integra R. For 1995 models, the
agreement covers the Accord V-6 and the Acura NSX, 2.5 TL. Acura is
a division of Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say Honda was fined for programming the
pollution-control computers to ignore spark-plug failures. The
computer software would not illuminate the ``check engine'' light
when parts fail and emissions rise, thus allowing the cars to emit
twice as much smog-causing hydrocarbons without warning their
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Honda, William Willen, said that the problem was
one of interpretation of the rules, and that the vehicles'
diagnostic systems would function if the problem were serious. The
``check engine'' light would fail to come on, Willen said in a
telephone interview, only in times of intermittent failure.
</P>
<P>
   Willen said the company's engineers had simply gone too far in
their efforts to minimize the number of times the light came on.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmental agency estimated that uncorrected, the
cars _ Civics, Accords, Del Sols, Integras, Preludes, NSXs and
CR-Vs, Odysseys and their Isuzu-brand twin, the Oasis _ would emit
8 million extra tons of hydrocarbons in their lifetimes. Total
emission of hydrocarbons from all transportation sources was about
10 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said that the cars could grow sluggish without
warning the driver that something was wrong, and that if a driver
took one to a garage, the mechanic would have a harder time
diagnosing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   David Alexander, a lawyer with the EPA enforcement division,
said suppressing the dashboard warning light made life harder for
all drivers, even those who were relatively knowledgeable about
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idiot lights are for all of us,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ford's case, the 60,000 Econoline vans are equipped with a
feature that makes them emit more nitrogen oxides at highway speeds
than they do on treadmill tests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying $2.5 million in civil penalties, the
company will buy pollution credits from other sources for $2.5
million, and will spend $1.3 million on fixing the Econolines, with
a goal of completing the work on at least 70 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford spokeswoman, Sara Tatchio, said the company had changed
the pollution systems on Econolines on its assembly line and in
dealer lots as soon as the government raised its objections early
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also called into question the
pollution-control systems on 1.7 million Ford Escorts sold between
1991 and 1995, but the agreement did not require any corrective
action to those cars. Ford sold 6.9 million vehicles worldwide last
year and had earnings of $6.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Honda was also notified of the problems last year and has also
corrected them for vehicles now in production.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The software in the affected Hondas is burned into the computer
chips, and correcting the problem would mean replacing the chips,
at a price the government put at $500 million. The package that
Honda agreed to _ including free oil changes, to lure drivers in
for their free tune-ups _ was more effective, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tuneups and engine checks, Honda will extend the
warranty on the pollution-control systems to 14 years or 150,000
miles. Depending on which part was involved and where the car was
sold, the existing warranties ranged from three years or 36,000
miles to eight years or 80,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the Justice Department estimate, Honda said it did
not know the cost for the remedial actions, because no one had ever
guaranteed car parts for so long. Honda's payment will be spread
over 14 years, which will significantly reduce the financial impact
on the company. Honda sold 2 million vehicles worldwide in 1997,
and for the fiscal year that ended March 31 had a profit of $1.96
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The largest previous case was the $45 million in fines and
remedial actions that General Motors Corp. agreed to in 1995 for
producing Cadillacs that passed emissions tests but violated
pollution standards on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda problem was discovered by officials of the California
Air Resources Board, which serves as the Environmental Protection
Agency's surrogate for certifying that Honda vehicles meet federal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The California board tested one vehicle that had been on the
road for several months, and found that it did not diagnose engine
misfires, in which the fuel-air mixture fails to explode and is
shoved out the exhaust system, sometimes damaging the catalytic
converter on the way.
</P>
<P>
   On closer examination, California engineers found that the
system was designed not to work.
</P>
<P>
   Honda said owners with questions could call its Consumer Affairs
Department at (800) 999-1009.

MARTIN WILL RIDE HIS CART IN THE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In dramatic fashion, Casey Martin qualified for the
U.S. Open Monday, fulfilling another dream and returning his
remarkable story to the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who successfully sued the PGA Tour earlier this year for
the right to use a cart in competition, prevailed on the second
hole of a sudden-death playoff at the U.S. Open sectional qualifier
at Clovernook Country Club. By making a 25-foot birdie putt on the
38th hole of competition, Martin won a five-man playoff for the
last available spot and earned a berth in next week's U.S. Open at
the Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who suffers from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, a
painful circulatory ailment, will become the first golfer ever to
ride a cart in the Open.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the odds were against Martin at Clovernook, with 67
golfers vying for just five qualifying spots. And during Martin's
third hole, his specially designed one-seat cart stalled, forcing
him to walk for two holes. But Martin shot a 2-under-par 138 over
36 holes of regulation before winning the playoff. When it was
over, Martin was relieved, drained, and somewhat stunned. On his
fourth attempt at making the Open, and at age 26, Martin had
finally reached a lifelong goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a growing up, hitting shots around my yard and
thinking I was in the Open, I never thought it would become a
reality,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin will become a focal point of attention next week,
especially since PGA Tour players were divided on whether he should
be allowed to use a cart. Martin has used a cart on the Nike Tour
this year, but the Open will be his first taste of competing
against the world's best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from a respected player that I'll be welcome,''
Martin said when asked what kind of reception he expected to
receive from players next week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's scene was full of bizarre moments, the most unusual of
which was when Martin's cart stalled. The vehicle was approved by
the U.S. Golf Association and designed by Pride Health Care, a
manufacturer of lift chairs and scooters based in Exeter, Pa.
Martin played down the incident, saying he must have accidentally
kicked the ignition key, which caused it to malfunction. But
Martin, who uses a regular cart on the Nike Tour, had trouble
steering the new cart at times, and when he could not get it to
move on the third fairway, he got up and limped to his ball,
leaving the vehicle behind.
</P>
<P>
   After one of Pride Health's representatives restarted the cart,
it was returned to Martin after his tee shot at No. 5, and he used
it the rest of the day. But more distractions followed. The gallery
was smaller than expected, reaching a maximum of only about 200
people, but a television station helicopter followed Martin's
threesome for the three holes during the afternoon. ``It annoyed
everyone on the golf course,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin pressed on. He almost squandered his dream, making a
double-bogey six on the final hole that threatened to cost him a
playoff spot. Martin nervously waited in his car after he finished
for the remaining golfers to complete their rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin regained his composure in the playoff to make a putt
he will not forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't sunk in, but I'm sure it will,'' Martin said. ``Next
week should be something I can really savor.''

SOUTH KOREAN RECOVERY: A MIXED BUT GLOOMY PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Six months after Koreans elected Kim
Dae-jung as president, economic pain is mounting with few signs of
a turnaround in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Economic output has fallen even more sharply than predicted _
3.8 percent in the first quarter, while unemployment has
outstripped economists' forecasts, reaching 6.7 percent at the end
of April.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is likely to get worse before it gets better, most
analysts believe. ``They're breaking with a social contract that's
been in place the last 40 years,'' said Linda Tsao-yang, the U.S.
representative to the Asian Development Bank. ``It's going to be
painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some discern seeds of growth. ``The process of growth is
probably already under way,'' said the U.S. ambassador here,
Stephen Bosworth. ``It's just overwhelmed by the more visible pain
of restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosworth and others say anyone who anticipated an overnight
transformation was simply unrealistic. ``I think we built
expectations too high, and when you do that, you are sure to
disappoint,'' said You Jong-keun, governor of North Cholla province
and economic adviser to Kim. ``We could not have moved any
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which provided $58 billion in
December to stave off Korean default, still claims South Korea as
its star pupil in Asia and says that the government is ahead of
schedule on many required changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is the first stages of restructuring in the
financial system and the corporations, and those reforms are going
to have a negative impact,'' said John Dodsworth, senior resident
representative of the IMF here. ``At least in the next few months,
they could be quite disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking system's bad debts have continued to rise as
debt-laden South Korean corporations continue to borrow. And many
of the chaebol, the sprawling conglomerates that dominate the
economic landscape here and are widely blamed for South Korea's
structural woes, seem determined to continue doing business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, companies are paying a total of $6 billion a
month to service their debts, an amount equal on an annual basis to
more than half the nation's export income last year. Asset sales,
which would help eliminate debt, have been sporadic.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign investors that South Korea so desperately needs
apparently still need to be convinced that the reforms under way
are substantial. But because the government of Kim, a former
political prisoner, is determined to act in a democratic fashion,
its ability to enforce change in private business is limited.
</P>
<P>
   The government cannot, for example, force the banks to make more
rational lending decisions or order the conglomerates to sell their
assets, as it could in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role has been reduced to that of a referee,'' said Hyun
Oh-seok, general director of economic policy at the Finance and
Economy Ministry. ``The government sets up the rules, but others
are the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Although officials bulldozed virtually the last remaining
barrier to foreign investment last month, foreigners greeted the
news by pulling so much money out of the stock market that it hit
an 11-year low. The market has since recovered somewhat, but
remains shaky.
</P>
<P>
   External factors beyond the government's control have
complicated matters, particularly the decline in the value of the
Japanese yen against the dollar, and the weakness of the Japanese
economy. Concerns like Samsung Electronics, Daewoo and Pohang Iron
and Steel compete head to head with Japanese companies, and the
cheaper yen means much stiffer competition. The Japanese market is
also less able to absorb Korean goods.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's decline has made many aware of the soft underbelly of
Korea's surging trade surplus _ the hard-currency flow that keeps
Korea's foreign-exchange coffers full.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's trade surplus is due more to a precipitous drop in
imports than to increased demand for its products abroad. The fall
in imports has investors worried because it means that business at
home is suffering badly. Companies have not been importing the raw
material, components and machinery they need, largely because they
have had difficulty finding financing.

<P>
   ``Many small and medium-sized companies that are doing well are
going down because banks are rushing to recall their loans or they
don't have access to the credit needed to do business,'' said Yoon
Young-mo, international secretary of the Korea Federation of Trade
Unions, the more militant of the nation's two labor groupings.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are signs that the credit shortage is starting to
abate, it has already put hundreds of thousands of people out of
work. The country's 30 large conglomerates get most attention when
it comes to labor issues, but they employ only about 5 percent of
the work force and have thus far not resorted to sweeping layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Workers and small-company owners have borne the brunt of the
restructuring, not the conglomerates for which the changes were
intended. ``Despite the fact that everyone is calling for reform in
the chaebol system, what is happening is that because so many small
and midsized companies are going under, the government is rushing
to prop up the conglomerates to avoid making the situation even
worse,'' Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that the conglomerates are restructuring but
that the process is exceedingly slow. Foreign companies have been
buying their Korean counterparts' stakes in joint ventures, but
only a handful of outright asset sales have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   These include the recent sale of the Hanwha group's power-plant
operations to AES Corp. of the United States for $874 million, the
highest price paid so far for a Korean asset.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. intends to invest $1 billion in
Korea Life, giving it as much as 60 percent of the privately held
insurer, the companies said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Reuters and Bloomberg News reported, Samsung
Heavy Industries said it had signed a contract to sell its forklift
truck business to Clark Material Handling of the United States for
$30 million. This follows the sale early in May of Samsung's
construction operations to Volvo for $720 million.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of ``cooperative financing'' _ loans and loan
extensions offered by bankers to big companies that would otherwise
go bust _ continues with little apparent slackening. The practice
has delayed corporate restructuring by giving otherwise insolvent
companies a new lease on life and added to the woes of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   Although government officials have declared that such loans
would stop, $600 million in new loans were granted last month to
the Dong Ah group, raising fresh doubt about Seoul's commitment to
banking reform.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how vast the pool of nonperforming loans is. Hyun
of the Finance Ministry conceded that raising enough money to cover
potential bad loans would be an uphill battle. But action on this
and other structural issues is necessary for the economy to
recover, many analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the reform process has begun, investors are beginning
to look more closely on a micro level as to precisely what changes
are taking place,'' Ms. Yang, the U.S. delegate to the Asian
Development Bank, said. ``They'll have to see those changes before
they're convinced.''

BILL WALTON URGES MALONE TO STEP UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What I wouldn't have given for a few renditions of
``That's terrible!'' from Bill Walton to describe Utah's
ignominious 96-54 collapse Sunday night to Chicago in Game 3 of the
National Basketball Association &QC; finals.
</P>
<P>
   But Walton is not the third member of NBC's game crew for the
finals as he had been for several years. Now, his tart, contrarian,
sometimes odd views are confined to NBC's pre-game and halftime
studio programs and to CNBC's post-game show.
</P>
<P>
   For every lousy clanged shot, dumb turnover or missed rebound by
Utah, NBC should play taped Waltonisms: ``That's awful!'' or
``Deliver me from this dreadful display of horrible passing that is
turning John Wooden's stomach!''
</P>
<P>
   If Walton is irked by his slim role, you must read between his
lines. ``You do whatever you can,'' he said Monday from Chicago.
``You do your best.''
</P>
<P>
   At least before Sunday's game, Walton used the pre-game show to
launch into a typically emotive challenge, this to Karl Malone, the
slumping Jazz forward: ``How about playing? How about 35 points on
a minimum of 25 shots? At least go down fighting. Let us see your
soul, your passion, Karl. This isn't another day at work. This is
about competitive greatness, about leadership, the ability to
respond to the greatest challenge and opportunity in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Walton said, Malone responded ``for about five
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's and Utah's failures, he said, are reminders of how far
Chicago towers over its rivals and how much greater Michael Jordan
is than anyone else. ``I always get the sense that Chicago is
toying with us,'' the former Trail Blazer, Clipper and Celtic said.
``They're just so good. In a close game, I'm thinking, `You're
teasing us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Jordan, he said: ``We haven't seen the best of Michael
Jordan because we haven't gotten to the point where Michael has had
to come up with something new. Just imagine if someone were in
their pushing him further?''
</P>
<P>
   Utah, he said, has failed to figure out how to attack Chicago's
defense, or create anything offensively once its pick-and-rolls
broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great offensive players should be able to break down a great
defense,'' Walton said. ``If Chicago's defense is such a big factor
in this series, then it's an indication of the separation between
these teams. They talk about defense winning championships _ well,
everybody plays defense _ but you need a guy who can come down and
when the defense is so good, can still get a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   So even if Utah lays down for Games 4 and 5, Walton insists he
can gaze admiringly upon the Bulls and not cry on Wooden's fatherly
shoulder. ``I'm lucky to have played on teams that have been
brilliant at times,'' he said. ``You hope the other team matches
that level, but as long as one team gets there, where everything
you dream of comes true, you get so high.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps watching the Bulls unleash devastation is not a turnoff.
Game 3's Nielsen 16.8 overnight rating rose from a 15.9 last year.
Despite the runaway, the rating rose from a 16.8 from 8:30-9 p.m.
to an 18.2 from 9-9:30 and fell only slightly to an 18.1 in the
final 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Loving the World Cup  &LR;  Preston Padden, the president of the ABC
Television Network, is hopeful about the success of the network's
14 World Cup telecasts, which begin Saturday at 3 p.m. with the
Netherlands playing Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting it will overtake `Monday Night Football'
but it is a building phenomenon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You've got all this built-in marketing, with kids,
coaches and parents. We're glad to have the franchise. We think
it'll grow. It's our Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is seeking World Cup synergy: Sunday's ``Wonderful World of
Disney'' is a soccer movie called ``The Big Green.'' ``The View,''
a daytime talk show, is giving away a van. The Saturday morning
cartoon shows are being used for a soccer contest, and Friday's
prime-time shows will present brief soccer features between the
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Padden said the network tried to weave soccer story lines into
the afternoon soap operas, but the U.S. team was chosen too late.
He hopes ``Ted Koppel is a big soccer fan,'' so ``Nightline'' will
book a soccer program. Maybe with the soccer aficionado Henry
Kissinger expounding on the Ronaldo Realpolitik?
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the United States-Iran game on June 21, Padden said,
``We're thinking about asking former President Jimmy Carter back
for commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Backstretch Thoughts  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Belmont Stakes coverage on Saturday excelled for showing
the finish photo being examined before stewards declared Victory
Gallop the winner and for quickly reporting the stewards' inquiry
of Real Quiet. But the running graphic showing the horses'
positions failed again, showing horses out of the slots that the
race caller Dave Johnson said they were in. Nielsen's overnight
ratings for the race were 6.6, up from 6.2 last year. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ After more than four weeks of searching for a new
head men's basketball coach, St. John's appears to be closing in on
a deal with Mike Jarvis of George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for St. John's and Jarvis refused to comment,
but an official from another school confirmed that St. John's
officials met with Jarvis' lawyer, Robert Ades, on Monday in New

$800,000 a year for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Ades did not return calls Monday night and Jarvis, reached in
his office, would not comment. A St. John's spokesman also refused

WAR ON DRUGS CALLED MORE HARM THAN GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A drug reform institute financed by the
billionaire philanthropist George Soros has amassed signatures of
hundreds of prominent people around the world on a letter asserting
that the global war on drugs is causing more harm than drug abuse
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The signers include the former U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, the former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz,
the Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, the former CBS
television anchorman Walter Cronkite, two former U.S. senators,
Alan Cranston and Claiborne Pell, and the South African human
rights activist Helen Suzman.
</P>
<P>
   The signers also include Soros, who has spent millions of
dollars trying to change the way Americans think about illegal
drugs. In the past, he helped finance referendums in California and
Arizona in support of medicinal use of marijuana and programs that
distribute clean needles to those who take illegal drugs by
injection.
</P>
<P>
   The move was timed to coincide with the U.N. General Assembly's
special session on combating drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was organized by the Lindesmith Center in New York,
which advocates more liberal drug policies. It is addressed to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, whose spokesman said Monday that he
had yet to receive it. The letter also ran as a two-page
advertisement in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   It says in part: ``Persisting in our current policies will only
result in more abuse, more empowerment of drug markets and
criminals and more disease and suffering. Too often those who call
for open debate, rigorous analysis of current policies, and serious
consideration of alternatives are accused of `surrendering.' But
the true surrender is when fear and inertia combine to shut off
debate, suppress critical analysis, and dismiss all alternatives to
current policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter proposes no clear alternatives beyond asking Annan to
take the lead in ``stimulating a frank and honest evaluation of
global drug control efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros said in a telephone interview that he did not contribute
directly to the cost of the Times advertisement but that the
Lindesmith Institute, which he bankrolls, did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to sign it,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``Firstly, it expresses my views and secondly, I hope it will
foster an open discussion, which is very difficult. By having so
many distinguished people sign on, it should make people want to
discuss whether our policies are counterproductive or not.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was not responsible for the campaign, he added, ``I'm
happy that it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lindesmith Center's president, Ethan Nadlemann, was not
reticent about taking credit for coordinating the letter, which he
said drew roughly 600 signatures from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my initiative,'' Nadlemann said. ``George agreed to
help, and sent out some letters in his name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had another week,'' he said, ``the number of names would
have been off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   The language was deliberately broad to attract the largest
number of people, he said, prompting some to complain that it was
not strong enough. ``I think that when people look back on the U.N.
drugs summit in 1998, it is not going to be because of the
platitudes,'' Nadlemann said. ``It will be a moment at which the
truly international movement for drug reform had begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, responded in a statement, ``The
secretary- general invites anybody who has any suggestions,
proposals or ideas which could help improve the international
community's response to this problem to come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letter did not seem to sway participants at the General
Assembly's special session. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton
administration's director of national drug policy, called the
letter ``a 1950s perception'' of the struggle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala said,
``There's no chance that we're going to throw up our hands and walk
away from what we think is a predominantly public health issue.''

PASSIONS RISE OVER COUNCIL RUNOFF IN NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: DeTwayne Holmes is cq) 
 (ja) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Runoff elections rarely set pulses racing. But
the one being played out Tuesday in Newark's Central Ward may prove
the exception.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the City Council seat from the neighborhood that
was ground zero in Newark's 1967 riots and the setting for
rebuilding in the last 15 years, is between a veteran politician
and a 29-year-old newcomer with Ivy League and Oxford credentials.
As New Jersey's largest city continues its steady struggle back
from the turmoil of the late 1960s, the Central Ward contest is not
just about young versus old and outsider versus insider, but about
the glitter of things hoped for against the solidity of things
known.
</P>
<P>
   The passion excited by the election was evident after a
candidates' forum June 3, when Darlene Parker argued with a
neighbor about the merits of one candidate, George Branch, a
69-year-old, four-term incumbent. Branch had, by virtue of his
experience and his quiet but constant presence in the ward, earned
re-election, she said. He had paid his dues, she went on, and this
country ought to respect such people.
</P>
<P>
   But her debating partner, DeTwayne Holmes, retorted that
Branch's 29-year-old opponent, Cory Booker, had impressive
educational credentials: Stanford University, Oxford University,
Yale Law School. Holmes said he saw Booker as just the kind of
``young, innovative, educated'' candidate that the now resurgent
ward and city needed. ``We need new blood,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's runoff was forced by the May 12 municipal election, in
which no candidate in a three-way race attained a majority in the
Central Ward voting. Branch finished 340 votes ahead of Booker, out
of 7,700 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of its energy level alone, the runoff shows a new
fervor about politics and the city's future among the ward's 27,000
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to Newark's credit that there is this runoff,'' said
Raymond Codey, director of development for the New Community Corp.,
a nonprofit housing and economic development group in the Central
Ward. ``Residents didn't just vote for the older guy, but are
intelligently evaluating the candidates. It speaks well for Newark
that we can attract a candidate like Cory Booker and give residents
this kind of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ballot also features a runoff in the West Ward and a
runoff among eight candidates for four at-large seats on the City
Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Booker's presence in the Central Ward race has generated the
most interest. He could have been sent by central casting to typify
a product of the black middle class who grew up in an era of
integration and civil rights gains. A cum laude graduate of
Stanford University, a Rhodes scholar and 1996 graduate of Yale Law
School, he was raised in Bergen County's affluent Harrington Park,
where his family had to invoke anti-discrimination laws to buy
their home. His only early connection to Newark was through an
uncle who lived and practiced dentistry here.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, he moved to Newark with a fellowship to do
legal work for the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, a
nonprofit group. He says he soon saw politics as a surer route to
change. Through school contacts, he had entree to city corporate
and business leaders. Soon his name was on all their lips as
someone who bore watching, and that buzz, as much as anything else,
placed him as a new star in the city's political firmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked a community which was in incredible distress and
which at the same time had amazing human beings,'' Booker said, in
explaining why he chose to come to Newark and to run in the city's
Central Ward. ``I'm in the top 1 percent educationally of this
nation _ black or white _ and I have been taught that to he who
much is given, much is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker has raised and spent more than $140,000 so far, an
extraordinary amount for a council race in Newark, which rarely
sees more than $50,000 spent. Much of it was raised from a network
of friends and associates from Stanford, Oxford and Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Newark's mayor, Sharpe James, who is supporting Branch, has
styled the Central Ward contest as a race between the Rhodes
scholar and the ``road scholar'' in an effort to burnish Branch's
street smarts and long service in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Branch, a former youth coordinator with the Newark Housing and
Redevelopment Authority, is also a former lightweight boxer who
amassed a professional record of 28-8. They were mostly decisions,
he said in a recent interview, noting that he patterned himself
after Sugar Ray Robinson, and was not a flashy knockout artist.
</P>
<P>
   This style has characterized his political career as well, say
supporters like the Rev. Jason Guice, pastor of Hopewell Baptist
Church. Branch played a role in making sure that the privately
financed, middle-income town houses of Society Hill/University
Heights got built and was one of the first buyers, Guice noted. He
also helped bring about the construction of apartments by
church-sponsored nonprofit groups and town houses by the city's
housing authority, Guice said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, he has performed the traditional constituent
service in solving problems for the elderly, helping start youth
programs and getting homeowner tax abatements. ``He has been there,
and that is why the ministers of the Central Ward are supporting
him,'' Guice said.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Branch and his supporters were lackadaisical
before the vote on May 12. But by the end of last week, Branch had
raised and spent more than $100,000 himself in an effort to beat
back the challenge in the runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Branch and his supporters are pressing hard to stick the
``outsider'' label on Booker, as well as tie him to downtown and
business interests whom they deride for having moved many of their
operations, and in some cases their residences, from Newark to the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jonah Nixon, vice chairman of the Newark North Jersey
Committee of Black Churchmen, said that these unnamed interests now
want to return and reclaim a prominent place in the city, as it
seems to be rebounding with such amenities as the New Jersey
Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have deserted the city would like to come back, and
these are the people who are supporting Cory Booker and giving him
most of his money,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   While Booker and his backers do claim the support of business
leaders who have holdings in Newark but live elsewhere, they brand
as ridiculous suggestions that they are his only supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Booker's claim of broader support is borne out in part by the
results of the May 12 election. Branch won most of the
middle-income, homeowner areas and precincts with large numbers of
elderly people, if only by slim margins. But it was Booker who won
the poorer areas dominated by the city's last remaining high-rise
public housing complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker and Holmes never resolved their own debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newark is not moving as fast as it could,'' Holmes said. ``We
need young people, educated people with vibrant new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker shot back, ``Education is not enough by itself. You
can be an educated fool, you know.''

BROADWAY BOMB IS ACTUALLY JUST A DUD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is every director's nightmare _ bombing on
Broadway. For Judy Cohen, it came true on Monday, in a manner of
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a white plastic bag, she stopped at a Citibank branch
on Broadway and 111th Street to use an automated teller machine.
Then she rushed to the Village Copier on 115th Street to make
photocopies of a script for a play she is about to direct.
</P>
<P>
   Then she had a chilling realization. The bag was still at the
Citibank branch. Inside the bag was a prop for the play. The prop
resembled a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she scampered back to the bank, a security guard had
called the police, who cordoned off the area. Ms. Cohen was left to
frantically explain that an episode of frightening confusion was
the result of a moment of absent-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so horribly embarrassed,'' said Ms. Cohen, 27, a graduate
student at Columbia University. ``I don't want this to be my 15
minutes of fame. I want the play to be my 15 minutes of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the incident lasted 77 minutes, said Sgt. Cory Cuneo,
a police spokesman. After a customer told the security guard about
the bag, who called the police at 6:39 p.m., the bomb squad closed
Broadway between 110th and 112th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the prop resembled the genuine article. There
were six cardboard tubes, painted fire-engine red and bundled with
gray electrical tape to resemble dynamite. Black wires snaked from
the end of each tube and were connected to a wristwatch atop the
bundle. After the police found that the bomb was make-believe, the
emergency was called off at 7:56 p.m., Cuneo said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen's play, called ``Baggage,'' opens on Friday at the
Theater for the New City, on First Avenue near 10th Street.

<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator of Nigeria, whose ruthless
suppression of opponents, human rights and democracy led to
condemnation around the world and seething discontent at home, died
early Monday, and his defense chief was quickly sworn in to lead
Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the death were sketchy, but U.S. officials said they
had no evidence of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha had not left a clear successor, but Nigeria's top
military leaders convened and selected Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
apparently averting a protracted power struggle for leadership in
the oil-rich nation of 115 million, a country wracked by decades of
harsh, corrupt military regimes and the effects of Western
sanctions imposed in a futile effort to hasten democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The swift selection of another military leader came in the face
of appeals by exiled Nigerians and world leaders in Washington,
London, Paris and other capitals, who said the the general's death
heralded an opportunity for Nigeria to release hundreds of
political prisoners, cancel executions set by kangaroo courts and
restore civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha's death is not going to bring my father back,'' said
Ken Wiwa, the son of the playwright and environmental activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa, who, with eight other opponents of the general, was
publicly hanged for ``treason'' in 1995 while a worldwide
outpouring of appeals for mercy was icily ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright who won the 1986 Nobel
Prize for Literature, fled to exile in Paris in 1994 and was
recently charged in absentia with treason, said from Jerusalem that
the general's death was an ``incredible opportunity'' for Nigeria
to resurrect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House offered no comment, but the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, offered sympathy to Abacha's
family, reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to promoting democracy in
Nigeria, and urged a ``peaceful transition to civilian, democratic
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of rumors and confusion in which heavily armed
soldiers sealed off the general's compound in the capital, Abuja, a
brief communique by Abubakar, announced that the 54-year-old
Nigerian leader, who seized power in 1993, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The head of state and commander in chief of the Nigerian armed
forces, Gen. Sani Abacha, died at dawn,'' the statement read on
national radio said. ``He was to be buried today in Kano, his
native town, in accordance with Muslim rites and tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The communique did not specify the cause of death, but news
reports quoted family friends and Western diplomats as saying he
had suffered a heart attack. Reports that Abacha's health was
failing circulated after he canceled a trip to Lagos, Nigeria's
principal city and former capital, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the death drew no outpouring of sorrow in Nigeria, where
the general had tamed political parties, trade unions and the
press, and had an enemies' list that read like a Who's Who of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, where opposition to Abacha had been strongest, there
were no signs of mourning. ``God is, capable of wonderful things,''
an opposition political figure in Lagos said from behind a screen
of anonymity. ``Perhaps Nigerians will be free at last.''

 UNDATED: at last.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports from Kano, the northern city where Abacha was born in
1943, said thousands of people had lined the streets, awaiting the
arrival of the general's body and an escort of senior government
and military officials who were to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what to think,'' a Kano businessman who had
closed his shop for the day told Reuters. ``It's true some people
are sad, but some will not be so sad either. We just worry over
what comes next.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the question on many minds.
</P>
<P>
   There was a political vacuum Monday in the absence of Abacha _
who wielded absolute power for five and a half years and was so
haunted by the specter of a coup that he surrounded himself with a
2,000-member personal security force, rarely appeared in public and
jailed or executed many leading Nigerians who could form a credible
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The general's former second-in-command, Lt. Gen. Donaldson
Oladipo Diya, who had been seen as a possible successor, was
sentenced to death by a military tribunal in April for allegedly
plotting a coup. His fate is still in the hands of the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria's leaders gathered in Abuja in a body called the
Provisional Ruling Council, the prospects appeared at first to be
for a behind-the-scenes struggle over the next few days to see who
would lead the government. Political experts said the likely
contenders to succeed the general included Abubakar; Lieut. Gen.
Jeremiah Useni, Nigeria's senior officer, and Maj. Gen. Ishiaya
Bamaiyi, the army Chief of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, after his selection, was promoted from major general
to full general and was sworn in by Nigeria's chief justice,
Mohammed Uwais.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 45 Nigerian groups that had clandestinely opposed
Abacha called Monday for the installation of a civilian government
headed by Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was imprisoned by Abacha after
his election as president in 1993 in what was widely seen as the
country's most democratic vote since it gained independence from
Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is a country of 250 tribal groups. The Hausa and Fulani in
the north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Ibo in the southeast
make up 65 percent of the population. The 1960s were marked by a
struggle for political dominance among the main ethnic groups, and
a devastating civil war almost broke the country apart in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, oil exports helped Nigeria recover
economically, and in the early 1980s, with a civilian government in
Lagos, Nigeria became known as a model of African democracy and
prosperity. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press
was one of the freest anywhere. Nigerian diplomacy challenged the
United States and Britain over issues like apartheid. The nation's
currency was worth twice as much as the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy in Nigeria died in 1983, and Abacha, a career
soldier who became an infantryman at 18 and attended military
colleges in England, the United States and Nigeria, had a role in
three military coups.
</P>
<P>
   The generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983.
Hopes for a return to democracy were high in June 1993, when
Abiola, a millionaire businessman, won an election with pledges to
return Nigeria to civilian government. But the government annulled
the election, and three months later Abacha overthrew President
Ibrahim Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, frustrated over the victory that was stolen from him,
declared himself president in defiance of Abacha and was jailed on
treason charges. Abacha promised democratic reforms and an election
in 1996 to bring back civilian government, but the promises proved
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing that he was stretching his rule to 1998, Abacha
began a virtual reign of terror. He cracked down on all political
opposition, subdued trade unions, took control of the press, jailed
hundreds of people and began a series of trials that sent opponents
to prison or the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa was executed on charges stemming from his campaign to
have Nigeria's huge oil revenues shared with the communities where
the petroleum was produced. The general's purges also extended to
prominent Nigerians and into his inner circle, and many fled into
exile.
</P>
<P>
   His iron rule drew wide condemnation in the West. While an
international oil embargo did not materialize, limited economic
sanctions against Nigerian oil were invoked. There were reports
that the general and other military leaders were siphoning off
billions of dollars from oil.
</P>
<P>
   As the general became a pariah in Western countries, he was said
to have turned increasingly for support to the Middle East and to
Asia, particularly China. At the same time, he became isolated
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has fallen into steep decline. In most cities,
electricity and water supplies are unreliable at best. Unemployment
soared in recent months, and inflation cut the purchasing power of
most Nigerians to subsistence levels. And for all the general's
repression, criticism could still be heard in Lagos, the
bursting-at-the-seams former capital.

U.S. BACKS DIVIDING CONRAIL TO SPUR COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Va., Conn., Mass., Pa., Canada)  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government approved a sweeping plan
Monday to restructure the United States' rail freight system east
of the Mississippi River, a move officials said would take trucks
off the road, reduce air pollution and lower the cost of goods for
the New York City metropolitan region and much of the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote by the Surface Transportation Board gave final
approval to a proposal by CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. to
divide Conrail's nearly 12,000 miles of track, stretching from
Boston to St. Louis. CSX and Norfolk Southern jointly bought
Conrail, which operated mainly in the Northeast, for $10.2 billion
last year in one of the largest rail mergers in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The plan approved Monday creates two railroad giants that will
dominate rail freight shipping throughout the nation's eastern
half, allowing direct competition between the two companies in
several places, including much of New Jersey and parts of western
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This carefully crafted, privately negotiated deal injects
competition in the entire East like no merger before has ever
done,'' said Linda Morgan, the chairwoman of the board. ``It will
bring competition back to many areas that had lost options through
the creation of Conrail.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and New York Gov.
George Pataki hailed the decision, saying it would allow more than
one major railroad company to ship goods in and out of New York
City for the first time in decades and potentially provide new
transportation routes for Long Island businesses that are solely
dependent on trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, businesses on the east side
of the Hudson will have access to competitive freight rail
services,'' said Bradford Race, Pataki's chief of staff. ``It's a
significant step forward for Long Island, Manhattan and communities
all along the river.''
</P>
<P>
   But some members of New York's congressional delegation said the
plan fell well short of what was needed to revitalize the region's
rail freight industry, charging that the transportation board had
squandered an opportunity to force much more competition for New
York City's huge market. Less than 3 percent of all the goods
shipped in and out of the city is carried by trains, compared with
about 40 percent in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they agreed to was grossly inadequate,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-New York City, who said he might file suit to
block the plan. ``This doesn't give us any real competition at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also not clear whether the new plan would have a
significant impact on rail shipping in Connecticut, where CSX will
take over Conrail's lines. But in New Jersey, where CSX and Norfolk
Southern will jointly operate hundreds of miles of former Conrail
track while directly competing with each other, shipping costs are
expected to decline and rail traffic to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates and New York officials said they were
concerned that added rail traffic in New Jersey would lead to an
increase in trucks carrying goods from New Jersey rail yards into
New York City over the George Washington Bridge even as New Jersey
benefits from less trucking over all. The transportation board said
Monday that it would conduct a study to see if that happened.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote clears one of the last major hurdles for CSX and
Norfolk Southern to complete their takeover of Conrail, a monopoly
system created by Congress 22 years ago out of the remnants of the
failed Penn Central system.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision _ which includes dozens of conditions
dealing with labor, environmental and administrative issues _ still
has to be set down on paper. After that report is released on July
23, the two companies will have to wait 30 days before the takeover
becomes effective. Officials with the two companies have said they
may take several months more to put the plan in place.
</P>
<P>
   CSX and Norfolk Southern have said that their plan will cut
truck travel on the nation's roads by a million trips a year,
sharply reducing air pollution in congested regions like New York
City. And while the elimination of Conrail's freight lines will
lead to the loss of more than 2,500 union and management jobs, the
two companies contend the nation's economy will benefit from lower
shipping costs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is going to be good for every consumer and every producer
in the East,'' said David Goode, chairman of Norfolk Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va., will grow from 14,400
track miles to 21,400 miles in 22 states. CSX, which is based in
Richmond, Va., will grow from 18,300 track miles to more than
23,000 miles in 23 states.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions representing workers who may lose their jobs were
expected to protest the plan. And some manufacturing trade
associations said that they were concerned that shipping rates
might actually rise in regions where Conrail had once been in
competition with CSX or Norfolk Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for CSX to take over Conrail's lines in
Connecticut, Massachusetts, along the Hudson from New York City to
Albany, N.Y., and running west from there to Buffalo, as well as
from Syracuse to Montreal. Norfolk Southern will take control of
lines along the New York-Pennsylvania border and throughout
Pennsylvania. The two companies will jointly operate much of
Conrail's former lines in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions the transportation board approved Monday is
a requirement that CSX allow Canadian Pacific Ltd. to ship goods
from Canada and parts west along the Hudson to New York City. City
officials said that requirement would greatly increase rail
competition in the metropolitan region, opening it up more to
western markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Nadler and other members of New York's and Connecticut's
congressional delegations had wanted the transportation board to
require CSX to allow Norfolk Southern to operate on the east side
of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Doing that would not only reduce shipping rates, they said, but
also encourage the two companies to expand the use of barges to
carry rail cars across New York Harbor from New Jersey to Brooklyn
in New York City. Because there is no rail bridge connecting New
Jersey to New York City, rail freight coming from the south has to
be unloaded in New Jersey and then trucked across bridges or
through tunnels to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morgan said the board was not willing to make such a radical
change to the CSX-Norfolk Southern deal. But the board did require
the two companies to join in a city and state study into improving
cross-Hudson shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is also expected to reduce shipping costs in Buffalo,
N.Y., and Rochester, N.Y.

POLICE SAY NEW YORK COUPLE RAN DRUG RING USING 2 SONS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors said Monday that they had charged
a Bronx man and his wife with running a large-scale drug operation,
and accused the husband of using their two sons, ages 6 and 10, to
carry narcotics and cash in the drug deals.
</P>
<P>
   The husband, Manuel Grullon, 38, and his wife, Maria Polanco,
37, were charged along with 26 other people for their roles in the
operation, which sold thousands of dollars in cocaine, crack
cocaine and heroin each week to customers in the High Bridge
section of the Bronx and elsewhere in the city, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were questions Monday night about the fate of the
couple's two sons. City and police officials said the sons were
left in the custody of a neighbor after the police and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents arrested Grullon on Friday and
Ms. Polanco on Saturday, but the children may have been taken to
the same apartment building where Grullon is accused of basing his
narcotics operation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the city's Administration for Children's
Services said that the placement with the neighbor was temporary,
pending an investigation by the child welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the wife of the superintendent of the building in which the
Grullon family had lived, at 162 W. 165th St., said that the two
boys, as well as the couple's two teen-age daughters, were then
taken by Ms. Polanco's sister, who lives at 1055 University Ave.
</P>
<P>
   According to papers unsealed in Federal District Court in
Manhattan Monday, Grullon and his associates based their drug
dealing in that building, in a group of apartments they controlled,
as well as from its lobby and from a bodega on its ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   A young man who answered the door Monday night in the
fifth-floor apartment at 1055 University Ave. where Ms. Polanco's
sister, Carina, lives, refused to say whether the children were
there. He would only give his first name, Eric, and said: ``They
are safe. They are with family.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman for Children's Services, Leonora Wiener, said
that she did not have further details on the status of the agency's
investigation, or whether a caseworker had yet visited the
children's temporary new home to determine its suitability or
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are with a neighbor and we are investigating,''
Ms. Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear how the decision was made to leave the
children with the neighbor after Grullon and Ms. Polanco were taken
into custody. Their arrests followed an eight-month joint
DEA-Police Department investigation of drug trafficking in and
around 1055 University Ave, ``a building that has long been
infested with pervasive drug dealing,'' prosecutors said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the DEA, Special Agent Diane Ingalls, said
that the drug agents and police officers who arrested Ms. Polanco
had left the children in the custody of the neighbor after Ms.
Polanco identified them ``as people that she trusted the children
to be left with.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman, said that the
police, as part of the continuing investigation in the case, had
alerted Children's Services in advance of taking the parents into
custody. ``There was a prior referral. This has been discussed with
ACS even before the arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   The court papers describe the boys' father, Grullon as leader of
the drug dealing organization, and Ms. Polanco as her husband's
chief deputy, who ``shares responsibility for the daily operation
and management.''
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcement source, who asked not to be identified, said
that it is believed that the organization has been selling as much
as $50,000 worth of narcotics in New York City, as well as
Delaware, for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint filed in the court cites two instances
earlier this year of Grullon's using his sons to carry bags of
cocaine and crack in their jackets, and in one case, to carry a
$2,400 payment from a customer back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Although minors are often used by drug dealers to carry out
transactions, it is rare to see children so young be used by their
parents, said law enforcement officials who have followed such
prosecutions over the years.

haunted by the specter of a coup that he surrounded himself with a
2,000-member personal security force, rarely appeared in public and
jailed or executed many leading Nigerians who could form a credible
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The general's former second-in-command, Lt. Gen. Donaldson
Oladipo Diya, who had been seen as a possible successor, was
sentenced to death by a military tribunal in April for allegedly
plotting a coup. His fate is still in the hands of the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria's leaders gathered in Abuja in a body called the
Provisional Ruling Council, the prospects appeared at first to be
for a behind-the-scenes struggle over the next few days to see who
would lead the government. Political experts said the likely
contenders to succeed the general included Abubakar; Lieut. Gen.
Jeremiah Useni, Nigeria's senior officer, and Maj. Gen. Ishiaya
Bamaiyi, the army Chief of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, after his selection, was promoted from major general
to full general and was sworn in by Nigeria's chief justice,
Mohammed Uwais.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 45 Nigerian groups that had clandestinely opposed
Abacha called Monday for the installation of a civilian government
headed by Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was imprisoned by Abacha after
his election as president in 1993 in what was widely seen as the
country's most democratic vote since it gained independence from
Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is a country of 250 tribal groups. The Hausa and Fulani in
the north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Ibo in the southeast
make up 65 percent of the population. The 1960s were marked by a
struggle for political dominance among the main ethnic groups, and
a devastating civil war almost broke the country apart in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, oil exports helped Nigeria recover
economically, and in the early 1980s, with a civilian government in
Lagos, Nigeria became known as a model of African democracy and
prosperity. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press
was one of the freest anywhere. Nigerian diplomacy challenged the
United States and Britain over issues like apartheid. The nation's
currency was worth twice as much as the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy in Nigeria died in 1983, and Abacha, a career
soldier who became an infantryman at 18 and attended military
colleges in England, the United States and Nigeria, had a role in
three military coups.
</P>
<P>
   The generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983.
Hopes for a return to democracy were high in June 1993, when
Abiola, a millionaire businessman, won an election with pledges to
return Nigeria to civilian government. But the government annulled
the election, and three months later Abacha overthrew President
Ibrahim Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, frustrated over the victory that was stolen from him,
declared himself president in defiance of Abacha and was jailed on
treason charges. Abacha promised democratic reforms and an election
in 1996 to bring back civilian government, but the promises proved
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing that he was stretching his rule to 1998, Abacha
began a virtual reign of terror. He cracked down on all political
opposition, subdued trade unions, took control of the press, jailed
hundreds of people and began a series of trials that sent opponents
to prison or the gallows.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa was executed on charges stemming from his campaign to
have Nigeria's huge oil revenues shared with the communities where
the petroleum was produced. The general's purges also extended to
prominent Nigerians and into his inner circle, and many fled into
exile.
</P>
<P>
   His iron rule drew wide condemnation in the West. While an
international oil embargo did not materialize, limited economic
sanctions against Nigerian oil were invoked. There were reports
that the general and other military leaders were siphoning off
billions of dollars from oil.
</P>
<P>
   As the general became a pariah in Western countries, he was said
to have turned increasingly for support to the Middle East and to
Asia, particularly China. At the same time, he became isolated
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has fallen into steep decline. In most cities,
electricity and water supplies are unreliable at best. Unemployment
soared in recent months, and inflation cut the purchasing power of
most Nigerians to subsistence levels. And for all the general's
repression, criticism could still be heard in Lagos, the
bursting-at-the-seams former capital.

GUNMAN FATALLY SHOOTS MAN IN NEW YORK PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Fidel was talking to a few friends late Sunday
night in Carroll Park, a small patch of trees and lawns in a
brownstone-lined section of Brooklyn, when a green car pulled up
and a man with a gun got out.
</P>
<P>
   The man pointed his pistol at Fidel's friends, who were sitting
on a park bench, and ordered them to ``scatter like cockroaches,''
said Lenore Calicchio, 21, Fidel's girlfriend. The gunman then
ordered Fidel, 22, to kneel in front of a park maintenance
building, just a few feet from a playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking Roy, `Do you know this guy? Do you know who he
is?''' Ms. Calicchio said Monday. ``And that's when he shot Roy in
the back of the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunman got into the car and the driver sped off. Fidel, who
was recently convicted on a charge of selling drugs and was
awaiting sentencing in federal court, died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The police described the gunman as a Hispanic male in his late
teens, said Gerry Falcon, a police spokeswoman, but the authorities
had few leads in the execution-style murder Monday. And as
detectives sought clues in Carroll Park Monday afternoon, their
presence stirred both fear and resentment among residents of
Carroll Gardens and nearby Cobble Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is terrible, but it's such an aberration,'' said a
Carroll Gardens resident, Patti Jones, 44, as her 4-year-old son,
Hart, climbed a jungle gym. ``We come here every day. Most of the
time, the older kids aren't here when the younger ones are playing.
The only thing I'm a little worried about is that someone might
strike back in revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   As parents and young children packed the benches and playground
on one side of the park, gathering on the other side were about a
dozen of Fidel's friends, teen-agers whose anger at his murder
quickly turned to disdain for the police officers trying to solve
it. At about 3:30 p.m., as officers posted signs offering a $1,000
reward for information leading to the arrest of Fidel's killer, the
teen-agers heckled the officers, cursing and screaming, ``Don't put
that poster up!''
</P>
<P>
   After a tense exchange between the teen-agers and the police,
Ms. Calicchio convinced her friends to let the officers continue
their work. She quickly added that she had not seen the killer's
face and would not cooperate with the detectives investigating the
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calicchio, who said she had dated Fidel for six years, wept
as she discussed the prospect of raising their 8-month-old
daughter, Angelique, without him. She acknowledged that Fidel had a
minor criminal record, but she said he was trying to find steady
work as a mover, that he had recently earned his general
equivalency degree and was trying to turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't deserve to die this way,'' Ms. Calicchio said.
``This kind of thing doesn't happen here very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidel's grandmother Leatrice Foti said her grandson had run into
some trouble with the law, but was a good-natured person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a thief,'' said Ms. Foti, 63. ``His favorite thing
to do was eat. Anything. As long as it was food. He was a big guy
with a soft heart.''

NEW YORK'S BATTERY PARK CITY PLANS NEW BUILDING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 60 developers have been invited to submit
proposals for a residential building at the northern end of Battery
Park City and are being encouraged to design large apartments for
families, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 300,000-square-foot apartment building is to be located
between Warren Street and Park Place West and alongside River
Terrace. The site will probably accommodate 250 to 300 apartments,
said Enid Feist, the vice president for policy and operations of
the Battery Park City Authority, the public benefit corporation
that is overseeing the development of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The site to be developed is near Stuyvesant High School and a
new school that is opening in the fall. Battery Park City residents
are being given preference for the new school, Public
School/Intermediate School 89.
</P>
<P>
   In its May 29 mailing to developers, the authority notified them
that it ``has a preference for more two- and three-bedroom units
and is seeking developments and apartments whose designs contribute
to better housing for families.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed designs are due by July 24. They will be considered
by a five-member committee, which will make its recommendation to
the authority, Ms. Feist said. She said no decision is expected
before the end of the year.

COFFEE JOINS CHECKING AS SERVICES EXPAND

(Also moving in the ``n'' California and ``a'' national news

By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The banking supermarket is coming, and not over by
the bakery section of your grocery store, either.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are scrambling to broaden the range of products they
offer, led by such fast-moving players as Minneapolis-based Norwest
Corp., which agreed Monday to merge with San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. in a $31.9 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new bank will keep the Wells Fargo moniker, its top
executive will be Norwest's Richard Kovacevich, an executive with
extensive retail background.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger frenzy expected to continue, your branch _ if it
stays open _ could soon be selling everything from insurance to
mutual funds. Chances are good that there will be a coffee bar in
the lobby _ run by Starbucks or maybe Coffee Bean &AMP; Tea Leaf _ and
perhaps a dry cleaner and copy center operating out of the old
vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Wal-Mart model is probably where banking is
going,'' said Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer
Action, a San Francisco-based watchdog organization. ``I believe
we'll see more banks trying to give customers access to services
they wouldn't normally have access to.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the successful bankers will be the ones who shed their
pin stripes for polo shirts and khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't putting up with bad service from banks anymore
because people pay a lot more attention to their finances than they
used to,'' said retail consultant Frederick Marx. ``It doesn't work
for a banker to be laid-back and work banker's hours. You're seeing
them becoming much more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   What banks are starting to do is add time-saving bells and
whistles, according to Kathleen McClave, president of bank
consultants Edward Furash &AMP; Co. ``They have borrowed a page from
retail by making banks into destinations so you can get a lot done
in one place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If that means remaking how a bank should look, so be it.
``People running banks aren't real sentimental and most branches
now have more space than they need, so why not put a Starbucks in
the lobby?'' Marx asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Since banks tend to be located at prime retail locations _
``They're at the corner of Busy and Busy,'' Marx said _ it's not
far-fetched to imagine a bank branch with a real estate office,
Internet service provider and travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest comes to the merger table as one of the nation's best
performers during the past decade, thanks in large part to a
strategy of offering customers a far wider range of products than
rivals while expanding rather than closing sites. It has 930
branches, many in rural towns and most offering home loans and
investment products in addition to the usual checking and savings
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norwest is a big bank that feels small to customers,'' McClave
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nation's top originator and servicer of home
mortgages, and analysts estimate that traditional banking produces
less than 40 percent of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   McDavid Stilwell, an analyst with SNL Securities, cautions that
the new Wells-Norwest is not a guaranteed success. ``Nobody
cross-markets better than Norwest, but I think people should
continue to be skeptical about it,'' he said. ``People want to shop
around because pricing is what guides consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bank will have $191 billion in assets with 20 million
customers and outlets in all 50 states. The deal, expected because
of Wells' poor performance, follows megamergers between BankAmerica
and NationsBank, and Citicorp and Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   More such deals will come among banks and financial service
providers, according to Thomas Theurkauf of Keefe Bruyette Woods.
``We're in the midst of consolidation with thousands of banking
companies that still dot the landscape,'' Theurkauf said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Wells also has been aggressive by closing
traditional branches, opening supermarket outlets, leaving the
mortgage business and experimenting with leasing excess space to
retailers like Starbucks. But it also became a takeover target as
its once-sterling reputation sagged following angry customer
reaction to its poorly executed $11 billion takeover of First
Interstate Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells has lost a lot a credibility,'' Theurkauf said.
</P>
<P>
   Tania Azarchs, an analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's rating service,
said the best outcome will be for the new bank to blend the best of
both. ``Merging is going to be tougher than it appears,'' she said.
``You have to have a well-honed sales staff and the data systems to
target customers effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   That means generating a warmer, fuzzier feeling than rivals. For
example, the clout of the combined banks could enable it to offer a
far wider variety of investment options for those whose
certificates of deposits have reached term. Or it could help
customers pay down high-rate credit cards with a consolidation loan
or a lower-rate card.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's difficult about a merger like this is making local
customers feel as if they're still valued to huge organizations,''
McClave said.

CABBY WHO FLED INDIA FINDS NEW STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Day after day, the view of Balvinder Singh that
people get is the back of his head. So why would anyone think he
has a story to tell? But he does, like everyone else. His life has
excellent, if heartbreaking, plot lines, from his flight from the
1984 pogrom of Sikhs in India to what Singh sees as the strange
persecution of taxi drivers by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani today.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what's in the mayor's mind, and who gives him
ideas, and why he's acting like this,'' Singh said last week, in an
interview in his immaculate taxicab. ``He was not like this.
Everyone liked this mayor. And everyone voted for him. Even the
taxi drivers, they liked him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, 35, is one of the top elected leaders of the United
Yellow Cab Drivers Association, one of the few cabby groups in a
disorganized industry. He is also one of the only taxi leaders to
drive a cab. He owns his own taxi medallion and represents the
largest group of cabbies _ people from India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh _ although nobody knows for certain the number of
immigrants from the subcontinent among the city's 42,000 licensed
drivers. (City estimates range from 40 to 60 percent. Singh says
the number is 75 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter. In the last decade, the turban has become the
symbol of the New York City taxicab driver, just as a Brooklyn
accent was four decades ago. Until now, the industry has been as
fragmented as its ethnic mix, but strict new taxi rules pushed
through by Giuliani are forcing drivers to try to work together _
and creating a new immigrant interest group in New York. A fresh
skirmish in the battle of strikes and protests will probably occur
next week, at another hearing of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi organizers describe Singh as a quiet and thoughtful man who
is the opposite of a self-promoter. No one, at least, would accuse
him of seeking press attention. ``Actually, we all are working the
same,'' he said, dismissing his leadership role. ``I'm not even
doing anything that other people aren't doing. They are working
more than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reach Singh in New York in recent weeks sometimes
felt, in fact, like trying to locate him in Patel Nagar, the
housing colony in New Delhi where he used to live. Calls to the
United Yellow Cab Drivers Association were met with a busy signal
or a recording; callers to Singh's cell phone were informed that he
was outside its range. Singh finally responded to a message left
for him at the office of the mayor's nemesis, Norman Siegel, the
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who is
representing the cabbies.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Singh turned up in his taxi to drive his
interviewer in circles around midtown for a while. Then he stopped
at a diner, and drove around some more.
</P>
<P>
   Does he like driving a cab?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really not,'' Singh said. ``It's not a respectable job.''
</P>
<P>
   What would he prefer? ``Actually,'' Singh said, ``I really want
to be a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh left New Delhi in 1984 when he was 21, after hiding for
four days in a Hindu neighbor's home as thousands of his fellow
Sikhs _ and five of his cousins _ were murdered by Hindu mobs in
revenge for the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Mrs.
Gandhi had been shot to death by two of her Sikh bodyguards, who
were themselves seeking vengeance for Mrs. Gandhi's military
crackdown on secessionist Sikhs in Punjab, where 1,200 died. There
are 18 million Sikhs in India, many of them business people,
members of the military _ and taxi drivers. Their religion emerged
in an 18th-century schism from Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the riots, I really did not want to live in Delhi,''
Singh said. Like other Sikhs at the time, he got rid of his
identifying Sikh characteristics _ his turban and long beard _ to
survive. He left his job as an apprentice technician at a company
that made water meters and other measuring instruments, and by
early 1985, he was picking sweet potatoes in California. Then he
installed windows in New York. ``That business goes very slow,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Singh started driving a taxi in 1990 and got his medallion three
years ago. He is now married, with three children, living in a
one-bedroom apartment in Flushing, Queens. His wife is a window
clerk at a post office in New Jersey; together they make about
$40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said that if taxi owners like himself had to post a
$100,000 bond for accident victims, a proposed rule the commission
has not yet voted on, he would be out of business. ``From where I
bring in the $100,000?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Singh acknowledges the existence of reckless taxi drivers, but
says that the mayor has become too harsh on groups he once
championed. ``In the beginning, he spoke for the immigrant
people,'' Singh said. ``I don't know what happened. His thinking is
good, but his way is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh is now looking for other jobs _ and dreaming through his
6-year-old son. ``The first generation that comes over here, they
have no choice but to do hard work,'' he said. ``Some people get
lucky, but their businesses depend on hard work _ restaurants,
construction. And after that, the next generation, they go with the
American system. Their thinking gets changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What would he like his son to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to be a doctor,'' he said.

hazards, leading patients to choose aggressive therapies that are
useless and increase suffering.

ANALYSIS: AN UNPOPULAR LEADER LEAVES NIGERIANS FEARFUL AND
DIVIDED

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Few Nigerians are in a state of
mourning over the death of Gen. Sani Abacha, a deeply unpopular
leader. But while Nigeria awaits clearer signs of its political
future, nearly all of the nation is in a state of dread.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha's legacy is a demoralized army, a political class whose
leaders have been jailed or driven into exile, and a national
economy that has been looted into penury.
</P>
<P>
   The booby traps he left in the nation's path could violently
rend Africa's most populous country, and send shudders through the
West African nations that gravitate around this regional giant like
so many small moons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military leadership named Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
who was promoted from major general and was formerly defense chief
of staff, as the country's new head of state, the army remains
divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``How divided is this military? It is seriously divided,'' said
Bolaji Akinyemi, a former Nigerian foreign minister. ``What is the
strength of each faction? Nobody knows. What is certain is that
this is a very dangerous moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the very first hints of potential trouble came from
within the Nigerian army itself, when early Monday afternoon
journalists were summoned without explanation to the presidential
compound in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, and then just as suddenly
chased away.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later the military government officially announced the
death of the president, which had taken place early in the day. The
lapse reflected deep divisions at the highest level of command
about the army's immediate and future roles, according to retired
senior officers of the Nigerian military.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha, who was 54, governing in a style bordering on heightened
paranoia, left a military that is both Africa's largest and perhaps
its least unified. Wave after wave of purges of senior officers,
show trials of suspected opponents and long-sustained ethnic
favoritism in the officer corps have left many commanders deeply
demoralized and dangerously suspicious of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many of us who have made our lives in the army
because we were trained to believe that the military had something
vital to offer to the nation,'' said one senior Nigerian general in
a recent interview. ``This, however, does not include politics, and
we have a bunch of officers who come to think of themselves as
permanent politicians. In behaving this way, they are dragging us
all down.''
</P>
<P>
   With feelings this raw and opinions so divided _ between those
who wish to get back to a classic republican army and others who
have for years cherished military power as a way to gain access to
the country's trough of abundant oil wealth _ many now fear an open
and potentially violent split.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Abacha's unexpected death came less than four months before a
long-promised transition to democratic civilian rule. But by the
time he died early Monday, reportedly of a heart attack, even those
who had been temporarily willing to believe in the improbable gift
of a democratic election had long ago concluded that this stern and
secretive military man would destroy the country in his attempt to
keep tight personal control.
</P>
<P>
   The seven military dictatorships that have dominated Nigeria's
history since independence from Britain 1960 have all put forth
plans for a ``transition to democracy.'' Even if the current high
command is able to maintain a reasonably united front and advance
yet another, there is no sign that the country's political class
will meekly sit back and await the results.
</P>
<P>
   Already, in the hours following Abacha's death there have been
impassioned calls for the restoration of the presidential mandate
of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the millionaire businessman who is widely
believed to have won the country's 1993 elections, which the
military then annulled and which international human rights groups
have called the most democratic ever held in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abiola should be invited to head a government of national
unity to organize a sovereign national conference and lead Nigeria
to genuine democracy,'' the Nigerian human rights lawyer, Gani
Fawehinmi told Reuters. ``The Nigerian people will not allow the
military to take over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, already suspecting the military has little intention of
giving up power, have begun to warn of the possibility of spreading
unrest. In the weeks leading to his death, street protests against
the military have erupted into small-scale riots, and opposition
leaders had already announced plans for a series of strikes and
other demonstrations against the army.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians, still haunted by the 30-year-old memories of the
Biafra conflict, one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, have little
difficulty imagining a continuation, indeed acceleration, of their
national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout West Africa, where Nigeria looms huge, whether by
virtue of its 105 million people, its large army or sophisticated
economy, these kinds of scenarios are already causing serious
worry.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, Nigerian soldiers intervened recently to
restore the elected president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who had been
overthrown, and rout a guerrilla force that has been terrorizing
much of the countryside. There, people from street vendors to
government officials expressed fear that disorder in Nigeria would
cause that country to lessen its commitment in Sierra Leone,
perhaps allowing the rebels to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha may have been hated in Nigeria, but he saved us here,''
said one Sierra Leonean journalist. ``If things go badly in
Nigeria, we will surely suffer again.''
</P>
<P>
   In other West African countries mounting concerns about
stability in Nigeria have less to do with Nigerian military
involvements than with fears of a huge refugee outflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is trouble in Nigeria, there is trouble for all of
West Africa,'' said one senior official from Ivory Coast. ``A
sinking Nigeria is big enough to swamp us all.''

COFFEE JOINS CHECKING AS SERVICES EXPAND

(Also moving in the ``f'' financial news file.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The banking supermarket is coming, and not over by
the bakery section of your grocery store, either.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are scrambling to broaden the range of products they
offer, led by such fast-moving players as Minneapolis-based Norwest
Corp., which agreed Monday to merge with San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo &AMP; Co. in a $31.9 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new bank will keep the Wells Fargo moniker, its top
executive will be Norwest's Richard Kovacevich, an executive with
extensive retail background.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger frenzy expected to continue, your branch _ if it
stays open _ could soon be selling everything from insurance to
mutual funds. Chances are good that there will be a coffee bar in
the lobby _ run by Starbucks or maybe Coffee Bean &AMP; Tea Leaf _ and
perhaps a dry cleaner and copy center operating out of the old
vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Wal-Mart model is probably where banking is
going,'' said Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer
Action, a San Francisco-based watchdog organization. ``I believe
we'll see more banks trying to give customers access to services
they wouldn't normally have access to.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the successful bankers will be the ones who shed their
pin stripes for polo shirts and khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't putting up with bad service from banks anymore
because people pay a lot more attention to their finances than they
used to,'' said retail consultant Frederick Marx. ``It doesn't work
for a banker to be laid-back and work banker's hours. You're seeing
them becoming much more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   What banks are starting to do is add time-saving bells and
whistles, according to Kathleen McClave, president of bank
consultants Edward Furash &AMP; Co. ``They have borrowed a page from
retail by making banks into destinations so you can get a lot done
in one place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If that means remaking how a bank should look, so be it.
``People running banks aren't real sentimental and most branches
now have more space than they need, so why not put a Starbucks in
the lobby?'' Marx asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Since banks tend to be located at prime retail locations _
``They're at the corner of Busy and Busy,'' Marx said _ it's not
far-fetched to imagine a bank branch with a real estate office,
Internet service provider and travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest comes to the merger table as one of the nation's best
performers during the past decade, thanks in large part to a
strategy of offering customers a far wider range of products than
rivals while expanding rather than closing sites. It has 930
branches, many in rural towns and most offering home loans and
investment products in addition to the usual checking and savings
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norwest is a big bank that feels small to customers,'' McClave
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nation's top originator and servicer of home
mortgages, and analysts estimate that traditional banking produces
less than 40 percent of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   McDavid Stilwell, an analyst with SNL Securities, cautions that
the new Wells-Norwest is not a guaranteed success. ``Nobody
cross-markets better than Norwest, but I think people should
continue to be skeptical about it,'' he said. ``People want to shop
around because pricing is what guides consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bank will have $191 billion in assets with 20 million
customers and outlets in all 50 states. The deal, expected because
of Wells' poor performance, follows megamergers between BankAmerica
and NationsBank, and Citicorp and Travelers Group.
</P>
<P>
   More such deals will come among banks and financial service
providers, according to Thomas Theurkauf of Keefe Bruyette Woods.
``We're in the midst of consolidation with thousands of banking
companies that still dot the landscape,'' Theurkauf said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Wells also has been aggressive by closing
traditional branches, opening supermarket outlets, leaving the
mortgage business and experimenting with leasing excess space to
retailers like Starbucks. But it also became a takeover target as
its once-sterling reputation sagged following angry customer
reaction to its poorly executed $11 billion takeover of First
Interstate Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells has lost a lot a credibility,'' Theurkauf said.
</P>
<P>
   Tania Azarchs, an analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's rating service,
said the best outcome will be for the new bank to blend the best of
both. ``Merging is going to be tougher than it appears,'' she said.
``You have to have a well-honed sales staff and the data systems to
target customers effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   That means generating a warmer, fuzzier feeling than rivals. For
example, the clout of the combined banks could enable it to offer a
far wider variety of investment options for those whose
certificates of deposits have reached term. Or it could help
customers pay down high-rate credit cards with a consolidation loan
or a lower-rate card.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's difficult about a merger like this is making local
customers feel as if they're still valued to huge organizations,''
McClave said.

FINDING A BREEZE FROM WINDY CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK HIPES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ It might not be the Windy City, but for most
of the patrons at this town's Tin Horn Flats saloon, it's darn
close.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted Chicagoans _ or fans who are passionate about the
Bulls, Bears, Cubs or White Sox _ know it's the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard there was a Chicago bar here and first came in about
five years ago,'' said Dave Muensterman, now the Flats' bar
manager. ``Everybody here is from Chicago. It's loud and crazy and
the people are a big part of the game for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell of Polish sausage dominates as much as the sports
paraphernalia. These days, the joint is jumping thanks to Michael
Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson, looking for the Bulls'
sixth championship of the '90s. The bar stools and Utah fans will
be at a premium for Wednesday's Game 4 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I'm a Chicago fan,'' said L.A.-reared
co-owner Darla Cook, who bought the bar just three months ago. She
looks at the bevy of Bulls jerseys and Nike Air Jordans asking _
pleading _ with a busy Muensterman for another pitcher before the
end of a Game 1 commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a wink, she said: ``I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure how Tin Horn Flats got this way, but nobody's
complaining. The place was a general store when it opened in 1925.
It became a bar in 1938 and the regulars help celebrate 60 years of
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got that nice Chicago feel to it,'' said
Bulls-hat-wearing Steve Frintner, a film distributor from Burbank.
``I mean, I sit down here next to a guy I don't know and we start
talking. It's like you've known people for 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the atmosphere that attracted Cook to purchase the bar. It
also attracts industry types looking for a laid-back, low-profile
place to unwind and watch a game. A pool table, a jukebox and a
patio area are in constant use. A framed photo of Wrigley Field
leans behind the bar like some sort of shrine, needing only candles
and a Budweiser bottle for worshiping purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in Chicago, we go to some of the local bars on the
North Side,'' said Victoria Easley, a radio newswriter reared in
Peoria, Ill. ``It's got that same type of feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The noise ebbs and flows depending on the action. It was hot and
heavy Wednesday, when the Bulls hung around into overtime before
falling 88-85 in a tight, defensive battle.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a social place, it's a diehard sports bar. The
fans here know the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's generally the case,'' said Frintner, a
South-sider, between referee complaints. ``I have four sisters and
they know as much about football and basketball as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The people are fanatical, yes, but mean-spirited, no. Last year,
a group of unsuspecting Jazz fans wandered through the
Western-style swinging front doors. It took a full half before they
figured they were in the wrong place and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK with them,'' said Easley, who first came looking for
a place to act the fool without being worried about the reaction.
``We kind of gave them the vibe that they were in the wrong place,
but we didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cook: ``There's never any trouble here. Everyone is so
nice. It's like being around your family all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason any and all types are welcome at her joint, a
haven for all things Chicago. And that means everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that there was a girl shot here in 1928,'' Cook
said. ``They say that her spirit still floats around here.''
</P>
<P>
   You can bet season tickets to the United Center that she's a
Bulls fan. &QL;

BANK MERGER TOUTED AS WISE INVESTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. admitted it made mistakes in its
integration of First Interstate Bank, but assured consumers that
the same thing won't happen during its merger with Norwest Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, officials with both companies emphasized during
Monday's announcement of their $31.9 billion merger that this is a
marriage of complementary companies, not the shotgun-wedding of
competing companies that bogged down the Wells Fargo-First
Interstate merger.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo of San Francisco and Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis
will merge in a stock-for-stock deal to form the nation's
seventh-largest bank in terms of asset size and the third-biggest
in California based on market share.
</P>
<P>
   Each Wells Fargo common share will be exchanged for 10 Norwest
common shares. Wells Fargo shareholders will end up owning 52.5
percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and based in San
Francisco, will have $191 billion in assets, more than 90,000
employees, 20 million customers and 5,777 financial services
offices worldwide, which include bank branches in 21 states.
Company officials said layoffs will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage gives Norwest a big distribution network in
California while giving Wells Fargo a nationwide presence.
</P>
<P>
   While the merger will give Wells Fargo a mortgage lending and
servicing arm, customers won't notice much change since Wells Fargo
already refers people to lenders it works with, including Norwest,
said Glen Grabelsky, a bank analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Since few Norwest and Wells Fargo operations overlap, there
shouldn't be the kind of systems problems in this merger that
occurred during the First Interstate takeover, Grabelsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest does not have any bank branches in California, but it
does have mortgage lending offices that are expected to remain
open. Wells Fargo does not offer mortgage loans or services
directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integration issues with Wells, we believe, are largely behind
the company,'' Grabelsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's troubles in absorbing First Interstate since the
1996 merger have cut into its earnings. For instance, a charge
related to incorrect posting of customer deposits led to a
second-quarter 1997 operating loss of $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to integrate the company too fast,'' said Wells Fargo
Chairman and CEO Paul Hazen, who will be chairman of the combined
bank. ``We did the entire systems integration in four months and
that was too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, ``we're taking three years to complete this merger.
We're very conservative, very measured, very focused on ensuring it
happens smoothly, without interruption in customer service,'' said
Richard Kovacevich, chairman and chief executive of Norwest, who
will become president and CEO of the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest's stock dropped 2 7/8 (seven-eighths) to close at 36
13/16 (thirteen-sixteenths) on Monday's news while Wells Fargo's
jumped by 2 1/2 (one-half) to 365 3/4 (three-fourths). Kovacevich
said that once investors realize the true value of the deal, share
prices should rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until people can understand this story and how exciting this
is, and the value that will be created as a result of this, (the
decline) doesn't surprise me at all,'' he said. ``This is an
awesome, awesome franchise.''

Jazz tries to get over embarrassment
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silver lining: Team has made habit of responding successfully in
Game 4
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ There have been several times when trying to beat the
Bulls was almost a joke.
</P>
<P>
   But there has never been anything like Sunday's 42-point laugher
at the United Center in Game 3 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one microscopic bit of hope the Utah Jazz can take
from that game, it's that things can't get any worse.
</P>
<P>
   Can they?
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Jerry Sloan certainly hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a couple of tables back there in the training room so
guys could lay back and rest while we watched the films _ in case
anybody gets sick,'' said Sloan of that 96-54 loss to the Bulls
that put Chicago up 2-1 in the best-of-seven series that resumes at
the United Center on Wednesday. ``So we'll take a look at that.
Hopefully, that (the films) will help them a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz set a slew of NBA Finals records in Sunday's loss,
including fewest points in a game, fewest points in a second half
(23), fewest points in a fourth quarter (nine), fewest players in
double-figure scoring (one, Karl Malone with 22) and fewest field
goals in a game (21).
</P>
<P>
   Monday's questions prior to Jazz practice centered on whether
the Bulls were running up the score. The Bulls scored just 96
points, but it certainly seemed like a lot more, especially to
Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that all they scored _ 96 points?'' he asked. ``Is that
really all? I thought they had 196 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the run-up-the-score questions was that Jud
Buechler and Steve Kerr were jacking up 3-pointers in the fourth
quarter with the Bulls up by more than 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely has to be some motivation, because they were
having a good time, and they were obviously still taking 3s when
the game was well out of hand,'' Malone said. ``Over here on our
side, our coach would have a fit if we did that. But it's the
championship, so you can't feel sorry about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to feel sorry about it. We got it handed to
us, without a doubt, so you give them credit for that. If this
can't get you motivated, nothing else can. So we're looking forward
to the game on Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   File those questions, and the answer, in the ``searching for
motivation'' file.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point was whether Utah was running down the score.
The Jazz shot just 30 percent Sunday (21-of-70), and that's with
Malone hitting eight of his 11 shots. Nobody else on the team hit
more than three field goals. Other than Malone, the other four Jazz
starters combined to hit just six of 26 attempts from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And if you tack on the fourth quarter from Friday's Game 2, in
which the Jazz scored 15 points, Utah has eked out just 69 points
in five quarters of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment for all of us,'' Sloan said. ``I take
responsibility for that. That's what I've always done.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does Sloan do now? Nothing, if you listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't motivate players,'' he said. ``They have to motivate
themselves. I've always had that philosophy, and I think that
(motivation) is the most overused word in sports. I'll say that
again. A player has to motivate himself. He has to want to play
hard and want to succeed, and if he doesn't and that's not very
important to him, then he is probably not going to perform well.
That comes from within yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   While certainly not on the level of Sunday's humiliation, the
Jazz has had a history of Game 3 pratfalls in the past few years,
only to respond with terrific fourth games. Last year, the Los
Angeles Lakers pounded the Jazz by 20 points in Game 3 of the
Western Conference semifinals, but Utah came back with a 110-95
victory in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Who in Houston can forget Utah losing Game 3 to the Rockets in
the Western Conference quarterfinals, only to have the Jazz bounce
back and take Game 4 by 22 points?
</P>
<P>
   And in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals this year, San
Antonio routed the Jazz 86-64, but Utah responded in Game 4,
hammering out an 82-73 victory in the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (Sunday's loss) was nothing to lose sleep over,'' said Greg
Ostertag, who started Game 3 in place of Greg Foster, who has
started every other playoff game for the Jazz this season. ``We had
a bad game and got our butts kicked. So far this year, we've been
really strong in Game 4s, and now it's just a matter of coming out
strong for Game 4. We're not letting this affect the way we play.
We're putting this behind us now, and we're coming to play the way
we're capable of playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing to get beat like that. It's over. All we can
do is watch film and see where we went wrong, come out and make
what changes we have to. If those changes are to play harder and
more aggressively, then maybe that's what we need to do. I think
Wednesday's game will be a much better game.''
</P>
<P>
   One would hope so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be in your heart and mentally,'' Bryon Russell
said. ``All the little adjustments in the world won't help if we
don't come out and play. If you don't have any heart, you shouldn't
even be out there. I'm sure we'll be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when it rains, it pours, and this one had thunder and
lightning, too. That's what happened.''

 0609 &HT;    Martinez comeback is for record and nation
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dennis Martinez goes for history tonight. He will try
to become the winningest Latin American pitcher of all time when he
pitches for the Braves against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   He does not care if he receives congratulations from Juan
Marichal, the man with whom he shares the record with 243 wins.
</P>
<P>
   It will be enough for him to have taught the baseball world a
geography lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a country that nobody knew where it was at the
beginning (of my career),'' Martinez said. ``I lived with this. I
lived for somebody to say, `that man is from Nicaragua. Now we know
where it's at. Central America, a tiny country. Basically, that's
why I think the Nicaraguan people are proud about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already been celebrated by his country. Last week,
Nicaraguan Ambassador Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa honored him when the
Braves were in Baltimore to play the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has turned around his season since moving into the
starting rotation in place of the injured John Smoltz. In his first
six games, he was 1-2 with a 10.05 ERA. In his last 12 games, since
April 24, Martinez is 1-0 with a 1.11 ERA, striking out 21 in 32
1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is perseverance,'' he said. ``I've been trying to
show that I'm healthy, that I can still win at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is 43, and he's been pitching professionally for 24
years. But he said he only became aware of the Latin American
record in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I first heard about it when I got to the '95 World
Series with the Indians.'' he said. ``That's when I start passing
Luis Tiant. And the stats in the media guide told me I was the
second winning pitcher among Latin pitchers and there were numbers
that were reachable. Before that, I never had thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he is friends with Marichal, but he seems a bit
annoyed that the former San Francisco Giants pitcher hasn't
acknowledged his tying the record. Marichal has been quoted as
saying he was offended that Martinez would try a comeback (after an
elbow injury) just to get the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good friend of mine,'' Martinez said. ``But I heard
some comments that he made when I first decided to come back, which
I never expected anything like that from him. We all have different
personalities. He may try to (inspire) me by saying that or maybe
he was trying to make me quit. I don't know which way it was. I
took it the positive way, it motivated me more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record was basically why I did come back. I do remember
when I left this game, it was because of the injury that I had in
my elbow. Before I got hurt, I was successful. Now finally I feel
better, the injuries disappear, I recover real well, I've worked
hard for it.''

MOSES TRIES THE SHOTGUN APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the same booming voice he used when playing Moses, Charlton
Heston, new president of the National Rifle Association, has told
the American people, ``Fellow citizens, IGNORE THE DEAD CHILDREN IN
THE SCHOOLYARD! Pay no attention to the blood, the gore and, most
especially, THE GUNS!!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those weren't his exact words.
</P>
<P>
   What Heston actually said last week was, ``Mr. Clinton, sir,
America didn't trust you with our health care system. America
didn't trust you with gays in the military. We did not trust you
with our 21-year-old daughters, and we sure, Lord, don't trust you
with our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who study the art of war, this was a classic
diversionary tactic. At least it would have been a classic if it
had worked.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Dead children can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The very first thing a newly elected president of the NRA should
talk about is the problem of guns and kids. Instead, Heston tried
to get you to take your eye off the ball.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who speaks unbearably about the right to bear arms,
he can't bear to bring up the carnage in Springfield, Jonesboro,
Edinboro, Fayetteville, Pomona, Paducah, Pearl and Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't blame him.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to care about middle America, about small towns, about
a world last seen on the old ``Andy Griffith Show,'' which in 1998
would have to be re-named ``Massacre in Mayberry''.
</P>
<P>
   So, rather than face the grim truth, he tries to change the
subject, to ridicule homosexuals and the president. Anything to
keep you from the fact that the firearm death rate for kids younger
than 15 is 12 times higher in the United States than the rest of
the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   The guns are out there.
</P>
<P>
   The children are out there.
</P>
<P>
   And the NRA is way, WAY out there.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to what Heston said about the Second Amendment:
</P>
<P>
   ``Among freedom of speech, of the press, of religion, of
assembly, of redress of grievances, it (the Second Amendment) is
the first among equals. It alone offers the absolute capacity to
live without fear. The right to keep and bear arms is the one right
that allows rights to exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns above free speech?
</P>
<P>
   Above assembly?
</P>
<P>
   Above the justice system?
</P>
<P>
   Above religion?
</P>
<P>
   Above God?
</P>
<P>
   It's like, in this version of the movie, Moses comes down from
Mount Sinai to find his followers worshiping a golden assault
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact is, the U.S. Department of Education reported that
6,000 students were expelled nationwide for bringing firearms to
school during the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Most weapons used in school murders come from home.
</P>
<P>
   Adults aren't much different. A survey by the Criminal Justice
Research Center found that only 27 percent of adult inmates said
they'd bought a gun on the ``black market.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy availability of weapons is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Heston could have attacked that problem. He could have tried to
find the middle ground Middle America is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he chose to attack Bill Clinton and gays, scattering
his shot wildly rather than taking careful aim at a deadly dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem is too abstract for the actor. Maybe Ben Hur
needs a dose of reality. Maybe he needs to visit 41st and Ruth
avenues in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at about 11 p.m., a car passed a group of teenagers
from that neighborhood. Gang signs were flashed from inside the car
but went unrecognized. A young man got out with a shotgun and fired
into the crowd, killing honor students Renelyn Simmons and Andre
Bradley. It made no sense. The shotgun approach never does. &QL;

ON BASEBALL: A SUPPORT GROUP OF NOMO'S VERY OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is much about Hideo Nomo that gets lost in translation,
and not just because of the language barrier that has separated the
Japanese pitcher from almost every element surrounding him in his
major-league career. Even if Nomo woke up today with the ability to
speak perfect English, that would not assure that the right-hander
would suddenly be any less unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo has been reserved from the day he arrived on the
major-league scene and single-handedly opened up the market to
adventurous and able Asian athletes. Nomomania may have had its
manic aspects. The pitcher never has.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he has fallen to a 2-7 record this season, one the
Dodgers were willing to trade, and Nomo succinctly said, ``I'm
getting hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``If I knew that, I'd be shutting out everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A David Cone, a Randy Johnson, even a sometimes taciturn Roger
Clemens would most likely spend more than nine words on such
questions. For Nomo, though, such discourses are tantamount to a
flood. This impenetrable and private aspect of Nomo existed during
his halcyon days with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances it will not change during the next phase of
his career, which kicks off Tuesday night when Nomo makes his
pitching debut for the Mets against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's inner sanctum, his island of peace, remains all but
untouchable. Fortunately for the Mets, they are probably the only
major-league team, including the Dodgers, that has the small
handful of people Nomo ever allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is Mike Piazza, the recently acquired All-Star
catcher, who was a teammate of Nomo's on the Dodgers. There is also
Dave Wallace, who was the pitching coach when Nomo joined the
Dodgers and won them over thanks to a sensational rookie season.
And finally there is Masato Yoshii, the pitcher who is a fellow
graduate of the Japanese major leagues, a former teammate and, of
no small importance, Nomo's very good friend.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher. Pitching guru. Kindred spirit. The Mets have engineered
this multitiered reunion, counting on it to make a difference not
only in the life of a pitcher hoping to reverse a slide, but also
for a rotation that has only one glaring hole to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, Bobby Jones and Yoshii are fine. So to is Rick Reed,
who Monday night retired the first 20 Devil Rays he faced in coming
within seven outs of a perfect game before Wade Boggs doubled. Nomo
need not be perfect. He is being asked to do only better than Dave
Mlicki, who was 1-4 before being traded in the Nomo deal June 5.
</P>
<P>
   The team did not bring Nomo, Wallace, Piazza and Yoshii together
after long, mapped-out planning. These multitiered reunions are the
result of many an intriguing coincidence. If they work, the Mets
will have every right to call them wondrous.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever unfolds Tuesday night and beyond for Nomo, the Mets
have to be comforted by the presence of so many who will at least
be able to read the signs. Wallace started that Monday when he
interpreted one of Nomo's more cryptic responses at his first news
conference in New York. The pitcher turned more than one head with
his response when asked if he could be a winner again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell,'' Nomo said with the help of an
interpreter. ``There are so many things I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that false modesty? Or was it shattered confidence because
of a 2-7 record and a 5.05 earned run average. Neither, assured
Wallace, now the special assistant to the Mets' general manager,
Steve Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reserved Hideo Nomo,'' he said. ``You'll come to
know that he's pretty quiet in his thoughts, and he doesn't reveal
a lot of stuff. It takes a while to really get to know him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wallace insists that it will be worth the wait, though. ``My
thoughts are very strong that to shake him mentally takes quite a
bit,'' he said. ``So I think he's fine from that standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wallace; the Mets' pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, and Manager
Bobby Valentine will concentrate on the mechanics, the A-B-C's of
pitching. Yet they will not underestimate the more esoteric aspects
of this deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoshii-Nomo friendship, Valentine said, is important if only
to give Nomo a person to talk baseball with without a translator.
``I can only imagine, but I've got to think that is a real bonus,
to experience things together,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Piazza, Wallace praised the catcher for understanding
early not only Nomo's standing in the baseball community _
well-established in Japan _ but also the pitcher's personality and
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is very good,'' Wallace said. ``One based on
mutual respect. Mike communicated with him. And Hideo, as people
will get to know, is a guy that if you respect where he comes from
and what he does, and his privacy, he will open up a little bit.
And Mike did that. Mike got the best out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Wallace, whose mere mention causes Nomo do to the
unusual and reveal some of his feelings. ``Dave Wallace has been
very important in my development,'' the pitcher said with obvious
gratitude. ``When I first came to the Dodgers, I didn't speak a
word of English, yet he understood me very well.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nomo that may be half the battle, one already won by three
other Mets who can only hope to help the pitcher get back to
winning the only way he knew how.

live without fear. The right to keep and bear arms is the one right
that allows rights to exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns above free speech?
</P>
<P>
   Above assembly?
</P>
<P>
   Above the justice system?
</P>
<P>
   Above religion?
</P>
<P>
   Above God?
</P>
<P>
   It's like, in this version of the movie, Moses comes down from
Mount Sinai to find his followers worshiping a golden assault
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact is, the U.S. Department of Education reported that
6,000 students were expelled nationwide for bringing firearms to
school during the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Most weapons used in school murders come from home.
</P>
<P>
   Adults aren't much different. A survey by the Criminal Justice
Research Center found that only 27 percent of adult inmates said
they'd bought a gun on the ``black market.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy availability of weapons is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Heston could have attacked that problem. He could have tried to
find the middle ground Middle America is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he chose to attack Bill Clinton and gays, scattering
his shot wildly rather than taking careful aim at a deadly dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem is too abstract for the actor. Maybe Ben Hur
needs a dose of reality. Maybe he needs to visit 41st and Ruth
avenues in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at about 11 p.m., a car passed a group of teenagers
from that neighborhood. Gang signs were flashed from inside the car
but went unrecognized. A young man got out with a shotgun and fired
into the crowd, killing honor students Renelyn Simmons and Andre
Bradley. It made no sense. The shotgun approach never does. &QL;

O'DONNELL SHOOTS FROM THE LIP  
 MUSICAL PRINCE  
 MUSCLES WON'T WAIT  
 SEEN AND HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH GLENN COLLINS AND STEWART KAMPEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The people in the audience for the Tony Awards at
Radio City Music Hall must have wondered if they had wandered onto
``The Jerry Springer Show.'' Rosie O'Donnell, the talk show diva
and Springer competitor who was the MC for the awards show,
ad-libbed shoot-from-the-lip patter that the folks in television
land did not see because she delivered it only during the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   First Ms. O'Donnell referred to Fran and Barry Weissler,
producers of the hit musical ``Chicago'' and the 1994 Broadway
revival of ``Grease'' (in which Ms. O'Donnell starred as the
salty-mouthed Betty Rizzo), as ``the cheapest people in the free
world.'' She also mimicked Mrs. Weissler's distinctive
pronunciation of ``darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Weissler leapt from his seat, but not to object. He took a bow.
He waved. Then the commercial ended, the cameras came back on and
Ms. O'Donnell returned to the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take ourselves seriously,'' Mrs. Weissler said
Monday. ``We thought it was hilarious. Everyone is talking about
the Tonys and about us, so what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell said she had intended her comments to be
affectionate. Of Mrs. Weissler, she said, ``She's like a mother
figure to me, and I will tease her forever about the fact that
they're cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   During later commercials, Ms. O'Donnell sometimes lapsed into
language not printable in a newspaper. She had unkind words for
everyone from Charlton Heston, the new president of the National
Rifle Association (she suggested that he star in a musical called
``Everybody Get Your Gun''), to Nancy Reagan (``looks like a human
Pez dispenser'').
</P>
<P>
   Royal Overture
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan so liked what he heard at a New
York Philharmonic concert (which opened the Minato Mirai 21 hall in
Yokohama, Japan) that he made overtures about playing with the
orchestra. Apparently, the crown prince, who attended the concert
with Crown Princess Masako, is serious about his viola.
</P>
<P>
   In a backstage huddle after the performance, he and the
Philharmonic's music director, Kurt Masur, talked repertoire. They
zeroed in on the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 by Bach and the Octet
in E flat (Op. 20) by Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a catch. ``Your Highness must still audition,''
Masur said.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: The crown prince has not given up his day job.
</P>
<P>
   No-Wait Workout
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Billy Crystal wanted barbells. In his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   He got them, but not from room service. Crystal, the actor and
comedian who is in New York to appear in the film ``Analyze This''
with Robert DeNiro, went shopping with a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typical New York, everything right immediately,'' said Richard
Miller, an owner of the Gym Source, a workout equipment store on
East 52nd Street where Crystal rented not only barbells but also a
bench. ``Took the stuff right off the floor. We said, `We'll
deliver it tomorrow.' They said, `No, no, we're working out in five
minutes.' They put it in the back of a big Suburban he was in, and
went over to the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen and Heard In the Hamptons
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gelman, executive producer of the midmorning talk show
``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' was seen surveying the ocean at
Atlantica, a restaurant in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. ``We had heard
that `Good Morning America' was interested in doing some shows from
there,'' said a man who works for the restaurant, ``and now, all of
a sudden, Gelman is here.'' ... Bryan Bantry, the fashion agent and
producer, had a showing of the new George Clooney-Jennifer Lopez
film ``Out of Control'' in the thick-carpeted screening room in his
home in Wainscott, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who settled into Bantry's comfortable seats (and
then went to supper at Alison by the Beach, a nearby restaurant)
were Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine ``60 Minutes''; Nina
Griscom, a former host on the Food Network who has summered in the
Hamptons since she was a child, and Bill Beutel, an anchor on
WABC-TV who has a home in Westhampton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he had liked the film, Beutel was diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice party, isn't it?'' he said.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Finally, some good news for Pedro Borbon.
</P>
<P>
   The once heavily relied-on reliever who hasn't pitched in a
major-league game in almost 22 months took a big step in his rehab
Monday as he was moved from the Class A Macon, Ga. team to the club
in Class AA Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Still recovering from reconstructive elbow surgery, Borbon's
numbers have not been terribly impressive, with a 9.00 ERA in three
games at Macon, though all the runs (three) came in one appearance.
But there isn't any pain and his control has been good, walking
just one of the 14 batters he has faced.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon still does not have the velocity he had before the
injury, now throwing his fastball at around 84 mph. However, his
control has been good and he said, ``I still have to build the
velocity, but it will come.''
</P>
<P>
   If Borbon can get healthy by the end of the summer it would be a
huge bonus for a club whose bullpen is still its shakiest part.
Fortunately, so far the starting pitching has been so good and the
offense has scored so many runs that on most evenings the Braves
haven't had to rely on their group of relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Mark Wohlers continues to be befuddled with control
problems, and while Kerry Ligtenberg has been effective, he has
been miserable on some nights, an inconsistency that can quickly
shoot down a good team in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Also headed to Greenville
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Smoltz will begin his rehab assignment
Wednesday at Greenville, then going to Macon for another start
Sunday. If all goes well, Smoltz is expected to throw three innings
in each game, then the club may pencil him back in the Atlanta
rotation for a start on June 19 in Montreal. Smoltz, who has been
bothered by pain in his right elbow after undergoing surgery last
December, said, ``It's my goal to pitch without pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanted here
</P>
<P>
   One opposing player who always likes returning to Atlanta is Red
Sox catcher Jim Leyritz, who in the 1996 World Series broke this
city's heart when he hit a Game 4 homer that sparked the Yankees to
a world championship. ``It was my greatest personal moment,''
Leyritz said. ``But winning it all back in New York was my greatest
moment in sports.'' Leyritz, who played his college baseball at
Middle Georgia, still has the ball he hit off Wohlers for the
homer, along with the bat and jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Honors for Mad Dog
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Greg Maddux was named co-National League player of
the week along with Sammy Sosa of the Cubs. Maddux was 2-0 last
week, allowing two runs on nine hits and striking out 14 in 18
innings. This is the sixth time in his career that Maddux has won
the award. Sosa hit six homers last week.
</P>
<P>
   Around the park
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and Braves had faced each other just three times
before Monday night but that was hard to tell before the game as
players and management from each team spent time together. Of
course, the Red Sox clubhouse has more Georgia flavor than any
other club in baseball, including three former Georgia Tech players
(Nomar Garciaparra, Darren Bragg and Jason Varitek) and also five
who have ties to the Braves _ manager Jimy Williams, coach Grady
Little, pitcher Steve Avery and second baseman Mark Lemke. Avery
even went on the field during Atlanta's batting practice, spending
time with his former rotation mates. ... So much for the myth that
Turner Field is a pitchers' park: Andres Galarraga has hit 10 of
his 23 home runs at home and is hitting .333 here compared with
.301 on the road. ... Courtesy of Reebok, Galarraga was wearing a
jersey in batting practice with the words ``Big Cat'' written
across the chest. ... On Friday Tom Glavine will hold his annual
sports memorabilia auction for the Georgia Counsel on Child Abuse.
The auction will be held on the Steve &AMP; Vicki morning show on Star
94 with bids taken over the telephone. A few of the items will
include a Mark McGwire bat and a Titanic poster signed by many of
the movie's stars, including Leonardo DiCaprio. ... Infielder
Rafael Belliard, who has been out since April 9 with torn
quadriceps, may go on a rehab assignment next week. ... Braves
manager Bobby Cox on Avery's seven innings of shutout ball Sunday
night against the Mets: ``I was tickled pink, especially not to
have to come in here and answer questions about what is wrong with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia pitcher signs
</P>
<P>
   Zack Frachiseur signed a minor-league contract with the Braves
and will be assigned to the organization's Class A team in Eugene,
Ore. Frachiseur, who recently completed his junior season at the
University of Georgia, was selected by the Braves in the 19th round
of last week's baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   The former Rockdale County, Ga. standout was the ace of
Georgia's staff, leading the team in strikeouts and innings pitched
each of the past two seasons. He posted a 6-7 record and 5.38 ERA
this spring for a team that finished 24-30.

WNBA CAN'T AFFORD DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You know how it is with kid sisters. They'll
obstinately try to keep pace with their big brothers, no matter how
gaping the age difference. So it is with the WNBA, which is 47
years younger than the NBA and already showing a precocity that is
truly scary.
</P>
<P>
   As the women of the NBA get their second season under way this
week, there are signs everywhere of the strides they're making to
catch up with their richer, more renowned male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The league has shot up physically, adding two more teams, in
Detroit and Washington D.C. Growth is good, but some of the
so-called signs of maturity are as attractive as acne. In Phoenix,
the Mercury repaid the fans who made the team the league's top draw
by raising ticket prices. A necessary evil, said one team
executive, ``to remain competitive with the rest of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a head start on the competition, some agents are swooping
in on the top collegiate players, slipping business cards into
their hands and whispering sweet salutations in the ears of even
those who have one, two and three years of eligibility remaining.
The agents are bloodhounds smelling dollar signs, hot on the trail
of players such as the reigning player of the year Chamique
Holdsclaw, who reportedly could command an estimated $10 million in
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   And the scent of money already has some high school players
swooning. Rising senior Nina Smith, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound center
from Waterloo West High in Iowa, is said to be contemplating a leap
straight from preps to the pros. She would have to wage a legal
battle to do so, since both the WNBA and its rival league, the ABL,
have rules against accepting players of college age or younger. But
where there's Spencer Haywood, who successfully challenged a
similar NBA rule in 1971, there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, from New York comes the word that a players' union
possibly is in the offing. The better to raise the low-end salaries
and, as New York Liberty standout Rebecca Lobo explained, ``to keep
the game pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question, pure as what? The Hudson River?
</P>
<P>
   Last year you could buy T-shirts that bragged on the WNBA,
boldly making the claim, ``INVENTED BY MAN, PERFECTED BY WOMAN.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the original idea, anyway _ for women to adopt all that
is terrific about pro sports. Namely the opportunity to play for
decent pay and pay back the surrounding community in myriad ways
while steadfastly refusing to follow their male counterparts down
the path of avarice and arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding principle was supposed to be that standby of mothers
everywhere: Just because your big brother dives headfirst into
shallow water, does that mean you should?
</P>
<P>
   But where there's money, there's the potential for greed. Where
there's popularity, there are outside pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Until just recently, the athletic careers of females came with
an expiration date that coincided with either their high school or
college graduations. Because female athletes knew they couldn't
bank on their sporting prowess, they had no choice but to pursue
alternate ambitions, which they did oftentimes with the same
discipline and determination they brought to the athletic arena.
</P>
<P>
   The result were women with a head start in the game of life,
high achievers such as Sparks rookie Allison Feaster. She took her
academics seriously enough to pursue, at her own expense, an Ivy
League education at Harvard. She wound up with a job offer on Wall
Street, as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Her 9-to-5 job is on hold while she plays out her basketball
career. Feaster has set herself up for success no matter how many
points she averages for the Sparks this or any subsequent season.
But what of future generations? With money to be made in sports,
will they follow the lead of Feaster or waver like Waterloo West's
Smith?
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the tunnel vision that has blinded so many male
athletes, the course for the WNBA is clear:
</P>
<P>
   __ Scotch any plans to form a players' union. If it's higher
salaries the players want, there's a ready answer: the ABL. Last
year, WNBA salaries averaged between $20,000 and $40,000, with the
six-figure salaries of a select few skewing the total picture. In
the ABL, salaries in the first year fell between $40,000 and
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL has survived two years playing when the sports calendar
is overcrowded, soldiering on despite a minimal marketing budget.
The ABL needs the NBA's publicity arm and the WNBA's summer
schedule. The WNBA could use the ABL's star players.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of the two leagues would be one made in hoops
heaven, provided the executives of both leagues put aside their
egos long enough to hammer out a prenuptial agreement that is
acceptable to both parties. United, women's pro basketball can
prosper. Divided, it's the 1997-98 Lakers, laden with potential but
laced with too many individual agendas to have staying power.
</P>
<P>
   __ Refrain from resorting to base instincts. The only black eye
the WNBA should have should come courtesy of smudged mascara. The
last thing the league needs is for another incident like the one
that occurred last year, when Nancy Liebermann-Cline executed a
headlock on the Sparks' Jamila Wideman.
</P>
<P>
   The sport eventually will be pinned if players persist in acting
more like Alonzo Mourning than Ann Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Implement a certification process for agents, and fast. The
only people handing college players slips of paper should be young
fans seeking autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: In an age full of young girls trying to follow
in the footsteps of their big sisters in the pros, the only beaten
path should be the straight and narrow one.

REED GETS WITHIN SEVEN OUTS OF PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rick Reed keeps making the art of pitching look so
simple. But Monday night was a little numbing even for him. Just
about every pitch had a purpose or slithered into the strike zone.
Just about every Tampa Bay batter wondered how the Mets'
right-hander, so coolly efficient, was so dominating with pitches
that looked so hittable.
</P>
<P>
   Reed unleashed two-seam and four-seam fastballs to start off,
fooled batters with his sinker or his slider and mixed in his
curveball. But regardless of what pitches Reed threw, they almost
always managed to brush the corner of the strike zone or come so
achingly close that they were impossible for the batters to let go.
</P>
<P>
   Inning after crisp inning, Reed tamed the Devil Rays in pitching
the Mets to a three-hit 3-0 victory at Shea Stadium. He retired
three in a row, then six, nine, 15, 18 and 20 straight. There were
two outs in the seventh, and Reed was seven outs from completing
his pursuit of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   To finish the seventh inning and carry his masterpiece into the
eighth, though, Reed needed to retire Wade Boggs, the five-time
former American League batting champion with the keen eye. At 2-2,
Reed fired a pitch just below Boggs' knees. It was so close that
Boggs flinched, and he hesitated to peek at Larry Vanover. The
plate umpire did not raise his arm for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs plastered the next pitch over Brian McRae and off the
center-field warning track for a ground rule double.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have never had a no-hitter in their 36-year history,
and Reed's terrific 20-batter sequence before Boggs' hit was five
short of Tom Seaver's team record of 25 straight retired from the
start of a game, which Seaver did against the Chicago Cubs on July
9, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when Mike Piazza returned to the lineup after
missing three games against Boston with a bruised left hand and
bashed a mammoth homer off the hapless and luckless Dennis
Springer. But Piazza was a footnote. The big news was that Reed
(7-3) settled for the shutout spiced with 10 strikeouts. He is 6-1
with a 1.21 earned run average in his last eight starts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Boggs' double, Reed walked Fred McGriff before pumping a
1-2 pitch past Paul Sorrento to end the seventh. Reed surrendered
singles to Dave Martinez and Mike DiFelice to start the eighth, but
his 10th strikeout and gorgeous plays by Rey Ordonez at shortstop
and Bernard Gilkey in left helped preserve the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had faced one of his toughest challenges in the fifth
inning after McGriff checked his swing on a low 2-2 pitch. McGriff
fouled off a pitch before lining a fastball back at Reed. The
pitcher, who was just completing his delivery, stuck out his glove
while still crouching and grabbed the ball for the first out. It
was the sort of play that makes everyone in the dugout look at each
other with raised eyebrows, thinking, maybe, just maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The fans must have sensed that something special was transpiring
in the fourth inning, because they howled as if it were October
when Boggs dribbled a grounder to Carlos Baerga for the third out.
It was as routine a play as a second baseman will ever make, but
the fans realized that it ended another inning and kept the pursuit
of perfection percolating.
</P>
<P>
   Reed did not waste time on the mound _ the game took only 2
hours 18 minutes. He rarely moved off the pitching rubber and was
waiting for the signal from Piazza the moment the ball returned to
his glove. He started the game by getting Quinton McCracken to
stare at a 1-2 fastball for strike three. Four pitches, one out and
the first of many baffled hitters who thought that Greg Maddux was
suddenly wearing a Mets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The trend continued as Reed worked fast and achieved quick
results. If the Devil Rays had a plan of attack against Reed, it
never showed. He barely had to sweat in the third, tossing nine
pitches to register a pair of three-pitch strikeouts sandwiched
around Kevin Stocker's unsuccessful bunt attempt. It was only the
third inning, and Stocker was desperate enough to try to steal a
hit with a bunt. Maybe he knew something. Maybe he knew Reed would
make it look simple.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   By losing Monday night, Dennis Springer (2-10) of the Devil Rays
gained an unwanted and dubious distinction: The knuckleballer has
lost more games (10) in the last two months than the entire Yankee
team has (nine). ... The Mets had an unexpected visitor as
outfielder-designated hitter Ruben Sierra arrived unannounced at
Shea Stadium in search of a job. Sierra, who was released by the
Chicago White Sox on May 25 after hitting .216 with four homers and
11 runs batted in, said, ``I can help this team if they give me a
chance.'' But the former Yankee, who played for Bobby Valentine in
Texas, failed in his attempt to meet with General Manager Steve
Phillips. ``We have no interest,'' Phillips said.

1 DEAD, 9 HURT IN QUEENS FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fire that engulfed a home in Queens early Monday
killed one person and left at least nine others injured, and city
officials said that the home _ meant to house only two families _
had been illegally subdivided into six apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Monday night that the fire had been
intentionally set from the first floor. ``Some sort of flammable
liquid appeared to be used,'' Frank Gribbon, a spokesman for the
Fire Department, said.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Tarshena Simmons, said she was awakened by screams
at the fire. ``We saw people running, flames coming from the attic
and people jumping out of the windows,'' said Ms. Simmons, 20, who
lives across the street and watched the blaze from her living room
window. ``No one really seemed to make it out the front door, they
got trapped inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the people seriously injured were in stable condition at
local hospitals following the 4:24 a.m. fire at 163-14 109th Ave.
in South Jamaica, fire officials said. Another resident, a woman
eight months pregnant, survived the fire by jumping two stories to
the sidewalk, and was treated for minor injuries, the officials
said. Three firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the victims were not released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were extinguished in about 40 minutes, according to
Amanda Schmidt, another Fire Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they were investigating whether the illegal
subdivisions of the house were contributing factors in the death of
a man who was found on the third floor. Gribbon said 15 people from
10 different families were living in the house. He said the Fire
Department had declared the house off limits because of the illegal
subdivisions and the inadequate escape routes for the number of
people living there.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings Department officials, who placed an ``unsafe building
notice'' on the residence, said they would visit what remained of
the structure to determine how many people were living there. Ted
Birkhahn, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said he could
find no past complaints about code violations at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending an inspector out tonight,'' Birkhahn said.
``You can't have nonfamily members living in the building, but a
family is allowed to have as many people as they want, unless it
poses an imminent danger.''
</P>
<P>
   But neighbors said they had complained to city officials about
the conditions at the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 25 more people living there,'' she Ms. Simmons'
mother, Florence. ``We couldn't sleep. They were showering with a
water hose in the back yard all night. There were gun shots. It was
horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had heard a woman who lived in the house threaten
to burn it down last week, but the authorities said they had no
information on suspects or a motive at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of illegal subdivisions has been a source of
friction in many Queens communities, as landlords find they can
profit by dividing up homes for rental by immigrants and others
eager for low-cost housing. But subdividing a house often can
overwhelm a home's electrical system or create other potential
safety problems, like inadequate fire exits.
</P>
<P>
   Birkhahn said that first-time violators of Building Department
regulations on occupancy and illegal subdivisions can face fines
from between $800 and $2,500 per violation. If the illegal
occupancy contributed to the death, city officials said that those
responsible could also face criminal charges.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his campaign promises, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has given New Yorkers strict law enforcement. Ordinary citizens get
ticketed for jaywalking. Taxi drivers and street vendors are under
close scrutiny from the New York City Police Department. Given such
enforcement policies, Giuliani and the police have been troublingly
quiet about the drunken brawl staged by New York City firefighters
last week at the Bryant Park Grill. The melee included between 50
and 100 uniformed firefighters who trashed the restaurant, harassed
patrons, exposed themselves and fought for five hours. Despite a
wealth of witnesses, the only person arrested was the restaurant's
bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani wants to keep his credibility, he needs to condemn
the rioters openly and make sure there is no double standard for
public-safety employees who brawl in public. Our bet is that if 50
to 100 plumbers, lawyers or schoolteachers tore up a restaurant,
they would be denounced in press conferences and arrested by the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder at the Bryant Park Grill followed a celebration in
which the mayor praised the firefighters for risking their lives
for their fellow citizens. The first accounts of the brawl
indicated that about 40 firefighters had drunk too much and gotten
rowdy in the restaurant. But a quick pass by city investigators
showed that the number of firefighters involved might actually have
approached 100 and that the situation was worse than initially
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani gives regular New Yorkers an earful when they
misbehave. But so far this year there has been no more flagrant
breach of his civility campaign. An official said Giuliani had kept
quiet out of respect for the family of another firefighter who died
in the line of duty two days after the brawl. That show of respect
is proper, but it cannot become an excuse for letting so many laws
be so flagrantly violated without a strong investigative and
prosecutorial response.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, law enforcement officials raised the troubling
possibility that none of the firefighters would be criminally
charged but would face departmental charges instead. Today the
Police Department was talking about pursuing the investigation
wherever it leads, and that sounds better. New Yorkers will be
understandably perplexed if there is a loophole in the mayor's
civility campaign big enough to drive a busload of brawling
firefighters through. &QL;

GIULIANI USES VETO POWER AGAINST COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taking direct aim at his adversaries in the city
budget battle, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani used his line-item veto power
for the first time Monday to eliminate nearly $5 million that the
City Council had allocated for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani vetoed the expenditure only hours after the Council
voted to use money from a property tax reserve fund to cover a $251
million gap in the budget the Council approved last week, in
defiance of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani denounced the vote as an effort to usurp his authority,
and then announced that he was vetoing 13 percent, $4.6 million, of
the Council's $35.2 million operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vallone, the Council speaker, described the mayor's
actions as mind-boggling and accused him of intentionally
underestimating the city's revenue for next year when its coffers
hold a record $2 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's actions by the Council and mayor were the latest
volleys in a battle that could heighten Tuesday or Wednesday when
the mayor is expected to veto up to $200 million more from the
Council's budget. The Council is expected to then override all the
vetoes.
 &UR;  &LR;  It is the first time that the mayor, a Republican, and the
Democratic-dominated Council have been unable to agree on an annual
budget since the city charter was revised in 1989. Almost everyone
agrees, though, that the disputes are destined for the courts, and
that they will drag on beyond the beginning of the new fiscal year
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The $251 million shortfall, which represents less than 1 percent
of the Council's $34.08 billion city budget, would have been easily
resolved in previous years by Giuliani and Vallone, who had
friendly relations until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deluge of tax and fiscal information nearly obscured
the political reasons behind the impasse: Giuliani's insistence
that Vallone drop his call for a referendum asking voters whether
city money should be used to help build a new stadium for the
Yankees, and Vallone's refusal to do so. Vallone is running for
governor, and his chances of defeating Gov. George Pataki in the
general election would be enhanced by a referendum on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone is expected to introduce a bill establishing the
referendum at a Council meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bender, the speaker's chief of staff, said the mayor was
retaliating for the Council's show of independence by cutting $4.6
million from its operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he realized that the Council couldn't be abolished,
and he can't take over the body with martial law,'' Bender said.
``So now he's trying to cut our budget.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after the Council passed its own budget, Giuliani
promptly said 1998-99 revenues would fall short of previous
estimates by $251 million. To balance the books, the Council would
have had to agree to the mayor's vetoes or raise the property tax,
the only tax it controls.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the Council voted to use $251 million of a reserve
fund that exists to cover property tax shortfalls. The mayor's
office had set the fund total at more than $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Outside fiscal experts said it was extremely difficult to
determine the level needed to offset delinquent taxes of the
reserve fund, because budget officials have arrived at different
figures, depending on the criteria they use.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Criscitello, director of the city's Independent Budget
Office, said his agency's calculations showed that the level would
be around $600 million.

EDITORIAL: A CRUCIAL PRIVILEGE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   Though the presidential inquiry by Kenneth Starr has yet to
produce many answers, his hunt for evidence has raised thorny legal
issues, among them the fight over attorney-client privilege heard
on Monday by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wants to see the notes taken by the personal lawyer for
Vincent Foster, the White House counsel who committed suicide,
during a meeting the two men had just nine days before Foster's
death. Starr is seeking to determine whether presidential aides
lied about any role Hillary Rodham Clinton might have had in the
dismissal of seven employees of the White House travel office. The
question confronting the justices is whether attorney-client
privilege survives a client's death.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-to-1 decision by a federal appeals court last summer carved
out an exception to lawyer-client privilege in criminal
investigations involving a dead witness. Taking a tack supported by
a number of legal scholars, the ruling said the privilege is not
absolute, and must be balanced against the needs of investigators
and the availability of the information in other places.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome failed to satisfy Starr, who takes the more extreme
view that the privilege should always die with the client. It also
provoked strong opposition from the organized bar as well as
hospice and psychiatric groups, which argued that watering down the
permanency of the attorney-client privilege beyond existing
exceptions, say for contested wills, would destroy the basic trust
the privilege is meant to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's questioning by the justices indicated concern about
chilling relations between lawyers and their clients. But several
justices were also properly skeptical about the idea that death
should rob investigators of evidence that they might have obtained
had the client been alive and able to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-client privilege should not be set aside lightly.
But in a narrow category of cases, especially where the information
is needed to establish guilt or innocence and prevent injustice,
there are more important values than protecting a dead person's
secrets. Carving a new rule that recognizes this without unduly
tampering with the lawyer-client relationship is now the court's
challenge. &QL;

 Grain elevator explosion kills two, injures others  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN PETTERSON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYSVILLE, Kan. _ An explosion tore through a south-central
Kansas grain elevator Monday, killing two persons and leaving four
others trapped in tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Eight persons were hospitalized after the blast at the DeBruce
Grain elevator, one of the largest in the world. The explosion
apparently occurred when a spark ignited grain dust suspended in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers worked cautiously to find a way to reach the four
workers trapped beneath tons of rubble that blocked entrances to
the tunnels. The four tunnels are 20-25 feet below ground level and
run from the center to the ends of the half-mile-long elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Structural engineers finally gave the OK late in the afternoon,
and rescue teams from Wichita, Sedgwick County and Oklahoma City
entered the tunnel with dogs to look for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   They found none of the missing, and parts of the tunnel were
blocked by debris and grain, they reported.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers were concentrating on an 800-foot section at the south
end of the elevator, said Curtis Wilson, Sedgwick County deputy
fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a rescue mode,'' Wilson said. ``Crews will be working
around the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday about 25 persons at a time were working in the
tunnel and grain bins, said Ken Cox, division chief for the
Sedgwick County Fire Department. Lights and generators were set up
inside. They were using Bobcats to remove debris. Some men were
using shovels.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people were working at the site, including 150
volunteers who joined rescue workers and firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's labor intensive,'' said Cox. ``It's hand-to-hand work.''
</P>
<P>
   The elevator's headhouse, a central structure that contains
machinery used to move grain from bin to bin, was badly damaged by
the blast and in danger of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That headhouse is moving six to eight feet in the wind,'' Cox
said. ``It has huge holes blown through its upper portion.''
</P>
<P>
   The ends of the elevator were blown out, and slabs of concrete
dangled from reinforcing bars. Chunks of the bin deck, which runs
along the top of the elevator and connects the separate bins, were
blown away.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter from Fort Riley plucked David Pickens from the top
of the south end of the elevator. A 150-foot crane was used to
remove several persons from the top of the elevator early in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse was the threat of severe weather in the
area around Haysville, just south of Wichita. Rain fell Monday
afternoon, and the area was under a tornado watch for a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather turns bad enough, we'll have to pull (rescue)
people out of the structure. This is going to be a long, drawn-out
operation,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that rescuers had heard a sound
like someone banging on pipes, a sign that someone could still be
alive in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is always critical,'' Cox said. ``We're hoping they are
in a space where they can breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   The elevator, which is in Sedgwick County between Wichita and
Haysville, is owned by DeBruce Grain, of North Kansas City. The
structure is 120 feet tall to the top of the bin deck and 214 feet
to the top of the headhouse. The grain elevator has a capacity of
24 million bushels.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce had no comment on the explosion Monday afternoon. Paul
DeBruce, the company's chief executive officer, was at the scene, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Black, a grain merchandiser for the company, said Monday
night that he had no knowledge of complaints against the company
concerning excessive grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four persons were at the elevator when the explosion
occurred about 9:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one individual who said he saw a red ball of fire come
out of the north end of the bin deck,'' said Tom Marple, area
director for Kansas for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grain dust suspended in proper proportions in the air can be
as explosive as dynamite,'' Marple said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Yorgensen, principal of Oatville Elementary School, about a
mile from the elevator, was at the school at the time. ``It really
rattled the windows and shook the whole building,'' Yorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said it appeared that the explosion started at the north
end of the structure and that explosions traveled along the bin
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said that was typical of grain dust explosions, as one
blast kicks up dust, which in turn ignites.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead was found outside the elevator, and the other
was found in the headhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen survivors were removed after the blast, including eight
sent to area hospitals. Five of the hospitalized workers were in
serious condition with burns.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' families gathered at the Oatville school, where
they received hourly briefings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are distraught. These people are in shock,'' said
Mark Schroeder, chairman of the Sedgwick County Commission. ``The
families were very quiet _ some of them visibly shaken, crying.''
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter from Fort Riley circled the structure Monday,
seeking survivors with the help of infrared sensing equipment
borrowed from the Vulcan Chemical Co. plant nearby.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen agencies were on hand, including firefighters;
police officers; agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms; and the state fire marshal's office. The Oklahoma City
Fire Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency office
in Lincoln, Neb., sent rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
   Marple said the explosion was the worst he had seen in his three
years in Kansas. He said there were 16 explosions blamed on grain
dust in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most significant damage was at the ends of the
elevator. ``That's typical of a grain-dust type of explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inspectors get inside, they will look for potential sources
of ignition, such as improper electrical equipment, sparks caused
by metal striking metal, welding, static electricity, and even heat
from a slipping conveyor built.

GRAIN ELEVATOR THAT EXPLODED HAD BEEN CITED FOR DUST PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The grain elevator near Wichita that exploded
Monday had been cited at least twice in the last 19 months by
federal warehouse inspectors for excessive grain-dust conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the company in both cases pledged to take
satisfactory action to clean up the dust, which can be a flammable
and deadly hazard.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce Grain Inc. officials in Kansas City referred all
questions to company executives who traveled Monday to Wichita.
Company phones in Wichita were not answered late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from another federal agency said Monday that since
1977 at least three other persons had died in industrial accidents
inside the huge grain-storage facility _ one the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey Grain Inc. sold the 24-million-bushel-capacity elevator
complex to North Kansas City-based DeBruce in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of that sale, Ned Bergman, chief of the
examination branch of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Kansas City
Commodity Office, said his inspectors cited the elevator for
excessive dust problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman said a follow-up inspection and the company's responses
resulted in a satisfactory finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was improvement in housekeeping and operational items,''
he said, and indications ``that management was paying closer
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In August of last year, however, agency inspectors again cited
the Wichita elevator for excessive dust, Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said DeBruce officials responded in September that they were
taking added steps, including daily inspections by management
representatives, to control the problem, Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no follow-up inspections since then, Bergman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grain dust, Bergman said, is an unavoidable problem throughout
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the resources and the manpower on hand to
clean (dust) up on a regular basis,'' Bergman said. ``Explosions in
grain elevators are typically caused by excessive grain dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Commodity Office licenses and regulates about
2,600 U.S. grain elevators under the federal Public Warehouse Act.
</P>
<P>
   The agency does not issue fines for violations, Bergman said.
Persistent cases of negligence or abuse can lead to suspension of
an elevator's federal warehouse license.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, officials in the Kansas City regional office of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it investigated
a fatal asphyxiation at the Wichita grain elevator in 1983 and a
double fatality there in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Details of those earlier accidents, and whether any fines were
levied, were unavailable Monday, said Pat Hand, agency spokesman.
Garvey Grain owned the elevators at the time of those two cases.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is filled this week with world leaders attending a
well-intentioned but misdirected U.N. conference on drugs. With
drugs more plentiful and cheaper than ever worldwide, the leaders
are mostly extolling failed strategies to combat the problem. Pino
Arlacchi, the Italian official who heads the organization's
International Drug Control Program, is promising to eliminate coca
leaf and opium poppies, the basis of cocaine and heroin, in 10
years. Such claims get in the way of effective programs to reduce
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi's proposal, which is likely to be approved, would
attempt to cut drug cultivation by bringing roads, schools and
other development to drug areas. The notion sounds reasonable, and
it is surely better to help farmers than to finance a militarized
war on drugs, which has torn apart societies and built up some of
the world's most repressive armies. But elements of Arlacchi's plan
are unrealistic and harmful. Half the funding would supposedly come
from drug-producing nations themselves, an unlikely prospect.
Arlacchi would also make partners out of such abusive and
unreliable governments as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the
military in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a place for crop substitution, law enforcement,
interdiction and other programs to cut drug supply, these steps
rarely deliver promised results. Where crop substitution has been
successful, drug cultivation has simply moved next door.
</P>
<P>
   The conference has seen a welcome increase in talk about the
duties of drug-consuming countries, but its proposals are still
tilted toward attacking supply. Studies show that treatment
programs are far more cost-effective than efforts overseas. But it
is politically safer to advocate fighting drugs abroad than
treating addicts at home.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations kept off the program virtually all the
citizens' groups and experts who wanted to speak. There is no
discussion of some interesting new ideas such as harm reduction,
which focuses on programs like needle exchanges and methadone that
cut the damage drugs do. Like previous U.N. drug conferences, this
one seems designed primarily to recycle unrealistic pledges and
celebrate dubious programs.  &QL;

WNBA PRIMED FOR MORE SUCCESSIN SECOND YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ WNBA president Val Ackerman, apparently tired of
those who continue to doubt the viability of her league, pointed to
an interesting statistic.
</P>
<P>
   It took the league's big brother, the NBA, 29 seasons to average
10,000 fans per game. The WNBA averaged 9,663 its first season and
officials will be surprised if it doesn't reach five figures when
the second season begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the women's league is riding piggyback on the wealthy NBA,
which has invested millions in its counterpart. And, yes, the WNBA
_ as well as the rival ABL _ have had the novelty factor working in
its favor. But the numbers, including healthy television ratings,
don't lie: After several failed attempts, women's professional
basketball doesn't appear to be going away soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would've said 20 years ago that there'd be a day when
we'd have two women's pro basketball leagues, one with a regular
network game of the week in its first year, nobody would've
believed you,'' said Ed Markey, vice president of sports
presentations for NBC. ``The sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls' and women's sports have grown dramatically since Title
IX, the gender-equity law enacted in 1971. Specifically, basketball
has become the No.1 participation sport for girls, and attendance
at women's college basketball games has quadrupled in the last 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   That swelling talent pool and increasing interest, punctuated by
the gold-medal success of the 1996 Olympic women's basketball team,
provided a solid foundation on which the WNBA and ABL were built
and failed leagues lacked. Hence the early success.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, a creation of the NBA, has long-term contracts with
three television networks (NBC, ESPN and Lifetime) and an
impressive and growing list of major sponsors. The ABL has TV
contracts with Fox Sports Net and Black Entertainment Television
and is negotiating with several networks that league officials hope
will provide wide exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings are good. An average of almost 2 million
viewers watched 11 WNBA games (10 regular season and the
championship game) on NBC last season. In contrast, the NBA
averaged roughly 4.7 million for regular-season games this year and
expects up to about 16 million for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Markey said he had no idea what to expect because so much was
unprecedented: the league, summer basketball, the question marks
that surrounded the public's opinion of women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   No one is complaining about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully it will grow, but it's a very good start,'' Markey
said. ``... We've made a long-term commitment. The ratings the next
one, two, three years are not the important thing. NBC and the NBA
is trying to grow the league. You have to take small steps in the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, there is the live attendance. The WNBA attracted twice
the number of fans it expected and its average attendance was
double of that of the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   With limited marketing and competition from the NFL, NBA and
NHL, the ABL drew an average of 3,536 its fist year and 4,333 its
second, an increase of 23 percent. The ABL's Long Beach Stingrays
averaged 2,366 this past season, its first in the league, the team
said. (The WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks averaged 8,931 fans last
year.)
</P>
<P>
   The top players _ mostly from the WNBA _ are ubiquitous. Players
like the WNBA's Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie and Cheryl Swoopes are on
television commercials and in print ads. All sure signs women's
basketball is gaining the ability to reach its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the fans?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they're not the traditional sports devotees who are
committed to the NFL, Major League Baseball and NBA. The WNBA
estimates that 67 percent of those who attended games last season
were female (compared to 37 percent for NBA games, Ackerman said).
</P>
<P>
   New fans mean new consumers and that's attractive to sponsors,
according to Sharon Barbano, president of the Women's Sports
Marketing Group. Barbano said women make roughly 80 percent of
household purchases _ including sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just adults who are being reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA brand is going to continue to develop,'' Barbano
said. ``For heaven's sake, Mattel has a WNBA Barbie. Talk about
starting brand loyalty early.
</P>
<P>
   ``When little girls think basketball, they're automatically
going to think WNBA because of that Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL doesn't have such an advantage, which raises the
inevitable question: Is there room for two women's leagues in the
market?
</P>
<P>
   The backing of the NBA is an advantage for the WNBA, which has
10 teams (eight last season) only in NBA cities. Television and
sponsors are more willing to link themselves to a proven product.
The NBA knows how to run a basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   A reported $15 million was spent to market the WNBA in its first
season (the ABL spent $1.5 million its first year, $3 million the
second) and backers continue to pump millions into it. Again, the
result is the face of a WNBA player everywhere you look, including
the invaluable promos during NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   Also, television and sponsors are more willing to link
themselves to a proven product. Last August, Newsweek magazine
quoted an unidentified source as saying the company nudges players
to the WNBA because ``the ABL just doesn't have the type of
exposure that sells products.''
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, people think of the WNBA when they think of
women's professional basketball. That doesn't escape ABL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, you have to envy that,'' said Tonya Edwards of
the ABL's Columbus Quest. ``Everybody loves to be in the spotlight.
Wherever you go, everyone recognizes them.''
</P>
<P>
   The future for both leagues is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   They continue to lose substantial sums of money, typical of
young enterprises but something that must ultimately shift. They
must capture the attention of the male fan if they hope to grow
substantially. And they must keep the attention of those already
committed to their product _ sponsors, television networks,
consumers and, most important, fans.
</P>
<P>
   One day they will have to deal with the issue of merger, which
some believe is a strong possibility, although officials in both
leagues don't see it happening soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they have many other things on which to focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep this in perspective,'' Ackerman said. ``We've
said from the beginning this is going to be a long process. It will
take time to establish a league in a way that gives it the greatest
chance to survive. That's the challenge of women's basketball.''

MAYOR WANTS TO PRIVATIZE PUPIL REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an ambitious effort to revamp one of the costliest
items in the city school budget, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani intends to
call on the Board of Education Tuesday to privatize the job of
evaluating children who are referred by their teachers to special
education, Board officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, children referred by classroom teachers are screened
by a team composed of a psychologist, a social worker and a teacher
trained in special education evaluation at each school. That system
has long been assailed as being inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   And the school-based evaluators have been criticized for
rubber-stamping the teachers' referrals _ a disproportionate number
of whom are black and Hispanic boys with behavioral problems rather
than serious physical or mental disabilities _ and consigning them
to self-contained special education classes.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday what kinds of savings the city expects
to reap from the privatization plan, or what the school-based
evaluation team would do if private psychologists were to take over
the screening of students. Monday night, both the mayor's
spokeswoman, Colleen Roche, and the chancellor's spokeswoman,
Chiara Coletti, declined comment, saying details would be disclosed
at a City Hall news conference Tuesday by a task force that
Giuliani set up last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan is likely to face stiff opposition from the United
Federation of Teachers, which represents nearly 3,500 school
psychologists, social workers and educational evaluators. Union
officials say the school-based team ought to remain independent
from administrators at the school and district levels.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would not be the school system's first foray into
privatization; in recent years, some janitorial services have been
put in private hands. But the task force plan would mark the first
time the system has contracted for direct services to students.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city's special education population has ballooned since
Congress passed a law in 1975 guaranteeing equal education for the
disabled. The majority of the roughly 140,000 children in the
city's special education program are not blind, deaf or suffering
from chronic illnesses like cerebral palsy. Instead, they are
classified as either learning disabled or emotionally disturbed _
evaluations that can be based on varying perceptions of teachers
and evaluators.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of New York's current $2 billion special education
program say it is driven by a financial incentive system that
rewards the city for each additional child it places in special
education. Each referral into special education reduces class size,
offers a swift solution to classroom disciplinary problems and
improves a school's cumulative scores on standardized tests because
many special education children are exempt from the examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the civil rights arm of the U.S. Department of
Education warned New York City school officials to correct the
overrepresentation of black and Hispanic children in special
education classes or risk losing million of dollars in federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the department directed state officials to
change the formula, and threatened New York with the loss of $300
million in aid. Several bills are pending in both houses of the
Legislature in Albany that would do that.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's task force is also expected to call for an expansion
of services for children in mainstream classrooms, from speech
therapy to counseling sessions, so that students who are at risk
can be helped in general education classes rather than having to be
sequestered in special education classes.

WELFARE MOTHERS DEEMED UNABLE TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After evaluating hundreds of disabled welfare mothers
for a new city workfare program, officials at four nonprofit
agencies said Monday that most of the women could not work because
they were too ill, had to care for disabled children or lacked
enough interest in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 410 mothers screened on Saturday, only 36 percent will be
considered for the work program, the officials said. The agencies
will continue to interview disabled women over the coming months
for the program, which is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's newest welfare
initiative. But while the officials stressed the importance of the
project to the mothers who will participate, they now have doubts
about how many will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are going to be as many people
participating as we had thought,'' said Linda Turner, director of
rehabilitation services at Goodwill Industries of Greater New York.
``There's a significant percentage of these folks that are quite
seriously disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary reports from the agency officials came Monday as
city officials and advocates for the poor fiercely debated the
value of the new program, which will require disabled welfare
mothers to work in jobs tailored to their specific impairments.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy began this weekend when city officials ordered
about 800 women to report to welfare offices for screening into the
new 20-hour a week workfare program. It was unclear Monday night
why only half of that group actually showed up for interviews, but
state officials, who helped finance the project, said as many as
12,000 mothers may ultimately participate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, disabled mothers were exempt from workfare
requirements unless a city doctor certified that they could work.
City officials contended that, as a result, those women were denied
desperately needed job training, work experience and career
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the poor say the new system endangers welfare
mothers who have already been classified by city doctors as
permanently or temporarily unemployable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the four nonprofit agencies conducting the
screening said they found some women eager to work and some who
appeared to be too severely disabled to participate. The agencies
are Goodwill Industries, the Federation Employment and Guidance
Service, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service and the National
Society for Disability Services.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation agency found 116 mothers who will likely
participate in the new program. Most suffered from mental illness,
asthma and chronic back pain. They were given an appointment for a
more complete evaluation, which will be reviewed by the state
Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals With
Disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those women will ultimately work 20 hours a week for three
months, and 35 hours a week after that, while receiving career
counseling, job search training and other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our experience, a lot of them don't think they're up to
working, but they welcome the opportunity,'' said Al Miller, chief
operating officer of the Federation agency.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, officials at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community
Service found only three employable mothers in a pool of 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty seriously disabled, and work may not be
appropriate for them,'' said Norma Martin, assistant executive
director of the Brooklyn bureau. ``We're not here to try to force
people who are severely disabled to work if they can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the Human Resources
Administration, which runs the city's welfare programs, said she
could not comment on the private agencies' findings without
reviewing them first. She could not say what would happen to those
disabled mothers who did not enter the workfare program.
